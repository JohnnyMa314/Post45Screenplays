                The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman

                         by Matt Drake

                                             June 4, 2007
           We left the bridge and traveled on in the starstudded night 
           toward the world where no one was waiting for us.

                                 - Márai Sándor, Famous 
                                 Hungarian Writer Who Wrote

                                 is Hungaria Anyway?
           A YOUNG MAN’S FACE 

           Fills the screen.  He’s in his 20s, and he’d probably be 
           handsome if his whole head wasn’t SWOLLEN and GROSS and 
           BLOODIED like it currently is.  He is CHARLIE COUNTRYMAN.  

           A familiar VOICE sets the scene:

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        Ah.  Here we are seeing it, 
                        dahlinge.  The very face of love.  
                        Look upon the miracle it reveals, 
                        for this boy, on this night, under 
                        the moon so full.  

           Tears fall from his eyes, but weirdly -- they FALL UPWARD.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        He weeps.  For her, and for us, and 
                        for the moonlight too, this boy 
                        does weep.

           We PULL BACK and FLIP OVER, to find that Charlie is DANGLING 
           from a BRIDGE, HANGING UPSIDE-DOWN over a moonlit RIVER.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        Funny, how love is.

           Charlie squirms.  He’s being held by two TRACKSUITED 
           GANGSTERS.  Another TRACKSUIT stands at the rail, grinning.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        In every heart there is a dream, in 
                        every dream a song, and in every 
                        song there is a name.

                                 CHARLIE
                        GABI!!

           Tracksuits laugh, and yank him up to the rail.  A YOUNG WOMAN 
           steps out.  She’s pretty.  The kind of pretty that starts wars 
           and makes your stomach ache.  This is GABI.  Charlie is 
           confused, seeing her here.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Gabi?  What...what are you...

           Gabi smiles.  Oh my god.  She’s pretty.  

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        Behold her, dahlinge -- the 
                        beloved.  Hers is the name in the 
                        song of the dream, which echoes in 
                        the space of his heart.
           At Gabi’s side, there’s a MAN with a FACE LIKE A KNIFE.

                                 KNIFE FACE
                        Take heart, Charlie.  We’ll see she 
                        gets the proper care and feeding.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        FUCK YOU!!  FUCKING FUCKASS 
                        FUCKFACE!!

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        Love is passion!

           Knife Face laughs.  Charlie looks into Gabi’s eyes, pleading.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why, Gabi?

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        Love is mystery! 

           Gabi’s got a GUN.  She looks to Knife Face.  He nods.  Gabi 
           swallows.  BLAM!  She shoots Charlie in the gut.  

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        And pain.  Above all things, love is 
                        pain. 

           Charlie SCREAMS.  Charlie BLEEDS.  Gabi leans in and WHISPERS 
           in his ear.  His eyes light up.  And he smiles.

           Gabi steps away.  Knife Face nods to the Tracksuits.  They 
           let go.  And Charlie falls.  Endlessly and headlong, for the 
           gray waters of the river flowing below. 

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        It’s the same old story.  Of love 
                        and the promise it holds.  Of life 
                        and of living it in love.  And 
                        perhaps of a little bit of death.  
                        Yes.  Just a splash of death...

           As Charlie’s head crashes through the surface we FREEZE FRAME.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        ...you know, to make us truly 
                        believe.  In love.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN CHICAGO - DAY

           TITLE: A FEW WEEKS EARLIER
           Michigan Avenue bridge.  We find CHARLIE mid-span, staring 
           into the paddy-green river.  And yes, he is handsome.  Maybe 
           not remarkably so, but still.

           A SOLID MAN in his early 50s comes up and hands Charlie a HOT 
           DOG.  They eat.  The solid man begins to cry.  He is SCOTT 
           BAKER, Charlie’s step-dad.  He wipes his eyes.

                                 SCOTT
                        This a day or what?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah.  

           They eat.  Scott’s trying to be solid, to keep it together.  
           But how?  He pulls out a PINT and takes a swig.

                                 SCOTT
                        Sambuca?

           Charlie takes a long pull from the bottle.

                                 SCOTT (cont’d)
                        Can I say something to you, 
                        Charlie?  In this moment, before it 
                        all goes to shit?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay.

                                 SCOTT
                        She’s my only home.  

           Charlie is felled by this.  

                                 SCOTT (cont’d)
                        You know?

           Out of a long silence:

                                 CHARLIE
                        We don’t have to do it, Scott.  
                        Maybe wait a few more days.

                                 SCOTT
                        Nah.  It’s time.

           Charlie nods.  They head off.  

                                 SCOTT (cont’d)
                        Gimme the ‘buca.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Beeps, monitors, wires, and a COMATOSE WOMAN whose face is 
           all but lost in swelling.  Her head is shaved and scarred, 
           her mouth crammed with tubes.  She is MARY, Charlie’s mom.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        It is here, ladies and gentlemen, 
                        that the story begins for the boy.  
                        And like all stories worth the 
                        telling, it starts with goodbye.  

           Scott talks to a DOCTOR as Charlie sits in the corner.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Okay.  Then we what?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Once in hospice, we turn off the 
                        respirator, switching to a manual 
                        breathing apparatus, which enables 
                        us to gradually, um, ease her out.

                                 SCOTT
                        Out where?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well.  Out.  There.  Away.  

                                 SCOTT
                        I see.  Out there away.  Good.  I 
                        feel good about that.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mr. Baker, I honestly believe 
                        you’re doing the right thing here.

                                 SCOTT
                        In letting you suffocate my wife.  

                                 DOCTOR
                        The, um, procedure is facilitated 
                        by a hospice careworker.  Not me.

           Scott just stares at him.  Charlie takes a drink of Sambuca.

                                 DOCTOR (cont’d)
                        Well.  The hospice is on seven.  
                        Shall I call a priest?  A rabbi 
                        maybe?  Would your wife have--

                                 SCOTT
                        Please.  You’ve done enough.  Go 
                        fuck yourself.
           The Doctor bows out.  Scott winces, grabbing his back.  He 
           shakes a BIG PILL out of a prescription bottle.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let me get one of those.

                                 SCOTT
                        They’re for my back.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay.  My back is killing me.

           Scott gives him a pill.  Charlie pops it.  

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Still hurts.

           Scott gives him another pill.  Charlie pops it.

           INT. HOSPICE ROOM - DAY

           Drawn curtains, muted tones, candlelight.  Chinese-ish muzak 
           twinkling appropriately.  FAMILY MEMBERS are gathered.  A 
           NURSE stands over Mary, pumping breath into her lungs from a 
           HAND-HELD APPARATUS.  Scott stands by Mary’s side.

           Charlie is FLOATING UP ON THE CEILING.  He calls down.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Psst.  Scott.  What the fuck?

                                 SCOTT
                        This is what happens.  You ready?

           Charlie looks to Mary.  The nurse squeezes the apparatus, and 
           it becomes FILLED WITH CRYSTALS OF LIGHT from Mary’s mouth.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What’s that stuff?

                                 SCOTT 
                        Whatever you see, Charlie, it’s the 
                        pills.  Are you ready?

           Some of the LIGHT ESCAPES.  Charlie reaches for it as it 
           fades.  THUD!  He falls heavily to the floor.  He gets up.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        May I be excused, Scott?

                                 SCOTT
                        We’re not eating broccoli here, 
                        Charlie.  Jesus Christ.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s okay.  You guys go ahead.  

           Scott stares at Charlie, giving him every chance.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) 
                        Here is what makes a life, dahlinge 
                        -- such moments, and the choices we 
                        make within them. 

           Charlie’s eyes flash pure helplessness.  

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        It is how we become who we are 
                        meant to become in the world.  We 
                        choose.

           Charlie leaves the room.  

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        Or not. 

           OUT IN THE HALLWAY

           Charlie sinks into a CHAIR.  

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        Who do we become if we do not do 
                        choose, if we do not do the thing 
                        that life itself is made of?

           PEOPLE pass by Charlie.  THEY HAVE NO FACES.  Like in that 
           Star Trek episode.  Charlie feels his face.  IT IS GONE.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        We become no one, dahlinge.

           Charlie looks down at his stomach.  IT IS GONE, REPLACED BY 
           AN INFINITE VIEW INTO DEEPEST SPACE.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        And we are nothing.

           THEN

           A WOMAN we don’t fully see takes a seat next to Charlie.  

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Took a powder, eh, Charlie?  

           It’s MARY BAKER.  She’s her normal self.  A lovely woman in 
           her 50s who should have a long time yet to live.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Sorry about that, Mom.

                                 MARY BAKER
                        I should’ve made you do your 
                        homework, Charlie.  I always knew.

                                 CHARLIE
                        My homework?

                                 MARY BAKER
                        I left too much up to you.  When 
                        you were young.  Now you’ve got so 
                        much fear, Charlie.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?  No.  I’m okay.

                                 MARY BAKER
                        You just ran out of my death scene.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I said I’m sorry.

                                 MARY BAKER
                        I was always wrapped-up in my own 
                        crap.   Meeting Greg, and leaving 
                        your Dad.  Then meeting Scott and 
                        leaving Greg.  I could never get 
                        the sequences right.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You were a complicated lady.

                                 MARY BAKER 
                        I didn’t mean to be, Charlie.  And 
                        now you’re such a mess.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        This is good, you coming back from 
                        the dead, us having this talk.

                                 MARY BAKER 
                        And p.s.?  You’re too sarcastic.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        What do I do?  If I’m such a mess.

                                 MARY BAKER
                        Change.  I don’t know.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Change how?
                                 MARY BAKER
                        I don’t know.  For the better.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Tell me what to do, Mom.  Please.

           Mary Baker thinks.  And thinks.  Then decides.

                                 MARY BAKER
                        Got it.  Go to Bucharest.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Bucharest?

                                 MARY BAKER
                        Yes. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why?

                                 MARY BAKER
                        I don’t know.  It came to me.  I 
                        have to go now, Charlie.  

           The ELEVATOR DINGS.  And the door opens.  A nice-looking 
           WOMAN is inside.  

                                 NICE-LOOKING WOMAN
                        Going up?

                                 MARY BAKER
                        I should frigging hope so!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mom, wait.  

                                 MARY BAKER 
                        Yes, Charlie. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I need another memory.  The one 
                        I’ve got...it’s not right.

                                 MARY BAKER
                        What do you mean?

                                 CHARLIE
                        The thing I’m going to remember, 
                        it’s...I don’t want it to be it.

                                            FLASH TO:
           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Scott is dragging Mary’s body to his truck.  Charlie follows 
           with a cell phone, making the call.  Mary’s sweatpants fall 
           down around her ass.  It’s not a pretty sight.  

           BACK TO SCENE

           Mary laughs.  It’s a big and affecting laugh.

                                 MARY BAKER
                        Oh, Charlie.  You goof.  Come here.  

           He leans into her.  She kisses his forehead.  

                                            FLASH TO:

           EXT. RIVER PARK - DAY

           Charlie is seven.  He and Younger Mary are at a picnic beside 
           a river, giddily BURNING AN ANT with a magnifying glass.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 MARY BAKER 
                        Better?
                    (Charlie smiles)
                        Okay, then.  I love you, Charlie.  
                        Have fun in Bucharest.

           Mary Baker gets in the elevator and the doors close.

           INT. BORDERS BOOKSTORE -  NIGHT

           Charlie is at the help desk.  A SUICIDE GIRL is helping him.

                                 SUICIDE GIRL
                        Dude, Bucharest?  No, we don’t have 
                        any books on Bucharest.  You know 
                        why?  Because no one from there can 
                        read or write is why.  All they can 
                        do is have sex with child 
                        prostitutes and get AIDS.  Oh wait.  
                        They can also harvest organs like 
                        nobody’s business.  It’s world 
                        capital of that shit.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Don’t they have the gymnasts?  
                        Nadia what’s-her-face and all?

                                 SUICIDE GIRL
                        You’d be a good gymnast too if you 
                        weren’t allowed to menstruate.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SUICIDE GIRL (cont'd)
                    (then)
                        You should go to Budapest.  It’s 
                        super pretty and they shoot all the 
                        pornos there.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Is there someone else on duty?  I’d 
                        like less dumb-ass information.

                                 SUICIDE GIRL 
                        A sweet-faced boy like you going to 
                        Bucharest makes no sense at all.  
                    (then)
                        Dude, did you not just hear me fully 
                        hit on you like I was Lindsay Lohan 
                        or something?  Where’s your head at?  
                        I’m off at 11:30.  Bring a bottle.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           The radio clock reads 11:47.  We see a half drunk BOTTLE OF 
           TEQUILA on the driver’s seat.  We go WIDER to find Suicide 
           Girl fucking the shit out of Charlie in the passenger seat.  
           A TEAR falls from Charlie’s eye.  She doesn’t notice.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

           Charlie stands on a Chicago-style back porch.  He is DRUNK.  
           He reaches into an old winter boot and pulls out a KEY. 

           INSIDE

           Charlie enters a bedroom.  A GIRL is asleep.  This is 
           MELISSA, Charlie’s ex.  He watches her until he hears a FART.  
           Charlie laughs.  Melissa wakes up and sees him.

                                 MELISSA
                        Charles!  What the fuck?

                                 CHARLIE
                        You farted.  

           A RUSTLING in the far side of the bed.  There’s a GUY there. 
           ANOTHER FART sounds.  Charlie doesn’t laugh.  He goes.

           IN THE KITCHEN

           Charlie is leaving.  Melissa comes after him.  He PUKES in 
           the sink.

                                 MELISSA 
                        We are not together, Charles.  Why 
                        are you vomiting in my sink?   
                                 CHARLIE
                        I like the symbolism.  Who’s that?

                                 MELISSA
                        No one you know.  Go home.

                                 CHARLIE 
                    (a half-assed stab)
                        You’re my only home.

                                 MELISSA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Forget it.

           Charlie turns on the faucet and runs the GARBAGE DISPOSAL. 

                                 MELISSA 
                        I’m sorry about Mary, Charles.  I 
                        heard but I didn’t know what--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t say Charles.  I’m Charlie.

                                 MELISSA
                        Please.  You love that I call you 
                        Charles.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No more.  I hate you.  My name is 
                        Charlie.  

           A NAKED GUY enters.  He’s Ted.

                                 TED
                        Melissa?  Everything cool?

                                 MELISSA
                        Fine.  Just give us a minute.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Try to hold it in if you can.  
                        Maybe scrunch up your butt cheeks.

                                 TED
                        Who’s he?

                                 MELISSA
                        Go to bed, Ted.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, Ted.  Don’t go to bed.  Forget 
                        what she said.  Stay here instead.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (cont'd)
                        Ted.  Please.  Do not go to bed.  
                        Not back where you far...Ted. 

           Melissa tries to keep a straight face.

                                 TED
                        What the fuck is he--

                                 MELISSA
                        You farted.  Okay, Ted?  Who gives 
                        a shit.  Give us a minute.

           Ted blushes.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Ted’s turning red.

                                 TED
                        Hey, bro!  Enough!  

           Melissa turns Ted toward the bedroom.  She whispers in his 
           ear.  Ted glares at Charlie, and goes.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What’s Ted got against Dr. Suess?  

                                 MELISSA
                        Fuck you.  Coming here being funny.  
                        You’re not funny, Charles.  Go home.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m moving to Bucharest.

                                 MELISSA
                        Romania?  With the AIDS and the 
                        organ harvesting?

                                 CHARLIE
                        And the prostituting of children, 
                        yes.  It’s the place for me.

                                 MELISSA
                        What about Budapest?  It’s supposed 
                        to be very cool.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Bucharest.  Not Budapest.

                                 MELISSA
                        You should go away.  Wherever it 
                        is, I think it’s a good idea. 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        You do?  
                                 MELISSA
                        You hate your job, you’ve got no 
                        real friends.  All you do is sit in 
                        your apartment and do nothing.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        You call it nothing, I call it 
                        masturbation.

                                 MELISSA
                        Change would do you good.  You can 
                        jerk off anywhere.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t mind if I do.

                                 MELISSA
                        Let me ask you something before you 
                        fuck off to Bucharest, Charles.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Charlie.

                                 MELISSA
                        Did it ever occur to you that the 
                        only reason we fell in love is 
                        because I fell in love with you?

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Are you underlining pronouns with 
                        your voice? 

                                 MELISSA
                        Go away, Charlie.  Fucking do 
                        something for once.  Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Take it worldwide.  Like Godzilla.  
                        I see.  Huh.  Okay.  Well, Melissa.  
                        I had a nice time being your 
                        boyfriend for a while even though 
                        all we did was fight and you made 
                        me cry when it was over.  

           He offers his hand to shake.  She hugs him.  He pulls back.

                        BTW?  I myself had sex tonight.  Not 
                        by myself.  It was me, along with 
                        another individual.  A girl.  FYI. 

                                 MELISSA
                        Take care of yourself, Charles.

           INT. CORPORATE LIMBO SPACE - INFINITE

           Charlie walks down a hallway.  He wears a suit.  He reaches 
           an office, knocks.  A woman, JAN, is inside.  She’s happy.

                                 JAN
                        Charlie, you so totally nailed the 
                        Save Secure Backup section.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Thanks, Jan. 

                                 JAN
                        You’re the Tiger Woods of tech 
                        writers, babe.  Never cease to amaze. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ve got to quit today, Jan.  

                                 JAN
                        Pardon?

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is my last day.  Save Secure 
                        Backup is my crowning achievement.

                                 JAN
                        Whoa.  I told you you came back 
                        from bereavement too soon.  Take 
                        the week.  Don’t do anything rash.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m moving to Bucharest.

                                 JAN
                        That’s rash, Charlie.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Still, Jan.  It’s something I’ve 
                        got to do.  
                                 JAN
                        Just who is going to write the User 
                        Guide for the Paperless Fax Sys?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Maybe the paperless Fax Sys doesn’t 
                        need a User Guide, Jan.  Being 
                        paperless and all.

                                 JAN
                        Don’t talk crazy, Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay.  So.  Sorry about the notice.

                                 JAN 
                        You break my heart, Charlie.  You 
                        son of a bitch.

           INT. O’HARE AIRPORT - BAR - EVENING

           Charlie and Scott are bellied up.  Charlie thumbs through the 
           ROUGH GUIDE TO ROMANIA.  Scott lifts a shot of Sambuca.

                                 SCOTT
                        To Bucharest.  Wherever the hell.

           They drink.  Charlie looks a little piqued.

                                 SCOTT (cont’d)
                        Nervous?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nah.  Yeah.  

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m proud of you, Charlie.  It’s 
                        not an easy thing you’re doing.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay.

                                 SCOTT
                        I want to say something, Charlie.  
                        Finally.  Okay?  
                    (Charlie nods)
                        We did the right thing.  I know it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah.  I guess.  

                                 SCOTT
                        You kill what you love if that’s 
                        what it needs to be set free.  
           AT A GATE

           Scott gathers Charlie in a hug.  Scott cries.  Charlie goes.

           INT. AIRPLANE - EVENING

           Charlie stares out the window.  

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        Look how sad, dahlinge.  The poor 
                        soul.  We want so badly to believe 
                        he does the right thing for 
                        himself.  But how can we, when we 
                        know how it ends for him?  I will 
                        tell you how -- because of love.  
                        We may comfort ourselves knowing 
                        that love awaits him.

           An OLD MAN’S HEAD lolls over onto Charlie’s shoulder.  He 
           tries to push the man back, but he wakes.  His name is 
           ISTVAN.  He’s got high gray hair and the bluest eyes.

                                 ISTVAN
                    (thick Hungarian accent)
                        What do you mean with touching me?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Your head fell on me.

                                 ISTVAN
                        I see.  Never mind.  What is wrong 
                        on your face?  

           Istvan touches Charlie’s face.  

                                 ISTVAN (cont’d)
                        The eyes.  Here.  You look bad.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        My mom died.  

                                 ISTVAN
                        Fooey.  I am sorry for you.  My 
                        wife died many years time ago.  I 
                        have never had another woman since.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, hopefully it won’t be the 
                        same for me.  But I see your point.

                                 ISTVAN 
                        I am Istvan Banyai.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        Charlie Countryman.

                                 ISTVAN
                        Why going to Budapest, Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m going to Bucharest.

                                 ISTVAN
                        The airplane goes to Bucharest?  Ur 
                        Isten!  I don’t go to Bucharest!

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s okay.  We’re going to Budapest.  
                        I take another flight to Bucharest.

                                 ISTVAN
                        I see.  Good.  I am in Bucharest 
                        one time.  Never again.  Fooey. 

           Charlie takes out a BOOK.  

                                 ISTVAN (cont’d)
                        I see.  You do not like to speak 
                        with me.  No trouble for me.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s not that.  I just--

                                 ISTVAN
                        What is wrong with you?  Should you 
                        not want to know what I am doing in 
                        Chicago?  Why an old Magyar man is 
                        going to there?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Maud-yar?

                                 ISTVAN
                        Hungarian.  Magyar is Hungarian 
                        word for Hungarian.  See, you can 
                        learn something by talking.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What were you doing in Chicago, 
                        Istvan?  I’m curious.

           Istvan pulls a CUBS HAT from his bag.  He sets it atop his 
           high gray hair.

                                 ISTVAN
                        I’m going to see the Cubbies at 
                        Wrigley’s Field.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ISTVAN (cont'd)
                        I say to my daughter, I want to 
                        sing Take Me Out To The Ballgame 
                        one time before I die.  So she send 
                        me to Chicago to visit a game with 
                        the Cubbies...

           Istvan’s blue eyes brighten and his face beams.

                                            FLASH TO:

           WRIGLEY FIELD

           Istvan in the bleachers, holding a beer.  Weeping happily.

                                 ISTVAN
                        ONE!  TWO!  THREE STRIKES YOU’RE--

           BACK TO SCENE

           Istvan is tearing up.  Charlie smiles.

                                 ISTVAN 
                        Now you do not wish to ask me how 
                        an old Magyar man can be a Cubbies 
                        fan who lives in Hungary?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        What I can’t figure out is how you 
                        became a Cubs fan, Istvan.  I mean, 
                        you live in Hungary.

                                 ISTVAN
                        The story of how is this: when I am 
                        young my father buys audio tape 
                        recordings of Mr. Jack Brickhouse 
                        and the Cubbies on the black market 
                        and we listen together under the 
                        blankets for fear of being caught 
                        by secret police.  And then later 
                        my daughter buys me the satellite 
                        to watch WGN, the TV SuperStation.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        I should apologize to you, Istvan, 
                        the Cubs being so bad and all.

                                 ISTVAN 
                        For me, the Cubbies are same as the 
                        Hungarian people.  We are, how do 
                        you say, long time suffering.  
                        Always an invasion or occupation, 
                        always beaten in the wars.  We are 
                        the heartbreak people, but our 
                        character is always strong.  Same as 
                        the Cubbies.
                                 CHARLIE 
                        You make a lot of sense, Istvan.  

                                 ISTVAN 
                        I told you, you can learn if you 
                        talk to an old man sometimes.  May 
                        I show to you something incredible?

           Charlie nods and Istvan pulls out a Cubs BATTING HELMET, the 
           kind that holds two beers and has a straw hanging down to 
           drink out of.  Istvan puts it on and smiles. 

                                 ISTVAN (cont’d)
                        For my daughter to say thanks you 
                        for sending me to Chicago.  You 
                        think she will love it?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who wouldn’t?

                                 ISTVAN 
                        Who wouldn’t!  This is what I 
                        thought!  Who wouldn’t.

           MANY HOURS LATER

           It is night.  Istvan is asleep, leaning on Charlie’s shoulder 
           again.  A line of DROOL hangs from his mouth onto Charlie’s 
           shirt.  Charlie sleeps too.

           DAWN

           Sunlight oranges Charlie’s face.  He wakes.  Istvan still 
           leans on him.  He gently tries to move him.  But Charlie 
           BLANCHES, yanking his hand back.  Something’s wrong.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Istvan?  Sir?

           Istvan’s face is ashen.  Charlie tries to shake him.  He’s 
           unmoving, as stiff as a board -- DEAD.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Oh shit.  Oh no.  

           He DINGS the call button.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Hello?  Can someone...is there a 
                        doctor?  This man is--

           People begin to stir.  The British FLIGHT ATTENDANT arrives.  
                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        May I help you, sir?

                                 CHARLIE
                        This man -- Istvan.  I think he’s, 
                        um, I don’t know.  He was fine.  
                        Earlier.

           Flight Attendant reaches for Istvan’s arm to check his pulse, 
           but SHE CAN’T MOVE IT.  Rigor mortis.  Charlie looks sick.  

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Is he...what can I do?

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Be quiet.  You’ll alarm the others.  
                    (to passengers)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, we have a 
                        potentially grave situation 
                        involving this man’s mortality.  Is 
                        there a doctor on board?

           THEN

           A DOCTOR LADY shakes her head over Istvan’s body.  

           The PILOT confers with the flight attendants.  They look back 
           at the body.  At Charlie.  He remains in his seat by the 
           window.  Trapped, stunned.  After a bit, Flight Attendant 
           approaches Charlie.  She’s got a DRINK and a SHEET.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        I’m sorry, sir, but we have no 
                        choice but to continue on to 
                        Budapest.  This man is from there 
                        and it really does simplify things.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I can’t sit here.  

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Unfortunately, the flight is full.  
                        We are sorry for the inconvenience.
                    (setting drink down)
                        Enjoy this complementary beverage.  
                        We’ll keep them coming.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        It’s morning.  There’s a dead 
                        person sitting next to me.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Only two hours more.  Let’s try to 
                        make the best of it, shall we?
           She places the sheet over Istvan.  She goes.  

           LATER

           Charlie’s had enough drinks to be drunk.  He DINGS the call 
           button.  Flight Attendant comes over.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I have to go to the bathroom.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Hm.  You’ll have to climb over, I 
                        suppose.

           She goes.  Charlie stands and tries to squeeze, but the 
           person in front of Istvan is reclining and asleep.  Charlie 
           tries to step over Istvan, but he FALLS into the aisle.

           He’s getting up.  Istvan’s sheet moves.

                                 ISTVAN (O.S.)
                        Psst.  Charlie, come in to here.

           Charlie looks around to see if someone is talking to him.  
           They’re not.  Charlie lifts the sheet.  Istvan smiles at him. 

                                 ISTVAN (cont’d)
                        I see your mother, Charlie.  I tell 
                        her you are going to Bucharest.  
                        She smiles for you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m sorry you died, Istvan.

                                 ISTVAN
                        Never mind.  I see also my wife and 
                        she made some sex with me.
                    (then)
                        Charlie, I wish to ask you a special 
                        thing.  It is my daughter -- perhaps 
                        you will give her my gift, and tell 
                        her she is my édeshem lány.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Your daughter...adesh-em what?

           Istvan is gray and dead again.  Charlie comes out from under 
           the sheet.  Everyone’s looking at him like he’s a freak.

           FINALLY

           The plane has landed.  Passengers disembark, moving around 
           Istvan like he’s, well, a dead body.  Charlie is stuck there.
           Soon, an AIRPORT OFFICIAL arrives with two other GUYS who are 
           pushing a wheelchair.  The official takes Istvan’s bag from 
           the floor.  Charlie picks up the BEER HAT.

                                 AIRPORT OFFICIAL
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        This is your funny hat?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t understand.  What? 

           A HELPFUL PASSENGER is there.

                                 HELPFUL PASSENGER
                        He want to know if the funny hat is 
                        belonging to you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes.  It is belonging to me.  It’s 
                        my funny hat.  Ha ha.  

                                 HELPFUL PASSENGER
                    (to official; subtitled)
                        He says it is his, but he is lying.  
                        It was the dead man’s funny hat.   

           The official takes the hat.  Charlie turns to the passenger.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What did you say?  Tell him it’s my 
                        funny hat.

                                 HELPFUL PASSENGER
                        But it is not your funny hat.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re a fucking asshole.  How do 
                        you say you’re a fucking asshole?

           The official gives Charlie a cold stare.  

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        He told me to give it to his 
                        daughter.  I have to--

                                 AIRPORT OFFICIAL
                    (to guys; subtitled)
                        Get the guy.  Don’t let the 
                        American take the funny hat.

           INT. BUDAPEST FERIHÉGY INTERNATIONAL - DAY

           Charlie is in the terminal.  The guys move Istvan away from 
           the gate.  The OFFICIAL has Istvan’s WALLET.  
           He opens it and surreptitiously pulls out a HUNDRED DOLLAR 
           BILL.  He pockets it.  Ms. Gabor chimes in:

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        How do we choose, dahlinge, between 
                        something and nothing, if nothing is 
                        all we’ve ever done?  

           Charlie is going to explode.  He eyes the BEER HAT sitting on 
           top of Istvan’s bag.  

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        I will tell you: if something will 
                        bring us closer to love, we must do 
                        it!  God dammit, we must do it!

           Charlie breaks into a run.  He’s going for the hat.  The 
           official sees him.  No time to react.  Charlie’s there.  He 
           SWIPES THE HAT and tears off down the corridor.  

           The official yells.  TWO GUARDS note the commotion.  
           Charlie’s heading right for them.  He doesn’t see them.  

           SMASH.  Charlie is knocked to the ground.  He slides into the 
           wall, in a heap.  The guards jump him, yanking him up.  He 
           flails wildly.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        I need to give Istvan’s daughter 
                        this hat!  You fucking pricks!  
                        Lemme go!   IT’S HER FUNNY HA--

           A TASER is out.  ZZZAAP!  Charlie convulses, and goes limp.

           INT. HOLDING ROOM - DAY

           Charlie sits at a table in a small room.  He seems dazed.  
           His hair is staticky.  His suitcase is there.  He checks his 
           watch.  He calls through the open door.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Got a plane to catch.  Hello?  

           He can see the TWO GUARDS.  Guard One has the beer hat on, 
           and is slurping coffee from a cup set in one of the holders.  

           Soon a weary-looking MAN in a cheap suit arrives.  Guard One 
           takes the hat off and hands it to him.  He enters the room, 
           holding the hat and Charlie’s passport.  

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        You have a story to tell?  About 
                        why you take this hat and run away?
                                 CHARLIE
                        The guy who died asked me to give 
                        it to his daughter.

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        You knew this guy who died?  Banyai 
                        Istvan?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Istvan Banyai.

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        In Hungary we say family name 
                        first, name name second.

                                 CHARLIE
                        My friend Richard Small should 
                        never come here.  Right?

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        Why does a guy want a guy he does 
                        not know to take a hat to his 
                        daughter?  Why can’t the guy take 
                        the hat to his daughter by himself?

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s an interesting question.  You 
                        should ask it to someone who didn’t 
                        just get tasered.

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        Do you think Banyai Istvan knew he 
                        was going to die?  Or perhaps he 
                        said it to you after he was dead?  
                        Maybe you talk to dead people like 
                        the boy in the Bruce Willis film?  
                    (whispering)
                        “I talk to the dead people.”

                                 CHARLIE
                        First of all, he sees the dead 
                        people.  And second, Banyai Istvan 
                        got this hat for his daughter.  I 
                        thought, the poor guy died, his 
                        daughter should get the hat.  

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        You are a hero of some kind?  Like 
                        Bruce Willis in many other films?

                                 CHARLIE
                        The guy who took the body from the 
                        plane also took a hundred American 
                        bucks from the body’s wallet.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (cont'd)
                        Which made me doubt the hat would 
                        ever get to the body’s daughter.  
                        So.  You know.  Fuck this.

           Cheap Suit’s cell phone RINGS.

                                 CHEAP SUIT 
                        Nem igáz.  Most?  Bistos?  Azzonal.

           He hangs up and tosses Charlie’s passport on the table.

                                 CHEAP SUIT (cont’d)
                        Go to your plane or you will be 
                        detained more seriously.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        That’s it?

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        There is a gypsy uprising in the 
                        car park.  Lucky for you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        A gypsy uprising?

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        In the car park, yes.

           Cheap Suit heads out, taking the hat.  He directs the guards.  
           They run off.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        What about the daughter? 

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        Zotlán!  Gyere már!

           The OFFICIAL comes out of an office.  Cheap Suit hands him 
           the hat, saying something.  Charlie jumps to his feet.

                                 CHARLIE
                        But that’s the fucker who--

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        The daughter will get the hat.  
                    (to official; subtitled)
                        See him to his plane.  Make sure he 
                        gets on it.

           Cheap Suit hurries off.

           EXT. TARMAC - DAY

           Charlie climbs into a crappy commuter jet.  He looks back.  
           The official is on the tarmac, holding the hat.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Better give it to her, pal!

           The official gives Charlie THE FINGER.

           IN THE PLANE

           Passengers file in.  Charlie is in his seat.  He notices 
           something off in the distance, at the terminal.

           We SWITCH TO HIS POV: it’s an AMBULANCE.  Two EMTs load a 
           gurney into the back, a body laid on it.  A WOMAN is there.

           The official is still outside.  Charlie knocks on the window, 
           gesturing to the ambulance.  The official gives Charlie 
           ANOTHER FINGER.  He’s about to explode.  He closes his eyes.

           IN BLACKNESS

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        You must do it, dahlinge.  Wake 
                        yourself up and god damn do it!

           The SOUNDS of running, frantic breathing.

                                            SMASH TO:

           THE TARMAC

           With Charlie.  He’s racing like mad toward the ambulance.  
           He’s got the hat.  In the background, the OFFICIAL struggles 
           to his feet, grabbing for his WALKIE-TALKIE.

           AT THE AMBULANCE

           The EMTs and the woman hear YELLING.  They turn to find 
           Charlie racing toward them, waving the hat.  

           CHARLIE

           Approaching the ambulance, calling to the woman:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Istvan’s daughter!  Your father got 
                        you this funny hat in Chicago!

           The woman is confused.  Charlie reaches the gurney.  He stops.  
           It holds an ALIVE GUY, his leg wrapped and elevated.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        You’re not Ist--

           BAM!  He’s KNOCKED OUT OF THE FRAME.  Tackled by a GUARD.
           INT. LONG CORRIDOR - DAY

           Charlie is handcuffed, getting pulled along by the guard who 
           tackled him.  The official walks out in front.

           Down the hall, CHEAP SUIT steps out of an office.  He’s 
           covered in something red and sticky.

                        Put him with the fucking gypsies.

                        Tomatoes.  Fucking gypsies.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

           Charlie sits amid a ragtag group of dark-skinned, brightly-
           dressed people.  An OLD MAN is next to him, staring.  He’s 
           wearing PINK EYEGLASSES.  They have a BARBIE LOGO on them.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        How’d the uprising go?

           The old man begins talking animatedly.  Charlie listens.

           LATER

           A YOUNG MAN plays GUITAR, singing a tune of gypsy heartache.  
           KIDS dance with WOMEN.  Charlie claps along with the crowd.

           THEN

           Charlie listens.  The old man in pink glasses is talking 
           again.  The DOOR opens.  Cheap Suit motions for Charlie. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Pardon me, Ilya.
                    (to Cheap Suit)
                        What about these people?  None of us 
                        are free until all of us are free.  
                    (to gypsies)
                        Right?

           The gypsies laugh: don’t-be-ridiculous!

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Okay, well, goodbye, friends.  Keep 
                        on uprising!
                                 GYPSIES
                        Viszontlátasrá, Charlie!

           WHAP!  A TOMATO smashes into Cheap Suit’s chest.  

           IN THE CORRIDOR

           Cheap Suit opens the door to a room.  Charlie looks in.  A 
           BEAUTIFUL WOMAN is standing there, holding the FUNNY HAT.  It 
           is GABI, the femme fatale from the beginning, though right 
           now she looks more like a girl who’s father just died. 

           Charlie’s face flushes and he gasps at her beauty.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        This is how it happens, ladies and 
                        gentleman.  One moment, nobody is 
                        your anything.  Then boom!  
                        Somebody becomes your everything.  

           She smiles as best she can at Charlie.  His mouth is open.  
           She offers her hand.  He grabs it like a lifeline.

                                 GABI
                        Jo nápot kivánok.  Banyai 
                        Gabriella, vagyók.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hello.  I’m Charlie Countryman.  
                        Er, Countryman Charlie.

           He holds her hand for too long.  His whole being is alight.

                                 GABI
                        You have gone to so much trouble 
                        for my father and this funny hat.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m glad you got it.  It seemed 
                        important.  Also, I’m a Cubs fan.

                                 GABI
                        I want to ask, how did he...what 
                        happened, with my father?

                                 CHARLIE
                        He fell asleep.  And he just, um, 
                        he didn’t wake up.

                                 GABI
                        You are sure?  There was no pain?
                                 CHARLIE
                        No.  He was asleep, on me.  Here.
                        You can almost see -- drool marks.  
                        I would have known, you know? 

                                 GABI
                        Okay.  I see.  Okay.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        He asked me to tell you something.  

                                 GABI
                        I don’t understand, he asked you.  
                        How could he know we would meet?

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        That’s what I said!  It makes no 
                        fucking sense!

                                 CHARLIE
                        What I mean is, he said something. 
                        Maybe you’d like to hear it.

                                 GABI
                        Please.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        He said you’re his...a-desh em, um--

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        Édeshem lány?

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s it.

           This lands on Gabi.  She struggles to keep it together.   
           Charlie gestures to Cheap Suit: what’s it mean?

                                 CHEAP SUIT
                        It means “candy child of my own”.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you sure?

                                 GABI
                        It means my sweet girl.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh.  That’s nice.

                                 GABI 
                        Okay.  Thank you, Charlie.  
           She looks at the hat.  A TEARDROP slides down her cheek.  It 
           drops off her chin.  Charlie CATCHES IT in the palm of his 
           hand.  Rightly, they consider this odd.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        I’m sorry about your father...

                                 GABI
                        Gabi.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Gabi.  I’m sorry, Gabi.  

           She nods and GOES OUT.  Cheap Suit follows her.  We hear them 
           talking.  Something’s wrong with Charlie.  He looks dazed.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Gabi.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        The name in the song of the dream, 
                        it echoes in the space of his heart.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Gabi.  Gabi, Gabi.  Gabi.

           He hears a THROAT CLEARING.  He turns.  Gabi is back.  

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Oh hey.  Gabi.  I was just...saying 
                        your name.

           She moves in close to him, right up under his chin.

                                 GABI
                        Please.  Would you allow me?

           Charlie gulps.  Gabi takes his arms and wraps herself in them.  

                                 GABI (cont’d)
                        Squeeze tight.  Please.  

           Charlie does.   Gabi presses into him.  She closes her eyes 
           and inhales deeply, for Charlie carries the final traces of 
           what will now be ever gone from her life.  She pulls back.

                                 GABI (cont’d)
                        Okay.  Thank you, Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Gabi, would it help if...do you want 
                        this shirt?   I brought others.

           She smiles and goes.  Cheap Suit gives him a look.
           EXT. FERIHÉGY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Doors slide open.  Charlie is pushed out.  Cheap Suit directs 
           a GUARD to toss Charlie’s bag out.  Charlie stands there at a 
           loss, for a while.  He sees a TAXI STAND.

           IN A TAXI

           Charlie sits in the back of an old Lada.  The DRIVER is 
           smoking West™ cigarettes.  He offers one.  Charlie declines.

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Where to?

                                 CHARLIE
                        If you just asked me where to --  
                        good question.  There a youth 
                        hostel or something?

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        You look like a guy who doesn’t 
                        know where to go.  Maybe I’ll take 
                        you to the youth hostel.  Okay?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay.

           EXT. TAXI - M1 HIGHWAY - DAY

           The taxi creeps along in a TRAFFIC JAM.  The radio plays THE 
           WAY WE WERE.  The driver smokes.  

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                        Barbra Streisand!  Robert Redford!  
                    (Charlie nods)
                        Hubble and Katie!  
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Do you know this movie?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Love this movie.

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Do you know it is actually an 
                        allegory?  About the homosexual love 
                        affair between Arthur Laurents, the 
                        ugly writer of the movie, and Farley 
                        Granger, the handsome actor from 
                        Strangers on a Train?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Of the smiles we left behind...

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        I love a nice love story, whether 
                        it’s based on faggots or African 
                        niggers or what have you.  You know?

           The driver notices something over on the shoulder.  A TRABANT 
           -- a tiny robin’s-egg-blue CAR -- with a CELLO strapped to 
           its roof.  A WOMAN is inside, slumped over the steering 
           wheel, weeping uncontrollably.

                                 TAXI DRIVER (cont’d)
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Poor thing.  I’d stop, but a crying 
                        woman often gives me a hard-on.

           The woman sits back and wipes her eyes.  You know who it is.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Gabi.
                    (to driver)
                        STOP!  Pull over!

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        I told you, I will get a boner.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop the car, man!

                                 TAXI DRIVER 
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        This is your love story?  A weeping 
                        woman with a cello on her Trabant?

           ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD

           Charlie knocks on Gabi’s window.  She rolls it down.

                                 GABI
                        Jo nápot kivánok, Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That a cello on your roof or are 
                        you just happy to see me?

           He smiles.  She stares.  

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        It’s a joke.  Maybe not here.  I’m 
                        sorry.  
           Gabi SNORTS magnificently, then wipes her nose with her 
           sleeve.

                                 GABI 
                        I’ve got so much snot in my nose.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Luckily, you’ve got that sleeve.

                                 GABI
                        I meant to follow my father.  The 
                        van he is in.  But I was crying.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ah.  So the snot.

                                 GABI
                        Yes.  So the snot.  
                    (down the road)
                        It’s gone now.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Actually, there’s just a bit...

           Gently, he wipes her lip with his thumb.

                                 GABI
                        The van is gone.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        How long were you crying for?

                                 GABI
                        I don’t know.  Time is not itself 
                        when you are crying.  You know?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Say five minutes.  We can catch it.  

                                 GABI
                        Never mind.  I’ll just--

                                 CHARLIE
                        No!  You followed the van for a 
                        reason.  This is a critical time 
                        for you.  You’ve got to follow 
                        through on this stuff.  Trust me.

                                 GABI 
                        I don’t know you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No?  What’s my favorite baseball 
                        team?
           She smiles.  He opens her door. 

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Let me drive.  I’m snot-free.
                    (off her hesitation)
                        It’s fine.  I had this same car 
                        when I was five.  

           She slides over.  He climbs in.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Mine had a clapping monkey on top, 
                        but what’s the difference, right?

           EXT. M1 HIGHWAY - DAY

           Charlie speeds the Trabi through heavy traffic.  

           INSIDE

           They’re looking for the van.  Neither speaks for a while, 
           until Charlie can’t not.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So, you play the cello.

                                 GABI
                        No. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No?

                                 GABI
                        What gave you that idea?  

           Charlie looks up to the roof.

                                 GABI (cont’d)
                        Maybe you imagined it.  Maybe you 
                        have some kind of fantasy about 
                        coming to the aid of a sad woman in 
                        a far away land?  A sad woman who 
                        happens to play the cello?  

           Now Charlie stares at her.

                                 GABI (cont’d)
                        Now I’m making a joke.  You don’t 
                        understand it?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sort of.  Not really.
                                 GABI 
                        The joke is to imply that you are 
                        making this up in your mind. 
                        Because I am pretty, I’m 
                        vulnerable, I play the cello -- 
                        it’s a boy’s dream, no?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re kind of pretty.  I guess.  
                        But I like the tuba.  

                                 GABI
                        Perhaps it’s more of a Hungarian 
                        type of joke.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I go for a simple type of joke.  A 
                        dick-joke, for example.  Nothing 
                        better than a good--

                                 GABI
                        Two guys stand on a bridge.  
                        Drinking lots of beer.  So much 
                        beer they need to urinate.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re not going to--

                                 GABI
                        First guy takes out his dick to go.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop it.  He does not.

                                 GABI 
                        He has a big dick.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Really...like, how big?

                                 GABI
                        So big that when he’s urinating he 
                        is able to say, this water’s cold.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        What about the second guy? 

                                 GABI
                        Second guy takes out his dick.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Does he have a big dick too?
                                 GABI
                        Bigger.  So much bigger that when 
                        he’s urinating, he is able to say: 
                        yeah, it’s deep too.

           Charlie cracks up.  So does Gabi.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        The second guy’s dick not only 
                        reaches the water, it hits the 
                        bottom of the river as well!

                                 GABI
                        Yes.  Exactly.

           They laugh.  Then they settle.  Gabi starts to cry. 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        I’m sorry, Gabi.  I shouldn’t be--

                                 GABI 
                        I play cello in the orchestra of 
                        the Budapest Opera House.  My 
                        father was my teacher.  From the 
                        time I was a little girl.  This 
                        explains the cello, no?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes.  

                                 GABI
                        Okay.

           INT. MORTUARY VAN - DAY

           In the cargo hold, Istvan’s BODY is laid out in a white bag.  
           SMOKE clouds the air.  We MOVE through it, up to the front.

           Two GUYS are there, PÉTER and PÁL.  Péter drives, Pál smokes 
           from a HASH PIPE.  They’re both fucked up.  (Dialogue is in 
           Hungarian, SUBTITLED throughout scene.)

                                 PÉTER
                        Taste familiar?
                    (Pál shrugs)
                        Search your mind.  You know this 
                        taste.  It is a taste you love.

                                 PÁL
                        It tastes like hash.  I love hash.
                                 PÉTER
                        You don’t sense an extra element?  
                        A certain pungency which makes you 
                        feel sentimental?

                                 PÁL
                        I don’t know.  It’s fucking hash.

                                 PÉTER
                        Hash that I brought from Slovenia 
                        in my asshole.
                    (Pál gags)
                        Now you recognize it?  The taste of 
                        your mother’s kiss after she has 
                        spent the day licking my asshole? 

           Pál takes out his CELL and pretends to dial.

                                 PÁL 
                        Hello, mom.  Please stop licking 
                        the assholes of my friends all day.  
                        It’s so embarrassing for me.

           Péter’s laughing, too fucking high.  He grabs for the 
           pipe...AND THE VAN VEERS WILDLY TO THE RIGHT.

           OUT ON THE HIGHWAY

           Charlie and Gabi drive along.  And suddenly... 

           THE VAN FLIES IN FRONT OF THEM, flipping over and over.

           Charlie STOMPS the brakes.  THUNK!  Something heavy and white 
           bounces across the hood.  

           The Trabant spins into traffic.  Cars screech around it.  

           Charlie skids to a stop.

           The VAN creeks onto its side,  PÉTER and PÁL are tangled up 
           in the wreckage.  Bloody and dead.

           Dust settles, quiet spreads.  

           Charlie and Gabi sit there stunned.  Gabi sees something.

                                 GABI
                        Ápu?  

           Dazed, she gets out.  Charlie sees what she’s looking at: in 
           the road, hanging out of the white bag, is ISTVAN’S BODY.

           Gabi walks into the road.  Charlie leaps out of the car.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Gabi, don’t!

           He grabs her and turns her away.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Don’t.  Please.  You can’t--

           SMASH.  She punches him in the face.  But he won’t let her 
           go.  SMASH.  She punches him again.  His mouth is bleeding.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Okay.  Okay.  Just--

           SMASH.  Again.  He takes it.  He pulls her in.  She SLUGS him 
           in the stomach.  Still, he takes it and holds her.  She HITS 
           him on the head a couple of times.  He holds her. 

           WIDER

           From afar, amid the horrible mess, we see Gabi begin to sob, 
           her body heaving.  Charlie holds to her as she drops to the 
           pavement.  He sits with her, cradling her in the aftermath.  

           LATER 

           Istvan’s body is in an AMBULANCE.  Gabi sits with it, dazed.  
           Charlie stands outside, helpless.  An EMT closes the doors.

           Gabi looks at Charlie through the window, blank-faced and 
           empty-eyed.  The ambulance pulls away.  Charlie waves.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        What does the world mean, dahlinge, 
                        when it conspires to keep lovers 
                        apart and their hearts at bay?

           Charlie looks around.  Cops and ambulances.  The overturned 
           van.  Flares and slow-moving traffic.  Charlie looks in his 
           hand.  A set of KEYS with a TOY CELLO dangling from them. 

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        It means for to us to prove we are 
                        worthy, that it is love we deserve.

           AT THE TRABANT

           Charlie rummages through Gabi’s bag.  He finds a cell phone.  
           He checks it -- a picture of Istvan smiling.  Then he finds a 
           HANDGUN -- a silver nub nose .45.  The handle is ENGRAVED.  
           Charlie reads:
                                 CHARLIE
                        “For Gabi, the girl with a killer 
                        ass.  Love, Nigel”  

           Charlie puts the gun back in the bag.  He opens the glove-
           box.  He finds an old OPERA PROGRAM.  

                                 GABI’S VOICE
                        I play cello in the orchestra of 
                        the Budapest Opera House.  

           EXT. OUTER BUDAPEST - DAY

           The Trabant passes endless arrays of Eastern Bloc apartment 
           buildings.  Charlie is behind the wheel looking dumbstruck.  
           The PROGRAM is on the seat next to him.  

           INT. GAS STATION - DAY

           Charlie pays for a MAP with a credit card.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        You speak English?

                                 COUNTER GUY
                        No.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You don’t speak English?

                                 COUNTER GUY
                        Not really.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s English.

                                 COUNTER GUY
                        If you say so.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let me ask you this -- can you show 
                        me how to get to the Opera House?

                                 COUNTER GUY
                        No.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dude, I’m not in the mood.  Really.

                                 COUNTER
                        I’m sorry.  I don’t understand you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wait here.
                                 COUNTER GUY
                        Okay.

           Charlie goes out.

           THEN

           He comes back in.  He sticks the GUN in Counter Guy’s face.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, I was wondering: do you speak 
                        English?

                                 COUNTER GUY
                        Yes I do.

           EXT. BUDAPEST - DUSK

           Charlie drives.  Nearing the city center.  Grand and beautiful 
           structures line the streets.  

           ELSEWHERE

           The Trabant passes City Park, and Heroes Square, then turns 
           onto the city’s most glorious street -- Andrássy.

           EXT. OPERA HOUSE - DUSK

           A magnificent beaux-arts wedding cake of a building.  Charlie 
           parks the Trabant.

           INT. OPERA HOUSE - DUSK

           Charlie enters carrying the CELLO and Gabi’s BAG.  A GUY in a 
           BERET walks in behind him.  He’s got his own CELLO.  

           UPSTAIRS

           Beret walks down a long hallway.  Charlie follows him, 
           hanging back.  Beret goes into a room.

           AT THE ROOM

           Charlie opens the door.  A hall.  Several CELLISTS sit 
           against the wall, while some MEN AND WOMEN sit at a long 
           table in the middle of the room.  A lone CELLIST sits in 
           front of them, playing.  An AID approaches Charlie.

                                 AID
                    (subtitled; in Hungarian)
                        You’re late.  Take a seat.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Uh, I’m not--
           A pinch-faced MAN quiets them:

                                 MAN
                    (subtitled; in Hungarian)
                        SILENCE, GOD DAMN IT!!

           His voice echoes.  The room is still.  All eyes on Charlie.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m, uh, a friend of Gabriella 
                        Baynai’s.  Banyai Gabriella’s.  
                        Does anyone know--

           Suddenly, the BEE-GEES’ JIVE TALKIN’ begins playing.  It’s 
           coming from the bag.  Charlie grabs around inside. 

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Hold on.  This might be...

           He pulls something out...it’s THE GUN.  People gasp and 
           shrink back.  A couple of judges dive under the table.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Sorry.  

           Jive Talkin’ is still sounding.  Charlie finds the phone. 

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Hello, Gabi’s phone.

           INTERCUT WITH:  Gabi on a pay phone, at a MORGUE.

                                 GABI
                        Charlie, this is me, Gabi.  Where 
                        are you?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Gabi, are you okay?  Where are you?

                                 GABI
                        No, you.  Where are you?

                                 CHARLIE
                        At the Opera House.  It’s the only 
                        place I could think to come.  I’ve 
                        got your cello and your car...

                                 GABI
                        And my gun, Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                    (whispering)
                        And your gun, by the way.  What’s 
                        up with that?!  
                                 GABI 
                        I overheard some policemen here.  
                        There was an incident at a petrol 
                        station, involving an American and 
                        a gun.  This was not you, was it?
                    (uh, um)
                        Úristen!  What did you do?!  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nothing.  I was upset.  Maybe I 
                        overreacted.  I never had a gun as 
                        an option before.  You know?

                                 GABI 
                        Now you are at the Opera?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I think I’m about to audition.

                                 GABI
                        Audition?  Is there an assholish 
                        man there?  With a face like he 
                        maybe ate shit or something?

           Charlie looks right at the MAN who yelled.  He’s now enraged.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        He’s here.  

                                 GABI
                        Béla.  Give him the phone.

           Charlie walks to BÉLA, who’s skinny and stiff and in his 40s.  
           Charlie hands him the phone.  He turns sickly sweet.

                                 BÉLA
                        Tessék, Gabika?

           He listens.  For a while.  He hangs up and looks at Charlie.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        You hung up.

                                 BÉLA
                        Wait in the corridor, sir, if you 
                        please.

                                 CHARLIE
                        But--

                                 BÉLA
                        The corridor, sir.  
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        IF YOU GOD DAMN PLEASE!  
           Charlie heads out, asking the cellists a simple question.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How many assholes can a guy meet in 
                        a day?  Seriously.  There must be a 
                        limit.  Right?

           IN THE HALLWAY

           Charlie sits on the ground, cello and bag next to him.  

           SOON

           Charlie is struggling to stay awake.  Cellists begin filing 
           out.  Béla is there.  He kicks Charlie’s foot.

                                 BÉLA
                        Come now, please.  

           The AID is with Béla.  Charlie gets up and grabs the cello 
           and the bag.  Béla nods to the aid.  She takes the cello.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        What’s going on?   

           Béla walks off.  Charlie follows.  

           INT. OPERA HOUSE - MAIN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           Béla leads Charlie into a viewing box.  He’s now in one of 
           the world’s most beautiful rooms -- gilded archways, a grand 
           proscenium, luxurious velvet draperies, and a domed ceiling 
           supporting an elaborate crystal chandelier.

                                 BÉLA
                        Wait here.

                                 CHARLIE
                        For what?

           Béla leaves. 

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Is there anywhere nicer?  To wait, 
                        I mean?  How about some nachos?

           LATER

           Charlie is ASLEEP.  He twitches, and starts awake.  He hears 
           MUSIC, and SINGING.  A well-dressed WOMAN is next to him, 
           scowling.  He looks around.  And is shocked to find that...

           THE HOUSE IS FULL and AN OPERA IS IN PROGRESS.  
           Charlie rubs the sleep away and looks down into the ORCHESTRA.  
           He scans the PLAYERS.  BÉLA is conducting.  Then he locates 
           GABI, playing her cello.  Her eyes are closed, and tears 
           stream down her face.  The day’s pain washing over her.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        How do we know when it is love we 
                        are in, dahlinge?  When we can see 
                        the world through another’s eyes,  
                        when we can feel it through her 
                        heart.  

           Charlie can’t help but cry a little himself.  

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        This is how we know.

           THEN

           Lovelorn DON JOSÉ is begging at the feet of the mysterious 
           gypsy, CARMEN.  But all Charlie can do is watch Gabi.  
           Eventually, she glances up at him, and we...

           SWITCH

           TO A MYSTERIOUS POV: watching Gabi through BINOCULARS as she 
           looks up into the crowd.  She smiles slightly and shrugs.  

           Suddenly, our POV SHIFTS, and the binoculars sweep across the 
           crowd, following the line of Gabi’s gaze.  Soon, we find 
           CHARLIE.  He waves at Gabi.  And we...

           REVERSE

           To find a MAN looking through a pair of OPERA GLASSES.  He 
           lowers them.  It is the KNIFE-FACED MAN from the opening scene.  
           This is NIGEL. 

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        Of course the boy would like to 
                        believe his beloved was born upon 
                        their meeting today.  She was not.  

           Nigel’s got the bottomless stare and the deep scars of a 
           soldier of fortune.  Which is precisely what he is.  He could 
           be 38, he could be 56.  It doesn’t matter.  What matters is 
           he’s upset.  We pity that piece of gum he’s chewing.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        Like so many of us here, she brings 
                        to love a troubled past, a darkness 
                        of history.  
           We PULL BACK to find we should also pity the OLD MAN in the 
           next seat over, as the opera glasses are attached to his neck 
           and he’s being pulled out of his seat, choking on the chain.  
           Eventually, Nigel hands the glasses back.  

                                 NIGEL
                    (English accent)
                        Cheers, mate.

           Nigel gets up and leaves.  Eyeing Charlie all the while.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        And so clouds do gather, dahlinge.

           INT. OPERA HOUSE DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

           Gabi wearily puts her cello into its case.  A WOMAN approaches.  

                                 WOMAN
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        A man is here to see you, Gabika.

           CORRIDOR

           Gabi comes out expecting to see Charlie, but it’s...

                                 GABI
                        Nigel.

           NIGEL smiles a crooked smile.  His eyes are more alive with 
           sex and violence than any we’ve probably ever seen.

                                 NIGEL
                        Hallo, gorgeous.  

           The HAIR on Gabi’s forearms stands on end.  Nigel notices and 
           runs his finger along her arm.  

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        Good to see you as well, baby.  

                                 GABI
                        What are you doing here, Nigel?

                                 NIGEL
                        Partaking of the arts.  Care of the 
                        soul and all that.  What else?

                                 GABI
                        It’s just, I didn’t realize you 
                        were back.

                                 NIGEL
                        I wasn’t.  Til now.
                                 GABI
                        Why are you here?

                                 NIGEL
                        I just said why.  

                                 GABI
                        To see Carmen.

                                 NIGEL 
                        Yes, Carmen.  The sad fucking cow.

           Beyond Nigel, Gabi sees CHARLIE enter the corridor.  She 
           subtly shakes her head, begging him off.  Nigel notices.  

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        Who’s this, then?

                                 GABI
                        Nobody.  I want you to go, Nigel.

                                 NIGEL
                        You’re nobody, mate?  Is that a 
                        possible thing for one to be?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who are you?

                                 NIGEL
                        Hold on.  You’ll want to posit that 
                        again.  And beware I’m giving you 
                        an opportunity to recalibrate your 
                        tone.

           Charlie gulps a little.  

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        Don’t piss yourself.  Simply ask 
                        who I am again.
                    (Charlie hesitates)
                        Go on.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you serious?

                                 NIGEL
                        I am utterly.

                                 GABI
                        Nigel, don’t--

                                 NIGEL
                        Let’s go, boy-o.  Last chance for 
                        petrol.  “Who are you?”
           Gabi’s eyes implore Charlie to ask.  He flattens his voice.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who...are...you...

                                 NIGEL
                        Good.  All robot like.  Zero tone 
                        detected.  I’m Nigel.  Who the fuck 
                        are you?  Besides nobody which is by 
                        now well and truly established.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        My name is Charlie.

                                 NIGEL 
                        Hallo, Charlie.  Who the fuck is 
                        Charlie, Gabi?  

                                 GABI
                        Charlie is an American...tuba 
                        player.  Here to observe the 
                        company.  He is homosexual.

           This characterization surprises Charlie.

                                 NIGEL 
                        Is he now?  Must make you quite the 
                        star cocksucker.  Eh, Charlie?

                                 GABI
                        Nigel, please, what do you want?  

                                 NIGEL
                        Baby, it’s like this.  I’m in 
                        Monrovia under fire from a battalion 
                        of cross-dressing no-monkey boys out 
                        their minds on Chinese molasses when 
                        all of a sudden I get the words “to 
                        have and to hold” ringing in me Ned.  
                        And it strikes me: eight years is 
                        too long a time for a man to have 
                        neither had nor held his wife...

           Charlie’s surprised again.

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        So, in an act which can only be 
                        described as merciful, I shoot out 
                        as many of their ashy little 
                        kneecaps as possible, and speed my 
                        way back to you.
                                 GABI 
                        I am not your wife, Nigel.
                    (to Charlie)
                        We divorced many years ago.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh.  Sorry.

                                 NIGEL 
                        Thank you, Charlie.  But Gabi knows 
                        such technicalities mean fuck-all 
                        to a lawless cunt like me.  

           Gabi turns to Charlie, who is all but lost.

                                 GABI
                        Charlie, perhaps you should go now.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay.  Where would be good?  For me 
                        to go, do you think.

                                 GABI
                        To the Marco Polo Youth Hostel, of 
                        course.  Where you are staying.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Marco Polo Youth Hostel.  Right.   

                                 GABI
                        Maybe I will see you tomorrow.  
                        During your observation time.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Okay.  I guess I’ll just...Will you  
                        be all right, Gabi?

                                 NIGEL
                        She’s grand, Charlie.  Be a dear 
                        and fuck off already, would you? 

           Charlie looks at Gabi.  She wants him to go.  So he goes.  
           But then he comes back.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        So, Gabi, “Marco Polo” in 
                        Hungarian.  It’s Marco Polo, right?  
                        Not Polo Marco?

                                 NIGEL
                        Jesus me, Charlie!  If you’re not 
                        the most helpless gay tuba man I 
                        ever encountered.
           EXT. MARCO POLO YOUTH HOSTEL - NIGHT

           Charlie climbs out of a TAXI in front of an OLD BUILDING. 

           INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT

           Charlie hands his passport to a CLERK.  It’s a bright, clean 
           place with TRAVEL-KIDS of various nationalities wandering in 
           and out.  The clerk hands Charlie a key. 

                                 CLERK
                        Top floor please.  Enjoy your time.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Thank you for not being an asshole.

                                 CLERK
                        Thank you.  For not being an 
                        asshole also. 

           Charlie moves toward the elevator.

                                 CLERK (cont’d)
                        You have no bags, not-asshole?

           Charlie’s shoulders fall.  He remembers.

                                            FLASH TO:

           STREET BY OPERA HOUSE

           Charlie’s BAG sits in the back seat of Gabi’s Trabant.

           INT. TOP FLOOR - HOSTEL - NIGHT

           Charlie steps out of the tiny elevator.  He checks his key, 
           finds his room.  He knocks.  The door opens.  It’s a SMALL GUY 
           with a MAPLE LEAF on his sweatshirt.  His name’s LUC.

                                 LUC
                        What’s up, bro.  Come on in.

           INSIDE

           Charlie enters.  There is a LANKY GUY in a BLACK SUIT reclining 
           on a bunk.  This is KARL.  He’s German.

                                 KARL
                        Hi, man.  Welcome.  Your bed is 
                        that one.  I am Karl.  That’s Luc.  
                        He’s Canadian. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Charlie.  Good to meet you guys.
                                 LUC
                        Just get here, Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, today.  

                                 LUC
                        It’s awesome, right?  The people?  
                        With their hugeness of spirit and 
                        everything?

                                 KARL
                        What you are hearing, Charlie?  
                        It’s what a Canadian sounds like.  
                        All day and night.  
                    (offering)
                        Crisps?

           Charlie takes some chips and sits heavily on his bed. 

                                 LUC
                        We were going to get some beers, 
                        maybe do some E.  You up for it?

           Charlie looks at Karl, who shrugs.

                                 KARL
                        It is only this aspect of a 
                        Canadian which makes him tolerable, 
                        in my opinion.

           INT. BASEMENT PUB - HOSTEL - NIGHT

           Karl and Charlie sit at a table in the cave-like space. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Karl, the suit.  That’s your thing?

                                 KARL
                        I have a very important meeting 
                        this week. 

           Luc approaches with three giant GLASSES OF BEER and sets them 
           down.  Charlie grabs his and begins chugging.  

                                 LUC
                        Charlie, did Karl tell you he’s 
                        auditioning to become a porn actor?

                                 KARL
                        Porn star.  We don’t say porn actor.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’ve done this before, Karl? 
                                 KARL
                        Many times.  Never on film, but I 
                        am often told I have the 
                        appropriate anatomical make-up.

                                 LUC
                        I told him myself.  When I saw it 
                        up in the room.  

                                 KARL
                        Accidentally. 

                                 LUC
                        Yeah, obviously, accidentally.  
                        What about you, Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s okay, I guess.  Not freakish 
                        or anything. 

                                 LUC
                        No, what brings you to Budapest?  

           Charlie takes a deep drink.  He seems drunk already.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m really supposed to be in 
                        Bucharest but this guy Istvan died 
                        next to me on the plane and then I 
                        got arrested trying to give his 
                        daughter a gift he brought home for 
                        her and it turns out she might be 
                        the coolest most beautiful woman I 
                        have ever seen anywhere.  In person, 
                        on TV, the internet -- anywhere.  
                        Her name is Gabi.  Gabriella.  She 
                        plays cello.  Your heart stops just 
                        looking at her and your ears and 
                        stomach go warm when she talks.  
                        I’ve never chosen before.  I’ve got 
                        so much fear.  But her, I’d choose.  
                        I do choose.  Her.  

                    LUC
                                         KARL
           Sounds magical.
                                 Describe her titties.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        But it’s complicated.  Not only did 
                        her father die today, there’s this 
                        soldier of fortune ex-husband who 
                        looks like he could chase down a 
                        lion, fuck it, eat it, do basically 
                        whatever he wanted to it.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Anyway, I feel like I think I 
                        already love her.  Which is fucked, 
                        I know.

           Karl shoots Luc a questioning look.  Luc smiles and shrugs.

                                 KARL 
                        Charlie, how do you feel at this 
                        time?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Strong.  Alive.  I feel brand new 
                        in the world.  I want to find her.  
                        Posses her, even.  Tell her that I 
                        feel what she feels, that I can see 
                        what she sees.  You know, inside?

           Luc giggles.  

                                 KARL
                        You should be made aware, Charlie, 
                        that Luc put ecstasy in your beer.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        He did?  You did?

                                 LUC
                        It’s okay, bro.  Mine and Karl’s 
                        are laced too.  You’re not alone. 
                        We’re all in a zone of mutuality.  

           Charlie looks around.  EVERYONE IN THE BAR IS NAKED.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is everyone in here naked right now?

                                 LUC
                        If we want them to be.  Your 
                        experience is your own, but we’re 
                        sharing the zone of mutuality.  We 
                        vote on any shared hallucinations.  
                        Who among us would like everyone in 
                        here to be naked right now?

           Charlie and Karl raise their hands.  So does Luc.  

                                 LUC (cont’d)
                        Sweet.  

           LATER

           Charlie waits at the bar, smiling at the NAKED bartenders -- 
           one buff GUY, one tattooed GIRL.  The guy brings three beers.
                                 CHARLIE
                        You look good, man.  What you’re 
                        doing?  Seriously, keep doing it.   
                    (to the GIRL)
                        Check you out, all tatted up.  
                        What’s that one...the Jolly Roger!  
                        Aarggh and avast, ye maties!  Bring 
                        me that horizon!

           Charlie takes the beers.  Then he sings.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Johnny Depp.  Lives in France.  Not 
                        the type.  FOR UNDERPANTS!  

           Luc and Karl are laughing.  Charlie delivers the beers.  
           Suddenly, he hears the SOUND OF A CHOIR.  He turns toward the 
           door.  WHITE LIGHT IS STREAMING IN.  And GABI is there.  

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Is she real?  Is she in the zone of 
                        mutuality?   

           Charlie stands.  Gabi sees him.  She smiles.  He smiles.  

                                 LUC
                        Wait.  Does her being real make her 
                        not in the zone?  Or is she in the 
                        zone due to her not being real?  
                        Damn.  I should know this.

                                 KARL
                        Can we vote her clothes off?

           Charlie weightlessly BOUNDS ACROSS TABLE-TOPS, SOARING OVER 
           PEOPLE to reach her.  She doesn’t notice because really it’s 
           just the drugs.  She’s got Charlie’s BAG. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I said I like the tuba.  Which isn’t 
                        even true.  I love you.  Which makes 
                        me gay how exactly?

                                 GABI
                        Excuse me? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What did I say?

                                 GABI
                        What is wrong with you?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s go on a walk.  With food as 
                        our secondary objective.  Romance 
                        being the primary.

                                 GABI
                        You are on drugs?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Agreed.  See that little-ish 
                        Canadian person with the well-
                        dressed German fellow?  He put 
                        ecstasy in my beer.  Not in a mean 
                        way.  I think he’s a good person.  
                        A Canadian person.  We’re in a zone 
                        of mutuality.  Oh my god, your 
                        father died.  I am so sorry.  
                        Istvan.  Remember how your tear 
                        landed in my hand?  That means 
                        something.  Everything.  I know it.

                                 GABI
                        You are hungry?  Perhaps more so 
                        after all this talking?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes, Gabi.  Gabi.  I am hungry.  
                        Hungry in Hungary.  How many times 
                        has that been said?  More than a 
                        million, I bet.  At least.

                                 GABI
                        Can you walk, Charlie? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes.  Gabi.  Gabi.  Yes.  

           Charlie smiles back at Luc and Karl as he goes.  They offer 
           him a very emotional thumbs-up.

                                 LUC
                        No zone of mutuality is forever.  
                        Go on, Charlie.  Live.

                                 KARL 
                        Live, you beautiful bastard.

           EXT. RÁKÓCZI ÚT - NIGHT

           Gabi and Charlie stroll along the half-beautiful, half-tacky 
           commercial thoroughfare.  Buses and cars stream by despite 
           the late hour, and the sidewalks still conduct people.  
                                 GABI
                        What would you like to eat?  There 
                        is Taco Bell/Pizza Hut Express.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So Nigel.  He seems nice.

                                 GABI
                        He is not.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        He gave you a gun.

                                 GABI
                        Why do you think I carry the gun, 
                        Charlie?  Every day for eight 
                        years?  To protect me from fucking 
                        Nigel if he ever came back. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        He wouldn’t hurt you.  No one 
                        could.  I can see that so clearly.

                                 GABI
                        You would like to see what he gave 
                        me for my twenty-first birthday?

           She pulls her shirt up, revealing CIGARETTE BURNS scarred 
           around her belly-button in the shape of a HEART.  Charlie 
           touches it, almost moved to tears, and a little turned on.

                                 GABI (cont’d)
                        It took a while.  Seven cigarettes 
                        is what I counted.  He had to chase 
                        me a couple of times.  Also, the 
                        neighbors interrupted when they 
                        came to see about the screaming.  
                        You know why he gave this to me?
                    (Charlie gulps)
                        Because I invited my friend Eszter 
                        to dinner for my birthday.  Oops.  
                        Nigel has some trouble with sharing.  

           A BUS goes by.  The AD on its side catches Charlie’s eye.  It  
           shows CHARLIE, DRESSED IN TUX, LIGHTING A CIGARETTE FOR GABI.  
           It’s the drugs again.  Charlie shakes it off.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why is he back here?

                                 GABI
                        Whenever he comes or goes, it’s 
                        because of some kind of trouble.  
                        He is running to or from something.
           Gabi SCREAMS in frustration.  ALL THE LIGHTS EVERYWHERE GO 
           OUT.  Charlie gasps, the sight of her face in the moonlight.

                                 CHARLIE
                        God damn.

                                 GABI 
                        What am I supposed to do?  I’ve got 
                        to bury my father, you know?  

           A single NEON SIGN SNAPS BACK ON.  It says KISS HER.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        No way.  Too soon.

           Gabi looks at him.  All the lights COME BACK ON.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        No way, too soon...to be worried.  
                        It will be okay.  I can help you.

                                 GABI
                        You are a tourist on drugs, 
                        Charlie.  I never thought I’d say 
                        this to another human, but you 
                        should go to Bucharest.

           They walk on for a while.  Then Charlie sees a BILLBOARD: 
           it’s GABI, WEARING AN APRON, WAGGING HER FINGER AT A LITTLE 
           BOY WHO IS COVERED IN SPAGHETTI -- CHARLIE.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Can I say something to you, Gabi?  
                        Not about Nigel because he freaks 
                        my shit out, but about the other 
                        stuff, your father and all.

                                 GABI
                        If you must.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I understand.

                                 GABI
                        Yes?

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s all. 

                                 GABI
                        What do you understand?

                                 CHARLIE
                        It.
                                 GABI
                        Fine.  It.  Maybe you will explain 
                        it to me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        There is no explanation.  It is 
                        just hard.  You know?  To lose 
                        someone who is your home.  Your 
                        only home in the world.  You think, 
                        Jesus Fucking Christ, I’m all alone 
                        now.  How did it come to this?  I 
                        should have had a back-up home.  
                        Some other person or place or thing 
                        to go to, to feel safe.  But I 
                        don’t.  Now I’m lost.  

           Gabi is crying.  

                                 GABI
                        “Now I’m lost.”  The end?  You 
                        cannot do better than this?

           Charlie looks around for a sign on the SIGNS.  He sees none, 
           just regular ads selling crap products, crap lifestyles.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        That’s it, as I understand it.  At 
                        this point.  It’s a process.

                                 GABI
                        This is the thinking of a child.  
                        Now I am not lost.  Now I am angry.  
                        My father died alone on an 
                        airplane.  His body was thrown onto 
                        my car in traffic.  I am too angry 
                        to feel lost.  All I feel is angry.
                    (then)
                        There is KFC.  I want KFC. 

           INT. KFC - NIGHT

           Charlie and Gabi eat. 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Can I say something else?  It kind 
                        of just came to me.  Regarding 
                        being angry but not lost?

                                 GABI
                        Úristen.  Why not?

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re going to need a different 
                        memory.
                                 GABI
                        My memory is fine.  Nine times 
                        seven is sixty three.  The capital 
                        of Ethiopia is Addis Ababa.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Of your father.  You can’t have a bad 
                        memory.  You’ll be stuck with it.
                    (off her dubious look)
                        What’s the one you have?  First 
                        thing you think of?

                                            FLASH TO:

           EXT. M1 HIGHWAY - DAY

           Istvan’s BODY bounces across the hood of Gabi’s car.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Her look of horror.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You need to change it.  

                                 GABI
                        How?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Think of something else.  

           She tries.  

                                            FLASH TO:

           EXT. M1 HIGHWAY - DAY

           Istvan’s BODY bounces across the hood of Gabi’s car.

           BACK TO KFC

                                 GABI
                        Still there.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s hard.  Try though.  

           She tries again.

                                         FLASH THROUGH:
           A SERIES OF IMAGES

           - Young Istvan dances with Gabi’s MOM in pool of light.  
           Little Gabi watching from the doorway.

           - Istvan drinks Unicum, a disgusting and powerful Hungarian 
           liquor, with four musician friends.

           - Istvan conducts an orchestra, his hair high and wild.

           - Istvan watches the Cubs on WGN, TV Superstation.

           - Istvan, in a crowd, watches teenage Gabi play solo cello.

           - Istvan gets on a plane to Chicago, wearing a Cubs hat.

           BACK TO KFC

           Tears fill Gabi’s eyes.  

                                 GABI
                        So many.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Pick one.  One good enough to keep 
                        the bad one unstuck.

           Gabi thinks.

                                            FLASH TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Istvan sits in the BUBBLE BATH.  He’s got his eyes closed.  
           He’s humming loudly, maniacally wielding an ORCHESTRA BATON.

           BACK TO KFC

           Gabi laughs.  So does Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Good?

                                 GABI
                        Yes.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        See?

                                 GABI
                        The wisdom of a child.  Thank you, 
                        Charlie.  

           Charlie beams, but Gabi’s face falls.
                                 CHARLIE
                        What?

                                 GABI 
                        Now I am lost.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah.  It’s a process.

                                 GABI
                        Tell me I need to go to fucking 
                        Bucharest, I will hit you.

           Charlie laughs.

           EXT. RÁKÓCZI ÚT - NIGHT

           Gabi and Charlie walk.

                                 GABI
                        It is late.  I should go home.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You don’t want to walk?  I see a 
                        river.  We could walk alongside it.  
                        With the moonlight and everything.

                                 GABI
                        I’m sorry, Charlie.  Like they say, 
                        another time, another place.  Right?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Not right.  Who is they?  It’s this 
                        time, this place.  All of this, it 
                        means something.  To us.

                                 GABI
                        Us.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Two letters, the whole world.  All of 
                        the past and future inside them like 
                        an oyster you could live in forever.  
                        How crazy is that?  Us, a pearl.

                                 GABI
                        Oh, Charlie.  God bless ecstasy.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        God bless us, Gabi.  God bless us, 
                        every one.

           She touches his cheek.  
                                 GABI 
                        You are a sweet boy, Tiny Tim. 
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Find me tomorrow and if I am not 
                        crying I will kiss you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wait.  What?  That sounded good.  

           She leaves.  

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        What did you say?  Gabi?!  

           She’s gone.  Charlie stares where she was.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        How can one feel so full, dahlinge, 
                        yet be so empty?  What can one do in 
                        the face of such exquisite suffering?

                                 CHARLIE 
                        GABI!!

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        One can scream.  One can run.

           Charlie turns and RUNS.  As fast as he can.  To nowhere at 
           all.  The people, the lights, the world -- all lost in a 
           BLUR.  Like in Star Trek when they go warp speed.

           Until...SMASH!  Charlie is HIT BY A TAXI.  He THWACKS onto 
           the hood, FLIES for a bit, then SLAMS onto the sidewalk.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        Or, one can fill the void with a 
                        pain of another sort.  Ouch.

           Charlie is dazed, tangled in a pile of himself.  People stand 
           over him.  A MAN leans in.  It’s the TAXI DRIVER from earlier.

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        I know this guy.  

           He slaps Charlie.

                                 TAXI DRIVER (cont’d)
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Hey, Hubble.  Why are you running 
                        into the street?  This is part of 
                        your love story?  You fucking moron?

           Charlie recognizes the driver.  He sings.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Misty water-colored memories.

           The driver picks him up.

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        You are fine.  I will take you to 
                        the youth hostel.  Okay?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m fine.  Take me to the youth 
                        hostel.  Okay?

           INT. HOSTEL ROOM - DAY

           Charlie sleeps.  Blood has soaked his pillow.  He stirs 
           awake.  Luc is there writing in his JOURNAL.

                                 LUC
                        Glad you’re awake, bro.  I was 
                        worried you were lying there dead 
                        in a pool of your own blood.

           Charlie creaks up.  He winces in pain.

                                 LUC (cont’d)
                        I was just writing a speculative 
                        narrative about what might have 
                        happened to you in my journal.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I got hit by a taxi.

                                 LUC
                        Hmm.  No elves or daemons involved?  
                        No lady werewolves?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nah.  

                                 LUC
                        I was way off.

           Charlie goes to the sink and runs his head under water.

                                 LUC (cont’d)
                        Grab a vicodin from my bag.  

           Charlie looks in the BAG.  It’s full of drugs.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        They let you travel with this?
                                 LUC
                        I’m Canadian.  Try a B-12 patch.  

           Luc gets up, making to leave.

                                 LUC (cont’d)
                        I’m meeting Karl.  He had his 
                        interview.  Come with, bro.   He 
                        said I could smell his finger.  

           INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT - DAY

           Charlie and Luc enter.  They see Karl sitting in a booth, 
           looking distressed.  They join him.

                                 LUC
                        How’d it go?  Do I know an actual 
                        porn star now?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        You don’t look so good, Karl.

           Karl begins to cry.  

                                 LUC
                        Hey, easy.  What’s wrong, bro?

                                 KARL
                        He won’t go down.

                                 LUC
                        Who won’t go down?

                                 KARL
                        Karl Jr.  He is staying up.

           Karl stands.  A BIG ERECTION tents his suit pants.  He sits.

                                 KARL (cont’d)
                        Five hours and counting!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yikes.

                                 LUC
                        How many viagras did you take?

                                 KARL
                        Four?

                                 LUC
                        One, Karl!  I said take one!  Damn 
                        it!
                                 KARL 
                        I could not even do my interview 
                        scene.  I mean, I did it.  And then 
                        did it, and did it more.  That’s 
                        not what they want, you know?

                                 LUC
                        Of course not.  The money shot is  
                        the whole point.  I said take one! 

                                 KARL
                        My head has no blood left in it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Maybe try some ice?

                                 KARL
                        I did, Charlie.  My balls merely 
                        went from blue to purple.  

           They think, options and such.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It feels weird, us sitting here.  
                        Karl being like he is.

                                 LUC
                        I feel so helpless.   

                                 KARL
                        We must go to a titty bar.  Only 
                        there will I be less conspicuous.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I was thinking hospital, but a 
                        titty bar’s good.

           EXT. CLUB DOLCE VITA - DAY

           Charlie, Luc and Karl climb down some stairs.  A TRACKSUITED 
           BOUNCER stops Karl and his bulge.

                                 BOUNCER
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        He can’t bring that in here.

                                 CHARLIE
                        He has incurable penis cancer.  His 
                        dying wish is for one last lap dance.

                                 LUC
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        He has penis cancer.  Have a heart.
           INSIDE - AT A TABLE

           It’s nighttime-like.  Girl on a pole.  A bar.  Your basic 
           strip-club.  The GUYS drink beers.   

                                 CHARLIE
                        You speak Hungarian, Luc?

                                 LUC
                        Sure, Charlie.  Being Canadian, I 
                        don’t only speak one language.  I 
                        also don’t invade sovereign nations 
                        to guarantee the sustenance of my 
                        ravenous military industrial complex.  

                                 KARL
                        Luc, please, this Canadian bullshit.  
                        My balls cannot take it right now.

                                 LUC
                        You’re right, bro.  We’re having a 
                        nice afternoon.  I shouldn’t 
                        politicize it.  My grandparents are 
                        Hungarian, Charlie.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        How do you say I love you?

                                 LUC
                        I like to send flowers.

                                 KARL
                        I prefer voluntary and spontaneous 
                        cunnilingus.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        How do you say it in Hungarian?

                                 LUC
                        Szeretlek.

                                 LUC
                        If you really love this person, you 
                        can say imádlak.  “I love you too 
                        much.”

                                 CHARLIE
                        Eemahdlok.  Eemahdlok.
                                 KARL
                        Look at us!  In the middle of pussy 
                        town talking about the military 
                        industrial complex and “I love you 
                        too much, baby”!  To hell with it.  
                        I’m getting a lap dance.

           He gets up.  He winces.  Still a big BULGE in his pants.  

           LATER

           Charlie and Luc are drunk.  Karl is getting his lap dance.  
           The dancer is sweating, looking tired and annoyed.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        She’s a champ.  He should marry her.

                                 LUC 
                        I’m worried about the bill.  I hear 
                        these places try to scam you.  
                        Secret charges and shit like that.

           A TITS-OUT WAITRESS delivers some beers.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ask her.  

                                 LUC
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Pardon me, miss.  Have we incurred 
                        any secret charges on our bill?

                                 TITS-OUT WAITRESS
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        You are fine, cutie.

                                 LUC
                        She said I’m cute.

           Charlie is dubious.

                                 LUC (cont’d)
                        Are you on TV, Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                        People used to say I look like 
                        Chandler.  I’m like, who the fuck is 
                        Chandler?

           Luc points to the bar.  A TV silently plays the news.  It’s a 
           report showing SECURITY FOOTAGE OF CHARLIE HOLDING A GUN IN 
           THE GAS STATION GUY’S FACE.
                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Fuck me.

           Karl watches from behind his dancer.

                                 KARL
                        Hey, Charlie?  Is that you, man?  

                                 LUC
                        It is him!  What did you do, bro?

                                 CHARLIE
                        That guy was a dick, totally 
                        unhelpful and rude.

                                 LUC
                        Did you kill him?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes, I killed him.  Can you tell 
                        what it’s saying, besides that?

                                 LUC
                    (off GRAPHICS)
                        “American terrorizes clerk for not 
                        speaking English.”

                                 CHARLIE
                        He spoke perfect fucking English!  

                                 LUC
                        They don’t seem to have your name.  
                        I think you’ll need a disguise.  

           Charlie snatches Luc’s MAPLE LEAF HAT, and puts it on.

                                 LUC (cont’d)
                        Good thinking.  A Canadian would 
                        never try to kill someone for not 
                        speaking English.

                                 CHARLIE
                        He fucking spoke English, Luc!

           Suddenly, Karl begins to MOAN.  The Dancer jumps off him.  
           Karl closes his eyes and convulses with great violence.  

                                 DANCER
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        The German pig came in his pants.
                                 ANOTHER DANCER
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Good work, honey.  Don’t forget to 
                        put it on his bill.

           Karl gets up smiling.  He adjusts himself.  Greatly relieved.

                                 KARL
                        Charlie, you are on the run from 
                        Johhny Law?  How cool are you, man?  
                        Fucking Belmondo in the hizzy!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t you need to clean yourself?

                                 KARL
                        Never mind.  I believe most of my 
                        ejaculate stayed in my scrotum.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s go.  I need to see someone 
                        again before I get arrested.

           He signals the waitress.  She brings the bill.  Luc checks 
           it.  His face becomes ashen.  Charlie looks.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Six hundred fifteen thousand.  
                        That’s what, a hundred bucks.

           Karl grabs the bill.  He is ashen too.  He calculates.

                                 KARL
                        Three thousand, what...

                                 LUC
                        Three thousand ten.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Three thousand ten what?

                                 LUC
                        Dollars.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        American dollars?

           They look sick.  Charlie gets up and goes to the waitress.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Excuse me, there’s a mistake.  This 
                        is three grand.  It seems high.  
                                 WAITRESS
                        The German had twenty two private 
                        dances.  He also, how do you say, 
                        shot a load.  This is very expensive.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How much is it exactly?  Show me 
                        “shoot a load” on the menu.  

                                 WAITRESS
                        You would like to talk to the 
                        manager?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Phase two.  Let’s get to it.

                                 WAITRESS
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Boss!  You’re on!

           A MUSCLED SERBIAN GUY in a tracksuit and no shirt comes out.  
           He’s got a TATOO OF LENIN on his neck.  

                                 DARKO
                        Hallo, I am Darko.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Come on.  Really? 

                                 DARKO
                        Really.  There is a problem?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, Darko.  This bill is wrong.  
                        We had some beers and my friend got 
                        a few dances.  

           Darko takes the bill.  He looks it over.

                                 DARKO
                        I see.  Yes.  This is correct.  Due 
                        to your friend...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shooting his load.  Fucking 
                        ridiculous.  

                                 DARKO 
                        Not to mention disgusting.  

           Charlie looks to the exit.  The BOUNCER is now there, along 
           with another TRACKSUIT SERB.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        We don’t have that kind of money.  
                        So what now?

                                 DARKO 
                        Come to my office.  Perhaps we can 
                        make an agreement.

           INT. CLUB OFFICE - DAY

           Darko sits behind a desk.  Charlie, Luc and Karl are on a 
           couch.  The thugs fill the doorway.  Two PIT BULLS sleep on the 
           floor.  There are PICTURES all over the walls -- strippers and 
           their round tits, gangsters and their Euro-crap Mercedeses.   

                                 DARKO
                        Okay.  I need this money.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s make an agreement, then.  

                                 DARKO
                        Okay.  You pay me this money, I 
                        don’t fuck you up.  Agreed?

                                 KARL
                        Hey, Dorko, he told you, we do not 
                        have this kind of money.

                                 DARKO
                        Darko.  Perhaps I should stick this 
                        pen into your asshole and write my 
                        name inside so you remember it.

           Charlie laughs.

                                 DARKO (cont’d)
                        Something is funny?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Darko, come on.  You’re talking 
                        about autographing the inside of 
                        someone’s asshole.  It’s funny.  

                                 KARL
                        It would not even help me remember.  
                        Who can read inside his asshole?

                                 DARKO
                        A guy who’s head is cut off and 
                        stuck up inside it.  Okay?
                    (Karl wonders)
                        Listen to me.  Everything I say in 
                        here?  It is all possible.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Can I go ahead and say what we’re 
                        all thinking, Darko?
                    (timing being all)
                        If you cut off his head and stuck 
                        it up his ass, he’d be dead.  You 
                        can’t read if you’re dead.

           Luc and Karl laugh.  Darko EXPLODES, jumping up, swiping the 
           shit off his desk.  The DOGS wake up, and BARK and SNARL.

                                 DARKO
                        This is not play time, little 
                        bitches!  You owe me fucking money!

                                 LUC
                        Is anyone else’s vicodin wearing 
                        off?  It’s time to call the police--

           The BOUNCER snatches Luc’s PHONE and smashes it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Whoa!  Take it easy!  
                    (to Darko)
                        Listen.  We’re staying at the youth 
                        hostel.  We have friends there.  
                        Meaning you can’t fuck us up without 
                        making trouble for yourself.  Okay?  
                        So let’s just come up with a number 
                        we’re all willing to--

           Something Charlie’s seen stops him.  Something on the wall.  

                                 DARKO
                        What is wrong, mister talk a lot?  
                        You have seen a ghost or something?

           Darko turns to where Charlie is looking.  

           It’s a PICTURE OF DARKO dressed in the FATIGUES of the ARMY 
           OF REPUBLIKA SRPSKA.  Next to him, NIGEL.  They’re smiling, 
           displaying the MATCHING SCORPION TATTOOS on their arms.  
           Darko takes the picture from the wall.

                                 DARKO (cont’d)
                        Something in this photo is making 
                        you stop talking a lot?  
                    (nothing from Charlie)
                        Do you know this man who I am with?  
                        Because how you look is how people 
                        who know this man look when they 
                        see him.  He is this kind of man.
                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t know him.

           Darko smiles and takes down another PICTURE.  It is of GABI.  
           IN A G-STRING, STRIPPING.  Charlie nearly pukes. 

                                 DARKO 
                        You know her?  By your face now it 
                        looks like maybe you do.

                                 KARL
                        Is that the girl from--

           Charlie backhands Karl in his tender balls.  He squeals.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        The Opera.  We saw her playing.  
                        Thought she was hot is all.

           Darko stares at Charlie, searching his face.  

                                 DARKO
                        You seem to know this man, my 
                        friend.  I would very much like to 
                        know how you know him.  
                    (Charlie’s mind reels)
                        Okay, tell me this.  Was it 
                        recently that you came to know him?  
                        It would be very good for me to 
                        know if this man is in Budapest.

           Charlie tries to focus, tries to process.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        What if I did?  Would that affect 
                        our situation with you?

                                 DARKO
                        Perhaps.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        We need more than perhaps.  

                                 DARKO
                        Stay within yourself now.  It would 
                        be nothing for me to take you and 
                        your friends to my cousin’s 
                        restaurant and put your faces into 
                        the frying machine where he makes 
                        his pork rinds.  

                                 LUC
                        He’s very creative with this stuff.
                                 DARKO
                    (to Charlie)
                        Tell me about you and this man.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        His name is Nigel.  

                                 DARKO
                        Correct.  Nigel is in Budapest?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Perhaps.  Or perhaps I met him in 
                        the shit in Monrovia.  I get around.

                                 DARKO
                        Okay, my friend.  Tell me where he 
                        is and your bill, your friend’s 
                        load shooting, it is on the house. 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        I’ll need to call you.  After we 
                        leave here.

                                 DARKO
                        Yes?  So easy for you?  Maybe you 
                        are new to this type of negotiation.

                                 CHARLIE
                        First time.  But I smell desperation 
                        coming from inside your ugly as fuck 
                        tracksuit.  Okay?  Something tells 
                        me knowing where Nigel is is worth 
                        way more to you than any of this 
                        bullshit.  I will call you.  After 
                        we leave here.

                                 DARKO 
                        You are right, mister first time.  
                        I do not care so much about load 
                        shooting now.  What this means is I 
                        am no longer fucking around with 
                        you.  You will call me.  If not, I 
                        will cook your nice American face 
                        into a pork rind.  Which I will 
                        then feed to my dogs.  I promise 
                        you this.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Charlie, Karl and Luc walk away.  Karl and Luc buzz on 
           adrenaline.  Charlie is sick to his stomach.
                                 LUC
                        Can I just say something?  Charlie?  
                        You were frigging awesome! 

                                 KARL
                        Very Charles Bronson, Charlie.  

           Charlie turns down a different street.  

                                 KARL (cont’d)
                        Hey, Charlie?  Where are you going?

           Charlie waves absently and is gone. 

                                 KARL (cont’d)
                        What’s his problem?

                                 LUC
                        Karl, bro, he just found out the 
                        girl he loves was a skank stripper.  

                                 KARL
                        Oh, poor guy.  I play the world’s 
                        smallest piano for him.

           He mimes playing the world’s smallest piano.

           EXT. OPERA HOUSE - DAY

           Charlie climbs the stairs.  In the window he sees a SIGN 
           announcing the death of BANYAI ISTVAN.  Charlie smiles at the 
           high-haired PICTURE.  He tries to puzzle out the sign.  
           Suddenly, the door opens.  A couple of people come out, 
           followed by BÉLA, dressed in a suit, wearing a SILK SCARF. 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Béla, hi.  You’re going to the 
                        thing?  What is it?  A memorial?  

           Béla pushes past him.  Charlie follows.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Wait up.  I want to...

           Charlie grabs his arm.  Béla loses his shit.

                                 BÉLA 
                        DO NOT TOUCH ME, SIR!

                                 CHARLIE
                        What’s with you and the yelling, man?  
                        I just want to know where it is.

           Béla keeps walking.  
                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Fine.  Walk on, ass.  Just know I’m 
                        on your...ass.

           Charlie follows.  Béla keeps walking.  Until he gets to a 
           car.  He opens the door.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Shit.  Come on.  Let me come with 
                        you.  I want to pay my respects.

                                 BÉLA
                        HORSEDICK!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Excuse me?

                                 BÉLA
                        You heard me, sir.  What you are 
                        saying is horsedick.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        You mean bullshit?

                                 BÉLA
                        In Hungarian, horsedick!
                    (Charlie: hmm)
                        Leave Gabriella be.  It is obvious 
                        you merely want do sex with her, 
                        with your swimmer’s body.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        My what? 

           Béla climbs in his car.  He lowers the window.

                                 BÉLA 
                        Leave her be, sir.  She has had 
                        enough pain from handsome rogues 
                        such as yourself.  

           Charlie focusses on Béla’s scarf.  Then he notes his 
           manicured NAILS.  And a CHRISTINA AGUILERA CD on the seat.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re gay!

                                 BÉLA
                        I beg you, sir, LEAVE HER BE!

           Béla pulls away.  Charlie runs after the car.  He’s flying 
           down the street.  He gains the car.  And runs alongside it.
                                 CHARLIE 
                        You’re gay, Béla.  I can see that 
                        now.  You must love Gabi in a 
                        protective yet competitive way.  
                        That’s cool.  The fag-hag dynamic 
                        can be great.  But I’m not a rogue.  
                        Thank you for saying so.  I don’t 
                        swim either.  But I do like Gabi.    
                    (still running, btw)
                        I like her in a selfless, aching, 
                        soul-stirring way.  I guess it’s 
                        more than like.  More of a 
                        supernova in my fucking chest.  
                        Granted, I’m dealing with the 
                        stripper issue as we speak, but I’m 
                        not backing down.  No, Béla.  She 
                        gave wings to these feet.  I’m not-- 

           THWACK.  CHARLIE DISAPPEARS.  An OPEN CAR DOOR has knocked 
           him on his ass.  He’s in the street, moaning, writhing.  Béla 
           backs his car up.  He opens the door.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        The streets of Budapest hate me.

                                 BÉLA
                        Get in.  I am late.
                    (Charlie: huh?)
                        GET IN THE GOD DAMN CAR, PLEASE!

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - COURTYARD - DAY

           Charlie limps after Béla through an old baroque building’s 
           covered driveway, then into a beautiful courtyard.  

           SIX FLOORS UP

           They reach a landing overlooking the courtyard.  Charlie’s in 
           pain and out of breath.  Istvan walks to an apartment.  

           INSIDE

           A party underway.  BOHEMIANS old and young drink, smoke and 
           argue.  Charlie follows Béla through the crowd.  A BAND can 
           be heard -- a convulsive beat, percussion and chanting.   

           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           Charlie enters the ballroom-sized space.  The band is a bunch 
           of COOL DUDES banging on shit and speaking in tongues.  A 
           SLIDE SHOW is projected onto the wall -- it’s playing images 
           of ISTVAN’S LIFE -- teaching, drinking, laughing.
           And off in a corner he sees her...GABI.  Glass of wine, eyes 
           closed, swaying to the music.  Charlie smiles.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        See his face, ladies and gentlemen, 
                        how it explodes into a smile?  This 
                        is not really what love is.  Love is 
                        more than loving beauty, dahlinge, 
                        so much more than loving nice 
                        boobies and sweet laughter.

           Charlie watches her.  She’s lost in the sounds.  Suddenly...

                                            FLASH TO:

           GABI IN A G-STRING

           Disco light spins on the walls as Gabi undulates on a POLE.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        Love is loving everything your 
                        beloved has every been, and all she 
                        ever will be.  

           Gabi opens her eyes.  She stops dancing.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        All and everything, dahinge.  Love 
                        is loving all and everything.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Charlie waves at Gabi.  And her face does something 
           surprising -- it EXPLODES INTO A SMILE of its own.

           Now she’s coming to him.  Smiling, smiling, smiling.  She 
           takes a drink of WINE.  Charlie’s eyes brim with tears.

                                 CHARLIE
                        God damn.

           A TEARDROP rolls down Charlie’s cheek.  Gabi is there.  SHE 
           CATCHES IT.  Gabi raises her hand to him.  He raises his, the 
           one he caught her tear in.  They press their palms together.  

                                 GABI
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        I am going to kiss you now.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?
           She eases into him, like he’s the other half of a thing she 
           once was, a thing perfect and complete, a thing that became 
           nothing when it was divided in two by the bullshit world.  

           THEY KISS.  Then she breathes into his ear.

                                 GABI 
                        Say my name, Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Gabi.  Gabi.  Fucking Gabi.

                                 GABI
                        Two letters, the whole world inside 
                        them.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Us.

                                 GABI
                        A pearl. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you drunk?

                                 GABI
                        Yes.  A little bit.  Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay.  Gabi.

           They pull back.  A little awkward.  

           AT THE DRINKS TABLE

                                 GABI 
                        How did you find me?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Béla.

                                 GABI
                        I am surprised.  He thinks he is my 
                        mother.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s common with them.

                                 GABI
                        He and Andi have been very good to 
                        me.  Through my years of shit.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Andi’s his boyfriend?
           Gabi nods.  Béla dances with a ELEGANT WOMAN in her forties.  

                                 GABI
                        Andrea.  His wife. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, I thought he was...

                                 GABI
                        Come on, Charlie.  A real man can’t 
                        love manicures and Mariah Carey?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Not Christina Aguilera?

                                 GABI
                        Sure, and Kylie Minogue too.  How 
                        he wept when she got the cancer.

           ELSEWHERE, Béla stops the band.  He goes to a SUPER-8 
           PROJECTOR.  He blows Gabi a kiss and presses play.

           ON VIDEO: ISTVAN’s in a sunlit room.  His cello rests between 
           his legs.  He’s talking to the camera.  (Dialogue is in 
           Hungarian, SUBTITLED throughout video.)

                                 ISTVAN ON SUPER-8
                        This is stupid.  Put it away.

           GABI’S VOICE is behind the camera:

                                 GABI’S VOICE
                        Don’t be shy, old man.  We must 
                        document your mastery for 
                        posterity.  You are an old man.  

                                 ISTVAN ON SUPER-8
                        Which should I do?  

                                 GABI’S VOICE
                        Glissando.

                                 ISTVAN ON SUPER-8
                        Glissando.  We play it like it 
                        sounds.  Glissando.  The pitch 
                        rising and falling smoothly, with 
                        no space, no separation.  Only 
                        variation of essence.

                                 GABI’S VOICE
                        Do it.
           Istvan draws his bow, sliding his finger up and down the 
           fingerboard without releasing the string, producing an 
           achingly beautiful sound.  

           Everyone in the room gasps and sighs.  Someone yells:

                                 SOMEONE
                        Bravo, Pishty!   

           Everyone concurs in cheers.  On video:

                                 GABI’S VOICE
                        Give us something juicy.  Something 
                        personal.  The real Banyai Istvan.  
                    (he waves her off)
                        Do it.

                                 ISTVAN ON SUPER-8
                        I’m an old man with no juice left.  
                        May I say something my father said?

                                 GABI’S VOICE
                        Depends.  Is it about the 
                        godforsaken Cubs?

           Everyone laughs.  Istvan laughs.

                                 ISTVAN ON SUPER-8
                        No.  It is a quote he would often 
                        say.  From Lenin.

                                 GABI’S VOICE
                        John, or Vladimir Ilyich?

                                 ISTVAN ON SUPER-8
                        Vladimir Ilyich, who killed twenty 
                        million of his own people.  Much 
                        worse than marrying Yoko, yes?
                    (Gabi’s voice LAUGHS)
                        Lenin said: I cannot listen to 
                        music too often.  It makes me want 
                        to do nice things. 
                    (then)
                        You understand this quote, Gabika?

                                 GABI’S VOICE 
                        Yes, daddy.  

                                 ISTVAN ON SUPER-8
                        I know you do.  My sweet girl.  

                                 GABI’S VOICE
                        I love you, daddy.
                                 ISTVAN ON SUPER-8
                        I love you.  Now put it away.  I 
                        would like to go pee.

           THE VIDEO ENDS.  Everyone cries.  They all look to Gabi.  She 
           musters a heartbroken smile.  Charlie looks into her eyes.  
           She sticks out her empty WINE GLASS.

           IN THE KITCHEN

           Charlie fills two glasses.  A COMMOTION sounds from the front 
           of the apartment.  Bohemians rush away to see what’s what. 

           AT THE FRONT DOOR

           BÉLA faces off against an unwanted visitor -- NIGEL.  

                                 BÉLA
                        GET THE FUCK OUT, YOU!

                                 NIGEL
                        Still screaming, Béla?  Still our 
                        old excessively bothersome self?

                                 BÉLA
                        You will not come in here, sir.  
                        This is a private function.

           In a flash, Nigel RABBIT PUNCHES Béla in the nose.  Béla 
           doubles over.  His nose is BLEEDING, expertly broken.

           Nigel moves into the apartment.  An ARTIST steps to him.  
           Nigel raises a KNIFE TO HIS EAR.

                                 NIGEL
                        Something to say, Van Gogh?  

           The artist thinks better of it.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gabi’s splashing water on her face.  

                                 NIGEL (O.S.)
                        Gabi!

           Gabi closes her eyes: fuck.

           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           Nigel’s looking for her.  Charlie steps in front of him.

                                 NIGEL
                        Hallo, Charlie.  Seen Gabi of late?
                                 CHARLIE
                        She doesn’t want you here.

                                 NIGEL
                        Charlie, I meant to ask you before -- 
                        can you do the Louis Armstrong bit 
                        with your cheeks?  When he goes all 
                        puffy-fish like?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        He played the trumpet, I think.  

                                 NIGEL
                        But you can do it, yeah?  Being the 
                        champion tubaist and cocksucker you 
                        are reputed to be?
                    (Charlie does nothing)
                        The present occasion’s a sorrowful 
                        one, Charlie.  I believe some relief 
                        in the form of funny face would be 
                        much appreciated by everyone here.

           Charlie stares.  Nigel sticks the KNIFE to Charlie’s throat.

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        Go on, Charlie.  Do the puffy-fish 
                        bit for us.

           Charlie does nothing.  FLICK.  He nicks Charlie’s neck with 
           the knife.  BLOOD drips down it.  Nigel cinches the blade.

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        Last chance for petrol, boy-o.

           Charlie’s got no choice.  He PUFFS OUT his cheeks.  

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        Jesus me, Charlie.  If that’s not 
                        the most woeful bit of puffy-
                        fishery I ever did see.  
                    (then)
                        It occurs to me, Charlie -- maybe 
                        you’re not a tubaist, and maybe 
                        you’re not even an actual faggot 
                        either.  Maybe the hard truth is 
                        you’ve got designs on my wife.  Can 
                        that be?  What do you think, Gabi?

           GABI’s in the doorway, her GUN raised. 

                                 GABI
                        I’m not your wife, Nigel. 
                                 NIGEL
                        The very gun I gave her, Charlie.  
                        The irony’s nothing short of fucking 
                        poetical.

           Nigel lowers the knife and turns around.  

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        My condolences for your loss, baby.  
                        Old Istvan was a right cunt to me, 
                        to be sure, but I won’t deny he was 
                        a fine enough gentleman.  A worthy 
                        adversary in the perilous battle for 
                        your affections.  

           Nigel takes ISTVAN’S MEMORIAL FLYER out of his pocket.  

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        To be honest, Gabi, I’m well 
                        heartbroken you didn’t mention it.  
                        Like I’m some sort of strang--

           BLAM!  Gabi’s fires!  The WALL behind Nigel EXPLODES.  PEOPLE 
           hit the floor.  Nigel doesn’t move.  He looks at his 
           SHIRTSLEEVE.  It’s got a SMOKY HOLE in it.  He smiles.

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        The ass of an angel, the brain of a 
                        man, the aim of Annie Oakley.  Ever 
                        the total package, my Gabi is.

                                 GABI
                        Leave, Nigel.  I will shoot your 
                        fucking face off.  You know I will.

                                 CHARLIE
                    (to Gabi)
                        You meant to do that?

                                 NIGEL
                        I taught her a whole hat-full of 
                        useful shit, Charlie.  Quite the 
                        eager beaver, she was.  Always a 
                        quick study.  I remember the first 
                        time she took it up the--

                                 GABI
                        Five seconds, Nigel.

                                 NIGEL
                        Counting down, baby?  Bit of a 
                        cliché, is it not?
                                 GABI
                        Five...

           All of the BOHEMIANS join in. 

                                 BOHEMIANS
                        ...four...

                                 NIGEL
                        Bloodthirsty bohemians.  How the 
                        thin veil of civilization does fall 
                        so readily away.  Fucking love it!

                                 GABI AND BOHEMIANS
                        ...three...

           Nigel squeezes Charlie’s cheek.

                                 NIGEL
                        We’ll get a funny face out of you 
                        yet, Charlie boy.  Mark it down.

           LATER

           Charlie and Gabi sit blank-faced on a couch.  Gabi’s got the 
           GUN on her leg.  The flat is empty.  Béla and Andrea clean up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So Nigel.  Again.  Wow.
                    (nothing)
                        And you.  With that gun!
                    (still nothing)
                        Wow.

                                 GABI
                        You would like the story?  Of how a 
                        nice girl like me fell in love with 
                        a psychopath like him?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I figure, you know, boy meets girl.  
                        Right?  Not like there’s a standard 
                        for it.  My first girlfriend was 
                        Lynn McDougall.  She was black.  
                        Not a very black name, but she was.  
                        I’m not sure how it’s relevant, but 
                        there you go.

                                 GABI
                        Obviously her ancestors were slaves 
                        and the owner was McDougall, yes?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hmm.  
                                 GABI
                        I met Nigel when I was seventeen. 

                                            FLASH TO:

           EXT. MUSIC SCHOOL - DAY

           A gaggle of teenage GIRLS smoking cigarettes.  They’ve got 
           various INSTRUMENT CASES at their feet.  Inhaling, coughing, 
           laughing.  By them walks a girl with a CELLO -- YOUNG GABI.

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        My life was music.  Nothing else.

           INT. PRACTICE ROOM - DAY

           Young Gabi is alone with her cello, lost in concentration.

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        I was in love with what I could do. 

           She stops, looking at her fingers.  They bleed.  She plays on.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Young Gabi at home.  Playing her cello.  

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        It was an obsession.  An addiction.  

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - DARK

           Istvan watches BRAVEHEART, grinning at the DISEMBOWELMENT.  

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        My father would try to introduce me 
                        to other things.

           Young Gabi is next to him with her eyes closed, her hands 
           miming playing the cello.

                                 GABI (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        But there was nothing else for me.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Istvan stands in the door yelling at Young Gabi.

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        He became a bit fed up. 
                                 ISTVAN
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        One more note and I kill myself!  
                        Go have some god damn fun!

           Istvan slams the door.  

           BACK TO GABI AND CHARLIE

                                 GABI 
                        Why do I need fun when I can make a 
                        sound that sounds like the breath 
                        of god?  With my own hands I can 
                        make myself and anyone else cry?
                    (then)
                        These are the things I would say.  
                        Being seventeen and ridiculous.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Makes sense to me.

                                 GABI
                        Because you are a child, as we have 
                        said.  Anyway...

           EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Young Gabi walks down some stairs into a basement.

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        ...in winter, I discovered a place 
                        to practice.  A secret place.

           IN A BOILER ROOM

           Gabi plays her cello in the glow of the furnace.  

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        Where no one could say, hey, 
                        fucking Gabi, you play too much!

           ANOTHER DAY

           Gabi plays. 

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        What I did not know was above my 
                        place, there was a small flat.

           WE RISE UP, like the sound, through the floor and we’re in...

           INT. SMALL FLAT - NIGHT

           Cramped and dingy.  A SEVERELY WOUNDED MAN lies on a bed.  
                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        In this flat -- broken into pieces 
                        by a bomb, hiding from criminals 
                        for things he had done as a soldier 
                        for hire Bosnia -- was Nigel.

           The music sounds, the man is still.  From the bandages around 
           his eyes, a TEAR falls.

           ANOTHER DAY 

           In the BOILER ROOM, Gabi plays.

           In the SMALL FLAT, Nigel sits on the bed, straining to raise 
           his arm even an inch.

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        He would listen to my playing as he 
                        struggled with his injuries.

           A SERIES OF SHOTS

           Moving from boiler room to flat...

           - Gabi plays.  Nigel removes the bandages from his head.

           - Gabi plays.  Nigel pulls himself across the floor, sweating 
           and straining to work his legs.

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        Every day he would hear me, every 
                        day he would become stronger.

           - Gabi plays.  Nigel stands.

           - Gabi plays.  Nigel does chin-ups.

           EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

           Gabi walks into the courtyard, heading for the stairs.  She 
           sees NIGEL waiting there.  

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        After many months, he approached me 
                        and told me I saved his life.  

           He smiles at her.  He’s not scary at all.  He begins talking.

                                 GABI (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        He said it is a universal rule that 
                        when someone saves your life, you 
                        are then responsible for that 
                        person forever.  
           Nigel gives Gabi a FLOWER.  She smiles.  He laughs.  

                                 GABI (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        He was the most beautiful man I had 
                        ever seen.  With his scars and his 
                        eyes.  Like some kind of animal.

           EXT. CHAIN BRIDGE - NIGHT

           Gabi and Nigel walk across the lovely span.  Gabi talks, 
           Nigel listens bemusedly. 

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        I had no idea who he was, what he 
                        did.  All I knew is he said my 
                        playing saved his life.  Which 
                        confirmed everything I believed 
                        about myself and my ability.  I 
                        could save a man’s life with my 
                        hands, with what was in my soul.

           BACK TO GABI AND CHARLIE

           Charlie’s looking at her.

                                 GABI
                        Do not look at me like that.  I 
                        told you, I was seventeen. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        And you married him?  

                                 GABI
                        Not then.  We were together for 
                        three years before we married.  

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Gabi pulls a METAL CASE from a closet.  She opens it.  The 
           bad-guy trifecta: GUNS, DRUGS and MONEY.  

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        Over time, I learned what he was, 
                        but it was too late -- I loved him.  

           Gabi picks up a small packet and examines it -- HEROIN.

                                 GABI (cont'd)
                        I became as addicted to him as I 
                        was to my music.  More so.

           Nigel storms in and pushes her down on the bed, yelling.  But 
           then he softens.  Because she’s on the bed and so fucking 
           sexy.  He joins her.  She doesn’t push him away.
           EXT. FORREST - DAY

           Gabi’s got a GUN raised.  Nigel is guiding her.  She FIRES.  
           Blowing a bottle off a tree trunk.  

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        I learned a lot from Nigel.  Things 
                        I would not have otherwise learned.

           THEN, Gabi whips a THROWING STAR into a tree.  Impressive.

           BACK TO GABI AND CHARLIE

           Charlie is squirming.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So you really loved him, that guy I 
                        just saw you shoot at.

                                 GABI
                        Do not do this puppy dog confusion 
                        face.  You never loved the wrong 
                        person?  And that person didn’t 
                        love someone wrong before you?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I thought I loved someone.  
                        Melissa.  But she was a bitch.

                                 GABI
                        Exactly.  If I, Gabi, were to love 
                        you, Charlie, do you think it would 
                        make any sense for me to do a puppy 
                        dog confusion face over the bitch 
                        Melissa?  How can Gabi love Charlie 
                        if Charlie loved the bitch Melissa?  
                        Fucking Melissa who loved the 
                        asshole George?  Is this how your 
                        mind is working?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t know.  Who’s George?

                                 GABI
                        I have a past.  Most people who 
                        have not been in a coma do.  Maybe 
                        mine is disgusting to you.  It’s 
                        not to me.  It’s just my past.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What about, um, Darko?
                                 GABI
                        Darko?  Fucking Darko?  What do you 
                        know about Darko, Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nothing.  Just that you were, um, a 
                        dancer in his club.  

                                 GABI
                        How do you know this, Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I went there.  There was a picture.  
                        We got in trouble.  I owe Darko 
                        three thousand dollars.  

           She gets up. 

                                 GABI 
                        I need to feed my cat.

           She goes.  He gets up and follows.

                                 CHARLIE
                        A cat?!  I didn’t know you had a 
                        cat.  Aren’t you the mystery lady.  
                        There’s a surprise at every turn 
                        with you.  Don’t forget your gun!

           INT. GABI’S FLAT - NIGHT

           Gabi opens the door.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re sure it’s safe here.

                                 GABI
                        He has tracked down and killed 
                        people on most continents.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re saying not completely.

           IN THE KITCHEN

           Gabi gets a bottle of wine.

           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           Charlie looks around.  Lots of books.  An old LP record 
           player and lots of vinyl.  He sees the CUBS BEER HELMET.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where’s your cat?
                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        No cat.  I said it to get you here.

           Gabi enters.  She’s got the wine and glasses, and an ENORMOUS 
           CAT in her arms.  She drops the cat in Charlie’s lap.

                                 GABI (cont’d)
                        Charlie, Frank Flour.  Frank Flour, 
                        Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Man, he is fat.

                                 GABI 
                        He is named for our most famous 
                        composer, Ferenc Liszt.  Frank 
                        Flour in English.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hello, Frank Flower.

                                 GABI
                        Flour -- the kind you cook with.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hello, Frank Flour.  You are fat.

           Gabi sits.  She pours the wine.

                                 GABI
                        Now you want to hear about Darko.  
                        What do I get to hear about you?  
                        Nothing because you have been in a 
                        coma your whole life?

                                 CHARLIE
                        My mom died.  Just before I left.  
                        She was a good person.  A good mom.  

                                 GABI
                        Charlie.  I am sorry. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah.  

                                 GABI
                        This explains a lot.  About what 
                        you have said to me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I guess.  

                                 GABI
                        How did she die?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Cancer.  Bone marrow cancer.  
                        Multiple Myeloma they call it.  
                        Really, she died from the treatment 
                        for the cancer.  Which I guess is 
                        common.  She’d gotten spinal 
                        meningitis but was feeling okay so 
                        she wanted to come home for my 
                        stepdad’s birthday.  Scott.  No one 
                        wanted her to leave the hospital 
                        but she was stubborn like that.  
                        Anyway, she was making flank steak 
                        and she had a brain aneurysm.  She 
                        went into a coma and we took her 
                        off life support.  The doctor said 
                        it was the right thing to do.  You 
                        have to kill what you love 
                        sometimes, to set it free.  Scott 
                        said that.  I try to believe it.  
                        But I don’t know.  You know?

                                 GABI
                        I am such an asshole.  I said you 
                        were in a coma, when your mother 
                        really was.  What an asshole I am.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, I’m gonna go.  I hate you now.  
                    (then)
                        Listen, you think I don’t feel weird 
                        rubbing all up on you with drug-
                        fueled sweet-talk when your father 
                        just died next to me on a plane?  I 
                        do.  I really do.  But also, I kind 
                        of don’t.  Part of me feels very 
                        right about it.  You know?

                                 GABI
                        It’s a complex situation.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes, it is.

                                 GABI
                        Shall I tell you about Darko now?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nah. 

                                 GABI
                        No?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Show me.
                                 GABI
                        What?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Never mind.

                                 GABI
                        No, what do you mean, show me?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nothing.

                                 GABI
                        You want me to show you how I 
                        danced?  Is that right?  You think 
                        that is something I’d do for you?  
                        At this point here?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I said never mind.

                                 GABI
                        You never mind.  I am sick that you 
                        think I would do something so sick.

           She walks over to the record player.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sorry, okay?  I was joke--

           A song begins -- PRINCE, LITTLE RED CORVETTE.  Gabi peels her 
           shirt up over her head and tosses it on Charlie’s face.  

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        --ing.

           He pulls it away.  She is dancing.  

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        God damn.

                                 GABI
                        This is what you want, Charlie?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Basically. 

                                 GABI
                        You are sure?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes.
                                 GABI 
                        Okay, Charlie.  You fucking tourist.

           She puts her foot into his chest and pushes him back on the 
           couch.  She shimmies out of her jeans in a way that is so 
           sexy I can’t even find the words.

           Charlie’s mouth hangs open.  He just stares.  The way she 
           moves, it’s so beautiful.  Not sexy.  It’s more than that.  
           Her body slows and his eyes fill with TEARS.  

                                 GABI (cont’d)
                        What’s wrong, little boy?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nothing.

           She puts one knee on the couch next to him.  Then the other 
           on the other side.  She lowers herself onto him.  

                                 GABI
                        You think you love me, Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes. 

                                 GABI
                        You think things like this happen 
                        to people?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes.  To some people.

                                 GABI
                        What people?

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know what people.

           She thinks.  She smiles.

                                 GABI
                        Us, Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes, Gabi.  Us.

                                 GABI
                        Okay, Charlie.  Us.

           She pulls him into her chest.  He breathes her in.  He 
           exhales.  Something like relief.  Like coming home.
           She kisses him.  Softly at first, and then harder, and then 
           it’s on -- she yanks away his clothes, he pulls off what’s 
           left of hers.  

           And they fuck.  Er, make love.  No, it’s definitely fucking.  
           Wait.  Now they’re making love.  Okay, that right there?  
           Fucking.  Jesus.  They’re doing both.  Is that even possible?

           Of course it is.  

           INT. GABI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie lies awake.  Gabi seems to be sleeping.  She’s not.

                                 GABI
                        You are waiting for the story of 
                        Darko?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Here in the dark.  O.

           She sits up.

                                 GABI
                        Last story, Charlie.  Okay?
                    (he nods)
                        I needed to get away from Nigel.  
                        He is not permitted to enter the 
                        UK, being who he is, so I decided I 
                        would go to London to study.  I 
                        needed money.  Nigel knew Darko 
                        from the war.  He got me a job at 
                        the club.  I made money and I went 
                        to London.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        He just let you go?

                                 GABI
                        We married before I left.  It was 
                        the only way I could make him 
                        believe I wasn’t leaving him.  My 
                        father almost died...

           The phrase catches her up.  Charlie smooths her hair.

                                 GABI (cont’d)
                        Béla pursued the divorce when I was 
                        away, and many bribes and forgeries 
                        later, it was granted. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        And Nigel does what anyone would --  
                        he goes to Africa to kill child 
                        soldiers hopped up on molasses.

                                 GABI
                        Chinese molasses.  Opium.

                                 CHARLIE
                    (no idea)
                        Of course not regular molasses.

                                 GABI 
                        Any more questions for me tonight, 
                        Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let me think.
                    (then)
                        Can we do it again, Gabi?

                                 GABI
                        Okay, Charlie.  We can.

           They dive into one another.

           INT. GABI’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Charlie stirs awake.  Gabi is not there.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Gabi?

                                 GABI (V.O.)
                        Jo régelt kivánok, Charlie.  Would 
                        you like coffee?

           Gabi comes in.  She’s NAKED, except for her head, where she’s 
           wearing the CUBS HELMET.  CUPS OF COFFEE sit in the holders.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t mind if I do.

           She sits on the bed.  She puts the drinking tube into his 
           mouth.  He drinks some coffee. 

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        I need to tell you, Gabi, Darko is 
                        looking for Nigel.  I think he 
                        wants to kill him.

                                 GABI
                        It is more complicated than this.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        I had a feeling.

                                 GABI
                        Since the war, Nigel and Darko have 
                        circled each other, each believing 
                        the other is in possession of  
                        something, a powerful thing which 
                        both of them desperately want.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        The one ring to rule them all?

                                 GABI
                        A piece of evidence showing them 
                        both in a place where terrible 
                        things happened.  Each of them 
                        thinks the other has it.  Once they 
                        find out neither of them has it, 
                        they will kill each other, or maybe 
                        be friends again.  Who knows with 
                        these guys?

                                 CHARLIE
                        But neither of them has it?  This 
                        mysterious and powerful thing?
                    (off her look)
                        Who has it, Gabi?  Not you, right?

           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           From the floor, Gabi pulls up a RADIATOR GRATE.  She pulls 
           away false WALL.  She reaches in and pulls out a VIDEOTAPE. 

           THEN

           Gabi puts the tape in a VCR.  She plays it.

           ON VIDEO:  NIGEL in a BLOODY UNIFORM, fully strapped for 
           battle.  He’s in a GYMNASIUM.  DARKO’S VOICE sounds.  

                                 DARKO’S VOICE
                        Perhaps you will say what you have 
                        done during your visit to the nice 
                        village of Bratunac?

                                 NIGEL
                        Bit of this, bit of that.  Nothing 
                        remarkable, really.

                                 DARKO’S VOICE
                        You are too modest.  
           The SHOT MOVES to a BLOOD-SOAKED PILE OF DEAD BODIES stacked 
           against the wall.  Probably fifty men, shot where they stood.  
           In the corner, a BODY MOVES.  The SHOT ZOOMS in on it.

                                 DARKO’S VOICE (cont’d)
                        My friend, please, one living Mujo is 
                        the same as a thousand.

           Nigel strides over.  BLAM!  Killshot to the head. 

                                 DARKO’S VOICE (cont’d)
                        Okay.  Get me now.

           The SHOT TURNS over a couple of times, blurring.  And then 
           DARKO comes into focus.  He smiles and gives a thumbs up.

           VIDEO ENDS.

           Charlie is sickened.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How did you get this?

                                 GABI
                        From Darko’s.  I meant to make a 
                        copy, then put it back.  He saw it 
                        was missing before I could.  I’ve 
                        kept it all this time to make sure 
                        my father and I are safe, to use 
                        against Nigel if he ever came back. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jesus, Gabi.  Your life.  What the 
                        fuck?

                                 GABI
                        A life is a life is a life, 
                        Charlie.  Who knows what the fuck.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        This is the only copy?

                                 GABI
                        I have another.  I won’t tell you 
                        where in case you are tortured.
                    (Charlie laughs)
                        I am not making a joke.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why not use it now?  I can go to 
                        Darko and tell him we’ve got the 
                        tape, that he can have it if he kills 
                        Nigel.  
                                 GABI
                        Charlie, do not be a fucking idiot.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        What?  It’s a good plan.  A two 
                        birds plan.  Darko kills Nigel, he 
                        gets the tape.  If Darko doesn’t 
                        kill Nigel, CNN gets the tape.  

                                 GABI
                        Do you hear yourself?  Talking about 
                        plans and CNN and two fucking birds.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        The tape being the stone.  Yeah.

                                 GABI
                        You saw this tape, Charlie.  Stay 
                        away from Darko.  And fucking 
                        Nigel.  I will deal with it when 
                        the time is right.  Okay?  

           Gabi goes into the bedroom.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, far be it for me.  It’s your 
                        genocide tape.  

           BEDROOM

           Gabi’s getting dressed.  Charlie enters.

                                 GABI
                        I need to go out.  Wait here, and 
                        do not do anything.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        What?  No.  Where are you going?

                                 GABI 
                        To get my father’s remains.  Okay?  
                        Just stay.  Take a bath.

           BATHROOM - LATER

           Charlie sits in the tub.  Just kind of sitting, his face lit 
           up, thinking of what’s become of him in so short a time.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        Remember, dahlinge, the boy is in a 
                        story, and like all stories worth the 
                        telling, it has only one possible end 
                        -- an end that was written long ago 
                        and far away in the stars.   
                                 (MORE)
                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        I am sorry to say it, dahlinge.  
                        Today is the day the story will end. 

           Charlie hears the FRONT DOOR open.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Gabi?  What took so long?

           The bathroom door opens.  IT IS NIGEL.  He’s got a SIG 9MM. 

                                 NIGEL
                        Came as soon as I could, Charlie.  
                        Let’s us take a ride.

           He tosses a LACY BATHROBE.  On Charlie’s face.  Poor Charlie.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        Today is the day the boy will die.

           EXT. GABI’S BUILDING - DAY

           Nigel pushes Charlie onto the street.  Charlie’s in the robe.  
           Not much left to the imagination.  Nigel opens the back of a 
           funky Russian TRUCK and bids Charlie to get in.

           IN THE TRUCK

           Charlie’s jostled about.  Nigel can be seen through grating.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where is she, you fuck?

                                 NIGEL
                        Aren’t we suddenly the hard man.  
                        In our lacy ladies finery.  

           EXT. BARREN COMMERCIAL AREA - DAY

           The truck stops at a LOADING DOCK.  Nigel climbs out.

           NEARBY

           A BUM sits in the BUSHES eating langos hideg.  He sees 
           Charlie pulled from of the truck in his robe.  He squints in 
           recognition, then down at the NEWSPAPER spread before him.  
           In it, a PHOTO OF CHARLIE holding Gabi’s gun on Counter Guy.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Nigel pushes Charlie into the room.  A CHAIR waits in the 
           center of the floor. 

                                 NIGEL
                        Have a seat, Charlie.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Eat a dick.  Where’s Gabi?

           THWAP.  Charlie falls, pistol whipped.  Nigel grabs him by 
           the HAIR and DRAGS him across the floor.

           AT THE CHAIR

           Nigel duct-tapes Charlie to the chair.  The chair is BOLTED 
           to the floor.  Charlie’s eye is nearly swollen shut.  

                                 NIGEL
                        Something you should see, Charlie.  
                        Might come as a bit of a shock.  So 
                        gird yourself, yeah?  Okay?

           Nigel tapes Charlie’s mouth shut.  

           THEN

           Nigel goes into another room.  Charlie’s eyes sweep the 
           place.  He wracks his body against the chair.  No chance.

                                 NIGEL (O.S.)
                        You sitting down, Charlie?

           He enters.  With GABI.  Her arm draped over his shoulder, he 
           half-drags her to a shitty COUCH.  She’s fucked-up on 
           something.  Charlie’s muffled screams draw her eye.  

                                 GABI
                        Jo nápot kivánok, Charlie.  Banyai 
                        Gabriella, vagyók.

           Charlie’s eyes go to Nigel, desperate.

                                 NIGEL
                        Don’t say she didn’t tell you, 
                        Charlie?  About her prior and 
                        wholly devoted relationship with 
                        her Uncle Henry?

           Nigel waggles a BAG OF HEROIN.  

                                            FLASH TO:

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           GABI looks into the METAL CASE with the GUNS, DRUGS, MONEY.  
           She picks up the BAG as before, but now she appears to smile.
           BACK TO SCENE

                                 NIGEL 
                        What sort of sorry affair are you 
                        two conducting?  Secrets are a 
                        cancer in love.  Everyone knows it.

           Nigel sits next to Gabi.  He’s drinks from a bottle of VODKA.

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        I’d heard she’s been free of the 
                        monkey for some time yet, but she 
                        took well kindly to what I put into 
                        her today.  Did you not, baby?   

           Gabi smiles a warm smile.

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        Right back on the horse, as it 
                        were, if you will.

           Gabi tries to sit up.  

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        Looks like she’s coming round.  No 
                        worries, Charlie.  I shall administer 
                        her a top-off most gladly.

           Nigel opens a KIT, laying out the apparatus.  Gabi stirs.

                                 GABI
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Where is Charlie, Nigel?  He loves 
                        me.  Do you think it’s too soon?

           Nigel cooks up a dose in a spoon. 

                                 NIGEL
                        Put it out of your head, baby.  
                        He’ll be dead soon enough.

           Nigel sticks a SYRINGE into Gabi’s arm.  Charlie goes wild,  
           screaming and jerking.  Gabi shudders and smiles.  

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        I’m going to fuck my wife now, 
                        Charlie.  With your permission, of 
                        course.  

           Nigel takes off his shirt.

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        Christ.  Nearly forgot.  
                    (walking to Charlie)
                                 (MORE)
                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        A minor detail, really, but a plan 
                        is a plan and I’m sticking to mine.

           Nigel TAPES CHARLIE’S EYES OPEN.  Then goes back to Gabi.

           WE STAY on Charlie.  His horrified face says it all.  He 
           turns away, tears streaming from his taped eyes.

           FINALLY

           Nigel sits on the couch, sweating.  Gabi’s passed out.  Nigel 
           takes a drink of Vodka and walks to Charlie.

                                 NIGEL
                        Well, Charlie.  I hope you’ve taken 
                        my point here today.  Love is a 
                        brutal, brutal thing.  What you 
                        just saw is what I saw full in my 
                        mind when I first saw Gabi look at 
                        you.  Pain begets pain, Charlie.  
                        It’s the proper way of things. 

           RIP!  The tape comes off Charlie’s eyes.  Fuck, that hurts.  
           He RIPS the tape from Charlie’s mouth.  Charlie can’t talk. 

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        I know, Charlie, it can be well 
                        trying to pull off a decent turn of 
                        phrase at a time like this.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fuck you.

                                 NIGEL
                        I stand corrected.  
                    (wielding his GUN)
                        Okay then, Charlie.  Your travels 
                        in this world are through.  It’s 
                        pennies on the eyes for you now.  

           Nigel puts the gun to Charlie’s head.  Charlie’s desperate 
           eyes go to Gabi.  She’s passed out.

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        Fair thee well, boy-o.  May you 
                        find peace in that place where gay 
                        tubaist impersonators go.

           CLICK.  Nothing.  

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        Bloody hell, Charlie!  Forgot to 
                        chamber it.  You’d fucking think 
                        with all my experience in the area.  
           Nigel YANKS the slide.  He raises the weapon again.  A SOUND 
           outside -- CARS arriving in a hurry.  Nigel goes to the 
           window, and SEES SOMETHING that makes him change plans on a 
           dime.  He gathers his shit, LEAVING.  Charlie is confused.

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        Welcome to limbo, Charlie.  Don’t 
                        get comfortable.  It’s not your 
                        final destination.  I’ll be along 
                        soon to hasten you there.

           He slides out of the WINDOW.  GABI opens her eyes a sliver.  

                                 GABI
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        People can’t be a pearl.  It’s sad.

           A COMMOTION at the door.  BAM!  It is kicked in.  TWO COPS 
           enter with GUNS drawn.  They scream at Charlie in Hungarian.  
           He is confused.  So are the cops, the scene being what it is. 

           The BUM peeks in, holding the NEWSPAPER with Charlie’s photo.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Charlie is CUFFED, being led in his robe to a POLICE CAR.  He 
           watches Gabi being loaded into an AMBULANCE.  He notes the 
           HOSPITAL NAME on the side -- SZENT ISTVAN.

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Charlie’s cuffed to a bench.  He’s wearing a JAIL JUMPSUIT.  

           IN AN OFFICE

           BÉLA is there, broken-nosed, sitting across from an OLDER COP 
           in a SUIT.  Béla hands an ENVELOPE to the older cop.

                                 BÉLA
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Private box.  La Bohême.  I trust 
                        Mrs. Chief Inspector will be pleased.  
                    (the cop harumphs)
                        It is Mrs. Chief Inspector who will 
                        accompany you?  Not that gorgeous 
                        creature you brought to Cosi Fan 
                        Tutti?  Your daughter, I assume?  

           Béla hands the cop a TRAIN TICKET to Bucharest.

                                 BÉLA (cont’d)
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        As agreed, you will give this to 
                        the American.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BÉLA (cont’d)
                        And you will make an effort to get 
                        the Englishman off the streets.

                                 OLDER COP
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Yes, yes.  You are sure this is a 
                        private box?  As agreed?

                                 BÉLA
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        I assure you, Chief Inspector, the 
                        ideal place to fondle one’s daughter.

           INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

           TWO UNIFORMS up front, Charlie in back.   

                                 CHARLIE
                        Take me to Szent Istvan Hospital.

           Uniform One hands Charlie the TRAIN TICKET.  

                                 COP
                        Bucharest.

           The cops laugh.  

           EXT. MARCO POLO YOUTH HOSTEL - DAY

           The car stops.  In front of the MARCO POLO YOUTH HOSTEL.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        No, Szent Istvan Hospital!

                                 COP
                        Bye bye.

           INSIDE

           Charlie’s at the front desk.  The CLERK is there.  He checks 
           out Charlie’s jump suit, his jail slippers, his face.

                                 CLERK 
                        Hey, man.  You are okay?  You do 
                        not look too okay.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where is Szent Istvan Hospital?  

                                 CLERK
                        Your friends, they said you were 
                        ill.  They checked you out of the 
                        hostel.  The Canadian and German.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        Luc and Karl?  They checked me out?  
                        Why the fuck...

           Clerk gives him an ENVELOPE.  

                                 CLERK 
                        A mean guy, he left this for you.

           Charlie opens it.  Piece of paper, on it a DIGITAL PHOTO -- 
           LUC AND KARL, NAKED, TIED TOGETHER around a STRIPPER POLE. 

                                 CLERK (cont’d)
                        You should run away.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I probably should.

                                 CLERK
                        No, man.  Now.  The guy is here.

           He points.  Charlie turns.  DARKO IS OUTSIDE, SMILING.  

                                 CLERK (cont’d)
                        Back door through pub, man. 

           Charlie BOLTS.  Darko SPRINGS.  Charlie runs INTO THE HOSTEL 
           and leaps down the STAIRS. 

           IN THE PUB

           Charlie FLIES through the PUB.  Darko’s on the stairs.  
           Charlie makes for the back, KNOCKING into IDIOT TRAVEL-KIDS.  

           Darko enters.  Charlie UPENDS TABLES to block him.  As if.  
           Charlie HURDLES the BAR, and RACES back into the KITCHEN.

           EXT. BACK DOOR - HOSTEL - EVENING

           Charlie BURSTS through the DOOR, BOUNDS up the STAIRS.

           ON THE STREET

           From a side-street, Charlie HURLS HIMSELF out onto the busy 
           sidewalk of Rákóczi.  He rips through the crowd.  He looks 
           back.  Yeah, Darko -- coming fast and unrelentingly.  

           Charlie VEERS into the street, DEAD INTO TRAFFIC.  WHAANH!  A 
           BUS SCREAMS BY, SKIMMING HIS NOSE.  CARS SKID and SCREECH as 
           he DARTS around them.  He gains the opposite sidewalk.   

           Darko’s in the street.  Traffic’s no problem.  Fred Astaire, 
           but violent, not as ugly.  Charlie spots a METRO STATION.
           INT. BLAHA LUJZA TER - EVENING

           Charlie VAULTS down some STAIRS and finds himself in an 
           UNDERGROUND SQUARE.  He spies the ENTRANCE to the METRO. 

           AT THE STATION

           Charlie lumbers in.  He looks.  No sign of Darko.  

           Charlie gets on the CROWDED ESCALATOR, heading down, way 
           down, under a gleaming futuristic half-dome ceiling.  It 
           seems not to ever end.  Maybe in hell.

           Charlie looks back -- Darko slides into view and steps onto 
           the escalator.  He comes, pushing through people.  Rude.

           Charlie tries to step it up.  It’s too crowded.  He notes a 
           NARROW SLIDE-LIKE SECTION that separates the escalators.

           Charlie THROWS HIMSELF onto the slide -- WHOOSH!  Now he’s A 
           BULLET.  On the slide, STEEL KNOBS are spaced to deter punks 
           from sliding down.  The first knob’s about to de-ball 
           Charlie.  But he BOUNCES up, enough to clear it.  Nifty.  

           He looks back.  Duh.  Fucking Darko sliding after him...

           Charlie slides and bounces, slides and bounces.  He notices a 
           SMILING WOMAN coming on the UP ESCALATOR.  It’s his...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mom?

                                 MARY BAKER
                        Look at you, Charlie!  No fear!  
                        Even though I said Bucharest!  You 
                        goof!

           ON THE PLATFORM

           Charlie’s BODY is SHOT OUT with great velocity.  He tumbles, 
           scrambles to his feet, over to the TRACKS.  No trains.  Shit.

           Charlie ducks behind a COLUMN.  He peeks back to find DARKO 
           BARREL ROLLING onto the platform.  All parkour and shit.  

           WITH DARKO.  He stands.  No sign of Charlie.  He strolls 
           forward.  Bad motherfucker.

           TWO TRAINS pull into the station, one on either side.  They 
           stop.  DOORS OPEN.  And PEOPLE start to pour out.  

           Darko stands surveying.  With killer robot eyes.
           WITH CHARLIE.  He looks from train to train.  What to do?  
           People file into the cars.  Soon the doors will close.  
           Charlie peeks.  Sees Darko, eyes sweeping, ready to pounce.  

           Charlie breathes -- one, two, three, he LAUNCHES HIMSELF 
           across the platform, heading for the far train.  

           Darko spots him, and SPRINGS toward the same train.  

           The DOORS are CLOSING.  Charlie’s not going to make it.  He 
           LEAPS into the air...

           Darko LEAPS too, his own set of doors closing...

           They’re both in the air...

           WHOOSH!  Darko SLUICES THROUGH the closing doors...

           WHACK!  Charlie HITS THE SIDE OF THE TRAIN, and crumbles to 
           the platform.  Fucking missed on purpose.  Clever Charlie.

           The doors close.  The train begins to move.  Darko stands, 
           looking, expecting to find Charlie in the next car.  

           But Charlie is OUT ON THE PLATFORM, watching Darko being 
           drawn away into the tunnel.  

           EXT. BLAHA LUJZA TER - EVENING

           Charlie approaches a TAXI STAND.  Several DRIVERS mill about, 
           smoking.  One takes notice of Charlie.  It’s HIS TAXI DRIVER. 

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Fucking hell, Hubble!  What kind of 
                        crazy love story are you in?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Can you take me to Szent Istvan 
                        Hospital?  I don’t have any money.

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Saint Stephen Hospital.  Okay, 
                        Hubble.  Whatever you say.  

           INT. SZENT ISTVAN HOSPITAL - EVENING

           Charlie’s at the front desk.  An ATTENDANT checks a PC.  

           THIRD FLOOR 

           Charlie exits the ELEVATOR.
                                 CHARLIE
                        GABI!!

           BÉLA sticks his head out of a room.  Charlie runs at him.  

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Béla!  It’s me, Charlie!

           Béla rolls his eyes gayishly, goes back in the room.  

           IN THE ROOM

           Charlie enters.  Gabi’s in bed, hooked to an IV.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Gabi.  I’m so sorry, Gabi.  I 
                        couldn’t...

                                 GABI
                        Charlie.  Listen to me.  You need 
                        to--

                                 CHARLIE
                        I didn’t help you...I’m sorry.

                                 GABI
                    (subtitled; Hugarian)
                        Bela, please go now.  

                                 BÉLA
                    (subtitled; Hungarian)
                        Do not worry, Gabika.  I will take 
                        care of everything.  

           Béla leans in and kisses her.  He leaves.  

                                 GABI 
                        Why are you here, Charlie?  Did you 
                        not get the ticket?

           Charlie takes the ticket from his jail jumpsuit.

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is from you?  You think I’d 
                        leave without--

                                 GABI
                        Go to Bucharest, Charlie.  This 
                        whole thing, it’s been a mistake.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mistake?  No...this is...this is 
                        it, Gabi.  Right?  Us?
                                 GABI
                        There is no it, or us.  I do not 
                        love you.  I could never love 
                        someone like you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?  

                                 GABI
                        Don’t ask what.  Okay?  Don’t make 
                        it worse for yourself.  Just go.

                                 CHARLIE
                        But, Gabi--

                                 GABI
                        Stop saying fucking Gabi!  Okay?  
                        You make me hate my own name!

                                 CHARLIE
                        What are you...I don’t understand.

                                 GABI 
                        Fucking obviously!  I told you, 
                        Charlie, you are a child.  Your 
                        mommy dies and you think if you go 
                        on a big adventure you will feel 
                        something different than what you 
                        are supposed to feel. 
                    (scoffs)
                        You see, it is no different for me 
                        with what Nigel put in me, Charlie.  
                        It is my adventure.  I had 
                        forgotten, but now I remember.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Remember what?

                                 GABI
                        Who I am.  A girl who will leave 
                        here and find Nigel as soon as 
                        possible so she can shoot some 
                        adventure into her veins.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fuck you.  Bullshit.

                                 GABI
                        No, it’s the first true thing I 
                        have said to you.

           Charlie reels.  Gabi kills him.
                                 GABI (cont’d)
                        The little boy is lost again.  So 
                        sad to see.  Go away, little boy.  
                        Bucharest or wherever you want.  No 
                        one cares.  Just leave.

           Charlie stands there.  With his annihilated heart.

                                 GABI (cont’d)
                        LEAVE!

           INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Charlie sits in a row of chairs.  Crushed.  A WOMAN we don’t 
           fully see sits next to him.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Took another powder, eh, Charlie? 

           It’s his MOM.  She gives him a reproving-Mom-smile.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s not the same, Mom.  

                                 MARY BAKER
                        I really should have made you do 
                        your homework.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Again with the homework?  

                                 MARY BAKER
                        It’s a for example, Charlie.  I 
                        left you to make your own choices 
                        before you were ready.  I didn’t 
                        help you enough.  You felt alone, 
                        you were always scared.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Of homework?

                                 MARY BAKER
                        For example.  A kid has homework, 
                        but his Mom doesn’t say hey, kid, 
                        do your homework.  The kid knows 
                        he’s supposed to do it.  He thinks, 
                        why isn’t anyone telling me to do 
                        this frigging thing I’m supposed to 
                        be doing.  Why I am being left 
                        alone?  Am I not loved enough to be 
                        told to do my homework?  See?

           Charlie thinks about it.  He understands.  
                                 MARY BAKER (cont’d)
                        I’m sorry, Charlie.  Fear is a 
                        terrible thing to have in your 
                        heart.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        So here I sit.

                                 MARY BAKER
                        You’ve come pretty far.

                                 CHARLIE
                        To sit here?

                                 MARY BAKER
                        It’s a process.  

                                 CHARLIE 
                        I can beat it.  The fear.  

                                 MARY BAKER
                        You’re almost there.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know what to do.

                                 MARY BAKER 
                        Then quit talking to your dead 
                        mother and do it, Charlie!

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie bursts into Gabi’s room.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Gabi, I...

           She’s gone.

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Charlie flies down the stairs.

           AT THE FRONT DESK

           The Attendant points Charlie out the door.

           OUTSIDE

           Charlie races out, looking, looking, until he spies NIGEL’S 
           TRUCK double-parked on the street. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        GABI!!
           AT THE TRUCK

           Nigel is preparing a NEEDLE for Gabi.  She looks helpless.  
           We NOTE the VIDEOTAPE on the seat.

                                 NIGEL
                        Picture my surprise, baby.  Finding 
                        it in your flat after all this time!  

           He ties a RUBBER BAND around her arm.  Tears fill her eyes.

                                 NIGEL (cont’d)
                        I’ve spoken to Darko.  He’s well 
                        relieved, to be sure.

           Nigel plunges out the air, ready to inject...THE DOOR FLIES 
           OPEN.  CHARLIE puts both hands in Nigel’s HAIR and YANKS him 
           out of the truck.  Nigel’s slammed onto the pavement.

           Charlie’s got CLUMPS OF HAIR in his fists.  He lifts his 
           foot...SMASH.  DOWN ON NIGEL’S FACE!  Unfortunately, he’s 
           wearing jail slippers, so Nigel is only marginally fucked.

           Charlie jumps in the truck, starts it and tears off.  

                                 GABI
                        What are you doing, Charlie?!

                                 CHARLIE
                        I choose life, Gabi.  I choose you!  
                        So what if it kills me?!

                                 GABI
                        You are on drugs again?!

                                 CHARLIE
                        You are!  But we’ll figure all that 
                        out after.  Together!

           Charlie checks the SIDE-VIEW MIRROR -- NIGEL’s up and 
           running.  Like the fucking T-1000. 

           Uh oh.  A CAR blocks the narrow street.  Charlie stops.  
           Nigel’s getting bigger in the MIRROR.  

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Your gun.  Where is it?

                                 GABI
                        I don’t have it!

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s unfortunate.  Wish me luck.
                                 GABI
                        What?

           Charlie gets out.

                                 GABI (cont’d)
                        Charlie, no!

           IN THE STREET

           Well.  Okay.  So Nigel proceeds to beat the shit out of 
           Charlie.  Charlie lands a couple of shots, but they’re pretty 
           much accidental, and also super goofy-looking.  Mostly, it’s 
           an ugly, brutal, monumental ass-whooping -- one that passes 
           beyond the physical, into the realm of metaphor.  

           Poor Charlie.  He gave it a shot.  But there he is, splayed 
           out in a spreading pool head-wound ooze.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        To the beginning now, dahlinge, 
                        where it all will end.  

           ON CHARLIE’S FACE

           Swollen and bloodied.  His TEAR falls UPWARD.  

           We PULL BACK and FLIP OVER, to find him DANGLING from 
           SZABADSÁG BRIDGE, HANGING upside-down over the DANUBE RIVER.  

           Darko’s THUGS hold his legs.  Darko grins down at him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        GABI!!

           Darko laughs.  Charlie is yanked up to the rail.  GABI steps 
           forward.  Charlie is confused, surprised she’s with them.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Gabi?  What...what are you...

           Gabi smiles a heroin smile.  Nigel is at her side.

                                 KNIFE FACE
                        Take heart, Charlie.  We’ll see she 
                        gets the proper care and feeding.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        FUCK YOU!!  FUCKING FUCKASS 
                        FUCKFACE!!

           Nigel laughs.  He’s got a GUN.  Charlie looks into Gabi’s 
           eyes, pleading.  Gabi looks around, as if waiting.
                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Why, Gabi?

           Gabi REACHES FOR THE GUN, appealing to Nigel: let me do it.  
           He thinks it over, then gives it to her.  Gabi gulps.  BLAM!  
           She shoots Charlie in the gut.  

           Charlie SCREAMS.  Charlie BLEEDS.  Gabi leans in close to him.

                                 GABI
                        You kill what you love to set it 
                        free, Charlie.  Imádlak, édeshem fíu.

           Charlie’s eyes light up.  He smiles.  Gabi steps back.  Nigel 
           nods.  The Serbs let go.  Charlie falls.  To the gray waters 
           of the river flowing below.  He crashes through the surface.

           ON THE BRIDGE

           Gabi searches the water.  Sees nothing.  Behind her, POLICE 
           LIGHTS FLASH and SIRENS SOUND.  TWO SWAT VANS roar up.  

           Nigel and Darko share a look.  Darko runs.  So do his THUGS.  

           POLICE in URBAN ASSAULT GEAR pile out of the VANS.  Some 
           chase Darko, others break for Nigel.

           Nigel looks to Gabi.  She smiles and pulls a CELL PHONE from 
           her pocket.  Nigel reaches for his gun.  But GABI’S GOT IT.  

           COPS surround him.  Nigel pulls ANOTHER GUN out of his 
           waistband.  He smiles at Gabi.  

                                 NIGEL
                        Like I always said, baby.  You’re 
                        the total pack--

           BLAM!  He SHOOT HIMSELF IN THE HEAD.  

           A POLICE CAR is there.  The CHIEF INSPECTOR is at the wheel.  
           BÉLA gets out, HOLDING A COPY OF THE GENOCIDE TAPE.  Gabi 
           smiles a thank you.  He blows her a gayish kiss.  

           Gabi drops the gun, turning back to the railing.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) 
                        Yes, dahlinge, the boy did die 
                        today.  But let us not weep for him.

           Gabi’s eyes well with tears.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        Let us take comfort knowing that in 
                        his final hours...
           Gabi stares into the water.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        ...he came more alive than he had 
                        in all the days of his life entire.

           UNDERWATER

           Charlie’s body floats beneath the surface, being swept along 
           by the current.  His eyes are open, lifeless.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) 
                        For the boy chose love -- in 
                        defiance of fear and the hazards of 
                        this world, he chose love.

           Charlie’s HAND MOVES.  To his stomach.  He lifts his shirt.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        Fortunately, dahlinge, a funny thing 
                        occurred.  Something wondrous and 
                        magical...

           His wound is in his SIDE, not his gut, and it’s merely an 
           expertly inflicted FLESH WOUND.  Fucking Gabi.  

           ON THE BRIDGE

           Gabi smiles.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.)
                        Love chose him back. 

           BACK UNDERWATER

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) 
                        And so, dahlinge, the boy is reborn 
                        a man.  A man in love.

           Charlie smiles.

           EXT. BUCHAREST, ROMANIA - DAY

           TITLE: A FEW DAYS LATER

           Charlie sits at a Belle Époque outdoor cafe.  The sun is 
           shining.  His face is kind of fucked up, but otherwise he 
           looks like his old fairly handsome self.

           KARL is with him.  A little bruised himself, but otherwise 
           looking good in his SUIT.  LUC approaches with some BEERS.  
           He’s fine, wearing his MAPLE LEAF clothes.
                                 KARL
                        I have to say, I like it here.  No 
                        one has yet touched my liver, and 
                        the prostitute I fucked last night 
                        must have been at least forty.

                                 LUC
                        And the people, dude?  They’re kind 
                        of magical.  With their quietness 
                        and their decency?  Pretty awesome.

           Charlie picks up his beer.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Anything besides beer in this beer? 

                                 LUC
                        Bro, you know the riot police took 
                        my stuff during the rescue.

           Charlie drinks.  He checks his watch.  Then he gets up.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll see you guys later.

                                 KARL
                        Fucking Warren Beatty, off to put 
                        his thing down.

           INT. GARA DE NORD - TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Charlie waits on the platform.  A TRAIN appears in the 
           distance.  But something is off -- it is FLOATING ABOVE THE 
           RAILS.  Oh shit.  Charlie looks around.  

           On a BILLBOARD.  AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE IN A DENTURE AD -- 
           CHARLIE AND GABI. 

           On the ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE BOARD, over and over and over: 
           CHARLIE & GABI: FOREVER, CHARLIE & GABI: FOREVER.

                                            FLASH TO:

           THE CAFE

           Luc and Karl are laughing.  Everyone around them is NAKED.

                                 LUC
                        The zone of mutuality is awesome.

                                 KARL
                        Fucking Bucharest is awesome.
           BACK TO TRAIN STATION

           The train is nearing.  Charlie’s feet are EIGHT INCHES OFF 
           THE GROUND.  CLOUDS OF LIGHT MOLECULES BLOW OUT FROM UNDER 
           THE TRAIN.  Charlie steadies himself as the train stops.  

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) 
                        This is our story, ladies and 
                        gentlemen.  Of love and the promise 
                        it holds.  Of life and of living it 
                        in love...  

           GABI’s in the door.  She’s got her CELLO, and she’s wearing 
           the CUBS BEER HELMET.  She smiles.  He smiles.  

                                 GABI
                        Say it, Charlie.  Please.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Gabi.  Gabi.  Fucking Gabi.

           A CHOIR SINGS as she comes toward him.

                                 ZSA ZSA GABOR (V.O.) 
                        ...of all and everything, dahlinge.  
                        For love is all, and love is 
                        everything.

           Charlie gathers Gabi into his grown-up arms.  And with one 
           word, two letters...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Us.

           ...a SUPERNOVA EXPLODES THE WORLD.

           THE END

           A SONG PLAYS while you sit there -- THE MAGIC POSITION, by 
           Patrick Wolf.  Hear it, and you will know.  Thank you.
