           FADE IN...

           EXT. FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

           ESTABLISHING -- Picture perfect 1970’s suburbia...

           INT. FAMILY HOME - SAME TIME

           The CAMERA CREEPS THROUGH the quiet home... Up the STAIRS... 
           Along a CORRIDOR that’s adorned with FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS...

           And into a CHILD’S BEDROOM... A LITTLE BOY kneels by his bed - 
           Saying his prayers... But as we inch closer -- We realize - 
           They’re not prayers -- He’s repeating some strange MANTRA...
           Over and over...

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        ...Water’s wet, the sky is blue... 
                        Water’s wet, the sky is blue...

           Then -- VOICES from behind -- His MOMMY and DADDY looking in -

                                 MOMMY
                        Monkey, you should be asleep.

           The Little Boy looks up at his loving Parents and smiles...
           He has a sweet face... But troubled eyes...

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        If I have nightmares can I come 
                        sleep with you?

                                 DADDY
                        Of course. But sleeps now.

           They tuck him back in... Kiss him fondly... And leave...
           The Little Boy closes his eyes and tries to fall asleep...
           And the CAMERA CREEPS IN... SLOWLY... CLOSER and CLOSER...
           Then suddenly -- The little boy shudders violently -
           As if wracked by some nightmare -

           The Little Boy opens his eyes -- To see -- A FLASH INSERT OF -
           A MONSTER -- A GROTESQUE SNAKE-LIKE HUMAN looming over his bed -
           TRANSPARENT -- Like a ghost -

           The terrified Little Boy jumps up and the CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM -
           Out into the shadowy corridor -- And into his PARENT’S BEDROOM - 
           It’s DARK -- Somehow they’re already asleep in bed -

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        There’s a monster!

           Bedside lights flash on -- His Mommy BACKS AWAY in shock -
           Daddy bolts out of bed -

                                 DADDY
                        Stay away from the bed!

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        But you said I could...?

                                 DADDY
                        ...How did you get in here?!
                                 MOMMY
                        Sam, don’t yell at him...

                                 DADDY
                        ...Why didn’t the alarm go off!

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        Mommy!

           His Parents freeze... Exchange fleeting glances... Then -

                                 MOMMY
                        Sweetie. I’m not your mother.

           The Little Boy’s mind begins to collapse -- He looks to -

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        Daddy!

           But Daddy just snatches up the phone -- Punches in 9-1-1 -
           The Little Boy turns back to his Mommy -- Crying hysterically -
           Mommy kneels in front of the Little Boy -
           Tries to focus his attention...

                                 MOMMY
                        Sweetie... Where are your parents?

           The Little Boy just looks at his Mommy and Daddy -
           Tears stinging his eyes -- Terror ripping at his heart...

           Look carefully and you’ll notice - There are no FAMILY PHOTOS...

                                                            QUICKLY TO:
           INT. POLICE STATION - LATER

           An OFFICER drags the terrified Little Boy from his Parents -

                                 MOMMY
                        They’re going to look after you.

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        No, Mommy! Daddy!

                                 DADDY
                        They’ll find your parents.

           As his Mommy and Daddy try to find comfort in one another -
           The Little Boy is pulled away -- Kicking and screaming -

           INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Officer sits the Little Boy unsympathetically -

                                 OFFICER
                        Wait here.

           And the Officer leaves -- Locking the door behind him -
           The terrified child hurries to the TABLE -- HIDES UNDERNEATH -
           Rocking himself gently -- Squeezing his eyes tightly shut -
           Trying to control his hysterics...
                                 LITTLE BOY
                        ...Water’s wet, the sky is blue... 
                        Water’s wet, the sky is...

           SUDDENLY -- There’s SHOUTING -

                                 DETECTIVE
                        ...Your buddy fingered you!

           The Little Boy opens his eyes -- Realizes -- THE ROOM IS FULL - 
           There’s people everywhere -- Someone kicks him under the table -
           The Little Boy makes a scared noise -- And the room goes quiet...
           Then suddenly -- Someone pulls the table aside -

                                 DETECTIVE (cont'd)
                        Hell’s this?

           The Little Boy backs away -- Just totally scared now -

                                 DETECTIVE (cont'd)
                        Whoa! It’s alright - No one’s gonna 
                        hurt you...

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        ...I want my Mommy.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Yeah - Okay - We’ll find your Mommy.
                        What’s your name?

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        Eric. Eric Blayne. I live at 2014...

                                 DETECTIVE
                        ...Blayne?
                             (he picks up the phone)
                        I got a kid in here - Says he’s 
                        “Eric Blayne”... Yeah, the runaway.
                             (he hangs up)
                        How’d you get in here, Eric?

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        I don’t know.

           The room falls silent... Then a commotion outside -
           Someone running -- And suddenly -- The door bursts open -
           And his PARENTS race in -- Fraught - Relieved -- Angry -

                                 DADDY
                        Where did you go?

                                 MOMMY
                        Monkey - You terrified us!

           His Mommy hugs the little with all her might -
           But there’s a fierce glare from his Daddy -

                                 DADDY (cont'd)
                        I said, where did you go?!

           As he WRENCHES his son out of his mother’s arms -- WE -

                                                              SMASH TO:
           INT. BEDROOM, APARTMENT - DAWN

           A man WRENCHES himself from the NIGHTMARE - MEET ERIC BLAYNE -
           All grown up -- He looks beat -- Not tired -- Beaten. By life.
           Notice his shattered eyes -- Tortured from sleepless nights -
           A human time-bomb -- Fragile... Volatile...

           He rises from his bed -- And we see -- His muscular arms - 
           COVERED IN HANDWRITTEN NOTES... Hundreds of them...
           Scrawled... Manically...

           INT. KITCHEN, APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne approaches his REFRIGERATOR -- One of those classic 
           old ICE CHESTS... Trepidation in his eyes -- He stops... 
           And checks his arm -

           CU FOREARM -- One particular note -- Underlined -- “GOT MILK“ -

           He places his hand on the refrigerator door... Fearful now... 
           Then -- Suddenly committed -- He opens the door -
           There’s over THREE DOZEN CARTONS OF MILK inside -
           Relief in Blayne’s eyes -- Now his day can begin...
           Blayne EXERCISES -- A Zen-like display of mind over muscle... 
           Grace and power -- Strengthening both body and soul...
           No Bowflex or Gold Line weights -- He uses everyday objects -
           Water bottles -- The bed frame -- Kitchen table...

           Then a MONTAGE as Blayne prepares for the day ahead...
           Carefully checking the notes on his arms -
           “RAZOR IN CABINET”... “TOOTHPASTE SINK LEFT”...
           And everything is exactly where it should be...
           “JEANS ON HOOK”... “BOOTS BY DOOR”...
           Every time he completes a task, he CROSSES OUT THE NOTE...
           “WATCHES IN DISH”... He straps watches to BOTH WRISTS...

           And slips an ANTIQUE POCKET WATCH into his jeans...
           You’ll also notice that there are CLOCKS EVERYWHERE -
           And Blayne is constantly checking them... Comparing them...
           Occasionally making tiny alterations to synchronize them...

           Finally -- Blayne checks a last note -- “KEYS ON SHELF”... 
           He takes a calming breath, so far, everything has been perfect... 
           He approaches the shelf... And... There they are -
           Right where he left them -- His keys... 
           He snatches them up and heads for the front door...

           He’s got the front door open... When he falters unexpectedly - 
           His confidence fades... Because there is one last neuroses... 
           Grinding on him... Scratching away at his tenuous sanity... 
           Finally, he succumbs and looks at his arm again -- “GOT MILK”... 

           Scored into his skin... He doesn’t want to have to check... 
           Doesn’t want to be a slave to his insecurities... 
           It was there five minutes ago, God damn it... 
           It must still be there... It must -- It must -- IT MUST...
           Damn it -

           Blayne storms back and wrenches open the refrigerator door -
           Of course, it’s still FULL OF MILK -- He slams the door -
           Hating himself for his weakness...

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. APARTMENT BLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne leaves his apartment -- Locking his front door -
           He makes a note on his forearm -- “FRONT DOOR LOCKED” -
           Then he makes his way out of the low-rent building -
           Ignoring the other TENANTS as he passes through...

           EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK, SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne crosses the street to a CLASSIC AMERICAN DINER...

           INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne finds a seat at the counter and a pretty waitress 
           pours him a coffee without asking -- This is TANYA -
           And she does a good job hiding her crush on Blayne...

                                 TANYA
                        Usual?

           But Blayne doesn’t answer -- Something’s bothering him -
           He glances at his watches -- Then at something behind Tanya -

                                 BLAYNE
                        Is that right?

           Tanya glances the clock - Then at the TV in the back kitchen -

           ON SCREEN - THE LOCAL MORNING NEWS - A story about some LAWYER - 
           PETER PATERSON - He’s been KILLED in a botched home burglary - 
           And the TIME - 6:18 AM -

                                 TANYA
                        I think it’s a few minutes fast.

           A uneasy calm returns to Blayne... Tanya looks the CHEF -

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                        Bright Eye’s Special!

           And the Chef regards Blayne with a neighborly smile...

           EXT. TOPANGA CANYON - MORNING

           Blayne’s bike keeps pace with the early traffic -
           A lovingly restored ‘53 INDIAN CHIEF -

           EXT. BUILDING DEVELOPMENT - LATER

           Some new sprawling housing complex still under construction...
           DAY LABORERS mill about -- Blayne arrives on his bike -
           Heels the powerful machine -- CHAINS it to the WATER TOWER -
           And WRITES on his forearm -- “BIKE AT WATER TOWER” -

           EXT. BUILDING DEVELOPMENT - LATER

           One house - Nestled on a RISE above the others...
           We find Blayne lost amongst the other workers -
           Nailing rafters to a ridge beam high above the ground...
           He glances at the sky... It’s still blue...
           EXT. BUILDING DEVELOPMENT - AFTERNOON

           Blayne lines up with the other WORKERS for his few dollars...

           EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - EVENING

           Blayne steers his powerful bike into the ALLEY...
           Chains it to a street light... Makes a NOTE on his forearm... 
           “BIKE IN ALLEY”...

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           All is quiet in Blayne’s Apartment as he reads a book -
           “A CLASH OF EMPIRES - A History of the Crimean War”...
           He reaches the end of a chapter... And sets the book back in 
           the bookshelf -- Where we see his extensive collection for 
           the first time -- There has to be over thousand books -
           And every one is a HISTORY BOOK...

           INT. BATHROOM, APARTMENT - LATER

           Scalding clouds of steam billow as Blayne showers... 
           Mumbling to himself -

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...Siege of Sebastopol,1854. After 
                        numerous victories Admiral Nakhimov
                        believes himself to be immortal - 
                        He’s killed by a sniper shot when 
                        he leads the final surge... Battle 
                        of Alma - 500 men of the Highland 
                        Brigade march against 10,000 
                        Russians...

           He’s reciting STRATEGIES from the Crimean War -
           An exercise to keep his mind strong... At the same time -

           He is scrubbing off CROSSED OUT NOTES with a NAIL BRUSH...

           Finally... He steps from the cubicle -- ONLY ONE NOTE REMAINS...
           “BIKE IN ALLEY”... He dries himself off... Brushes his teeth...

           And then begins his nighttime ritual...

           Making careful notes on his arms where everything goes...
           “RAZOR IN CABINET”... “TOOTHPASTE SINK LEFT”... Etc...

           He enters the kitchen and the psychotic ritual continues...
           Filling every square inch of his forearms with notes...
           “KEYS ON SHELF... “WALLET IN DRAWER”...

           Then finally, he turns to the refrigerator and opens the door -
           Just as every time before -- It’s FILLED WITH MILK...
           Relief in his eyes once more... He closes the door...
           And he makes his last note of the evening... “GOT MILK”...

           INT. APARTMENT - LATER

           Blayne lies in his bed... Waiting for sleep...
           But a single thought nags at him... Keeping him awake...
           He keeps looking at his arm... “GOT MILK”... “GOT MILK”...
           It’s clawing at him -- Like a thousand bugs under his skin...
           But he can’t take it -- He springs from his bed -
           RACES THROUGH TO THE KITCHEN -- Rips open the refrigerator...
           As always... IT’S FILLED WITH MILK -
                                 BLAYNE
                        God damn it!!

           He SLAMS the refrigerator door shut -- Then BANGS IT -
           Again ----- And again ------ And again ----- AND AGAIN!!!!
           Then he snatches up a pen and UNDERLINES the “GOT MILK” -
           ONCE ------- TWICE ------- And circles it over and over -
           AND OVER ------ AND OVER ----- DRAWING BLOOD -

           Then he heaves open a drawer -- Turns out its CONTENTS -
           FIFTY BOTTLES OF PILLS -- He scavenges through them -
           Finding the one he wants -- Rips it open -
           And downs a couple at the kitchen faucet...
           He sinks to the floor -- Holding his head in his hands...
           And gradually controls his breathing... And a calm returns...

           And he’s able to look up... But he sees -- THE REFRIGERATOR -
           Just standing there... It’s door slightly ajar... Taunting him...
           He wants to open it... To check one last time... 
           To make sure... But he knows -- There’s milk... 
           He knows that................ But what if there’s not...
           He begins to weep... And the CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS AWAY...
           Leaving him to his misery...

           FADE TO BLACK... 

           WE HOLD IN THE DARKNESS FOR A LONG MOMENT -
           THEN SUDDENLY - A SNAKE MAN JUMPS RIGHT AT US -
                                                              SMASH UP:

           INT. BEDROOM, APARTMENT - MORNING

           Blayne awakes GASPING FOR BREATH -- Wracked by the nightmare... 

           QUICK MONTAGE... 

           “RAZOR IN CABINET”... “TOOTHPASTE SINK LEFT”...
           “JEANS ON HOOK”... “BOOTS BY DOOR”... “WATCHES IN DISH”... 
           “WALLET IN DRAWER”... “KEYS ON SHELF”... “GOT MILK”...

           INT. DINER - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Blayne sits and checks the clock as Tanya pours him a coffee -

                                 TANYA
                        I set the clock right for you.

                                 BLAYNE
                        I saw. Thank you.

           Tanya tries to see behind his harrowed eyes...
           Then shouts to the Chef -

                                 TANYA
                        Bright Eye’s Special!

           Just like yesterday, the Chef gives Blayne a brief smile...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. BUILDING DEVELOPMENT - LATER

           Blayne arrives and chains his bike to the WATER TOWER -
           Then he WRITES on his forearm -- “BIKE AT WATER TOWER” -
           EXT. BUILDING DEVELOPMENT - LATER

           Blayne hangs upside down -- Nailing rafters to a ridge beam...
           The excruciating sun beats down... Blayne glances at the sky...
           Even upside down it’s still blue...

           EXT. BUILDING DEVELOPMENT - LATER

           Blayne sits amongst a complex network of wooden rafters -
           Eating his lunch -- When another WORKER clambers up...

           AND -- WITHOUT WARNING -- AN EARTHQUAKE RUMBLES THROUGH -
           Not the Big One -- But a good shaker -

                                 WORKER
                        Cinco dos.

                                 BLAYNE
                        No - Three-point-five - Tops.

           The quake settles -- But then -- There’s a RIPPING SOUND - 
           And Blayne looks across to the WATER TOWER -
           As the SIGN RIPS OFF -- And PLUMMETS -- CRASHING DOWN -
           Just inches from BLAYNE’S BIKE -

                                 WORKER
                        Oh, man -- You muy lucky...!!

           But then -- WITHOUT WARNING -- A RAFTER PIN BREAKS -
           SPLITTING A MASSIVE BEAM IN TWO -- IT COMES SWINGING DOWN - 
           And SPEARS the WORKER in the SHOULDER -- He SCREAMS IN AGONY -

           Blayne tries to compress the wound -- But BLOOD SPURTS -
           SPLATTERING Blayne -- Staining his T-shirt -

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        Hold on...

           Blayne scrambles down the BEAMS and RAFTERS -
           Races out of the HOUSE - To the edge of the ESCARPMENT -
           And calls down -

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        Medico! Accidente!

           But no one can hear him - He has TWO CHOICES -
           Run down the ACCESS ROAD - Or tear straight down the ESCARPMENT -

           Blayne BRAVELY CHARGES down the ROCKY ESCARPMENT - 

           The ground giving beneath his feet - 
           Barely able to keep his balance -
           More earth gives way - And it’s a FULL ON ROCK SLIDE -
           Blayne is practically surfing now - STUMBLING - FALLING -

           And the sound of the ROCK FALL becomes momentarily DEAFENING -
           LIKE A BILLION TONS OF WATER THUNDERING DOWN -
           He scrambles back to his feet and runs -

           But everyone’s just staring at him -- No one’s panicking -
           He crashes into the FOREMAN -

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        A guy’s hurt!
           Blayne turns and points back up to the RAFTERS -
           BUT THERE’S NO ONE THERE -- No WORKER -- NO ONE...

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        The ridge beam gave. 

           The Foreman glances up at the structure...
           There’s no broken rafter... Nothing...

                                 FOREMAN
                        Looks fine to me.

                                 BLAYNE
                        No. The earthquake loosened the 
                        cross beams... Look -

           He goes to show the Foreman the blood on his shirt...
           Only... THERE IS NO BLOOD ON HIM NOW...

                                 FOREMAN
                        ...What earthquake?

           Blayne looks from face to face... Mumbles of “Loco” -
           “Drog adicto”... Then he backs away...

           EXT. BUILDING DEVELOPMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne stumbles to the WATER TOWER, fumbling his bike keys 
           from his pocket -- But as he rounds a corner -- He slows...

           Fear in his eyes -- Because -- HIS BIKE IS NOT THERE... 

           He checks his arm -- “BIKE AT WATER TOWER”...
           Checks the tower again -- All around... No bike...

           Then he looks up and sees -- THE SIGN IS STILL ON THE TOWER...
           Now his breaths come in ragged gasps as he tries to stay calm -

           And a terrible thought comes to Blayne...... So slowly...
           Ever so slowly..... He looks to the sky...... And sees.......

           THE SKY IS NOT BLUE........ IT’S AMBER... 

           He pulls out a BOTTLE of PILLS -- Throws a couple down -
           Closes his eyes -- Tries to control his breathing -

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...Water’s wet. The sky is blue...
                        Water’s wet. The sky is blue...

           But then -- AGAIN WITHOUT WARNING -- ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE -
           SAME INTENSITY AS THE EARLIER ONE... It finally settles...
           Blayne barely has time to consider this -- Before he hears it -
           THE RIPPING SOUND -

           FLASH INSERT -- A FEW MINUTES EARLIER -- Blayne looks to see -
           The SIGN CRASHING FROM THE TOWER -

           BACK TO BLAYNE -- Looking up -- As the SIGN RIPS OFF AGAIN -
           He dives clear as the SIGN EXPLODES INTO the ground -
           The dust settles and Blayne sees -- The sign -
           Embedded in the ground -- Right where his head would have been - 
           If he hadn't had the premonition...
           EXT. TOPANGA CANYON - DAY

           Blayne wanders the canyon highway -- Trying to hitch a ride -
           Trying desperately to hold his shattered mind together...
           Trying to ignore the AMBER SKY...
           At last a truck pulls over and he clambers in...

           INT. TRUCK (MOVING) - SAME TIME

           Blayne straps himself into the passenger seat...
           But falters... Because he’s noticed -- The clock -- 1:11 pm...
           He checks all three of his own watches -- 1:18 pm...

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        Is that right?

                                 DRIVER
                        I guess. I dunno.

           Blayne changes the RADIO STATION without asking -

                                 RADIO
                        ...once again, our top story is the 
                        death of Senator Peter Paterson, found 
                        dead this morning in his family home. 
                        An apparent heart attack. It’s eleven 
                        minutes past the hour...

           Blayne is getting paler with every passing moment...

           EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - LATER

           Blayne climbs from the truck... And heads for his Apartment...

           INT. APARTMENT BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Blayne makes his way to his door -- And checks his arm -
           “FRONT DOOR LOCKED”... He takes out his keys -
           And starts to unlock the door -- But it just PUSHES OPEN -
           It’s been left on the LATCH...

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Blayne enters and his eyes immediately fall upon -
           HIS REFRIGERATOR... He approaches it apprehensively...
           And checks his arm... “GOT MILK”... And opens the door...
           There’s juice... Diet sodas... 

                                 BLAYNE
                        No... No, no, no...

           He starts rummaging through -- Pulling stuff out - 
           Eventually finding -- A plastic jug of milk -
           But that’s not it -- There were cartons -- DOZENS OF THEM -
           HE SAW THEM ------ IT’S ON HIS GOD DAMNED ARM ------

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        NO!

           Blayne turns -- Furious -- To see -- A WOMAN -
           Entering from the bedroom -

                                 BLAYNE
                        Where is it?
                                 MOTHER
                        The hell you doing?

                                 BLAYNE
                        Where’s the God damn milk?!

           Blayne moves in on her -- When, from nowhere -
           A KID rushes him -- BELTING Blayne a BASEBALL BAT -
           Right in the SIDE OF HIS HEAD -

                                 KID
                        Keep away from my family!

           Blayne is unconscious before he hits the ground -

                                                       FADE TO BLACK...

           WE HOLD IN THE DARKNESS... THEN -

           INT. POLICE CELL - MORNING

           FADE IN... Blayne wakes slowly -- Dizzy from the blow...
           As his eyes focus -- He sees -- His CELL MATE -
           Absolutely terrified -- Pointing at Blayne in fear...
           And whispering repeatedly...

                                 CELL MATE
                        Diablo... Diablo... Diablo...

           Blayne manages to sit up... How the Hell did he get here?
           When a POLICE GUARD walks by -- And looks at Blayne...
           Confusion in his eyes...

                                 POLICE GUARD
                        Who put you in there?

           Blayne has no answer...

                                 CELL MATE
                        ...Diablo... Diablo...

           EXT. POLICE STATION - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           The Police Guard escorts Blayne out...

                                 POLICE GUARD
                        ...No booking reference, no final 
                        Disposition Form, no property card - 
                        As far as we’re concerned, you were 
                        never here - This is your lucky day.

           He leaves Blayne alone on the sidewalk...
           And Blayne slowly looks to the sky........ IT’S BLUE AGAIN...

           INT. APARTMENT BLOCK - LATER

           Blayne approaches his door -- And tries to push it open...
           But this time it’s LOCKED... He looks to his arm -
           “FRONT DOOR LOCKED”... It’s a good sign...
           He takes the keys from his pocket... And unlocks the door...
           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Blayne shuffles in... And approaches his refrigerator...
           He closes his eyes... Makes a silent wish... And opens the door -
           IT’S FILLED WITH MILK ONCE MORE... 

           INT. BATHROOM, APARTMENT - LATER

           Blayne showers -- Washing the crusted blood from his head...
           Washing the nightmare away...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER, NORTH HOLLYWOOD - DAY

           A GROUP THERAPY SESSION -- FEMALE PATIENT shares her story...

                                 PATIENT
                        ...I got it home and I counted it 
                        again - Three dollars and sixty-
                        five cents - And I know I gave him 
                        a twenty - Damn, he does this to me 
                        every God damn week - Short changes 
                        me, just because I’m different - 
                        Right, Doc? 

           The DOCTOR consider this, then looks to Blayne -

                                 DOCTOR
                        Juliet is still struggling with 
                        issues of trust. Do you have any 
                        advice for her?

           Blayne looks up with a hardness we haven’t seen from him before...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Yeah. Next time write a check.

           If he can deal with his problems, everyone else should be 
           able to deal with theirs... A sadness in the Doctor’s eyes...

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER, NORTH HOLLYWOOD - LATER

           The Doctor writes out a prescription for Blayne...

                                 DOCTOR
                        In these sessions, it’s important 
                        to acknowledge everyone’s feelings.

                                 BLAYNE
                        How can I do that? They all want 
                        their lives to change... I just 
                        want mine to stay the same.

           It’s a terribly sad and simple truth...

                                 DOCTOR
                        Eric, I heard about this new 
                        clinical trial... 

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...You gave them my name?
                                 DOCTOR
                        Of course not. Their guy’s been 
                        making the rounds to all the groups. 
                        Sounds as though you could be exactly 
                        what they’re looking for.

           He hands Blayne a MEDICAL CARD and leaves... 
           Blayne regards the card... And RIPS it in two...

           INT. APARTMENT - LATER

           Blayne enters -- His arms laden with MILK CARTONS -
           He opens his refrigerator door -- The milk’s still there -
           He checks dates -- Throwing out the old cartons...

           Finally -- He shuts the fridge door -- REVEALING -
           Detective Weiss -- Just standing there in another nice suit -

                        Detective Weiss, door was open. 
                        You Eric Blayne?

                                 BLAYNE
                        What’s this about?

                                 WEISS
                        Section 1767 of the Health and

           Weiss re-evaluates Blayne -- He’s smarter than he presumed...

                                 WEISS
                        So why’d you run? I spoke to your 
                        foreman and he said you had 
                        nothing to do with the accident...

                        What do you mean, “It happened”?

           “MEDS IN DRAWER”... Blayne pulls out the drawer -
           Tipping out his prescriptions...

                                 BLAYNE
                        I see things - That aren’t real -
                        I didn’t think the accident 
                        happened - I thought I just... 
                        Saw it. In my head.

           Weiss examines a bottle -- OLANZAPINE -- In BLAYNE’S NAME -

                                 WEISS
                        You some kind of psycho?
                                 BLAYNE
                        Delusional schizophrenic. 
                        Is the guy okay?

                                 WEISS
                        He’ll be fine. How long you been 
                        having these episodes?

                                 BLAYNE
                        Since I was a kid. My Doctor will 
                        confirm everything.

           But Weiss isn’t listening... He’s noticed something -
           Blayne’s collection of books - Wall to wall - Floor to ceiling...
           HISTORY BOOKS...

                                 WEISS
                        You got a thing for history?

           Blayne looks to his books... His sanctuary...

                                 BLAYNE
                        History doesn’t change.

           And something kinda odd happens... 
           Weiss’ demeanor changes - DRAMATICALLY -
           Suddenly -- He’s all pleasant -- A smile warms his face -
           And he extends his hand for Blayne to shake...

                                 WEISS
                        Well - Thank you for your time.

           But that’s where it’s weird -- There’s a vibe -
           Like Weiss really wants to shake Blayne hand...

           I mean - REALLY WANTS TO SHAKE BLAYNE’S HAND...

           So Blayne hesitates... And in that still moment -
           There’s a KNOCK on the door -

                                 BLAYNE
                        Excuse me...

           Blayne opens the door -- There’s TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS -

                                 OFFICER
                        Eric Blayne? 

                                 BLAYNE
                        Yeah?

                                 OFFICER
                        We need to ask you some questions 
                        about an accident...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...Your detective is right here -

           Blayne turns back to Weiss -- BUT HE’S GONE -
           The BATHROOM DOOR SWINGING SHUT -

           Blayne storms into his BATHROOM -- BUT IT’S EMPTY...
           He glances to the WINDOW -- Locked from the INSIDE...
           And Blayne can see -- THE SKY IS STILL BLUE...
           His mind is disintegrating before our eyes...

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON -- The RIPPED MEDICAL CARD -- Now taped back together -

                                                                REVEAL:

           EXT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE, STRIP MALL, STUDIO CITY - DAY

           A simple office between a DONUT EMPORIUM and a NAIL SALON -

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           A plain, freshly painted set up...

           DOCTOR RICHARDS -- A younger man with sharp eyes is reading 
           over Blayne’s file while Blayne squirms uncomfortably in a 
           leatherette chair... 

           In the silence, Blayne notices an odd detail -
           His CHAIR IS A LITTLE WET...

                                 DOCTOR RICHARDS
                        It says you were made a ward of the 
                        state when you were ten years old.

                                 BLAYNE
                        My father died suddenly. When I was 
                        a kid. I guess my Mom couldn’t take 
                        care of me on her own. I ran away a 
                        lot.

           Doctor picks up a QUESTIONNAIRE and the scene now becomes 
           a RAPID FIRE exchange of questions and answers -
           Blayne’s been through this a thousand times...

                                 DOCTOR RICHARDS
                        So... Have any of your relatives ever 
                        been diagnosed with a mental illness?

                                 BLAYNE
                        No.

                                 DOCTOR RICHARDS
                        On a scale of zero to five, tell me 
                        how these statements apply to you... 
                        “I believe people are spying on me”.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Zero.

                                 DOCTOR RICHARDS
                        “I believe I’m receiving messages 
                        through books, television, songs...”

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...Zero. Maybe I’m not what you’re 
                        looking for...

                                 DOCTOR RICHARDS
                        ...“I’m often disoriented.”
           Blayne falters... But then... 

                                 BLAYNE
                        Five.

           Then -- With each answer -- Blayne grows increasingly agitated -

                                                         BLAYNE
                                                  ...Five.
                      DOCTOR RICHARDS
           “I constantly misplace 
           objects”

                                                         BLAYNE
                                                  ...Five.
                      DOCTOR RICHARDS
           “So I obsess over tiny 
           details.”

                                                         BLAYNE
                                                  ...Five.
                      DOCTOR RICHARDS
           “Because every time I turn my 
           back something changes.”

                                                         BLAYNE
                                                  ...Five.
                      DOCTOR RICHARDS
           “Sometimes friends or family 
           don’t recognize me.”

                                                         BLAYNE
                                                  ...Five.
                      DOCTOR RICHARDS
           “I often experience déjà vu 
           or premonitions.”

           Now we’re looking over Doctor Richard’s shoulder -
           At the questionnaire... There’s hundreds of questions...
           But the SERIES OF QUESTIONS that Blayne is answering “Five” 
           to are marked in RED INK... It’s like they’ve been specially 
           marked just for him...

                      DOCTOR RICHARDS
                                                         BLAYNE
           Sometimes I black out...
                                                  ...Five...

                                                         BLAYNE
                                                  ...Five...
                      DOCTOR RICHARDS
           ...And wake up in unfamiliar 
           places...

                                                         BLAYNE
                      DOCTOR RICHARDS
           “I obsess about time.”
                                                  ...Five...

                                                         BLAYNE
                                                  ...Five...
                      DOCTOR RICHARDS
           “Because sometimes time just 
           disappears.”

                                 DOCTOR RICHARDS
                        And this time that disappears -
                        Does it vary? Hours, days?

                                 BLAYNE
                        No. It’s always exactly the same... 
                        It’s always seven minutes.

           And there -- Printed in the questionnaire... “7 MINUTES”...
           But Doctor Richards keeps his poker face -

                                 DOCTOR RICHARDS
                        “I have reoccurring nightmares -
                        Where the Snake Men are trying to 
                        get me.”

                                 BLAYNE
                        What?
                                 DOCTOR RICHARDS
                        The Snake Men.

           Doctor Richards holds up a PICTURE CARD -
           It’s an ILLUSTRATION of a SNAKE MAN -
           Not the one from Blayne’s vision, but close enough - 

                                 DOCTOR RICHARDS (cont'd)
                        Have you ever seen anything like this?

                                 BLAYNE
                        Yes. They’re everywhere.

           Doctor Richards returns to the questionnaire...

                                 DOCTOR RICHARDS
                        “Sometimes I can’t breath.”

                                 BLAYNE
                        Yes. It’s like I’m drowning in air.

           Doctor Richards puts down the questionnaire...

                                 DOCTOR RICHARDS
                        Well, that concludes the questions.

                                 BLAYNE
                        How’d I do?

                                 DOCTOR RICHARDS
                        Let’s see.

           He casually flips a SWITCH ON HIS DESK -- And -
           WATER STARTS TO POUR IN THROUGH THE AIR CONDITIONING VENTS -

           Blayne looks up in horror as the WATER FLOODS IN -
           Then back to Doctor Richards -- Just as THE DOOR CLOSES -
           The Doctor’s gone -- He races to the door -- BUT IT’S LOCKED -

                                 BLAYNE
                        The hell are you doing?!

           The WATER’S RISING AT AN ALARMING RATE -- Already to his knees - 
           He wades back to the desk -- Snatches up the phone -
           But it’s dead -- The TURBULENT WATER RISES OVER THE DESK -
           Blayne eyes flick around the room -- Looking for a way out -

           And he sees -- THE WINDOW -- He grabs the COMPUTER MONITOR -
           And HEAVES it into the GLASS PANE -- But it doesn’t even crack -
           So he picks up the CHAIR -

           EXT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE, STRIP MALL, STUDIO CITY - SAME TIME

           We look in at Blayne through the WINDOW -- WATER RISING -
           FILLING THE ROOM -- Like some freak-show HUMAN AQUARIUM -
           He tries to smash the window out with the chair -

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE, MEDICAL BUILDING - SAME TIME

           The RISING WATER lifts Blayne from the floor --
           And still it GUSHES IN -- Just a few inches of air remain...
                                 BLAYNE
                        Help me!

           Two inches... One... Then the room is COMPLETELY FILLED -

           UNDERWATER -- Blayne pounds on the CEILING TILES -
           SCREAMING ----- Air rushing from his lungs -----
           He turns SUDDENLY ----- And -----
           HE FALLS -------- All the way to the FLOOR ------

           He lands with a DULL THUD -- Screaming -- Gasping for air -
           But his scream faces as he realizes -- THERE’S NO WATER -
           It didn’t drain or overflow -- IT JUST VANISHED...
           Gradually, he sits up -- And discovers that he’s in -

                                                     REVEAL SEAMLESSLY:

           INT. PADDED PSYCHIATRIC CELL - SAME TIME

           Somehow -- Blayne is now in a PADDED CELL...
           Floor, walls, ceiling, door... He shuffles into a corner -
           Trying to fathom the riddle -- How did he get here?
           His sanity is collapsing -- As he realizes... It’s happened...
           It’s finally happened -- He’s completely lost his mind...
           He must have blacked out -- And been taken here...
           Frightened... Lost... He begins to weep... Rocking gently...
           And for the longest time....... That’s it....... 
           Blayne weeping.......... Cradling himself in a fetal embrace...
           Life has finally broken him..................

           But then... Through his anguish... He realizes something...
           HE’S SOAKING WET... But as he begins to contemplate this -
           The HATCH in the door snaps open -- And a FACE appears -
           A PSYCHIATRIC GUARD -

                                 PSYCHIATRIC GUARD
                        He’s secure.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Why am I wet?!

           Blayne runs at the door - But the instant he touches it - 
           He’s JOLTED by a BRUTAL ELECTRIC SHOCK -
           He goes down hard -- Fetal -- GUARDS RUSH IN -
           And gently led him out of the Padded Cell - INTO -

           INT. OIL-AND-LUBE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           An RV is waiting -- The DRIVER steps down -
           It’s DOCTOR RICHARDS -- Carrying a towel... 
           Blayne weighs his options... Takes the towel...
           And climbs aboard the RV...

           INT. RV (MOVING) - SAME TIME

           A LUXURIOUS RIDE... But the Windows are BLACKED OUT -
           Doctor Richards climbs in behind Blayne -

                                 DOCTOR RICHARDS
                        There are dry clothes in the closet.
           Blayne slips into a T-shirt and jeans and looks out -
           As the RV pulls out of the OIL-AND LUBE -- Blayne realizes - 

           It’s where the STRIP MALL was an hour ago...
           There’s just no DONUT EMPORIUM, no NAIL SALON...
           And no DOCTOR’S OFFICE...

           MONTAGE -- The RV takes the FREEWAY towards the coast...
           Finally it heads off of PCH into the Malibu Hills...

           EXT. THE ESTATE - EVENING

           A massive, sprawling Southern California Estate -
           It sits on TWENTY ACRES and comprises several buildings -
           Most would mistake the main residence for a HOTEL -
           The RV comes to a rest in the wide motorcourt...
           A moment passes before Blayne steps out... And waits...

           And then -- A FIGURE appears from the ESTATE MAIN DOORS -
           And walks calmly down the imposing steps to Blayne...

           This is DOCTOR CHRISTIAN HARPER -- Mid fifties -
           Well kept... And there’s a warmth to him... A comfort -

           Like he knows everything is going to be alright -
           It’s in his smile...

                                 HARPER
                        Eric, my name is Christian Harper. 
                        Delusional schizophrenia is a 
                        chronic and disabling disease that 
                        approximately one percent of the 
                        population develop during their 
                        lifetime...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...I know the statistics.

                                 HARPER
                        Yes. But what you don’t know is this... 
                        You are not schizophrenic.

                                 BLAYNE
                        There’s only one thing that keeps 
                        me sane - And that’s knowing that I 
                        am seriously messed up.

           Harper accepts this with a smile...

                                 HARPER
                        Of course. What other diagnosis could 
                        there be? Objects vanish...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...Objects? Try strip malls.

                                 HARPER
                        But what if another conclusion could 
                        be drawn?

                                 BLAYNE
                        Don’t tell me - It’s a conspiracy.
                        The whole world’s out to get me - 
                        Moving stuff around when I’m not 
                        looking.
                                 HARPER
                        No one is that important, Eric.

           This isn’t an insult -- Just a fact...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Can I get a ride back to the Valley?

                                 HARPER
                        You’re free to leave at any time.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Well, that’s good to know.

                                 HARPER
                        But if you leave, you leave without 
                        the truth.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Yeah, I think I’ll take the loss.

           He turns to leave, but -

                                 HARPER 
                        Eric, every conclusion you have ever 
                        reached in your life has been founded 
                        upon the same misguided presumption. 

           Blayne slows, because, much to his chagrin... He’s intrigued... 

                                 BLAYNE
                        And that is?

                                 HARPER
                        That there is only one Earth.

           The statement just hangs there... Finally, Blayne smiles...
           Tries hard not to laugh at his obviously insane host...

           But then... Blayne sees something... Behind Harper’s eyes...
           Behind the warmth... Something he’s never seen before...

           THE TRUTH...

           As Blayne stands there, reeling -- The front door opens -
           And the most beautiful INDIAN WOMAN appears -

           YAATI -- About Blayne’s age, but the wisdom of the millennia 
           in her eyes -- She’s dressed in an authentic Indian Salwar...

                                 HARPER
                        Yaati, this is Eric. Perhaps you 
                        could show him around.

                                 YAATI
                        Of course.

           SHE OFFERS BLAYNE HER HAND... He regards it for a moment...
           But takes it -- And she leads him away -

           And something quite astonishing happens -- For a brief moment - 
           EVERYTHING AROUND THEM SLOWS -- Like the world is FROZEN IN TIME -
           The leaves in the wind... A passing bird... 
           Even Harper himself -

           And EVERYTHING IS BECOMING TRANSPARENT -
           VANISHING BEFORE OUR EYES -

           But Blayne doesn’t have time to consider this -
           Because Yaati continues to lead him -

                                                         SEAMLESSLY TO:

           EXT. MALIBU HILLS - EVENING

           THERE’S A VIOLENT RUSH OF SOUND -- THEN A SUDDEN QUIET -
           Blayne still holds Yaati’s hand -- But the Motorcourt,
           the Estate, Harper, everything has gone -- VANISHED -
           They’re standing on an EMPTY LOT in the Mountains -
           A SHEER CLIFF overlooking the Pacific -

           EXACTLY WHERE THE ESTATE WAS TWO SECONDS AGO -
           There are the POURED FOUNDATIONS for the Estate...
           The only building is an ORIENTAL TEMPLE TO ONE SIDE -
           Blayne snatches his hand back -

                                 YAATI
                        Do not be afraid...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...What the hell just happened?!

                                 YAATI
                        Eric - There are two Earths. We 
                        just switched from Earth One to...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...What are you talking about? 
                        Where’s the house?!

                                 YAATI
                        Eric... I am Unique. Just like you.
                        A Unique is able to bring another 
                        Unique across with them - But no 
                        other living tissue...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...Where’s the house?

                                 YAATI
                        The Estate exists only on one Earth.

           She indicates the ground and Blayne sees the POURED FOUNDATIONS -
           Yaati steps up onto the FOUNDATIONS and offers Blayne her hand 
           once again... This time he regards it with trepidation in his 
           eyes...

                                 YAATI (cont'd)
                        One cannot take another’s hand 
                        with a clenched fist.

                                 BLAYNE
                        You’re asking me to trust you?

                                 YAATI
                        No. We’re asking you to trust yourself.
           And even though that’s something Blayne has never done...
           He walks to her and takes her hand -

           Once again -- EVERYTHING SLOWS -- And THE ESTATE FADES IN -
           As they move -- SEAMLESSLY BACK TO -

           INT. FOYER, THE ESTATE - EVENING

           THERE’S A VIOLENT RUSH OF SOUND -- THEN A SUDDEN QUIET -
           Blayne and Yaati are now INSIDE the Estate...
           Blayne takes this all in... He looks tired... Drained...
           The FRONT DOOR opens and Harper steps in...

                                 HARPER
                        Welcome back.

           INT. LIBRARY, THE ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

           A perfectly tranquil setting... Blayne, still mind-blown -
           Sits opposite Harper as Yaati lays out a Japanese Tea...
           Once the “Chabako” has been set, Yaati retreats...
           And there’s a moment of stillness...

           Before Harper BANGS down a BOTTLE of JACK DANIEL’S -

                                 HARPER
                        These things tend to go one way or 
                        the other.

           Blayne considers his options -- Tea or whiskey...

                                 BLAYNE
                        I take it straight up.

           Harper accepts this -- Pours a shot -- Slides it to Blayne...

                                 HARPER
                        Straight up - There are two Earths. 
                        Separated by a thin sliver of quantum 
                        reality...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...And everyone’s just flipping 
                        back and forth?

                                 HARPER
                        No. Most of us have a twin, born on 
                        this other Earth. But a very rare 
                        few have the ability to switch. 
                        Between the Earths... These are the 
                        Uniques... May I ask when your 
                        delusions began?

           For the first time in a while, Blayne has nothing quippy...
           He looks to Yaati... Then down at his whiskey... 
           Then back to Harper... As he remembers the night terrors...

                                 BLAYNE
                        When I was a kid. I kept having 
                        this nightmare. I’d wake up in my 
                        house... Only it wasn’t my house... 
                        I’d run to my parents room...
                                 HARPER
                        ...Only they weren’t your parents. 
                        Because in this other world, you’d 
                        never been born.

           Harper opens a file -- Slides it to Blayne...
           He looks at it warily... 

           COPIES OF -- Blayne’s BIRTH RECORD -- His SCHOOL ENROLLMENT - 
           His Parent’s MARRIAGE LICENCE -- His Parents DIVORCE ORDER - 
           Blayne’s COMMITMENT PAPERS...

                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        You were born May 25th 1975 to 
                        Alice and Patrick Blayne... 
                        On E2. Earth Two. 

                                 BLAYNE
                        Have you been watching me?

                                 HARPER
                        No. When we received word from 
                        Doctor Richards that you had 
                        switched, we pulled some files 
                        from the Net...

           He slides Blayne a SECOND FILE and shows Blayne ANOTHER STORY...
           His Parent’s MARRIAGE LICENCE - Records of FERTILITY TREATMENTS...

                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        But you were not born here on E1. 
                        Your parents had trouble conceiving - 
                        They eventually adopted a little girl...

           Another PICTURE -- Pulled from some Adoption Agency’s Website -
           It’s BLAYNE’S PARENTS -- Proudly sitting with a LITTLE GIRL...
           MORE IMAGES -- Pulled from the WEB -- Blayne’s Mother -
           Elated at being elected Mayor of some small town...

                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        ...They live in New Mexico now.

           Blayne is dumbfounded -- Staring at the strange images of his 
           Parents... But what is most striking to Blayne is that his 
           Mother looks happy in this life...  

                                 HARPER
                        We believe there are no more than 
                        a few dozen Uniques in the world. 
                        Eleven are here with us, the rest 
                        are scattered to the four corners. 
                        Most, like you, have no clue to the 
                        Earth’s duality and find themselves 
                        disenfranchised from society. We 
                        seek them out and bring them here.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Why?

                                 HARPER
                        Because this is all my fault...

           A rare display on honesty... Blayne is intrigued...
                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        ...In 1974 I was working for the 
                        Energy Development Administration. 
                        On the 28th of July we flipped the 
                        switch on the World’s first Quadrupole 
                        Accelerator in hopes of igniting a 
                        stable fission reaction. It failed. 
                        Nothing happened... Or so we thought... 
                        There was a “side-effect...”

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. PLASMA LABORATORY - 1974 - NIGHT

           A mishmash of a lab, cobbled together on a shoestring and a dream -

                                 HARPER (V.O.) (cont'd) 
                        ...Unknown to us at the time, 
                        there was a chain reaction. On a 
                        sub-atomic level. It tore a rift in 
                        the space-time continuum...

           A SUDDEN FLASH OF QUANTUM ENERGY BURSTS FROM THE ACCELERATOR -
           And as the WAVE SWEEPS THROUGH THE LAB -- It TEARS A RIFT -
           RIPPING EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH IN TWO -- DOUBLING and DIVIDING -
           Then it’s gone -- The RESEARCH TEAM appears unaware...

                                                       QUICKLY BACK TO:

           EXT. ORIENTAL TEA HOUSE, THE ESTATE - DAY

                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        ...It took seven minutes to rip the 
                        Universe in half and create two 
                        identical Earths... Well, almost 
                        identical...

           He appears riddled with guilt about something...

                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        ...During that seven minutes a 
                        number of babies were conceived 
                        around the world - But they were 
                        only conceived on one Earth... 
                        Around ten months later...
                        The Uniques were born. 

           Blayne sits there... Calmly... Absorbing this...
           But you can tell -- Inside -- Something is brewing...
           Anger... Relief... Anger... Freedom... ANGER!!!!!
           All those years... All Harpers fault -----

           IMAGES FLASH THROUGH BLAYNE MIND -- HIS MISSING BIKE - 
           HIS REFRIGERATOR -- FILLED WITH MILK -- THEN EMPTY -
           THE NOTES ON HIS ARMS -- THE POLICE CALL -- THE GOD DAMN MILK!

           The PUNCH comes from nowhere -- Blayne just DECKS Harper -
           His chair flips back -- And Harper lies there -- Reeling...

                                 BLAYNE
                        A side effect?

           He downs the shot of whisky -- And leaves -
           EXT. MOTORCOURT, THE ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne is heading for the gates... Steadfast... Determined...
           He slows... And looks back to the Estate... A last thought...
           Then he turns away -- RIGHT INTO YAATI who has just APPEARED -

                                 YAATI
                        If you stay we can teach you to 
                        control...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...Why isn’t the sky blue?

           Yaati slows... Because she knows there’s a way to reel him in...

                                 YAATI
                        Several years ago, there was an 
                        anti-smog law was introduced on 
                        one Earth, but not the other.

           It’s all so simple when you know the answer...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Who are the Snake People?

           She steps closer...

                                 YAATI
                        Eric... All your answers are here.

           And as her words filter through... 
           Blayne regards the Estate...

                                 BLAYNE
                        I’ll give you one day... 
                        Show me what you got.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. TEMPLE, THE ESTATE - LATER

           Blayne stands in the center of the TRAINING TEMPLE...
           Yaati stands a few feet behind him...

                                 YAATI
                        Every switch you have ever made has 
                        been instinctual. Driven by fear. 
                        The need to run. The need to hide. 
                        We first need to teach you control.

           Yaati steps close -- Intimately close... 
           And whispers in his ear...

                                 YAATI (cont'd)
                        Have you ever had the feeling 
                        someone’s watching you - But when 
                        you turned to look - There was no 
                        one there? The other Earth is that 
                        close... It’s just beside you.

           Blayne lets the words filter through... 

                                 YAATI (cont'd)
                        Now, take a breath... And turn.
           Blayne takes a deep breath -- And turns -
           But he’s still at the Estate... Yaati touches his face...
           And close his eyes...

                                 YAATI (cont'd)
                        It’s just beyond what you can see... 
                        Just outside of what you know...
                        Don’t use your eyes to look for it... 
                        Use your mind... Just follow my voice... 
                        Take a breath... And slip through...

           Blayne takes another calming breath and turns -
           And as he does -- THE ESTATE BECOMES TRANSPARENT -
           Because they have entered -- ZERO TIME...

           EXT. ESTATE/MALIBU HILLS - ZERO TIME

           ZERO TIME -- The QUANTUM DIMENSION between the two Earths -
           HALF AT THE ESTATE -- AND HALF ON THE MALIBU HILLTOP -
           A SUPERIMPOSITION OF TWO GHOST WORLDS -

           The only solid object is the TEMPLE -
           BECAUSE IT EXISTS ON BOTH EARTHS...

           ALSO -- Although Blayne and Yaati are moving normally -
           EVERYTHING around them is moving at about 1/100th NORMAL PACE -

           The CAMERA SWIRLS AROUND BLAYNE -- As he realizes -
           HE CAN’T BREATHE - There’s no air in Zero Time - Fear looms -

           But Yaati is there -

                                 YAATI
                        You’re halfway there - 
                        Keep following my voice.

           Blayne turns to her - But they’re still in ZERO TIME -

                                 YAATI (cont'd)
                        Again.

           He turns once more - But gets nowhere - NOW HE’S CHOKING -

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...please...

                                 YAATI
                        ...You’ve done this a thousand 
                        times before - This isn’t about 
                        your abilities - It’s about your 
                        belief in them...

           She comes right up behind him -

                                 YAATI (cont'd)
                        ...NOW TURN TO ME!

           Blayne turns -- And the GHOST OF THE ESTATE VANISHES -
           As the MALIBU HILLS become SOLID -
           A CROSS-FADE BETWEEN EARTHS -

           EXT. MALIBU HILLS - DAY

           Blayne turns - And collapses - GASPING FOR AIR... Finally -
                                 BLAYNE
                        What was that? 

                                 YAATI
                        Between Earths - We call it Zero Time.

                                 BLAYNE
                        I couldn’t breathe. 

                                 YAATI
                        There is no air in Zero Time.

           Blayne shoots her a look -

                                 BLAYNE
                        ‘Heads up’ might have been nice.

                                 YAATI
                        I told you to take a breath...
                        Now... Switch again...

           She turns -- And a most extraordinary thing happens - 
           She becomes WAFER THIN -- TWO DIMENSIONAL -
           Like an image on a sheet of celluloid -
           She keeps turning -- BECOMING A THIN LINE -
           ONE DIMENSIONAL -- Then VANISHES...
           He just witnessed a SWITCH from an outsiders POV...

           Blayne steadies his breathing.... AND TURNS.....

                                                         SEAMLESSLY TO:
           EXT. ESTATE/MALIBU HILLS - ZERO TIME

           The GHOST OF THE ESTATE BEGINS TO FADE IN -
           Blayne -- Keeping deadly focused -- Continues to turn -
           As the ESTATE CONTINUES TO FADE IN and the HILLS FADE OUT -

                                                         SEAMLESSLY TO:
           EXT. TEMPLE, THE ESTATE - DAY

           Blayne turns to face Yaati... And something happens -
           Something that we haven’t seen from Blayne before... A SMILE...
           A glimmer of hope at the end of his dark, dark, tunnel...
           A glimpse of the end of his nightmares...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Maybe I’ll give you two days.

           Yaati tries not to share his smile...
           And focuses back on the lesson -

                                 YAATI
                        Again.

           Blayne turns away -- Becomes 2D -- 1D -- THEN VANISHES...

           And from a distance... Harper has ween watching...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           TRAINING MONTAGE...
           Over the next few days Yaati works with Blayne -
           There is a gentle quality to the exercises... Spiritual...
           Balance... Poise... Breathing... Concentration... 

           Then... Yaati begins to add OBSTACLES to the SWITCH -
           In the TEMPLE AT THE ESTATE she arranges PUNCHING BAGS -
           So as Blayne SWITCHES from the MALIBU HILLS TEMPLE -
           The PUNCHING BAGS APPEAR AS GHOSTS IN ZERO TIME -
           So he can avoid them...

           Then... Yaati hands Blayne a CLOCKWORK TOY ROBOT...

                                 YAATI
                        We have the ability to switch a 
                        small amount of inanimate material.

           He TURNS -- DISAPPEARS -- Then REAPPEARS with the toy robot -
           But when Yaati winds it -- The TOY SHATTERS -- REVEALING -
           The COGS and MOVEMENTS are FUSED -- MELTED... 
           MONTAGE -- He tries it again... And again...
           But always with the same result...

                                 BLAYNE
                        But I’ve switched with objects 
                        before - My watches.

                                 YAATI
                        But that was before you knew - 
                        Now, your mind is in the way - 
                        You must have a sense of every 
                        molecule in your body... Feel 
                        where metal touches your skin... 
                        Know that it is part of you...
                        Every atom of it... Connected...

           Blayne concentrates on the TOY -- WHERE IT TOUCHES HIS SKIN -
           THE PAINT -- THE METAL -- THE COGS -- THE SPRINGS...
           ALL CONNECTED... CONNECTED TO HIM...

           Blayne SWITCHES -- THROUGH ZERO TIME -- To THE MALIBU HILLS - 
           Where Yaati is waiting for him... Blayne unfurls his fist... 
           The tiny clock-work marvel is WALKING on his palm... 

           And a self-confident power is brewing inside Blayne...

           And all the time... Harper watches from a distance...

           INT. DINING ROOM, THE ESTATE - NIGHT

           Blayne enters to find a buffet dinner arranged on a side table...
           He takes a plate and fills it -- When suddenly -
           Something utterly bizarre happens -

           There’s a PUFF OF SMOKE -- RIGHT OUT OF THIN AIR -
           Blayne turns, startled -- But there’s no one there -
           He turns back to the buffet -- And there’s a MAN -

           This is XUN (tzun) -- Striking, of pure Chinese descent...
           He takes a last drag of his cigarette -- Then THROWS IT AWAY -
           But as it leaves his hand -- IT VANISHES INTO THIN AIR -
           He’s thrown it to the OTHER EARTH...

                                 BLAYNE
                        How...?
                                 XUN
                        ...Smoke and mirrors, baby.

           But, Xun breaks into an unexpected smile and extends his hand -

                                 XUN (cont'd)
                        I am Chiang Xun. Unique.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Eric Blayne. You’ll forgive me if I 
                        don’t shake your hand.

           Xun smiles -- Completely understanding -- When -
           Someone else APPEARS OUT OF THIN AIR -- This is -

           PENNY -- A beautiful spirit from KENYA -
           She brandishing Xun’s CIGARETTE BUTT -

                                 PENNY
                        For the last time - You’re going to 
                        start a fire!

                                 XUN
                        It’s a good trick.

                                 PENNY
                        It’s a stupid trick...
                             (she looks to Blayne)
                        Give this one a wide berth -
                        He is a bad influence.

           Blayne watches them as they fill their plates... 
           Bickering...Like brother and sister... Like family...
           And Blayne is warmed by this notion...

           And as he watches -- EVEN MORE UNIQUES BEGIN TO APPEAR -

           KICHE -- A Native American Girl -
           REINHART -- Australian -- Tough as nails -
           SUE -- A scrappy little Cockney girl -
           CARLOS -- A quiet Argentinian boy -
           SIMON -- A Carnival Freak-Show Tattoo canvas -

           And Blayne takes this in... They all appear to be...home.

           INT. BATHROOM, THE ESTATE - NIGHT

           Blayne showers... And SCRUBS AWAY the last of his notes...

           Finally, he emerges from the shower... Naked at last...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. TEMPLE, THE ESTATE - NIGHT

           MONTAGE -- Blayne practices alone -- SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH - 
           Taking increasingly difficult objects through with him -
           A BOOK... AN ANTIQUE CLOCK... ALL CONNECTED TO HIM...

           Then he tries to bring a FLOWER across - But try as he might -
           IT CAN’T BE DONE - Each time it’s like the flower is liquidized -
           Just a organic slime in his hand...
           He is at the TEMPLE IN THE MALIBU HILLS - DAWN
           When Yaati explains -

                                 YAATI
                        Apart from another Unique, 
                        we cannot switch living tissue -
                        No plants. No pets. No people.

                                 BLAYNE
                        You should get T-shirts made up.

           They share a smile...

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        How long have you known?

           A shadowy memory flashes across Yaati’s eyes...
           She looks to the SUN AS IT RISES BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS...

                                 YAATI
                        When I was a little girl I could 
                        escape from any room. At the age of 
                        four, my father sold me to a Jadoo - 
                        An Indian street magician. The 
                        Jadoo would invite people to bind 
                        my hands, lock me in a wooden 
                        crate, barricade me in some cellar. 
                        And I would escape by switching to 
                        the other Earth.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Then why didn’t you run away?

                                 YAATI
                        The Jadoo was all I knew. He was 
                        my home until Christian arrived - 
                        He had seen this documentary...
                             (struck by another thought)
                        You want to see something cool?

                                 BLAYNE
                        Always.

                                 YAATI
                        Check the sun. Then follow me.

           Blayne glances at the rising sun -- Then turns -
           Through ZERO TIME -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. TEMPLE, THE ESTATE - PRE-DAWN

           Blayne turns to the sun -- And realizes -- It’s twilight here - 
           The SUN HAS YET TO RISE ON EARTH ONE...

                                 YAATI
                        Seven minutes earlier, remember. 
                        It’s Time that separates the Earths.
                        So every day we get two sunrises. 

           As this notion sinks in... The SUN BURSTS OVER THE HILLS...
           FOR A SECOND TIME...

                                                        FLARE TO WHITE:
           WE HOLD IN THE BRILLIANCE... BEFORE FADING IN...
           Somewhere completely new...

           EXT. OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY (ORNL) - MORNING

           ESTABLISHING -- A sleek modern facility nestled in the forest...
           A TESLA ROADSTER pulls up at the GUARD GATE...

                                 GUARD
                        How can I help you this morning?

           The driver’s side window opens -- REVEALING -- Detective Weiss -
           Only -- SOMETHING’S DIFFERENT -- He has LESS HAIR -
           But there’s something distinctly ‘wealthy’ about him...

           THIS IS WEISS’ TWIN...

                                 WEISS’ TWIN 
                        I have an appointment with 
                        Professor Emily Fielding.

           INT. ACCELERATOR CHAMBER, ORNL - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           WE ARE INSIDE THE ACCELERATOR ITSELF -
           THE CAMERA HURTLING ROUND IN CIRCLES AND SOME RIDICULOUS SPEED -
           WHEN SUDDENLY -- THE ANGLE CHANGES -

           CLOSE ON ----------- THE DEVICE ----------

           A LENS - Held precisely in place by a web of MICRO FILAMENTS -
           IN FRONT OF A DAZZLING ARRAY OF PLATINUM MICROCHIPS -
           ALL CONTAINED WITHIN A SMALL TITANIUM CAGE -
           It looks VERY EXPENSIVE -

           A DOZEN BEAMS OF LASER LIGHT HIT THE LENS -- And are REFRACTED -
           TOWARDS THE MICROCHIPS... And.... And........ And..........
           Absolutely nothing happens.

           The CAMERA PULLS FOCUS -- TO A SMALL WINDOW that looks in -
           THROUGH which we see -- Weiss’ Twin -- And -

           Professor EMILY FIELDING -- Mid-thirties -- Attractive -
           But that’s not what is truly appealing about EMILY - 
           There’s a fire that burns behind her eyes...

                                 EMILY
                        And that’s where it all goes wrong.

           OUTSIDE THE ACCELERATOR -- Weiss follows Emily to a DISPLAY -
           That demonstrates the bad news with COMPUTER GRAPHICS -

                                 EMILY (cont'd)
                        The lens simply doesn’t have the 
                        refractive power to focus the beams 
                        on the array. I feel terrible, 
                        you’ve spent a fortune on this...

                                 WEISS’ TWIN
                        ...So what do you need?

           Emily laughs it off -
                                 EMILY
                        Well, there’s only one material 
                        that could do it. Diamond. And you 
                        can see the size it would have to 
                        be. It’s prohibitively expensive. 

                                 WEISS’ TWIN
                        How prohibitive?

                                 EMILY
                        Well... Thirty million, at least.

           But Weiss’ Twin isn’t smiling...

                                 WEISS’ TWIN
                        Cash or check?

           Emily hesitates...
                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BLAYNE’S ROOM, THE ESTATE - MORNING

           Blayne wakes gently...

           EXT. MOTORCOURT, THE ESTATE - LATER

           Yaati leads Blayne out...

                                 YAATI
                        Today you will master Zero Time.

                                 BLAYNE
                        I thought I had.

                                 YAATI
                        No. All you have done is avoid it.
                        Come with me now... Take a breath.

           Blayne takes a deep breath - And follows Yaati -

                                                         SEAMLESSLY TO:

           EXT. MOTORCOURT/MALIBU HILLS - ZERO TIME

           NOTE: READ THIS SCENE SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY -
           ZERO TIME IS TRICKY TO EXPLAIN WITHOUT A DIGITAL EFFECT!

                                 YAATI (cont'd)
                        On both Earths time is almost 
                        standing still...

           She shows Blayne a LEAKY FAUCET -- There’s a DROPLET -
           Or rather THE GHOST OF A DROPLET as it only exists on one Earth -
           The droplet is almost frozen in time -- Falling VERY SLOWLY -

                                 YAATI (cont'd)
                        Just as you have learned to control 
                        every molecule of your body. In 
                        Zero Time, you can learn to control 
                        every molecule of your environment.

           She takes the BASEBALL and tosses it from one hand to the other -
           As she does, the most extraordinary thing happens -
           IT STRETCHES -- LIKE AN ARCHING SNAKE OF STITCHED LEATHER -
           So that when she catches it in the other hand -
           She’s left with a perfect ARCH -- Like a LEATHER ‘POOL NOODLE’ -

           She hands the strange object to Blayne -
           And the moment it touches his hand -
           It SHRINKS BACK DOWN TO A REGULAR BASEBALL AGAIN...

                                 YAATI
                        Step out to breathe...

           They turn -- And the ESTATE BECOMES SOLID AGAIN -

           EXT. MOTORCOURT, THE ESTATE - DAY

           Yaati and Blayne take a BREATH -

                                 YAATI
                        ...Now your turn.

           They turn -- AND THE ESTATE FADES INTO THE MALIBU HILLS -

           EXT. MOTORCOURT/MALIBU HILLS - ZERO TIME

           Blayne focuses on the BASEBALL and tosses it from one hand 
           to the other -- But it just acts like a regular ball...
           Yaati steps closer and takes his hand...

                                 YAATI (cont'd)
                        Fell the leather against your skin.
                        Feel the entire ball as part of you.

           Blayne focuses again and tosses the ball -- And it happens -
           It GROWS -- From one hand to the other -- He holds the ARCH -
           Then concentrates -- And the ARCH shrinks back to a BALL...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Trippy.

           He tosses the ball from hand to hand like a leather slinky -
           His confidence building -- Throwing it higher and higher -
           Then he catches it -- And PITCHES IT -- And it STREEEEEEEEETCHES -
           ALL THE WAY -- FIFTY YARDS -- BOUNCING ON THE GROUND...
           Yaati is almost able to hide how impresses she is...

           And that’s when Blayne sees Harper -- Walking in the Motorcourt -
           Several bizarre things are happening to him...
           Firstly, he’s a GHOST as he only exists on one Earth...
           Secondly, he’s moving in SUPER-SLOW MOTION...
           And thirdly, something weird is happening to his flesh -
           As he moves forward he occupies all the space he has taken up -
           Let me simplify that -- He’s GROWING -
           Just like the baseball grew - He is BECOMING SNAKE LIKE -

                                 BLAYNE
                        The Snake Men.

           Blayne turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -
           EXT. MOTORCOURT, THE ESTATE - DAY

           Blayne turns as Harper picks up the baseball...
           As always, he’s been watching the whole time... 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. LIBRARY, THE ESTATE - NIGHT

           Blayne finds Harper alone... There’s a long silence as Blayne 
           summons the courage to apologize...

                                 BLAYNE
                        I’m sorry for... you know...
                             (hitting you)

                                 HARPER
                        I can understand the animosity you 
                        must harbor.

                                 BLAYNE
                        I doubt it.

           But Harper knows something Blayne doesn’t...

                                 HARPER
                        Thirty years ago, my wife and I 
                        were woken in the night by the 
                        sound of a baby crying. On the 
                        floor of our guest room, we found a 
                        newborn. Alone. Screaming. Before 
                        we could contact the authorities, 
                        the child vanished. Right from my 
                        wife’s arms. This happened several 
                        times over the next few months... 
                        Then an even stranger thing begun 
                        to happen. The child would be 
                        calmed when I appeared - As if he 
                        knew me... He was my son. Born to 
                        my twin on the other Earth... 

           Blayne is silenced by this revelation...

                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        ...This is how I came to learn of 
                        the...side-effect of the failed 
                        experiment... There came a day when 
                        I had to tell him what I had done... 
                        I have never seen such rage in 
                        another soul... But even he grew to 
                        forgive me. As will you.

           Blayne considers this...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Where is he now? Your son.

           A shroud of sadness begins to fall...

                                 HARPER
                        One day he just stopped visiting. 
                        We had no idea what had happened. 
                        We though perhaps his other family 
                        had moved away. Or the door between 
                        the worlds had somehow closed... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        But then... We found his body. 
                        Buried. In our own back yard... 
                        I have subsequently come to learn 
                        that his father had dug foundations 
                        for a pool... Andrew must have been 
                        playing in the hole... When he 
                        switched... Into solid earth.

           It’s a disturbing mental image, but Harper swallows the pain 
           once more...

                                 BLAYNE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 HARPER
                        My son died before I knew enough to 
                        protect him. Before I could build 
                        this...
                             (he indicates the Estate)
                        ...Home.

           Blayne finds comfort in this... He turns to leave...

                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        You know, there is still one 
                        question you haven’t asked.

                                 BLAYNE
                        And that is?

                                 HARPER
                        What do I want from you?

           Blayne looks back... Intrigued...
                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSES, VAN NUYS CA - DAWN

           Grey... Quiet... An SUV arrives -- Yaati and Blayne step out... 
           Yaati approaches a building - Takes out a set of bolt cutters - 
           She removes the PADLOCK  - And opens a door - AN ALARM SOUNDS -

                                 YAATI
                        We have about four minutes.

           She steps inside and Blayne follows... Curious...

           INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           An inventor’s ‘tinker shop’ -- Mechanical parts everywhere - 
           Electric motors -- Batteries -- POST IT NOTES strewn about...

                                 YAATI
                        Eve Enterprises. A pipe dream of 
                        one Daniel Russet - Five years ago 
                        he set out to single-handedly solve 
                        the world’s energy problems by 
                        reinventing the electric motor.
                        He’s failed. Lost everything -
                        His home, his family... However...

           She turns and Blayne follows her -- SEAMLESSLY TO -
           INT. WAREHOUSE - ZERO TIME

           As they turn -- VARIOUS OBJECTS APPEAR -- AND DISAPPEAR -
           As they continue -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. WAREHOUSE (E2) - DAWN

           Yaati and Blayne step into the same Warehouse on EARTH 2 -
           The place is much neater -- And there are BOXES piled up -
           And the alarm isn’t ringing... Yaati opens a box - REVEALING - 
           A MOTOR -

                                 YAATI
                        Here on Earth Two Daniel Russet’s 
                        twin came up with this... The EM 10. 
                        More power than a V6 combustion 
                        engine. A six minute charge will 
                        power a average sized sedan for over 
                        four-hundred miles. Clean. Cheap. 
                        The Holy Grail for alternative fuel 
                        vehicles.

           Yaati picks up the MOTOR and turns -- 2D -- 1 D - GONE...
           Blayne follows...

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSES, VAN NUYS CA - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           SECURITY GUARDS wait as a HOME MADE ELECTRIC VEHICLE putters up -
           And DANIEL RUSSET hurries out -

                                 DANIEL
                        Is anything missing?! My entire 
                        life is in there!

           The SECURITY GUARDS shrug -- Not really caring -
           And Daniel hurries inside -

           INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Daniel races in -- His eyes darting about...
           Mentally checking his CLUTTERED INVENTORY...
           But then he falters -- Because there... On his work bench...
           The EM 10 MOTOR... Just sitting there...
           Like little elves have left him the magic box...

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Everything alright?

                                 DANIEL
                        Everything’s going to be fine.

           Daniel swallows with heady anticipation...

           Blayne sits with Harper...

                                 BLAYNE
                        We’re thieves?
                                 HARPER
                        While there are a few rogue Uniques 
                        who have chosen to use their powers 
                        for their own material gain, that 
                        is not what we do.

                                 BLAYNE
                        So you’re just giving that motor to 
                        this guy on the other Earth?

                                 HARPER
                        Eric, some ideas are simply too 
                        revolutionary not to share. 
                        A bacteria that eats oil slicks - 
                        A safer car-seat for children - 
                        A vaccine against cervical cancer.

           Blayne considers the implications of this philanthropy...

                                 BLAYNE
                        So that’s it - We’re pan- 
                        dimensional Robin Hoods?

                                 HARPER
                        That’s the job.

           Blayne tries not to smile... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - LATER

           Blayne speeds on his BIKE to some as yet unknown destination...

           EXT. TRAILER PARK, PALMDALE CA - LATER

           Blayne heels his bike and checks an address...
           It’s the right place... He takes a deep breath...
           And makes his way to a particularly quaint trailer...
           He knocks and after a few moments a WOMAN appears...

           It takes a second to recognize BLAYNE’S MOTHER -
           ALICE... Time has not been generous to her pained face...

           The two regard one another for along moment...

                                 BLAYNE
                        I’ve been meaning to stop by.

                                 ALICE
                        I was hoping you would.

           She takes her son’s hands... And begins to weep...

                                 BLAYNE
                        No, why you gotta be like that...

                                 ALICE
                        ...My baby’s come home...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...Oh, God...
           He helps her inside...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MOTORCOURT, THE ESTATE - DAY

           Blayne follows Harper to the SIX CAR GARAGE...
           Harper takes out a remote -- Punches in a code -
           And all THREE DOUBLE DOORS of the Garage OPEN UP -- REVEALING -

           THE COMMAND CENTER...

                                 BLAYNE
                        You love that part, don’t you?

           Harper indicates that he does --  And they head into -

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, THE ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           Blayne and Harper are met by -

           PATRICK REINHART -- The Chief Security Officer -

                                 HARPER
                        Patrick Reinhart - Eric Blayne.

                                 REINHART
                        The Blinder?

                                 HARPER
                        He’s just going to observe.

           Blayne follows Reinhart and Harper through the CROWDED ROOM -
           This is HIGH TECH and BUSY -- Video monitors -- Internet feeds -
           There’s TWO EARTH MAPS -- Marked E1 and E2 -- With TWO CLOCKS -

                                 HARPER
                        Center of our Universe.

                                 REINHART
                        Put this on.

           Reinhart hands Blayne a BRIGHT YELLOW TWO-FACED WATCH -
           Blayne slips it on -

                                 REINHART (cont'd)
                        You are now part of the Universe...
                        It is a two-way and a locator - 
                        You are not a prisoner - You can 
                        remove the watch at any time - 
                        But, trust me - You will not want to - 

           Reinhart holds up his own watch -- WELDED around his wrist... 
           Then he indicates the E1 MAP -- A NEW BLIP APPEARS -- BLAYNE -
           Blayne sees that there’s MORE BLIPS ACROSS BOTH MAPS -

           Harper unfolds a LAPTOP COMPUTER -- Hits a few buttons -
           A PICTURE APPEARS ON A SCREEN -- A SERIES OF CANDID SHOTS - 
           SCIENTISTS -- Entering DIFFERENT BUILDINGS...
                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        A research team here on Earth One 
                        is on the brink of creating a stable 
                        quantum reaction - Unlimited free 
                        energy... And here - UC-Berkeley, 
                        on Earth Two - Department of Nuclear 
                        Engineering - Also on the brink of 
                        creating a stable quantum reaction - 
                        Now, in a beautiful twist of 
                        synchronicity, each team holds the 
                        key that will unlock the other’s 
                        breakthrough. The Uniques will 
                        provide the conduit through which 
                        that information will flow.

                                                            QUICKLY TO:

           INT. PRIVATE HANGER, VAN NUYS AIRPORT - LATER

           Blayne and Reinhart hurry into a waiting AIRPLANE -
           A JET BLACK BUSINESS JET -- It is a slick looking vessel...

           INT. JET - CONTINUOUS

           Xun is already aboard -- With the final member of the team -
           KICHE -

                                 REINHART
                        Blayne - You know Xun. 
                        And this is Kiche.

                                 BLAYNE
                        ‘Quiche’? Like the egg dish...?

                                 KICHE
                        ...No, not like the egg dish. It’s 
                        Cree Indian. It means “Sky Spirit”.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Oh. It’s pretty.

                                 KICHE
                        Yeah.

           She turns away...

                                 XUN
                        Nicely done, Slick.

           EXT. VAN NUYS AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

           The Jet takes off...
                                                       FAST FORWARD TO:

           EXT. MCGHEE TYSON AIRPORT, TENNESSEE - DAY

           The Jet lands... And taxis into -

           INT. PRIVATE HANGER, MCGHEE TYSON AIRPORT - SAME TIME

           Reinhart, Kiche, Xun and Blayne disembark -
           And are met by a GUARD -
                                 GUARD
                        You are cleared for Switch.

           Reinhart, Kiche and Xun step into a MARKED AREA -- Turn -
           BECOME 2D -- 1D -- Then DISAPPEAR... But then Blayne hesitates...
           Because he knows -- This next move -- Is full commitment...

                                 GUARD (cont'd)
                        Is there a problem?

                                 BLAYNE
                        No. No problem.

           Blayne turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. PRIVATE HANGER, MCGHEE TYSON AIRPORT, E2 - DAY

           The place is identical -- Blayne steps in line with the others -
           SEVERAL VEHICLES are waiting for them -- SUV’s, trucks, etc...
           Reinhart and Kiche walk to a gorgeous BLACK SUV -

                                 REINHART
                        This is ours - You two follow 
                        behind.

                                 BLAYNE
                        In what?

           There’s a slight smirk on Reinhart’s face as he points out -
           A CHERRY PICKER CRANE... Blayne and Xun’s hearts sink...

                                                       FAST FORWARD TO:

           EXT. ROUTE 162, TENNESSEE, E2 - DAY

           The BLACK SUV crosses the Clinch River...
           Followed closely by the CHERRY PICKER CRANE... Finally -
           The SUV and the Cherry Picker pull over to the side of the road...
           Dense forest for MILES IN ALL DIRECTIONS -- NO BUILDINGS -
           Reinhart, Kiche, Xun and Blayne climb out... 
           Reinhart talks to his watch -

                                 REINHART
                        How we looking on the other side?

                                 WATCH COMM.
                        Satellite is clear.

                                 REINHART
                        Then let’s go.

           Reinhart turns -- And DISAPPEARS -- Followed by Kiche -
           Then Xun... And lastly Blayne -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. ROUTE 162, TENNESSEE, E1 - DAY

           Blayne turns and joins Reinhart, Kiche and Xun - 
           Here on EARTH ONE it’s a very different setting -
           They are standing at a MAJOR INTERSECTION with Route 162 -
           And a PAVED ROAD leads to the OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY -
           (Where Weiss’ Twin met with Emily Fielding) -

           Blayne takes a moment to compute this...
           And realize some thing momentous...
                                 REINHART
                        Xun and I will take outside 
                        measurements - Kiche and Blayne - 
                        You’re inside.
                             (he notices Blayne’s 
                              distraction)
                        What’s the matter?

                                 BLAYNE
                        The differences - Between the Earths - 
                        The buildings - The sky - They’re all 
                        because of us - Because of the 
                        differences we’ve made.

           Reinhart sighs and heads towards the facility...

                                 REINHART
                        This is why I don’t like bringing 
                        Blinders...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...But I’m right, aren’t I?
                        From the moment we were born...

                                 KICHE
                        ...Actually from the moment we were 
                        conceived - One couple pregnant - 
                        Their twins not...

                                 REINHART
                        ...Don’t encourage him...

                                 KICHE
                        ...And the divergence is just 
                        getting wider...

           INT. ORNL - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           This place must have cost a fortune -- It’s beautiful...
           Blayne and Kiche have joined the SMALL TOUR GROUP...

                                 GUIDE
                        Oak Ridge National Laboratory is home 
                        to the nation’s largest Quadrupole 
                        Accelerator...
                             (blah, blah, blah...)

           But Blayne and Kiche are in their own conversation...
           It’s like he’s getting all the ‘inside information’...

                                 KICHE
                        ...What’s weird is that as the Earths 
                        become more bifucated - Synchronicity
                        remains unaltered...
                             (off Blayne’s look)
                        ...There is a connection between Earth 
                        Twins. When one is elated, the other 
                        will feel an unexpected feeling of 
                        euphoria... Or a sudden wave of 
                        sadness when the other is depressed. 

           EXT. ORNL - SAME TIME

           Xun stands next to a LOCKED UTILITY DOOR -
           And talks to his watch -
                                 XUN
                        I’m outside main communications.
                        Take my mark.

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, THE ESTATE - SAME TIME

           An OPERATOR is getting a fix on Xun’s position...

                                 OPERATOR
                        Hold steady for thirty seconds...

           INT. SECOND STORY, ORNL - SAME TIME

           The Tour Group reaches the top of a SET OF STAIRS -

                                 KICHE
                        ...and it totally explains ‘Love at 
                        first sight’ - It’s not some woo-
                        woo emotion - It’s simply because 
                        the twins have met before - On the
                        other Earth. So ‘Love at first 
                        sight’ is something Uniques will 
                        never experience.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Someone sounds bitter.

           It’s said with a smile -- They pass a set of security doors - 

                                 GUIDE
                        The Spallation accelerator is 
                        through these doors - That’s off 
                        limits to us, but if you follow me 
                        I can show you a scale model...

           The group heads off, but Kiche and Blayne linger...
           Once alone, Kiche stands by the doors and addresses her watch -

                                 KICHE
                        I’m in position. Take my mark.

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, THE ESTATE - SAME TIME

                                 OPERATOR
                        Hold steady for thirty seconds...

           INT. SECOND STORY, ORNL - SAME TIME

           Blayne and Kiche wait anxiously at the Accelerator door...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Sorry about the egg-dish thing.

                                 KICHE
                        If you were the first I’d be pissed.

           SUDDENLY -- SOMEONE appears -

           EMILY FIELDING -- From the earlier scene with WEISS’ TWIN -
           She’s kinda surprised to see them there -

                                 EMILY
                        Can I help you?
                                 BLAYNE
                        No, we’re good. We’re with the tour.

           Their eyes hold... And in that tense moment...
           Something utterly unexpected happens...
           Call it Kismet... Call it love... Call it pheromones -
           It’s right there -- Between them... 

           Finally -- Emily turns away to see the tour up ahead...

                                 EMILY
                        You mean, that tour?

                                 BLAYNE
                        Yes. That’s the one.

                                 EMILY
                        Because you shouldn’t really be here. 
                        Alone.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Well...we’ll just...go then...

           Kiche shoots Blayne a “We-need-more-time” look -

                                 BLAYNE
                        Actually - Is there a -er- toilet? 
                        I need a toilet... Badly.

                                 EMILY
                        Just ahead. With the tour.

           “Still-more-time”... Blayne’s just winging it now -- Badly -

                                 BLAYNE
                        So apparently this Neutron goes 
                        into a bar and says to the Barman, 
                        “How much for a beer?” And the 
                        Barman says, “For you - No charge.”

           There’s a nasty quiet... Until...

                                 EMILY
                        Have you heard? Entropy isn’t what 
                        it used to be.

           Utterly lost, Kiche watches them share a soft smile...
           Then her WATCH BEEPS “Thank God!” -

                                 KICHE
                        Okay - I think I need a toilet now.

           She gives Blayne a “Leave-now” glare...

                                 BLAYNE
                        I have to go...
                             (reading her name tag)
                        ...Doctor Fielding.

                                 EMILY
                        Emily.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Eric.
                                 KICHE
                        Okay - Leaving now.

           Blayne follows Kiche -- And Emily heads for the Accelerator -
           And they do that thing -- You know -- Where one turns back -
           But the other isn’t looking -- Then the other turns back -
           And same thing - Neither sees the other one looking...
           Staring... Wondering... It’s really kinda cute...

           Blayne turns to Kiche -

                                 BLAYNE
                        What was that about Uniques and 
                        ‘Love at first sight’...?

                                 KICHE
                             (mildly annoyed)
                        ...Just... Concentrate on why we’re 
                        here...

           EXT. ORNL - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           The FOUR meet back up and Reinhart address his watch...

                                 REINHART
                        Alpha complete.

                                 WATCH COMM.
                        Satellite is clear. Although there 
                        is a light rain.

                                 XUN
                        God damn.

                                 BLAYNE
                        What’s wrong with the rain?

                                 XUN
                        You’ll see.

           The four turn -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. ROUTE 162, TENNESSEE, E2 - DAY

           The four turn to face the FOREST -- The SUV is still there...
           The RAIN IS QUITE HEAVY -- Blayne immediately starts CHOKING -
           Then he pukes up a lung full of water -- And notices -
           HIS HANDS ARE BLOATED -- His face -- Everything -
           Just like EVERYONE else -

                                 REINHART
                        You just morphed with about a 
                        gallon of rain - Don’t worry -
                        You’ll piss it out in a couple of 
                        hours.

           EXT. FIELD OFF ROUTE 162, E2 - LATER

           Everyone’s bloating has gone by now... Reinhart is 
           stabilizing the CHERRY PICKER in the muddy earth -
           Xun is TRACKING his EXACT POSITION on a WRIST COMPUTER -
           LONGITUDE -- LATITUDE -- HEIGHT ASL -
                                 XUN
                        I am at my mark - Directly outside 
                        main communications.

           He drives a STAKE IN THE GROUND -- Then takes two paces forward -

                                 XUN (cont'd)
                        I am now inside main 
                        communications.

                                 WATCH COMM.
                        Xun - You are green.

           Xun gives a last smile and turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. MAIN COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ORNL - NIGHT

           Xun turns and orientates himself -- It’s one of those cramped 
           communications room -- Banks of telephone lines and video feeds -
           He quickly finds the junction box he’s looking for -
           And HACKS INTO THE SECURITY CAMERAS -

           EXT. FIELD OFF ROUTE 162, E2 - NIGHT

           Reinhart reacts to his watch -

                                 WATCH COMM.
                        We have eyes.

           And he climbs into the Cherry Picker BASKET -

                                 REINHART
                        Blayne - Remain here on X-tract. 
                        This field is hot. Nothing changes. 
                        Keep it clean.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Understand.

                                 REINHART
                        Kiche - Shadow me. 

                                 KICHE
                        Don’t you love it when he gets all 
                        military?

           Reinhart offers her a hand and pulls her up -- BUT SUDDENLY -
           SHE SLIPS ON THE WET METAL RAILING -- Her ANKLE TWISTS -
           And she crumbles -

                                 KICHE (cont'd)
                        Dagh!

                                 REINHART
                        You okay?

           She tries to stand -- But there’s no way -
           She shakes her head -- Furious at herself... 
           Reinhart looks to Blayne... Then addresses his Watch -

                                 REINHART
                        Kiche is out of action -
                        Please advise.
           INT. COMMAND CENTER, THE ESTATE - SAME TIME

           Harper is considering every angle...

           EXT. FIELD OFF ROUTE 162, E2 - NIGHT

           For a long moment nothing happens... Then -

                                 WATCH COMM.
                        Blayne will shadow. If comfortable.

           Reinhart looks to Blayne -- Who simply nods -- He’s in...

           Blayne climbs in to the BASKET --  And they start to rise...
           Reinhart is tracking their exact position on his WRIST COMPUTER -

                                 REINHART
                        Little higher... Left... More...
                        Forward - Stop. We are at the mark.
                        The doors right there...

           He indicates an empty space in front of them -
           Then checks a schematic on his wrist computer...

                                 REINHART (cont'd)
                        ...Six feet forward... And six 
                        inches up... We’re now inside.

                                 WATCH COMM.
                        Destination is clear -
                        You are green.

           Reinhart takes an ALUMINUM CASE -- Then he turns away -
           And disappears -- Then Blayne follows -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. OFF LIMIT CORRIDOR, ORNL - EVENING

           Blayne turns -- And drops SIX INCHES to the floor -
           Stumbles, but keeps his balance --

                                 REINHART
                        We raise the basket six inches so 
                        as not to morph with the floor - 
                        ‘Cause that ain’t pretty...

           He takes out a CAN OF SPRAY PAINT and marks the ground -
           A CIRCLE with an ‘S’ INSIDE -

                                 REINHART (cont'd)
                        This is your safe return. Switch 
                        anywhere else on this level and 
                        it’s six stories straight down.

           Reinhart switches his WRIST COMPUTER to the SECURITY CAMERA FEED -
           And they head up the corridor -- Through another set of doors -

           INT. ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - NIGHT

           (Where Emily and Weiss’ Twin ran the failed experiment...)
           Blayne follows Reinhart to the ACCELERATOR CONTROL PANEL -
           Reinhart takes a specialized screwdriver from the case -
           And begins to remove a panel...
                                 BLAYNE
                        Know much about particle 
                        accelerators?

           Reinhart indicates the schematic on his wrist computer -

                                 REINHART
                        Just following instructions.

           He pulls out the first SCREW... THREE MORE TO GO...
           Blayne’s eyes scan the perimeter... Tension thick in the air...
           But then -- An unexpected moment between the two men...

                                 REINHART
                        So... A month ago - Think you’d 
                        find yourself doing this?

                                 BLAYNE
                        I was just hoping to find my way 
                        home.

           Reinhart accepts this with reminiscent empathy...

                                 REINHART
                        Seems like another lifetime, right?
                        Being blind.

                                 BLAYNE
                        How many more of us are out there?

                                 REINHART
                        Don’t know. Few dozen. Maybe less.
                        I try not to think about it.

                                 BLAYNE
                             (correcting him)
                        Them. You try not to think about them.

           Reinhart acknowledges this sad truth... And removes the PANEL -
           He reaches in... And carefully takes something out...

           THE DEVICE... 

           Now complete with an ENORMOUS DIAMOND at its heart...

                                 REINHART
                        Open the case.

           Blayne does so... And Reinhart carefully secures THE DEVICE...

                                 REINHART (cont'd)
                        Motor time.

           INT. OFF LIMIT CORRIDOR, ORNL - MOMENTS LATER

           Reinhart and Blayne hurry back to the SAFE RETURN -
           Reinhart talks to his watch as they approach the SECURITY DOORS -

                                 REINHART

           She’s in the CHERRY PICKER CAB -- MOVING THE VEHICLE -
           BACKING IT UP -- RIGHT OVER THE STAKE THAT XUN HAMMERED IN -

                                 KICHE
                        Return is set.

           Reinhart plummets SIX STORIES straight down -
           And CRACKS HIS SKULL on the CRANE BASKET BELOW -

                        No. Still awaiting his return.

           She takes the Aluminum Case from Reinhart -
           And walks away -- Leaving Reinhart unconscious...

           The CAMERA MOVES IN ON Xun’s bloody body...
           And suddenly -- His eyes open -- So he sees as -

           A QUAD ALL TERRAIN VEHICLE FLASHES OUT OF THIN AIR -
           And SKIDS to a standstill beside Kiche -
           The HELMETED RIDER helps her on -- And they TEAR AWAY...

           INT. OFF LIMIT CORRIDOR, ORNL - SAME TIME

           Blayne freezes -- Because -- Outside the SECURITY DOORS -
           MOVEMENT -- Feet shuffling -- GUARDS ARE ASSEMBLING...
           He dives through an UNLOCKED DOOR -

           INT. LOCKER ROOM, ORNL - CONTINUOUS

           Blayne orientates himself -- Starts opening lockers -
           Finding -- A LAB COAT -- He slips it on -- And turns -

           Right as -- EMILY walks from the SHOWER CUBICLE -
           Wrapped in a towel -- Blayne covers his eyes -

                                 EMILY
                        Jesus! What are you doing in here?!
                                 BLAYNE
                        Co-Ed!

                                 EMILY
                        What?!

                                 BLAYNE
                        I thought it was co-ed...

                                 EMILY
                        ...No! Turn around!

           Blayne does -- And Emily scurries into a robe -

                                 EMILY (cont'd)
                        That’s why we have signs the doors -
                        To alert the more inquisitive amongst 
                        us as to what might be on the other 
                        side - If you see one that looks like a 
                        red bow tie, don’t go in - It means 
                        there’s nuclear waste...

           It’s about now that Emily notices Blayne’s face in the MIRROR -
           And she falters... 

                                 EMILY (cont'd)
                        ...Wait... You...

           For a brief moment, she’s warmed by his recollection -
           But then, the implications dawn...

                                 EMILY (cont'd)
                        You were on the tour. 

                                 BLAYNE
                        Yeah...I...got lost - You know -
                        Wandered off...

                                 EMILY
                        ...No - There’s a head count - 
                        And this is a restricted area -
                        What are you doing here?

           Blayne hesitates -- And Emily HITS A PANIC BUTTON -
           ALARMS SOUND -- And Blayne runs -

           INT. OFF LIMIT CORRIDOR, ORNL - CONTINUOUS

           Blayne runs back towards the far doors -
           But they’re NOW LOCKED DOWN -- He’s trapped...

           Then he sees -- On the wall -- A large painted sign -
           LEVEL SIX... And he knows what he has to do...
           At the far end of the CORRIDOR -- THE DOOR UNBOLTS -
           This is it -- They’re coming through -
           He turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. FIELD OFF ROUTE 162, E2 - NIGHT

           Blayne appears out of thin air -- SIX STORIES UP -
           He starts to FALL -- But he twists again -- SEAMLESSLY TO -
           INT. LEVEL FIVE, ORNL - NIGHT

           Blayne re-appears out of thin air -- A FOOT FROM THE FLOOR -
           And falls to the tiles -- He looks up at the large painted sign -
           LEVEL FIVE... And a wry smile flashes across his face -
           IT’S GONNA WORK...

           INT. LEVEL SIX, ORNL - SAME TIME

           Guards burst through the doors -- As Emily appears -
           To an empty corridor...

                                 EMILY
                        He was right here.

           INT. LEVEL FIVE, ORNL - SAME TIME

           Blayne stands -- Prepares -- And turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. FIELD OFF ROUTE 162, E2 - NIGHT

           Blayne appears -- Falls -- And twists -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. LEVEL FOUR, ORNL - NIGHT

           Blayne re-appears -- Falls to the tiled floor -

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, THE ESTATE - SAME TIME

           Harper’s ASTONISHED EYES flash from one EARTH MAP to the OTHER -
           As Blayne’s BLIP zips back and forth...

           INT. GROUND LEVEL, ORNL - NIGHT

           Blayne falls to the floor -- And rolls -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. FIELD OFF ROUTE 162, E2 - NIGHT

           Blayne drops the last couple of feet to the muddy ground...
           He pulls himself up and controls his breathing...
           Then sees -- Reinhart -- Unconscious -- And Xun’s bloody corpse...
           Them... He addresses his watch...

                                 BLAYNE
                        She still wearing her watch?
                                                              SMASH TO:

           EXT. OAK RIDGE WOODS, E2 - NIGHT

           CHASE SEQUENCE -- The ATV SPEEDS along a WOODLAND TRAIL... 
           When suddenly -- There’s a THUNDEROUS ROAR FROM BEHIND -
           As the SUV TEARS AFTER THEM -

           We see Blayne in the SUV -- Wrathful -- Determined -
           It BOUNCES and CRASHES ALONG -- Almost rolling -

           ON THE ATV -- Kiche realizes -- She still has her watch -

           She rips it off -- And tosses it -- Then TAKES OUT A WEAPON -
           A STUBBY LITTLE MACHINE GUN -- AND FIRES -- SPEWING BULLETS -
           It sounds like a high-pitched sewing machine -- 
           Thpthpthpthpthp!
           The CHASE CONTINUES -- Around trees -- THROUGH STREAMS -
           DOWN HILLS - And onto -

           EXT. BRIDGE, OAK RIDGE WOODS, E2 - NIGHT

           A TWO LANE SUSPENSION BRIDGE across a DEEP RAVINE -
           Empty -- Not a car in sight -- The ATV hits it first -
           Then Blayne in the SUV -- Now he’s got them -
           He drops a gear and accelerates -- About to PLOUGH THEN DOWN -
           When -- The ATV VANISHES -- It skids -- BECOMES 2-D -- 1-D -
           Then disappears -- THEY SWITCHED -

           INSIDE THE SUV -- Blayne reacts to this -- Then a calm settles -

           He knows what he has to do... He re-grips the steering wheel -
           Feeling the leather against his skin... The STEERING COLUMN...
           THE CHASSIS... THE ENTIRE SUV -- It’s all CONNECTED...
           It’s all part of him... HE HEAVES THE WHEEL - AND -
           The SUV SKIDS SIDEWAYS -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. BRIDGE, OAK RIDGE WOODS, E1 - NIGHT

           The SUV appears out of THIN AIR -- And sees -- DEAD AHEAD -

           STOPPED TRAFFIC -- There’s been an ACCIDENT -
           Blayne SLAMS ON HIS BRAKES -- And SCREECHES to a stop -
           Inches from slamming into the row of stopped cars -
           A LITTLE KID’s wide-eyes face -- Looks out the back of a car -
           As the SUV HEADLIGHTS almost smash into him -

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, THE ESTATE - SAME TIME

           Harper looks to Yaati -- Incredulous -

                                 HARPER
                        Did he just switch an SUV?

           EXT. BRIDGE, OAK RIDGE WOODS, E1 - NIGHT

           BACK IN THE TRAFFIC -- Blayne sees -- Weaving through the cars -
           The ATV -- Almost to the accident itself -- And escape -
           There’s no way Blayne can follow -- Kiche waves goodbye -
           Inciting Blayne -- He backs up at high speed -
           Kiche looks ahead again -- So she doesn’t see -
           The SUV DISAPPEAR BACK INTO THIN AIR -
           But the Little Kid in the rear of the car is dumb-struck!

           EXT. BRIDGE, OAK RIDGE WOODS, E2 - NIGHT

           The SUV BACKS OUT OF THIN AIR -- Blayne jams the gears -
           And accelerates across the NOW DESERTED BRIDGE -
           Past where the accident would be on E2... Geddit????

           EXT. BRIDGE, OAK RIDGE WOODS, E1 - NIGHT

           The ATV weaves around the accident -- And speeds away -
           Kiche looks back to give Blayne one last mocking glare -
           But her smile fades when she realizes the SUV isn’t there...

                                 KICHE
                        Oh, no...
           She turns to warn her partner -- When -- Without warning -
           The SUV RE-APPEARS OUT OF THIN AIR -- DEAD AHEAD -
           BACKING UP at HIGH SPEED -- The two vehicles CRASH -
           The ATV FLIPS AWAY -- Throwing Kiche and the Rider -
           They land in twisted heaps...

           Blayne stumbles from the SUV and crosses to Kiche...
           Doubled over in pain -- Her eyes flash open -- Intense -

                                 KICHE
                        Come. With us. Now.

           But before Blayne can consider this -- He looks up to see -
           The Rider -- Heading right for him -- PULLING A WEAPON -

           Instinctively, Blayne backs away -- His hand hits Kiche -
           And feels -- A GUN -- Under her jacket -- He pulls it out -
           And the THING JUST STARTS SHOOTING -- Thpthpthpthpthp -
           WILDLY -- Blayne’s never handled a gun before -
           He HITS the Rider IN THE SHOULDER -- Who dives clear -
           And DISAPPEARS -

           Blayne is about to give chase -- When he sees -
           The paramedics from the accident running to help them -
           Blayne considers all his options -- The CASE -
           The risk of being seen switching -- He snatches the CASE -
           Hurries to the SUV -- And takes off into the night...

                                                       FADE TO BLACK...

           INT. OFFICE, OAK RIDGE LABORATORY - MORNING

           Emily dials a number on her speakerphone...

                                 EMILY
                        Please go to messages... Please go 
                        to messages...

                                 WEISS’ TWIN (SPEAKERPHONE)
                        ...Yes?

                                 EMILY
                        Ah. Doctor Weiss. You’re there. Good. 
                        I don’t know how to tell you this...

           INT. VILLA, HOLLYWOOD HILLS - SAME TIME

           A magnificent place restored to its original glory...
           WEISS’ TWIN listens to the bad news on his EARPIECE...
           He seems to take it remarkably well...

                                                       FADE TO BLACK...

           EXT. GRAND VIEW CEMETERY, GLENDALE - MORNING

           WIDE SHOT -- Blayne, Harper and Yaati at Xun’s simple funeral...

                                                       FADE TO BLACK...

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, THE ESTATE - NIGHT

           Reinhart is on some elaborate breathing machine...
           Blayne sits with Harper and Yaati... Nervous as hell...
           He’s riddled with second thoughts...
                                 HARPER
                        They are Rogues. They exploit the 
                        Earths’ duality for their own gain. 
                        Every day they become more organized. 
                        More dangerous. 

                                 BLAYNE
                        How long had Kiche been here?

                                 HARPER
                        Six months.

                                 BLAYNE
                        And you had no idea?

           Harper and Yaati are too ashamed to respond...

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        She ask me to join them.

           Harper absorbs this...

                                 HARPER
                        You saw what she did to Xun. This 
                        is the who they are. They have no 
                        regard for anyone except themselves.

           Blayne looks to the window... Gazes to the expanse...
           And Harper knows what he’s thinking...

                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        If you leave, they will seek you 
                        out. If you join them then you will 
                        become my enemy... But if you do 
                        not join them, they will kill you... 
                        I cannot allow either outcome. 

           Blayne considers this veiled threat...

                                 BLAYNE
                        You might want to think about 
                        slipping that into your welcome 
                        speech.

           He starts to leave -- But -

                                 HARPER
                        Eric. There is another mission... 
                        Reinhart was to have left with 
                        Yaati for New York this evening. 
                        I’d like you to take his place.

           Blayne takes pause... And considers his options...
           But nods a silent agreement...

                                                       FADE TO BLACK...

           INT. MOTEL ROOM, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

           A foul place rented by the hour - We find a WOMAN -
           She’s about to inject an obscene amount of heroine into her veins -
           But look closer and you’ll realize... Beneath the bad make-up...
           And the dyed black hair... 
           This is EMILY FIELDING’S TWIN... She readies the needle -

           When DETECTIVE WEISS walks out of the bathroom...
           He looks her up and down -- And is filled with sadness...

                                 WEISS
                        Where the hell did you go wrong?

           The Twin just stares back - Unsure how he even got in...

                                                       FADE TO BLACK...

           EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT

           SMASH UP -- ESTABLISHING -- LIGHTS -- SIRENS -- LIFE -
           THE CAMERA RACES THROUGH THE FERVOR - AND FINDS -
           Blayne and Yaati driving EAST RIVER DRIVE...
           Eventually they turn -

           INT. PARKING STRUCTURE, BATTERY PARK - NIGHT

           Blayne drives the SUV all the way up to the ROOF...
           As he pulls into an empty space... Blayne slows -
           Because he’s seen something...

           SOMETHING THAT STOPS HIM COLD...

                                 BLAYNE
                        My God.

           Yaati too looks ahead...

                                 YAATI
                        I know. Keep breathing.

           In the windshield we see... THE REFLECTION OF THE TWIN TOWERS...

                                 BLAYNE
                        It didn’t happen here.

                                 YAATI
                        No.

                                 BLAYNE
                        But... We’re responsible for the 
                        differences between the worlds... 
                        So we’re responsible...

                                 YAATI
                        For what? For it happening? Or it 
                        not happening? Remember this -
                        We are only responsible for 
                        the difference between events - 
                        Not the events themselves.

           They step from the car and Yaati takes a case from the trunk -
           Then she walks into ANOTHER EMPTY PARKING SPACE -

                                 YAATI (cont'd)
                        I shouldn’t be long. This is my 
                        return - Make sure it remains clear.

           But Blayne is transfixed by the eerie sight...
                                 YAATI
                        Eric...!

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...Yeah. Keep it clear. Got it.

           Yaati turns -- 2D -- 1D -- And VANISHES...
           But Blayne is lost in thought -- UNTIL -- A CAR ARRIVES -
           And heads for the spot Blayne should be protecting -

                                 BLAYNE
                        Sorry! Can you take another spot?
                        I’m saving this one.

           The DRIVER winds down their window -

                                 DRIVER
                        I need the plug in.

                                 BLAYNE
                        What?

                                 DRIVER
                        Electric Vehicle plug in. Dude, 
                        there’s plenty of other spaces -
                        I need this one...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...No...Please...

           But the Driver parks anyway... And Blayne has to watch as he 
           casually takes out the charging leads and plugs them in...

                                 DRIVER
                        Sorry. I just need the charge.

           Then he heads off -- Blayne waits anxiously for him to go -
           Then Blayne immediately turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE, BATTERY PARK - ZERO TIME

           VEHICLES GHOST IN AND OUT -- Blayne checks his path is clear -
           Then turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE, BATTERY PARK, E2 - NIGHT

           Blayne orientates himself...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Yaati!

           But she’s nowhere in sight -- But then he sees -
           The open door of the stairwell...

           INT. STAIRWELL, PARKING STRUCTURE, E2 - MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne enters -- And starts down the stairs -
           When he sees her -- TWO FLOORS BELOW -
           Talking to someone in a shadowy corner...

           And you can immediately tell -- SOMETHING IS WRONG...
           Something shady is going down...
           Blayne slows and creeps closer for a better view point...
           And realizes... It’s a DRUG DEAL... Yaati is buying drugs...
           What the hell? She hands over a roll of notes... 
           And the DEALER hands over a pouch of something illegal...

           Then Yaati takes out a gun and shoots the Dealer -
           THREE TIMES IN THE HEART -

                                 BLAYNE
                        No...

           Yaati’s head snaps around -- And she sees Blayne...

                                 YAATI
                        Why aren’t you guarding the return?

                                 BLAYNE
                        What the hell is happening?

                                 YAATI
                        We need to leave.

           And with that Yaati turns -- 2D -- 1D -- And VANISHES -
           Blayne curses himself -- And turns -- SEAMLESSLY -

           INT. STAIRWELL, PARKING STRUCTURE - ZERO TIME

           The GHOST OF A TRASH CAN FADES UP -- Blayne side steps it -
           And turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. STAIRWELL, PARKING STRUCTURE, E1 - NIGHT

           Blayne charges up the stairs -

           EXT. SERVICE ROOF, PARKING STRUCTURE, E1 - MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne bursts out of the stairwell -
           Yaati already heading for the SUV...

                                 BLAYNE
                        What just happened?!

                                 YAATI
                        Calm down...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...You didn’t need me to guard your 
                        return - You just didn’t want me 
                        there!

                                 YAATI
                        That’s right.

           Blayne’s mind is racing...

                                 BLAYNE
                        You killed someone.

                                 YAATI
                        Eric - We need to leave.
                                 BLAYNE
                        Why? Why did you do that? 
                        Why did you kill him?  
                        You just shot him...

                                 YAATI
                        ...We don’t have much time -
                        If you want answers - Come with me.

           Blayne considers his meager options...
           And goes to the car...

           EXT. STREETS, NEW YORK - MOMENTS LATER

           Yaati drives at HIGH SPEED...

           INT. SUV (MOVING) - SAME TIME

           Blayne holds on tight...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Shouldn’t you slow down? I mean you 
                        don’t want to be killing any more 
                        people tonight.

           Yaati doesn’t respond...

           EXT. THE S.O.B. CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           The place to be tonight -- It’s ROCKING to a BRAZILIAN BEAT -
           The SUV skids up to the VALET -- Yaati tosses him the keys -
           She slips the BOUNCER a stack of HUNDREDS -
           And they head inside -

           INT. THE S.O.B. CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           South American sultry... Blayne and Yaati enter...
           They head for a PRIVATE BOOTH IN THE BACK...
           And in the shadows, they find HARPER WAITING...

                                 HARPER
                        Eric. This is an unexpected pleasure.

           It’s not...

                                 YAATI
                        He saw the kill.

                                 BLAYNE
                        I need to know what is happening.

                                 HARPER
                        Sit... Please.

           Blayne does...

                                 HARPER
                        There is a synchronous connection 
                        between every Doppelgänger and 
                        their twin. When one is elated...
                                 BLAYNE
                        ...Yeah, yeah - Happy-happy -
                        Sad-sad - Love at first sight -
                        I already got the speech...
                             (insistent)
                        Why did she kill that man?

                                 HARPER
                        Sync Death.

                                 BLAYNE
                        What?

                                 HARPER
                        When one twin dies, the other will 
                        die seven minutes later. 

           NOTE: If this information is hitting you like a ton of bricks - 
           Don’t worry -- It’s having the safe effect on Blayne...

                                 HARPER
                        Imagine that - No control over your 
                        own life - Your Doppelgänger walks 
                        under a bus - And that’s it - You 
                        just die... This is of course a fear 
                        with which the Uniques do not need to 
                        contend. 

           Harper is obviously terrified by this concept... However -
           He changes tact -- Further confounding Blayne...

                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        Illegal drugs are responsible for 
                        the deaths of over ten thousand 
                        Americans every year...

           He takes out a file and slides it to Blayne...

                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        Ramon Calvo. Cuban national. Imports 
                        fifteen percent of all drugs that 
                        enter our country - According to my 
                        math that makes him personally
                        responsible for around three thousand 
                        deaths a year. 

           Blayne’s mind is whirling even without the math...
           He looks to the file -- Candid images -- A WEALTHY CUBAN 
           BUSINESS MAN -- Cars, boats etc. Blayne recognizes him...

                                 BLAYNE
                        This is the man Yaati just killed.

                                 HARPER
                        No. Yaati killed his twin. A low-
                        life street pusher... This Ramon 
                        Calvo is sitting over there.

           Blayne looks over -

           And we see him -- RAMON CALVO -- You just hate him instantly -
           From his slick black hair to his handmade Mezlan shoes -
           He oozes perversity from every pore...
           SURROUNDED BY A WALL OF BODY GUARDS...
                                 HARPER
                        How long?

           Yaati checks her watch...

                                 YAATI
                        Fifteen seconds.

                                 HARPER
                        Then may God have mercy upon his 
                        soul.

           Blayne tries to assimilate everything...

                                 BLAYNE
                        This isn’t right...
                        You can’t decide...

                                 YAATI
                        ...Time.

           They look to Calvo... And he just dies -
           He slumps over... And expires...

           Harper collects up the file and walks away...

                                 YAATI
                        We should probably leave now.

           A COMMOTION begins to arise around Calvo...

           And Blayne walks away... Mind blown...

           EXT. THE S.O.B. CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Still in a disturbed trance, Blayne climbs into the SUV...

           INT. SUV (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER

           City lights streak by...

                                 HARPER
                        In the Summer of 1939, the British 
                        attempted several assassinations of 
                        Adolph Hitler. All failed. Uniques 
                        have the exceptional ability to go 
                        where no others can. What if one of 
                        them could have killed that madman. 
                        Thirty-eight million lives would 
                        have been spared.

           It’s a compelling argument... 

                                 BLAYNE
                        But who decides?

                                 HARPER
                        It’s a process.

                                 BLAYNE
                        I bet.
                                 HARPER
                        The worlds are better off without 
                        Ramon Calvo.

           Blayne tries to accept this...
                                                       FADE TO BLACK...

           INT. BLAYNE’S ROOM, THE ESTATE - NIGHT

           For the first time in weeks, Blayne is wracked by a nightmare...

           INT. THE S.O.B. CLUB - NIGHTMARE

           Blayne sits at Calvo’s table -- Watching as Calvo dies -
           Over and over... The CAPILLARIES IN HIS EYES FILL WITH BLOOD -
           And he slumps over... Again and again...

           Then something odd happens in the nightmare -
           Calvo starts cutting the food on Blayne’s plate...

                                 CALVO
                        Your mother made it special -
                        Now eat it.

           The CAMERA WHIP PANS TO BLAYNE -- ONLY IT’S NOT BLAYNE -
           And we’re NOT IN THE S.O.B CLUB ANYMORE - WE’RE -

           INT. FAMILY HOME - NIGHTMARE

           YOUNG BLAYNE is sitting with his FATHER at the DINNER TABLE -

                                 YOUNG BLAYNE
                        I’m not hungry.

                                 BLAYNE’S FATHER
                        Fine. Starve. I don’t care.

           Blayne’s Father turns back to his own meal.... AND DIES...
           Just like that -- His capillaries fill with blood -
           And he just slumps over -

           INT. BLAYNE’S ROOM, THE ESTATE - NIGHT

           Blayne wakes from the nightmare... And lies there...
           Lost in thought...

                                                       FADE TO BLACK...

           EXT. TOWN HALL, RED RIVER, NEW MEXICO - DAY

           FADE IN -- A log building in the mountains of New Mexico...
           Blayne waits patiently on a bench, watching PASSERS-BY...

           After a moment -- His MOTHER appears...

           Only it’s not his mother -- It’s ALICE’s TWIN on EARTH ONE -
           Mayor of Red River -- A well-kept friendly woman...

           Blayne crosses to her...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Excuse me - You’re Alice Blayne?
                                 ALICE’S TWIN
                        It’s ‘Hadley’ now. But, yes. 

           She falters... Because there’s something familiar about Blayne...

                                 ALICE’S TWIN (cont'd)
                        Do I know you?

                                 BLAYNE
                        I’m Eric... You used to live in Los 
                        Angeles, right? 2014 Harbor Drive. 

                                 ALICE’S TWIN
                        May I ask what this is regarding?

                                 BLAYNE
                        When you lived there... You used to 
                        get visits... From a little boy...
                        Who thought you were his Mother.

                                 ALICE’S TWIN
                        How would you know that?

           Blayne finds the strength to admit...

                                 BLAYNE
                        It was me.

           Alice’s Twin stiffens... But then she realizes -
           She’s not frightened -- In fact... As if she knows him -
           She completely trusts this stranger...

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        I just wanted to apologize - 
                        For all the stress I must have 
                        caused you. And your husband.

                                 ALICE’S TWIN
                        You used to frighten us so much.

                                 BLAYNE
                        I am so sorry.

                                 ALICE’S TWIN
                        No, no - It’s alright. You just 
                        used to break my heart - Seeing you 
                        so lost. So convinced that we were 
                        your parents. That we were your 
                        home... My husband thought that you 
                        must have come from a violent home 
                        and you were trying to replace your 
                        parents. It’s actually what 
                        inspired us to adopt Natalie - Our 
                        daughter. She came from an abusive 
                        household.

                                 BLAYNE
                        No - My parents...were amazing - 
                        Considering how I behaved...
                             (he changes course)
                        I need to ask you something and I 
                        don’t meant to be rude... But I 
                        need to know how your husband died.

           A strange request... But there’s just something safe about him...
                                 ALICE’S TWIN
                        After we adopted our Natalie, my 
                        husband dedicated his life to 
                        domestic abuse. Various programs, 
                        counselling couples. He was 
                        overseeing an intervention that 
                        went very wrong... And he was 
                        stabbed trying to remove a three 
                        week old baby from a house.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Oh, God... I’m...

           But then he trails of -- Realizing something...
           Something terribly tragic...

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        ...But he first became interested 
                        in domestic violence because of me.

                                 ALICE’S TWIN
                        Yes.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Then... He died because of me.

                                 ALICE’S TWIN
                        No. Don’t say that. Don’t you think 
                        that. Patrick Blayne did so much 
                        good before he died. If you want to 
                        blame yourself for anything, blame 
                        yourself for all that good.

           Kind words -- But Blayne knows the truth in his soul -
           Just by being born -- He killed his father...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Well, I just wanted to say how 
                        sorry I was. How sorry I am.

           He turns and starts to walk away... But...

                                 ALICE’S TWIN
                        Eric, did you ever find your way 
                        home?

           Blayne considers his lot in life... 

                                 BLAYNE
                        I think I’m on my way.

           Alice’s Twin smiles at this notion...

           INT. ALICE’S TRAILER - SAME TIME

           Alice is brewing a pot of tea...
           When she smiles for no apparent reason...
           Warmed by some distant notion...

                                                       FADE TO BLACK...
           CLOSE ON -- A HEAD STONE -- PATRICK JAMES BLAYNE 1942-1984 -
           LOVING HUSBAND -- DEVOTED FATHER -- WE MISS YOU EVERY DAY...

                                                                REVEAL:

           EXT. GRAVEYARD - AFTERNOON

           Blayne stands by his father’s grave...
           Contemplating his regrets... Finally -

                                 BLAYNE
                        So, I’m sorry... I’m so sorry - 
                        For every time I ran away... 
                        For every moment you couldn't 
                        breath until I came home.

           He takes an EMPTY PILL BOTTLE from his pocket...
           And lays it by the grave... Then he moves on...

                                                       FADE TO BLACK...

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Emily’s Twin is lying in bed -- Hand-cuffed to the rails -
           Shivering -- Sweating -- DETOXING...

           A moment passes before Detective Weiss enters -
           He’s carrying a tray of food and a change of clothes...
           He sets them down and sits on the edge of the bed...
           And rests a comforting hand on her back...

                                 EMILY’S TWIN
                        Why are you trying to save me?

           He strokes her hair gently...

                                 WEISS
                        Because you’re going to save us 
                        all.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK...

           INT. LIBRARY, THE ESTATE - DAY

           Harper sits before his remaining Uniques -
           Yaati -- Jenny -- Carlos -- Sue -- Simon -- And Blayne...
           Harper lays a file on the table...

                                 HARPER
                        It’s preemptive. Now I know how 
                        some of you feel about that. But 
                        his person is about to facilitate 
                        the sale of a large quantity of 
                        enriched uranium to a non-
                        sanctioned territory. 

           Harper notices Blayne shift uncomfortably in his chair...

                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        Eric, this could potentially save 
                        thousands of lives.
                                 BLAYNE
                        What if they were to have had a 
                        change of heart?

                                 HARPER
                        The worlds can’t take that risk.
                        Yaati will take the lead.

           He turns to Yaati -

                                 HARPER
                        Who goes with you?

           Yaati eyes her choices...

                                 YAATI
                        Jenny.

           Jenny nods -- Accepting her call to duty...

                                 HARPER
                        Fine. You leave this afternoon.

           Yaati and Jenny stand... And Blayne finds himself 
           experiencing a familiar emotion... Rejection... Isolation... 
           Like he’s no longer part of the family...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Wait.

           A moment of stillness...

                                 HARPER
                        Well?

                                 BLAYNE
                        I need to be there. 

                                 HARPER
                        That sounds ominous.

                                 BLAYNE
                        I have to know if I want to be 
                        part of this.

           Harper think this through... And nods his tempered approval...
           Jenny sits...

           And there’s a tiny moment between Blayne and Jenny -
           Unnoticed by the others -- A silent message in her eyes...

           “Thank you”...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SAN DIEGO - DAY

           ESTABLISHING...

           EXT. LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E1 - DAY

           Blayne and Yaati leave the car with the valet and head inside -
           Wheeling suitcases behind them...
                                 YAATI
                        The Target went off grid yesterday - 
                        But her Twin is attending a 
                        conference at this hotel. We need 
                        her room number.

           INT. RECEPTION, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E1 - CONTINUOUS

           Blayne follows Yaati to the Check-In... 

                                 YAATI
                        Hi - I’m meant to meet a colleague, 
                        but I don’t have her room number.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Her name?

                                 YAATI
                        Doctor Emily Fielding.

           But Blayne notices a sign -- And falters...

           “La Jolla Marriot welcomes the 13th International Conference 
           on Quantum Energy.”

           And a PICTURE of the GUEST SPEAKER - DR EMILY FIELDING -

           And Blayne stops cold -- Because he knows... 
           SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG...

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Let me connect you to her room.

           She hands Yaati a phone and Yaati watches as she dials -
           Then waits for the call to be answered...

                                 YAATI
                        She’s not there. Not to worry. I’m 
                        sure I’ll run into her.

           She leaves and Blayne follows...

                                 YAATI (cont'd)
                        Fielding’s in 1608.

           They head into the REVOLVING DOORS -- And circle back -

                                                         SEAMLESSLY TO:

           INT. RECEPTION, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E2 - DAY

           The hotel is far less crowded on Earth One...
           Yaati approaches the Reception Desk -

                                 YAATI
                        Hi - I stayed here once before - 
                        The room had a great view  - 
                        I think it was 1608.

           Behind her -- Blayne’s mind is in overdrive...
           INT. ROOM 1608, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E2 - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Yaati and Blayne let themselves in -- Yaati flips open 
           her suitcase and begins assembling a SILENCED PISTOL...
           And Blayne notices in a mirror -- There’s an ENVELOPE in her bag - 
           That she slides under her clothes -- Like she didn’t want Blayne 
           to see it...

                                 BLAYNE
                        So, what do we know about the twin? 
                        This... what was her name?
                             (he’s feigning forgetfulness)
                        Emily Fielding?

                                 YAATI
                        The less I know about the twin, the 
                        better. Just focus on the assignment.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Yeah.

           Something is just not sitting right with Blayne...
           She LOCKS HER BAG -- POCKETS THE KEY -- And turns to Blayne -

                                 YAATI
                        What’s wrong?

           Blayne’s doing a bad job at hiding his worries...
           He’s gotta find a cover... But what? Think, God damn it...

                                 YAATI (cont'd)
                        Eric - What’s going on?

                                 BLAYNE
                        I want the assignment.

           Yaati stops... Intrigued...

                                 YAATI
                        You think you can handle it?

                                 BLAYNE
                        I don’t know. That’s why I need it.

           It’s the sort of cryptic answer that Yaati will love...
           A moment between them... Before Yaati talks to her WATCH...

                                 YAATI
                        Blayne is requesting the assignment.

           And there’s a long silence... Blayne concentrates on breathing... 
           Finally -

                                 WATCH COMM.
                        Request denied. Proceed as set.

                                 BLAYNE
                        I can do it.

                                 YAATI
                        Good. Just not today.
           Yaati starts to walk towards the BATHROOM... 
           Blayne’s breathing quickens -- There’s something wrong...
           Something doesn’t add up... He has to stop Yaati -

                                 BLAYNE
                        Then I’m out.

           That did it. She stops -- And turns back...

                                 YAATI
                        I beg your pardon.

                                 BLAYNE
                        I’m done... You guys asked me 
                        to trust myself. Well, I did - 
                        I’m here...

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, THE ESTATE - SAME TIME

                                 BLAYNE (SPEAKERPHONE)
                        But now I’m asking you to trust me.

           Harper thinks it through...

                                 HARPER
                        Give him the assignment.

           INT. ROOM 1608, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E2 - SAME TIME

           Yaati hands Blayne the weapon...

                                 YAATI
                        I’ll be right here if you need me.

           ...Blayne takes the handgun and heads into...

           INT. BATHROOM, ROOM 1608, E2 - CONTINUOUS

           Blayne enters... Closes the door and turns SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. BATHROOM, ROOM 1608, E2 - ZERO TIME

           Instant and utter silence... Blayne sits on the edge of the 
           tub and notices -- A DROPLET OF WATER ALMOST FROZEN IN TIME 
           as it drips from the faucet... 

           Blayne peeks out of the Bathroom into the Hotel Room -

           Yaati is also ALMOST FROZEN IN TIME -- Caught in mid sit...
           Blayne watches her eyes carefully... The -- SHE BLINKS -
           But in ZERO TIME her blink is going to take SEVERAL SECONDS 
           to complete -- So Blayne runs -

           INT. ROOM 1608, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E2 - ZERO TIME

           Blayne steps around Yaati -- Careful not to touch her...
           And once he’s behind her -- Yaati’s eyes open again...

           Blayne turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. ROOM 1608, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E2 - DAY

           Blayne BREATHES QUIETLY -- And turns back -- SEAMLESSLY TO -
           INT. ROOM 1608, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E2 - ZERO TIME

           Out of Yaati’s sight -- Blayne tries to open her suitcase -
           But its locked -- And he remembers -- Yaati pocketed the key... 
           So ve-eeeery ca-aaaaarefully... Blayne reaches into her 
           pocket... And you just know -- HE MUSTN’T TOUCH HER SKIN...
           He’s desperate to breathe -- But then -

           He finds the key... Fishes it out... And unlocks the suitcase...
           He begins rifling through... Finally finding -
           The ENVELOPE that Yaati tried to hide...

           Inside there are dozens of PICTURES of EMILY FIELDING - 
           And ARTICLES -- And DATA SHEETS...

           Blayne glances at Yaati -- And her words echo in his head...

                                 YAATI (V.O.)
                        ...the less I know about the twin, 
                        the better...

           And Blayne realizes...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Fielding’s not the twin... 
                        She’s the target.

           QUICK MONTAGE -- Blayne puts the papers back in the Envelope...
           The Envelope in the bag... The key back in Yaati’s pocket... 
           Hurries into the bathroom -- Picks up the gun -- And turns - 
           Disappearing...

           INT. CONFERENCE HALL, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E1 - MOMENTS LATER

           Emily is making her speech...

                                 EMILY
                        ...Over the lifetime of a child 
                        born today, the demand for energy 
                        will more than triple... 

           From the back of the Hall -- Blayne watches her for a moment...

           INT. ROOM 1608, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E1 - MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne enters and locks the door behind...

                                 WATCH COMM.
                        Blayne - What’s going on?

                                 BLAYNE
                        Still no sign of the Twin.

           Blayne paces -- What to do? What to do? What to do?
           He picks up the phone to dial -- But then sees -
           His WATCH -- They’re listening... To everything...
           If he takes it off, they’ll know... He runs through to -

           THE BATHROOM where he quickly takes the BELT from a ROBE -
           SOAKS it under the tap -- Wraps it tightly over his WATCH...
           Then he talks to his wrapped watch -

                                 BLAYNE
                        Can you hear me?
           He tries to listen to his watch, but can’t hear anything now...
           So -

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        I need back up. Send Yaati through.

           He stands back... And waits... But Yaati doesn’t appear...
           He’s done it -- He’s isolated -- But what next? Think!!
           Then he sees -- THE SHOWER...

           INT. ROOM 1608, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E1 - MOMENTS LATER

           Emily and a COLLEAGUE waltz in -

                                 COLLEAGUE
                        ...Well, I thought it went 
                        wonderfully well...

           Emily stops cold -- RECOGNIZING BLAYNE from before -
           And registering the gun in his hand -- SHE JUST RUNS -

                                 BLAYNE
                        No!

           He tears after her -

                                 COLLEAGUE
                        Emily?

           INT. CORRIDOR, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E1 - DAY

           Emily sprints to the ELEVATOR -- BANGS the call button -
           The doors open -- REVEALING -- Blayne -- Already there -
           He pulls her in -

           INT. ELEVATOR, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E1 - DAY

           He hits the LOBBY BUTTON -- And the ELEVATOR DESCENDS -

                                 EMILY
                        Please don’t hurt me.

                                 BLAYNE
                             (urgent whisper)
                        I won’t - I know it doesn’t look 
                        like it, but you’re in no danger 
                        from me. 

           And there’s a long moment between them... Eyes locked...
           Pleading... Searching for trust... Then -- Finally -

                                 EMILY
                        Okay.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Okay?

                                 EMILY
                        Yeah. Okay.

           A splinter of peace between them...
           INT. ROOM 1608, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E2 - DAY

           Yaati sits quietly... Waiting for word...
           When she finally notices -- Her CASE IS UNLOCKED...
           Curious... She opens the suitcase -- And sees -
           The ENVELOPE -- ON TOP OF HER CLOTHES... That’s odd...
           Yaati takes out the CONTENTS out the ENVELOPE -
           It’s all out of order -- Back-to-front -- Upside-down -
           Rage flashes across her usually tranquil eyes -

           She runs into the BATHROOM -- And turns -- SEAMLESSLY -

           INT. BATHROOM, ROOM 1608, E1 - CONTINUOUS

           Yaati APPEARS in the BATHROOM -- Choking -- Puking -
           SHE’S JUST MORPHED WITH THE FOUNTAINING WATER SHOWER -

           Emily’s Colleague is incredulous -- He witnessed the switch -

                                 COLLEAGUE
                        How did you do that?

                                 YAATI
                        It’s a secret.

           Yaati SHOOTS him THREE TIMES in the heart -

           INT. ELEVATOR, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E1 - SAME TIME

           The elevator doors open -- And a FLOCK OF PEOPLE JAM IN -

                                 PROFFESSOR
                        Emily! What a wonderful speech.

           Blayne flashes her a ‘go-ahead’ signal..

                                 EMILY
                        Thank you Professor Dennis.

                                 PROFFESSOR
                        Emily, I was just telling Proffessor 
                        Simmons how you’re doing a little 
                        something for the kids... Emily?

                                 EMILY
                             (awkwardly)
                        Yes. At the L.A. Science Museum.

                                 PROFFESSOR
                        Well?

           Emily fumbles out a LEAFLET from her overstuffed purse -
           (this will be important later)...

                                 EMILY
                        The...er...original Christofolos 
                        particle accelerator is on display - 
                        I’ll be giving a show-and-tell. 
                        If we can ever get it working.

                                 PROFFESSOR SIMMONS
                        My daughter lives in Newport Beach -
                        I’ll be sure to tell her to take 
                        the grandkids.
                                 EMILY
                        Great.

           BING! Finally -- They arrive -

           INT. RECEPTION, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E1 - CONTINUOUS

           Blayne leads Emily away -- When a CELL PHONE RINGS -
           Blayne takes out HIS TWO CELL PHONES -- E1 and E2 -
           And answers the one that’s RINGING -
           Puts the other away -

                                 BLAYNE (ON CELLPHONE)
                        Yeah - I still can’t find her 
                        anywhere...

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. LIBRARY, THE ESTATE - SAME TIME

                                 HARPER (ON PHONE)
                        ...You have exactly one hour to 
                        come to your senses and kill her - 
                        Or you will pay the price.

           INT. RECEPTION, LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E1 - SAME TIME

           Blayne disconnects the call...

                                 EMILY
                        Who are you working for?

           Blayne glances back at the hotel...

                                 BLAYNE
                        I think I just went into business 
                        for myself. 

           Blayne rips off his watch -- Drops it into the KOI POND -
           Along with the CELL PHONE -

           EXT. LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E1 - CONTINUOUS

           Blayne leads Emily to the parking lot -

                                 BLAYNE
                        You got a car?

                                 EMILY
                        Yes...

           When suddenly -- KICHE APPEARS -- Blocking their escape -
           There a tense stillness -

                                 BLAYNE
                        They want her dead.

                                 KICHE
                        And what do you want?

                                 BLAYNE
                        Answers.
           Kiche sees something behind them...

                                 KICHE
                        Then go. Now.

           Blayne leads Emily away -- And after they’ve passed -
           Kiche turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. LA JOLLA MARRIOT - ZERO TIME

           Kiche continues her turn into a BLISTERING LEG SWEEP -
           Knocking the STILL BLOATED YAATI to the ground -
           Yaati snaps back to her feet -- And the TWO GIRLS COLLIDE -

           Their arms locked in some complex MARTIAL ARTS STRENGTH HOLD -
           Their eyes hold fast -- And there is some distant gentility...

                                 KICHE
                        Yaati.

                                 YAATI
                        Kiche. Ready to die?

                                 KICHE
                        No. You?

                                 YAATI
                        Not today.

           And there’s a SUDDEN EXCHANGE OF BLOWS -- COUNTER-BLOWS -
           HAND ATTACKS and DEFENCES -- Then again -- Their arms lock -
           But Kiche has the slight advantage -- Yaati is impressed -

           But something else is also in play -- THERE’S NO AIR -
           THE PRESSURE IS BUILDING -- They are BOTH SUFFOCATING -
           They turn -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. LA JOLLA MARRIOT, E1 - DAY

           They BREATHE -- And turn -- SEAMLESSLY BACK TO -

           EXT. LA JOLLA MARRIOT - ZERO TIME

           And the complex fight continues -- When without warning -
           Yaati has the sudden advantage -- Locking Kiche’s head UNDERFOOT -
           And twisting her arms behind her -- It’s a DEADLY LOCK...

           But here it comes again -- THE PRESSURE --
           CRUSHING BOTH OF THEM -- Like a billion tons of water -

           And then Yaati does something even more extraordinary than 
           anything we’ve seen before -

           Yaati looks to one side -- SO THAT JUST HER HEAD EXITS ZERO TIME -
           She takes a BREATHE -- And turns back to Kiche -- Still pinned -

                                 YAATI
                        Guess you missed that lesson.

           The surprise on Kiche’s face is replaced with one of agony -
           As the PRESSURE CRUSHES HER SKULL -

                                                              SMASH TO:
           EXT. RUN-DOWN MOTEL, ORTEGA HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           A fifties eyesore overlooking a desolate landscape...
           RAIN slashes across the darkening desert sky...
           Emily’s car pulls up and she kills the engine...
           And they just sit there for a moment in silence...
           Lit by the gaudy flashing neon... Finally...

                                 EMILY
                        I didn’t check out of my room -
                        You think they’ll charge me for 
                        an extra day?

           A nervous smile flickers between them...

                                 EMILY (cont'd)
                        At some point you’re going to tell 
                        me what’s happening here, right?

           Blayne considers his options...

                                 BLAYNE
                        We’re gonna need a room.

           INT. ROOM, RUN-DOWN MOTEL - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           It needs a coat of paint, but at least the roof ain’t leaking...
           Blayne and Emily sit opposite one another on the twin beds...
           Blayne takes a breath... Then dives in...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Okay... The next few minutes of your 
                        life are gonna get pretty weird - But 
                        what I’m going to tell you has to be 
                        seen to be believed... You should 
                        also know that I’m not crazy... I 
                        mean, I was. But I’m not. Alright... 
                        Here goes...

           EXT. RUN-DOWN MOTEL, ORTEGA HIGHWAY - SAME TIME

           ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT as we look in through the window...
           Blayne explains it all... And Emily just sits there... 
           Calmly listening...

           Finally -- Blayne stands and walks INTO the BATHROOM -
           He turns back to Emily -- And DISAPPEARS -
           Emily stands and moves slowly towards the BATHROOM -

           WHEN SUDDENLY BLAYNE RE-APPEARS -- ECU -- RIGHT IN FRONT OF US -
           Beneath the covered walk-way -

           By the way -- This should scare the hell out of us!

           But Emily is still peering into the BATHROOM -
           So Blayne KNOCKS on the window -- Startling her -
           But she gathers herself -- And approaches the door...
           UNLOCKS it... And steps outside... Drawing near to Blayne...

           Her face is dead-pan, making her reaction difficult to read...
           She looks Blayne up and down... Then bursts into a HUGE SMILE!

                                 EMILY
                        Holy freaking wow!!
           INT. ROOM, RUN-DOWN MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne hands Emily a roll of toilet paper...

                                 EMILY
                        ...And you know this would totally 
                        validate Wheeler's oscillating 
                        universe - Not to mention Linde's 
                        bubble theory.
                             (then, changing gears)
                        Do it again. Bring me something 
                        else.

           Blayne sighs -- Turns -- DISAPPEARS -- THEN RE-APPEARS -
           This time holding one of those tiny tubes of toothpaste -
           Which he hands to her -

                                 EMILY
                        Do you have any idea how cool this 
                        is?!?!

                                 BLAYNE
                        I think we might be getting a 
                        little off point here - Why would 
                        Harper want you dead?

                                 EMILY
                        No clue - Oh, my God, you can still 
                        taste the mint - So why do you think 
                        you can’t bring living tissue across?

                                 BLAYNE
                        Please - They’ll be looking for us - 
                        They might even be on their way 
                        here right now...

           But you can tell -- Emily is too mind blown to listen...
           So Blayne indulges her...

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        ...Because there’s too much noise. 
                        You can’t switch living tissue 
                        because there’s too much noise.

           Emily’s eyes narrow, not understanding...
           So Blayne takes back the tube of toothpaste...

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        When you switch something, you can feel 
                        it... All of it... Connected to you. 
                        It’s like it becomes part of you...

           He feels tube against his skin -- THE CAP -- THE NOZZLE -
           THE PASTE -- ALL CONNECTED...

                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        ...but when you try and feel 
                        something living... All you see is...

           He takes her hand in his... And closes his eyes...

           Blayne feels Emily’s skin against his -- BUT THEN -
           AS HE TRIES TO FEEL INSIDE ----------- NOISE ----------
           A THOUSAND BILLION CELLS -- RESONATING -- SCREAMING -
           Then A SUDDEN SILENCE as Blayne breaks the connection -
                                 BLAYNE (cont'd)
                        ...Noise. You just can’t hold that 
                        much chaos together. All that life.
                        It can never be part of you.

           He goes to drop her hand -- But she doesn’t let him...

                                 EMILY
                        Don’t... It’s nice.

           Their hands linger for the briefest of moments...
           But Blayne’s not ready for that kind of intimacy...
           After a lifetime of isolation... He pulls his hand back -

                                 BLAYNE
                        I saw a vending machine - 
                        You want anything?

                                 EMILY
                        No. I’m good.

           Blayne turns away... And Emily watches him leave...
           Taking his rejection gracefully...

           EXT. RUN-DOWN MOTEL, ORTEGA HIGHWAY - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne is trying to feed bills into the stubborn machine...
           When he notices -- IN THE MANAGER’S OFFICE -- A TELEVISION -

           CU SCREEN -- Blayne’s -- Taken from the HOTEL’S SECURITY CAMERA -
           As he led Emily out of La Jolla Marriot...

           INT. ROOM, RUN-DOWN MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne enters at a pace to find Emily ready watching the NEWS -

                                 REPORTER (TV)
                        ...Once again - Police have just 
                        released  the name of the victim in the 
                        La Jolla shooting - Karl Macavie was a 
                        researcher at the Oak Ridge...

                                 EMILY
                        ...Karl?...

                                 REPORTER (TV)
                        ...Police believe Doctor Fielding 
                        and the unidentified male are armed...

           Emily picks up the phone -- But Blayne snatches it from her -

                                 BLAYNE
                        They’ll be tracing any number you 
                        dial...

                                 EMILY
                        ...We’ve done nothing wrong.

                                 BLAYNE
                        You haven’t. I’m on shaky ground. 
                        Your car - Is it yours or a rental?

                                 EMILY
                        Rental.
           Decision's made -

           EXT. RUN-DOWN MOTEL, ORTEGA HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne leads Emily outside...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Stay here. And don’t move. And make 
                        sure nothing moves in this driveway.

                                 EMILY
                        Where are you going?

                                 BLAYNE
                        To get a car they can’t trace.

           He turns and DISAPPEARS... Leaving Emily alone...
           But only for a moment because -

           AN OLD CADILLAC RUMBLES up to the Motel -
           Emily dives into its path - Startling the OLD COUPLE -

                                 EMILY
                        NO! Back it up! Back it up!
                        Go! Go! Go!!!

           The OLD MAN fumbles into reverse... And backs up...

                                 EMILY (cont'd)
                        Thank you.

           JUST AS -- BLAYNE SWITCHES A PICK-UP TRUCK OUT OF THIN AIR...

                                 EMILY (cont'd)
                        That’s my ride.

           She hurries away from their astonished faces...
           Jumps in the Pick-up -- And they speed away...

           INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne and Emily speed along the Ortega Highway in silence... 
           After a while Emily notices the “GOT MILK” SCAR on Blayne’s arm...
           He notices her looking... And reluctantly admits...

                                 BLAYNE
                        In my apartment... The milk 
                        vanished. Least that’s what I 
                        thought - I mean I thought all my 
                        stuff vanished... I just took it 
                        out on the milk.

           She tries to imagine this...

                                 EMILY
                        You’d just switch and not know 
                        where you were?

                                 BLAYNE
                        I knew where I was - But where I 
                        was wasn’t were it was meant to 
                        be... Or something.

           They both try and find their smiles... But it’s tough...
                                 EMILY
                        So which Earth is home?
                        Here... Or there?

           It takes a moment for Blayne to sift this out...
           His Mother... 

                                 BLAYNE
                        There. 

           Emily hides her disappointment well...
           They watch the road again, before Emily asks -

                                 EMILY
                        Why did Harper have you steal the 
                        interferometer?
                             (off Blayne’s look)
                        The Device. From the Oak Ridge lab.

                                 BLAYNE
                        I don’t know. The diamond, I guess.

                                 EMILY
                        So you never figured out what is 
                        was for?

                                 BLAYNE
                             (unsure)
                        You don’t know?

                                 EMILY
                        I only know what it did - Not what 
                        it was for. It created a T-Point...
                             (off Blayne’s look)
                        A theoretical point of Super-
                        Gravity... 
                             (again off his look)
                        It made an infinitely small point 
                        of space infinitely heavy for an 
                        infinitely short amount of time.

                                 BLAYNE
                        What would that do?

                                 EMILY
                        No one knows - It’s like the 
                        “King’s New Clothes” of Quantum 
                        Mechanics. They’ve been trying to 
                        make a T-Point since the seventies. 
                        Problem is - You might create one, 
                        but you have no way of measuring if 
                        it ever existed.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Why would you build something that 
                        you have no idea what it’s for? 
                        That diamond alone - It must have 
                        cost millions.

                                 EMILY
                        Hey, I don’t pay the bills.

           Finally, a shared smile... But a thought comes to Blayne...
                                 BLAYNE
                        Then who does?

           Now Emily realizes -- They have a plan...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TEMPLE, THE ESTATE - NIGHT

           Harper is serving himself tea... When Yaati appears behind him...
           He finishes the ritual in silence... Before addressing her...

                                 HARPER
                        I would really appreciate it if 
                        you would see this one through.

           Yaati swallows nervously... And steps away...
           Harper sips his tea... There’s a distant RUMBLE OF THUNDER...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GAS STATION, ORTEGA HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           RAIN now slashes down across the dark sky...
           Blayne and Emily huddle by a PAY PHONE...
           Waiting for her call to be answered...

                                 EMILY (ON PHONE)
                        Doctor Weiss?... This is Emily Fielding.

           INT. VILLA, HOLLYWOOD HILLS - SAME TIME

                                 WEISS’ TWIN (ON PHONE)
                        Have you found my diamond?

                                 EMILY (SPEAKERPHONE)
                        No... But I’m standing next to the 
                        man who stole it.

           That gets Weiss’ attention...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COFFEE SHOP, HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           An all-night hangout filled with Wanna-Be’s and Has-Been’s...

           Emily sits alone at a booth... Occasionally glancing at Blayne - 
           Who is seated at the far end of the counter... And they wait...
           Blayne orders coffee... The WAITRESS pours him a cup... 
           And he turns to his neighbor -

                                 BLAYNE
                        Could I get the sugar?

           It’s WEISS’ TWIN -

                                 WEISS’ TWIN
                        Sure. Can I get my diamond?

           Blayne starts to move, But the Twin jabs a gun in Blayne’s ribs -
           EXT. COFFEE SHOP, HOLLYWOOD - MOMENTS LATER

           Weiss’ Twin escorts Blayne out into the DESERTED PARKING LOT -

                                 BLAYNE
                        I know you.

                                 WEISS’ TWIN
                        Don’t think so. Where’s my device?

                                 BLAYNE
                        You’re that Detective.

           Emily comes running out of the Coffee Shop -

                                 EMILY
                        Doctor Weiss!

           Weiss’ Twin turns to Emily -- And Blayne strikes -

           HE BECOMES A ZERO TIME GHOST -

           This is what a Unique looks from an outsiders POV when they 
           are moving through ZERO TIME -- They appear to be a BLUR -
           A GHOST travelling a HUNDRED TIMES FASTER THAN NORMAL -
           Leaving a TRAIL as he goes -

           Blayne snatches Weiss’ Twin’s gun away from him -
           Then RE-APPEARS with the gun now leveled at Weiss’ Twin -

                                 BLAYNE
                        I’m sorry - But there are things 
                        going on here that you cannot 
                        understand...

                                 WEISS
                        ...Why, you little...

           And with that -- WEISS’ TWIN BECOMES A ZERO TIME GHOST -
           He snatches his gun back -- And RE-APPEARS behind Blayne -
           Gun pressed against Blayne’s temple -

           It’S NOT WEISS’ TWIN ---- WEISS IS ACTUALLY A UNIQUE ----

           Weiss smiles at Emily -

                                 WEISS
                        Excuse us.

           Weiss hurls both he and Blayne -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP, HOLLYWOOD, E2 - NIGHT

           Pretty much the same sad place on both Earths -

           Weiss hurls Blayne to the ground -- And grimaces -
           Holding his shoulder -- And Blayne realizes -

           FLASH MEMORY -- In the TENNESSEE WOODS -
           SHOOTING the ATV RIDER in the shoulder -

           BACK TO BLAYNE -- His mind reeling -
                                 BLAYNE
                        You’re the Rogue.

                                 WEISS
                        Where’s the Device?

                                 BLAYNE
                        That’s why you wanted to shake my 
                        hand.

                                 WEISS
                        And what a different story it would 
                        have been if I had. Where’s the 
                        Device?

                                 WEISS
                        Play it your way.

           Weiss turns -- And DISAPPEARS -- Blayne jumps up to follow -

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP, HOLLYWOOD, E1 - NIGHT

           Weiss turns to an astonished Emily -- Who backs up in fear -

                                 EMILY
                        You’re one of them.

                                 WEISS
                        Don’t worry - It’s not infectious.

           Weiss kneels -- SCOOPS a HANDFUL OF PARKING LOT GRAVEL -
           Calculates -- Then TOSSES the GRAVEL into the AIR -
           Just as BLAYNE APPEARS -- His RIGHT ARM MORPHS with the GRAVEL -
           He SCREAMS IN AGONY -

                                 WEISS
                        Once again - I want the Device back...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...Screw you..!

                                 WEISS
                        ...Look if that gravel’s in your 
                        arteries, you’re gonna be dead in 
                        the next minute or two, so you 
                        might as well...

                                 BLAYNE
                             (indicating Emily)
                        ...Why does Harper want her killed?

           This causes Weiss’ to pause... 

                                 WEISS
                        Seriously? I tell you you’re about 
                        to die and you want to know about 
                        Miss Fielding?

           He’s truly impressed -- Enough to reconsider Blayne entirely...
           He glances at Emily -

                                 WEISS (cont'd)
                        You might have a keeper here...
                                 BLAYNE
                        ...Why?!

                                 WEISS
                        Little angry, but I think his 
                        heart’s in the right place...

           It’s an off-handed comment - But of huge significance -
           Blayne misses this and starts towards Weiss threateningly -

                                 WEISS (cont'd)
                        ...Because she’s the only one who 
                        can end this.

           The statement hangs there for a moment...

                                 EMILY
                        I am?

                                 WEISS
                        With my help, of course - But 
                        essentially - And for dramatic 
                        effect - Yes, only you...
                             (pointedly to Blayne)
                        ...and the Device...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Why go after Emily herself? 
                        Why not go after her Twin?

                                 WEISS
                        Because I have her Twin stashed 
                        safely away...

           Emily reacts to this...

                                 WEISS (cont'd)
                        ...Why didn’t you kill her like 
                        Harper wanted?

                                 BLAYNE
                        Something didn’t add up.

           Weiss notices Blayne wince in pain as the dirt shifts inside him -
           He indicates the LUMPS IN BLAYNE’S ARM -

                                 WEISS (cont'd)
                        Really? You can’t figure your way 
                        out of this one? What the hell is 
                        Yaati doing with you Blinders?
                        Okay - I’m going to teach you to 
                        fish here... 
                             (off Blayne’s look)
                        ...You know, give a man a fish, 
                        blah, blah, blah. That gravel 
                        exists here on E1... But where 
                        doesn’t it exist?

           Blayne thinks through the conundrum... Then... He gets it -
           He turns -- DISAPPEARS -- BUT LEAVES THE GRAVEL BEHIND -
           The Gravel falls to the ground -

           Weiss hands Emily his car keys -- And indicates a LUXURY SEDAN -
                                 WEISS
                        The passenger seat has Shiatsu 
                        massage.

           And with that, he DISAPPEARS -

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP, HOLLYWOOD, E2 - NIGHT

           Blayne is massaging his arm, when Weiss APPEARS behind him...

                                 BLAYNE
                        If you’re trying convince me you’re 
                        the good guy, you’re getting off to 
                        a piss poor start.

                                 WEISS
                        I don’t care who you think I am. 
                        Or who the bad guy is - So Harper 
                        sell off stolen E2 technology to 
                        the highest bidder. Am I meant to 
                        care about that? He has a few 
                        people killed off who get in his 
                        way. I’m not his priest. I really 
                        don’t care about labels... I only 
                        care about the ending this -
                        For all of us.

           Blayne’s eyes narrow... Not understanding...

                                 WEISS (cont'd)
                        Five babies are conceived every 
                        second. It took seven minutes for 
                        the Worlds to split - That’s over 
                        two-thousand of us - Out there - 
                        Lost - Not knowing what the hell 
                        is going on. Do you remember being 
                        blind?

                                 BLAYNE
                        Every day.

                                 WEISS
                        Well, the Device will end it.
                        All of it. It will collapse Zero 
                        Time and separate the two Worlds 
                        forever. And Two thousand Uniques 
                        will be able to sleep for the first 
                        time.

           Blayne begins to realize the enormity of this...
           When his CELL PHONE RINGS...

                                 BLAYNE (ON CELLPHONE)
                        Hello?... 

           The VOICE on the other end sends a chill through him...

                                 BLAYNE (ON CELLPHONE)
                        How did you get this number?

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. DINER - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Blayne enters at a pace -- And hurries to the counter -
           Where he finds TANYA -

                                 TANYA
                        There you are - God, we’ve missed 
                        you round here...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...How did you get that number?

                                 TANYA
                        Some lady gave it to me.
                        Told me to give you this.

           She hands Blayne an envelope... 

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                        Are you in some kind of trouble? 
                        ‘Cause she left this weird message.

                                 BLAYNE
                        What message?

                                 TANYA
                        She said to tell you that it was 
                        time to pay the price.

           And a terror begins to rise in Blayne...

                                 TANYA (cont'd)
                        Do you owe somebody money?
                        Because I have some put away...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...No. I don’t need money.

                                 TANYA
                        Are you okay?

                                 BLAYNE
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 TANYA
                        For what?

           The CAPILLARIES IN TANYA’S EYES FILL WITH BLOOD...

                                 TANYA
                        Something’s wrong.

           And Tanya just dies. Right there. In front of Blayne.
           She goes down hard...

           Blayne is motionless -- Terrified...
           And all eyes are on him... Blayne backs away...

           EXT. DINER - CONTINUOUS

           Blayne stumbles out... Sees the ENVELOPE IN HIS HAND...
           opens it... And takes out a PHOTOGRAPH -
           ECU PHOTO -- Blayne talks with his ALICE’S TWIN in New Mexico... 
           Blayne flips the PHOTO - “You have 24 hours to kill Fielding.”

                                                            QUICKLY TO:

           INT. VILLA, HOLLYWOOD HILLS - LATER

           Weiss follows in Blayne’s wake...

                                 WEISS
                        You can’t sync-assassinate Harper.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Why not?

                                 WEISS
                        Because he’s thought of everything.

           Blayne falters -

                                                            QUICKLY TO:

           EXT. PRIVATE PRISON, CENTRAL CALIFORNIA - DAWN

           A MODERN MAXIMUM FACILITY -- Set at the bottom of a 
           blistering DESERT VALLEY -- Miles from anywhere...

           Weiss and Blayne are on the HILLSIDE ABOVE...
           The SUN IS JUST RISING...

                                 WEISS
                        This is Ironwood. Harpers very own 
                        private maximum security facility. 
                        He was so terrified that his Twin 
                        here on Earth Two will walk under 
                        a bus or prick his finger on a 
                        infected needle, that fifteen years 
                        ago he had him abducted and built 
                        this place to put him in...

           FLASH INSERT -- HOUSE IN THE SUBURBS in the DEAD OF NIGHT - 

           MASKED MEN drag HARPER’S TWIN out of his home -
           He’s shoved in a van -- And deposited at the prison... 
           In a padded cell -- Sterile food packs -- Purified air - 
           Rigorous medical check-ups -

           BACK TO SCENE -

                                 WEISS
                        The Twin is completely isolated - 
                        No visitors - No germs - No possible 
                        way to be harmed or to harm himself...
                        Then there’s this...

           Weiss turns and DISAPPEARS -- And BLAYNE FOLLOWS HIM -
           SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. DESERT RESERVOIR - PRE-DAWN

           Blayne turns to see -- The entire area where the Prison was -
           It’s UNDER SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET OF WATER - 
                                 WEISS
                        Just in case any Uniques attempted 
                        a sync-assassination.

                                 BLAYNE
                        How deep?

                                 WEISS
                        I know what you’re thinking - Dive 
                        to the bottom and switch into the 
                        Prison. But how’d you get out?  
                        You’d switch back and your lungs 
                        would be instantly filled with 
                        water. You’d be dead in a matter of 
                        seconds. There’s just no way out. 
                        It’s impossible.

           Blayne’s eyes glance across the valley floor... 
           Calculating... And finally... A slow smile appears...

                                 BLAYNE
                        “Impossible” is just another way of 
                        saying, “I’m possible”.

                                 WEISS
                        The hell does that mean?

                                 BLAYNE
                        Dunno. I saw it on a T-Shirt.
                        But I know how to do it.

           He strides away...

                                                                CUT TO:

           Emily is on a WALKIE-TALKIE...

                                 EMILY
                        Are you sure about this?

           INT. TRUCK TRAILER - SAME TIME

           Blayne and Weiss in an EMPTY TRAILER -- Armed to the teeth...

                                 BLAYNE
                        No. Just do it.

           EXT. DESERT RESERVOIR - SAME TIME

           Emily presses a HYDRAULIC SWITCH -

           CLOSE ON -- THE TRAILER HITCH -- RELEASING from the truck cab -
           And the TRAILER begins to ROLL BACK DOWN THE HILLSIDE -
           INTO THE RESERVOIR -

           EXT. UNDERWATER, RESERVOIR - SAME TIME

           The TRAILER rolls all the way to the bottom of the Reservoir -
           TUMBLING OVER AND OVER -
           INT. TRUCK TRAILER - SAME TIME

           Blayne and Weiss tumble with the sinking trailer...
           Finally -- They reach the floor... And orientate themselves...
           Blayne prepares to switch... But -

                                 WEISS
                        You know we have no idea where 
                        we’re switching to, right?

                                 BLAYNE
                        I’ve spent my entire life 
                        trying to avoid surprises... 

           And with that -- He turns -- Becomes 2-D -- 1-D -- And vanishes -
           Weiss sighs heavily... And follows -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. KITCHENS, PRIVATE PRISON - NIGHT

           Weiss appears in the Kitchens -- And falls TWO FEET on to a 
           STAINLESS STEEL SURFACE -- BANGING his head... His looks at 
           Blayne scornfully - Then they turn -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. PRIVATE PRISON, CENTRAL CALIFORNIA - ZERO TIME

           Blayne and Weiss make their way through the prison...
           Around ‘frozen’ GUARDS... Avoiding patrolling Uniques...
           And slipping through open doors... DOWN STAIRS...
           TURNING TO REAL TIME TO BREATH -- Finally -- They reach -

           INT. ISOLATION CHAMBERS, PRIVATE PRISON - ZERO TIME

           SIX CELLS set into the FLOOR -- Each with a PLEXI-GLASS
           CEILING so that you can look down into the OCCUPANTS...
           The entire room itself is open to the four floors above...
           Blayne and Weiss appear and turn -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. ISOLATION CHAMBERS, PRIVATE PRISON - NIGHT

           REAL TIME AGAIN -- Blayne and Weiss walk over the cells... 
           And find -

           HARPER’S TWIN -- Asleep in a bunk below... 
           He seems peaceful -- Like sleep is his only escape...

           With Weiss keeping guard -- Blayne produces a DRILL from his bag -
           And carefully bores a THREE INCH HOLE through the PLEXI-GLASS...

           IN THE CELL BELOW -- Tiny shavings of glass fall on the twin -
           He stirs in his sleep -- But doesn’t wake...

           ABOVE -- Blayne takes a PISTOL... Screws on a silencer... 
           And turns back to the CELL...

           AND THAT’S WHERE THINGS GET WEIRD...........

           Weiss is standing between Blayne and the Cell........
           Blocking Blayne’s path.........

                                 BLAYNE
                        What are you doing?
                                 WEISS
                        We’re not here to kill him.

                                 BLAYNE
                        I don’t understand.

           Blayne watches as Weiss  reaches down through the HOLE as far 
           as his arm will allow... What the hell is he doing?

           Now -- WE CLOSE ON WEISS’ HAND... As he CLICKS HIS FINGERS...

           And Harper’s Twin gently wakes at the subtle noise...
           It takes a moment for him to focus in the dim light...
           But when he does -- HE RECOGNIZES WEISS IMMEDIATELY...
           And it’s with warmth... And love... And great loss...

                                 HARPER’S TWIN
                        My God.

           And Blayne realizes... 

                                 BLAYNE
                        Harper said his son was dead.

                                 WEISS
                        To him. I am.

           BLAYNE IS FURIOUS -- He pulls Weiss up -

                                 BLAYNE
                        This is why we came here?!?! 
                        So you could see your father?!

                                 WEISS
                        Not see him. Rescue him.

                                 BLAYNE
                        What?

                                 WEISS
                        He’s coming with us.

                                 BLAYNE
                        How?

                                 WEISS
                        Same way we came in.

                                 BLAYNE
                        No. It’s not possible. No plants, 
                        no pets, no people.

           Weiss steps in close -- They only have a moment -
           So he better make this clear...

                                 WEISS
                        Have you ever loved someone so much 
                        that nothing else mattered? That 
                        everything else just melts away... 
                        All that noise...just fades out.

           And Blayne realizes what Weiss is telling him...
           There’s a way... But that’s when -
           A GUARD enters -- GUN BLAZING -- EMPTYING HIS CHAMBER -
           RIDDLING WEISS with GUN FIRE -- He crashes down -
           Organs exploding... 

           Instinctively -- Blayne turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. ISOLATION CHAMBERS, PRIVATE PRISON - ZERO TIME

           Blayne rolls -- Pulls out a STUBBY MACHINE GUN -
           And returns a HAIL OF BULLETS -- Each GROWING in ZERO TIME -
           So that the weapon is SPEWING OUT CABLES -
           CABLES that HIT THE GUARD -- HIS CHEST EXPLODES IN SLO-MO -

           And there’s a TINY MOMENT -- As Blayne realizes -
           He’s killed for the first time -

           The ENTIRE PRISON GOES INTO SEQUENTIAL LOCK DOWN -
           Beginning with -- The Isolation chambers beneath Blayne’s feet -
           Steel plates slam shut beneath the Plexi-Glass -
           Then the CELLS AROUND BLAYNE LOCK DOWN -
           Then the CELLS ONE FLOOR ABOVE -- TWO -- THREE -
           And before he knows it -- He’s trapped -- Three stories down -
           No way to climb up to the only way out -
           A BALCONY FIFTY FEET ABOVE...

           But Blayne has a plan -- He re-grips the MACHINE GUN -
           And feels it -- The HANDLE -- The MAGAZINE -- 200 BULLETS -
           And he FIRES -- SPRAYING BULLETS -- Each GROWING -
           So that the weapon is SPEWING OUT CABLES AGAIN -
           They RICOCHET around the cavernous room -
           Becoming an INTERWEAVING WEB -- A web he can climb...

           He hurries to Weiss and heaves up his limp body...

                                 WEISS
                        Don’t...

           Ignoring him -- Blayne starts to heave him up the web...
           He’s got about half way up -- When a UNIQUE GUARD ENTERS -
           Sees what happening -- And touches the first of the CABLES -
           And it VANISHES -- WHIP-LASHING back into a bullet -
           Then he touches ANOTHER -- And ANOTHER -- And ANOTHER -
           Taking away MORE and MORE of the CABLES of the web -

           Then the strand that Blayne is gripping DISAPPEARS -
           And they fall -- Before Blayne manages to catch another -
           And there’s an unspoken word between Weiss and Blayne -
           Weiss knows that he’s slowing Blayne -- He pulls away...

                                 BLAYNE
                        No...

           Weiss reaches into his pocket -- TAKES OUT A ROOM KEY -
           And hands it to Blayne -

                                 WEISS
                        Take care of her.

           And then Weiss plummets -- On top of the Guard -
           But when they hit -- THEY BOTH DISAPPEAR -
           Weiss has taken them both to the other side...

           Blayne is left looking at the ROOM KEY - 
           “Royal Pagoda Motel - Room 2205” -
           He pockets it -- And tears away...
           INT. PRIVATE PRISON, CENTRAL CALIFORNIA - ZERO TIME

           Blayne races through the prison as it continues to SHUT DOWN -
           Juuuu-ssssst squeezing though door as they SLAM SHUT -- Into -

           INT. KITCHENS, PRIVATE PRISON - ZERO TIME

           Blayne is chased in under a HAIL OF GUN FIRE -

           He jumps up onto the counter and LEAPS INTO THE AIR -
           And as GUARDS race in -- Blayne twists -- And disappears -
           The Guards exchange amused looks... 

                                 GUARD
                        Unless he just grew gills, he’s dead.

           INT. TRUCK TRAILER - NIGHT

           Blayne rolls of the hard floor and aims back where he appeared...
           But no one follows... He barely has time to relax -
           When there’s an OMINOUS CREAK... And water begins to pour in -
           And suddenly -- The trailer doors burst in UNDER THE PRESSURE -
           And Blayne turns -

                                                         SEAMLESSLY TO:

           INT. TRUCK TRAILER - ZERO TIME

           The water THUNDERS INTO the trailer in SUPER SLOW-MO -
           So that what would normally take less that half a second is 
           going to take ten seconds -- Still, he’s going to be crushed -

           Unless -- As the WALL OF WATER presses in -- Blayne takes a 
           BULLET from the magazine -- Feels it -- Then tosses it from one 
           hand to the other -- So that it becomes a TALL METAL ARCH -
           FOUR FEET ACROSS -- Then -- He holds the arch like a jump rope -
           And swings it over his head -- So it becomes a METAL SHELL -
           A COMPLETE BALL -- With Blayne on the INSIDE...

           EXT. UNDERWATER, RESERVOIR - ZERO TIME

           The METAL BALL rises through the water -- And breaks the surface -

                                                         SEAMLESSLY TO:

           EXT. DESERT RESERVOIR - NIGHT

           As we exit Zero Time the Metal Ball SHRINKS back to an ARCH -
           Then to a BULLET again -- And Blayne swims ashore -

           Emily helps him up onto the muddy bank... 

                                 EMILY
                        Weiss?

           Blayne shakes his head and sits... Broken...

           EXT. UNDERWATER, RESERVOIR - SAME TIME

           The bullet sinks to the muddy floor...
                                                       FADE TO BLACK...
           INT. LIBRARY, THE ESTATE - NIGHT

           SMASH UP -- Yaati enters and reports to Harper nervous as hell -

                                 HARPER
                        Well?

                                 YAATI
                        Blayne switched at the prison.
                        We’re searching the reservoir.

           That wasn’t what he wanted to hear -

                                 HARPER
                        And?

                                 YAATI
                        Your son switched at the Isolation 
                        Chambers. Into solid rock.

           That wasn’t it either...

                                 HARPER
                        And?

                                 YAATI
                        And your twin is safe.

           That was the news he was waiting for...

                                 HARPER
                        Good... Kill the mother.

           Yaati accepts the instruction without emotion...
           But that’s when the ALARM SOUNDS -

                                 HARPER
                        Lock us down.

           EXT. MALIBU HILLS - NIGHT

           All across the EMPTY LOT -- SPIKED METAL PILLARS RISE UP -

           TEN FEET HIGH -- Nothing is getting in or out -
           But then we hear -- THE REVVING OF A HIGHLY TUNED ENGINE -

           Blayne -- ON A MOTORBIKE -- SCREAMING towards the lot -
           Right at -- A CAR TRANSPORTER -- It’s ramp down -
           The bike hits the ramp -- And he’s AIRBORNE -- Over the 
           pillars - He turns -- WITH THE BIKE -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. FOYER, THE ESTATE - NIGHT

           Blayne lands the bike -- AND WIPES OUT -- He rolls away -
           And the BIKE SMASHES OUT THOUGH A SET OF FRENCH DOORS -
           Yaati and Harper dive clear -- And Blayne keeps rolling - 
           SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. FOYER, THE ESTATE - ZERO TIME

           Blayne is half way up the stairs before Yaati enters ZERO TIME -
           Drawing her weapon and FIRING -- CABLE BULLETS AGAIN -
           INT. LANDING, THE ESTATE - ZERO TIME

           Blayne sees the DOOR to the WALK IN SAFE -- And runs right at it -
           He launches himself UP INTO THE AIR -- And twists SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. MALIBU HILLS - NIGHT

           Blayne appears -- Leaping through the air -
           OVER THE SPIKED METAL PILLARS -- SEAMLESSLY BACK TO -

           INT. WALK-IN SAFE, THE ESTATE - NIGHT

           Blayne appears ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR - 
           Inches from the METAL FLOOR of the safe -

           INT. LANDING, THE ESTATE - NIGHT

           Yaati stops short of the door -- Reluctant to follow Blayne -

           Harper arrives behind her with THREE ARMED GUARDS...

                                 HARPER
                        There’s nowhere for him to go.

           He shouts through the door -

                                 HARPER (cont'd)
                        It doesn’t have to be this way, Eric. 
                        We can go back. To how it was before. 
                        Your mother doesn’t have to die.

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. WALK-IN SAFE, THE ESTATE - SAME TIME

           Blayne locates the DEVICE and places it in his BACKPACK...

                                 BLAYNE
                        I’m taking the Device and ending it. 
                        Just like your son wanted.

                                 HARPER
                        My son had no vision even after he 
                        was no longer blind.

                                 BLAYNE
                        You have no right to decide who 
                        lives and who dies. You’re not God.

                                 HARPER
                        On the contrary... I created the 
                        two Earths - I think that’s pretty 
                        much the job description.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Well, I’m about to make the 
                        position redundant.

                                 HARPER
                        It’s over, Blayne... If you try 
                        switching from where you are, you 
                        will fall and die, impaled on the 
                        metal spikes.
           Ignoring the warning, Blayne kneels... 
           And places his hands on the metal floor...
           So he feels it... CONNECTED... 

           INT. LANDING, THE ESTATE - SAME TIME

           Harper enters the safe’s pass code... And opens the door -
           REVEALING -

           Blayne -- Just as he turns his head -- AND DISAPPEARS -
           Along with the ENTIRE FLOOR OF THE SAFE -- It just VANISHES -
           So that Harper is left looking down into the Foyer below...

                                 HARPER
                        Now that’s thinking on your feet.

           EXT. MALIBU HILLS - NIGHT

           Blayne and the SAFE FLOOR drop onto the SPIKES -
           He lands awkwardly -- Fights for his balance...
           Then steadies himself... He’s about to clamber down -

           When the SPIKES RETREAT -- BACK INTO THE GROUND -

           Blayne and the SAFE FLOOR fall -- And immediately -
           ONE OF THE GUARDS APPEARS -- And attacks the fallen Blayne -
           Kicking him along the ground -- Towards the SHEER CLIFF -
           Blayne manages to deliver a blistering donkey kick -
           And scramble to his feet -

           The Guard pulls out a NIGHT STICK and runs in -
           Blayne is defenceless -- But then he remembers -
           And turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. MALIBU HILLS - ZERO TIME

           The Guard immediately slows so that Blayne can dodge him -

           But not a second later -- The Guard enters Zero Time -
           He charges in with his Night Stick again -

           But this time, Blayne takes the ROOM KEY from his pocket -
           Holds it up high -- And drops it from one hand to the other -
           So that it GROWS into -- A METAL BATON -- THREE FEET LONG -

           A BLISTERING FIGHT ENSUES -- Night stick vs Metal Baton -
           It goes to and fro -- Finally -- Blayne SMASHES the night stick -

           But the Guard pulls out a GUN and FIRES the ENTIRE CHAMBER -
           The BULLETS come at Blayne faster than he could run -
           No escape -- They’re gonna hit -- But at the LAST MOMENT -
           Blayne twirls the METAL BATON so that it becomes a METAL DISC -
           Three feet in diameter -- And the BULLETS HIT the DISC-SHIELD -

           As the Guard reloads -- Blayne kicks the gun from his hands -
           But -- Yaati and the OTHER GUARDS appear in ZERO TIME -
           Guns BLARING -- SPRAYING CABLE BULLETS -- Over fifty of them -
           Blayne wrenches the METAL DISC from side to side -
           And it becomes a METAL WALL -- Protecting him -

           But he needs to escape -- And he sees -- The discarded GUN -
           He snatches it up -- Clasps it in his hands -- Feels it -
           THE HANDLE -- THE CHAMBER -- SPRING -- CASING -- BULLET...
           Then he aims over the cliff -- At the beach 300 feet below -
           And FIRES -- And the bullet GROWS -- BECOMING A CABLE -
           All the way down to the beach -

           Then he takes the gun -- Tosses it from one hand to the other -
           So it becomes an arch of morphed metal parts -
           (much like the arch of baseball from earlier) -
           Then he slings the arch of morphed metal over the cable...
           AND SLIDES ALL THE WAY DOWN THE CABLE TO THE BEACH -
           Where he turns to run -- And DISAPPEARS...

           Yaati and the others are left standing on the cliff top...
           She looks to her troop -

                                 YAATI
                        Now why didn’t one of you think of 
                        that?

           She touches the WALL OF METAL and it immediately SHRINKS BACK -
           To a DISK -- A BATON -- The ROOM KEY... Which Yaati picks up -
           She reads the engraving... And a smile curls her lips...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE ROYAL PAGODA MOTEL, DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

           Establishing...

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, ROYAL PAGODA MOTEL - NIGHT

           EMILY’S TWIN sleeps... When -- A SHADOW passes by her window... 
           We hear a RATTLING at the door -- Someone tries the lock...

           THEN SUDDENLY -- Someone kicks the door off its hinges -
           And bursts in -- Waking Emily’s Twin with a start -
           The figure hurries to the bed -

                                 BLAYNE
                        You need to come with me.

           Emily’s Twin looks at the stranger by her bed...
           And is consumed by an overwhelming sense of trust...
           A trust that is inexplicable and utterly consuming...

           IT’S LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT...

                                 EMILY’S TWIN
                        Okay.

           She offers Blayne her hand... And he takes it...

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK - SAME TIME

           Emily is parked behind the Sportsman Lodge on E1... When -
           A feeling strikes her out... Out of nowhere...
           She touches her own hand, where Blayne just touched her Twin’s...
           And she is taken by a sense of peace...
           EXT. ROYAL PAGODA MOTEL - SAME TIME

           Blayne and Emily’s Twin tear through the parking lot -
           To a waiting MOTORBIKE -- And they both climb on -
           She holds him tight...

                                 EMILY’S TWIN
                        How do I know you?

                                 BLAYNE
                        We’ve met once before.

           They take off ------ WHEN FROM OUT OF NOWHERE ------
           AN SUV SIDE SWIPES THEM --- THE BIKE FLIPS OVER ---
           Sending Blayne and Emily’s Twin sprawling -

           Blayne rights himself to see -- Yaati exiting the SUV -
           GUN LEVELED -- He throws himself -- SEAMLESSLY INTO -

           EXT. ROYAL PAGODA MOTEL - ZERO TIME

           Just as Yaati FIRES -- THE BULLET MOVES AT ABOUT 10 mph -
           RIGHT AT EMILY’S TWIN -- Blayne snatches up his bike helmet -
           And HURLS IT -- It GROWS IN ZERO TIME -- FORMING A BARRIER -
           THAT STOPS THE BULLET -

           EXT. ROYAL PAGODA MOTEL - SAME TIME

           Yaati reacts to the FAST-MOVING HELMET saving Emily’s Twin -
           She FIRES OFF SEVERAL MORE ROUNDS -- That are all DEFLECTED -
           Then Blayne APPEARS in front of her...

           And there is a sudden moment of stillness between them...

                                 BLAYNE
                        There’s no need to kill her.

                                 YAATI
                        I will destroy those who seek to 
                        destroy my way of life.

           She levels he gun -- AS BOTH BLAYNE AND YAATI TURN SEAMLESS TO -

           EXT. ROYAL PAGODA MOTEL - ZERO TIME

           A SUDDEN FIGHT ENSUES -- Blayne and Yaati fight for the gun -
           Occasionally Yaati gets off a SHOT -- That Blayne manages to stop -
           But he’s ASPHYXIATING -- He can’t leave Zero Time to breathe -
           If he does, Emily’s Twin will die -----

           But the PRESSURE IS BUILDING -- CRUSHING HIM -- LUNGS EXPLODING -
           Finally -- He can’t take it any more -- Yaati turns to breathe -
           And Blayne follows her -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. ROYAL PAGODA MOTEL - NIGHT

           Yaati takes a breath........... Blayne takes a breath........
           Then Yaati turns back...... And Blayne follows SEAMLESSLY BACK TO -

           EXT. ROYAL PAGODA MOTEL - ZERO TIME

           Before Blayne can get back --------- YAATI FIRES A SINGLE BULLET -
           THE BULLET CABLES TOWARDS Emily’s Twin -- Blayne -- Helpless - 
           Reaches for the bullet -- It SCALDS his hand -- SLICING THE FLESH -
                                 BLAYNE
                        NO!!!

           The BULLET SLIPS THROUGH his bloody fingers ----------
           And HITS Emily’s Twin in the heart -

           Yaati smiles -- Her job is done -- She turns -
           And DISAPPEARS -

           Blayne turns -- SEAMLESSLY BACK TO -

           EXT. ROYAL PAGODA MOTEL - NIGHT

           REAL TIME -- THE BULLET EXPLODES THROUGH EMILY’S TWIN’S HEART -
           He runs to her..... She’s choking...... Utterly terrified........
           Bringing up blood.........

                                 EMILY’S TWIN
                        Don’t let me die..... 

                                 BLAYNE
                        No.... Come on.... 

                                 EMILY’S TWIN
                        .....Please don’t let me die.....

           He pulls out his cell phone -- DIALS 911..........

                                 BLAYNE
                        .....Y’gonna be fine....

                                 EMILY’S TWIN
                        ......I’m so scared.....

                                 BLAYNE
                        ......I won’t let you die.....

                                 EMILY’S TWIN
                        .......I don’t want to go.....
                        ...Tell Mommy I don’t want to go...
                        .......I don’t want to go.....

           She looks to Blayne....... And he smiles reassuringly.....

                                 BLAYNE
                        It’s okay... You don’t have to go.

           She smiles... Then sees Blayne with absolute clarity...

                                 EMILY’S TWIN
                        Oh, I remember you.

           And then she dies... Right there in his arms...
           Blayne’s soul is consumed with an abject terror...

           And the SUN DAWNS OVER THE HORIZON....

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK - PRE-DAWN

           It’s SEVEN MINUTES EARLIER -- SO THE SUN HASN’T RISEN YET...

           CLOSE ON EMILY..... As an icy chill creeps up her spine.....
           An overpowering sense of grief......
           And Blayne sits into the seat beside her.........
           A terrible fear in his gentle eyes....
           He fires the engine -- And tears away -

                                 BLAYNE
                        We have seven minutes to destroy 
                        Zero Time.

           And now Emily knows..... In seven minutes... She will die...
           It is the most terrifying piece of knowledge to possess...

                                 EMILY
                        We need the device.

                                 BLAYNE
                        We have it.

                                 EMILY
                        And.... And.... We need to get to 
                        an Accelerator.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Okay. Where’s that?

                                 EMILY
                        Well...... The closest one is....
                        Er.....is......

                                 BLAYNE
                        ......Come on...! Where.....?!

                                 EMILY
                        ....Berkley... There’s one in Berkley.

                                 BLAYNE
                        No. Closer.

                                 EMILY
                        There isn’t.....

                                 BLAYNE
                        ......Think! There’s got to be...!

                                 EMILY
                        ...It’s alright...

                                 BLAYNE
                        ...No, it’s not. I’m not losing you.
                        Not again.

                                 EMILY
                        There’s nothing you can do.

                                 BLAYNE
                        There has to be.

                                 EMILY
                        Okay, there is one thing... 
                        Hold me.

           It takes a moment for Blayne to accept this... But finally...
           He brings the car to a standstill... And there’s quiet...
           Blayne gently reaches for her hand...
           She rests her head on his shoulder... And he holds her...

           And that’s when Blayne sees....... Emily’s handbag.......
           Stuffed with papers and pens and notes and tissues.....

           And LEAFLETS......... For the LOS ANGELES SCIENCE MUSEUM....
           And their LATEST EXHIBITION -------

           THE ORIGINAL CHRISTOFOLOS ACCELERATOR.......

                                 BLAYNE
                        No........way.....
                                                              SMASH TO:

           EXT. SCIENCE MUSEUM, EXPOSITION PARK - PRE-DAWN

           The place is deserted -- Locked down for the night...

           The Pick up SCREAMS IN -- SCREECHES to a standstill -
           By the Museum’s ELECTRICAL GENERATOR BUILDING -

                                 EMILY
                        How do we get in?

           The MAIN DOOR is LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE -
           Blayne turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. EXPOSITION PARK, E2 - MORNING

           Blayne turns to see -- The MUSEUM IS GONE -
           And some MULTI-STORY STRUCTURE is UNDER CONSTRUCTION -

           With a CRANE TOWER over a hundred feet tall -
           The HOOK and WIRE have been tied off against the CRANE CAB...

           Blayne clambers onto the MASSIVE HOOK -
           He releases the rope -- And the hook SWINGS OUT -
           A GREAT SWOOSHING ARC on the end of the 100 foot wire -
           He WHOOSHES out over the foundation like a giant PENDULUM -
           Then swings back -- And right at it lowest point -
           Blayne jumps -- Flies though the air -- VANISHES -

           For a moment we sees the HOOK -- SWINGING FREELY -

           INT. MAIN ENTRANCE HALL, SCIENCE MUSEUM - PRE-DAWN

           Blayne reappears just a few inches from the ground -
           And is sent CRASHING into a FULL TRASH CAN -
           Blayne gets his bearings -- He’s at the MAIN ENTRANCE CAFE -
           Tables and chairs and MARKET UMBRELLAS pulled in for the night -

           He UNLOCKS THE MAIN DOOR -- And an ALARM SOUNDS -
           Emily hurries in -

           INT. EXHIBIT GALLERY, SCIENCE MUSEUM - MOMENTS LATER

           Blayne and Emily hurry through the deserted halls -
           Finally finding -- “A HISTORY OF OUR FUTURE” -
           And there it is -- The oldest, rattiest Accelerator ever -

                                 BLAYNE
                        This thing even work?
                                 EMILY
                        It’ll take a moment for the Generators 
                        to warm up - Then we’ll find out.

           She starts to fire up the TRANSFORMERS -
           CHARGING LIGHTS ILLUMINATE -- One light of ten... Then two...
           Blayne unpacks the DEVICE...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIBRARY, THE ESTATE - PRE-DAWN

           Yaati finds Harper at his computer -

                                 YAATI
                        Someone just tripped the alarm  at 
                        the Science Museum.

           And Harper realizes their plan...

                                 HARPER
                        Very clever... Take everyone. 
                        Finish it.

           Yaati appears pleased by this notion...

           INT. EXHIBIT GALLERY, SCIENCE MUSEUM - PRE-DAWN

           An eerie quiet has befallen the vacuous room -
           Just the hum of the Transformer as the EIGHTH LIGHT BLINKS ON...

                                 BLAYNE
                        How long once they’re charged?

                                 EMILY
                        We just have to flip that switch.
                        Inside Zero Time.

           A simple switcher marked FIELD GENERATOR...

           The NINTH LIGHT FLICKS ON... Blayne checks his watch -
           Two minutes...

                                 BLAYNE
                        It’s going to work.

           Emily steps closer and takes Blayne’s hand...

           And that’s when THE LIGHTS GO OFF -
           As the entire building POWERS DOWN...
           All NINE TRANSFORMER LIGHTS FADE...

                                 BLAYNE
                        They know.

           And he turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. EXHIBIT GALLERY/CONSTRUCTION SITE - ZERO TIME

           A SUPERIMPOSITION OF TWO GHOST WORLDS -
           HALF AT THE MUSEUM -- HALF AT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE -
           TIME IS NOW CLOSE TO FROZEN -- EVEN THE SUN WILL RISE SLOWLY -
           SO BLAYNE CAN EXTEND THOSE PRECIOUS FEW MINUTES -

           Blayne runs -- To the WINDOW -- And looks out -
           As Yaati and FOUR UNIQUES arrive ON MOTORBIKES -

           And there -- The Museum’s Electrical Generator Building -
           BENEATH A TALL TREE -- He needs to find a way to get in there... 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, EXPOSITION PARK, E2 - MORNING

           A moment of stillness -- Before Blayne APPEARS -
           And RACES UP THE STAIRS -

           INT. EXHIBIT GALLERY, SCIENCE MUSEUM - PRE-DAWN

           REAL TIME -- Emily opens her eyes -- Waking from the kiss...
           And she touches her lips -- Still feeling Blayne’s touch...
           She looks to the clock and watches as TWO SECONDS tick by...

           INT. UNFINISHED PENTHOUSES, CONSTRUCTION ZONE, E2 - MORNING

           Blayne tears up the STAIRS -- Runs to an OPEN WINDOW -
           When suddenly -- HE’S ATTACKED BY A UNIQUE GUARD -
           WHO THROW THEM BOTH -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. PENTHOUSE/ABOVE THE MUSEUM - ZERO TIME

           A SUPERIMPOSITION OF TWO GHOST WORLDS -
           The UNFINISHED PENTHOUSES -- And fifty feet above the Museum -

           A brutal street brawl -- Exchanging vicious blows -
           While dodging slow-moving bullets -- Then -
           The Guard gets the upper hand -

           Kicking Blayne across the floor -- So that he notices -
           The ceiling is COVERED IN THREE FOOT MIRRORED TILES -
           And we FOLLOW BLAYNE as he rolls -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. UNFINISHED PENTHOUSES, CONSTRUCTION ZONE, E2 - MORNING

           REAL TIME -- Blayne aims up at the MIRROR -- AND SHOOTS -
           Just as the Sweep Guard follows him out of ZERO TIME -

           So that he MORPHS WITH THE FALLING SHARDS OF MIRROR -

           Riddling his body with broken glass and silver -
           The Guard is dead before he hits the ground -
           And we FOLLOW BLAYNE -- SEAMLESSLY BACK TO -

           INT. PENTHOUSE/ABOVE THE MUSEUM - ZERO TIME

           Blayne looks from the WINDOW OPENING down to the TALL TREE -
           And where the Generator Building is back on E1 -

           Then he looks for just the right tool -- And sees -
           A THREE FOOT MIRRORED TILE -- Still intact -

           He picks up the TILE -- Turns to the window -
           And hurls it out -- LIKE A FRISBEE -- And it GROWS -
           Becoming A LONG NARROW MIRRORED BRIDGE -
           That gently ARCS all the way down to the ground -
           Then -- Very cautiously -- He climbs onto the MIRRORED BRIDGE...
           And steps out through the window -- There’s a SPLINTERY CRACK -
           But it seems to take his weight -- So he edges further along...

           Which is when ANOTHER UNIQUE GUARD appears -- Sees Blayne -
           And leaps onto the fragile bridge after him -

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE/MUSEUM PARKING LOT - ZERO TIME

           A SUPERIMPOSITION OF TWO GHOST WORLDS -
           The CONSTRUCTION SITE -- And high above the PARKING LOT -

           Blayne and the Guard tear across the MIRRORED BRIDGE -
           The thing’s CRACKING and SNAPPING under their stomping feet -
           Then the Guard OPENS FIRE -- And Blayne dives forward -
           Sliding down the LAST STEEPER PART OF THE MIRRORED ARC -
           The EDGES SLICE into his arms and legs -

           He slides onto the ground -- Turns -- FIRES AT THE BRIDGE -
           Which SHATTERS -- And the Guard plummets to the ground -
           Blayne stands -- Gets his bearings -- And turns SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. GENERATOR BUILDING, SCIENCE MUSEUM, LA - PRE-DAWN

           Blayne turns to the MAIN ELECTRICAL BOX -- And flips the BREAKERS -

           INT. EXHIBIT GALLERY, SCIENCE MUSEUM - PRE-DAWN

           Emily looks up in wonder as the LIGHTS COME BACK ON -
           Then to the Accelerator as the CHARGING LIGHTS RE-APPEAR -
           One... Two... Tree... Four...

           INT. MUSEUM FOYER/CONSTRUCTION SITE - ZERO TIME

           A SUPERIMPOSITION OF TWO GHOST WORLDS -

           Blayne tears through -- When suddenly -- Yaati appears -
           Hurling him to the ground -- She runs in for the kill -
           AND A BLISTERING ZERO TIME FIGHT ENSUES -

           KNIVES BECOME SHIELDS -- COINS BECOME CHAINS -
           And the fight goes to and fro -- Until suddenly -
           Yaati gets the upper hand with the same move that killed Kiche -
           Blayne’s head is pinned under her foot -

           AND THE PRESSURE IS BUILDING -- BEGINNING TO CRUSH THEM -
           And Yaati tries the same trick -- She turns her head -
           OUT OF ZERO TIME TO BREATHE -

           But in that split second -- As Yaati is looking away -
           Blayne sees -- THE GHOST OF THE CRANE HOOK SWINGING IN -

           And -- Using every last ounce of his strength -
           He hurls Yaati -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, EXPOSITION PARK, E2 - MORNING

           Yaati APPEARS -- And MORPHS with the GIANT HOOK -
           In MID-SWING -- Right through her belly - 

           INT. EXHIBIT GALLERY, SCIENCE MUSEUM - PRE-DAWN

           Emily looks up as Blayne APPEARS OUT OF THIN AIR -
                                 EMILY
                        One more light.

           They turn to the transformer..... Waiting.......
           As the last light blinks into life -

                                 BLAYNE
                        Let’s blow this popsicle stand.

           Emily flips the switch -

           And now WE’RE INSIDE THE ACCELERATOR -- Round and round -
           FASTER and FASTER - A DOZEN BEAMS OF LASER LIGHT HIT THE LENS - 
           And are REFRACTED TOWARDS THE MICROCHIPS... And.... And........ 
           And..........

           Nothing happens... Fear rises in them...

                                 EMILY
                        Did it work?

                                 BLAYNE
                        I don’t know.

           They look to the horizon -- BRIGHTENING AS THE SUN REARS...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Hold on.

           Blayne turns -- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. EXHIBIT GALLERY, SCIENCE MUSEUM - ZERO TIME

           Emily is FROZEN -- Becoming SNAKE-LIKE -

           As Blayne looks all around -- Desperate for a clue...
           And then he hears it... A distant quiet cracking...
           Then he notices -- A TINY CRACK -- Snaking its way up the wall -

           He moves closer to inspect the wall -- And SUDDENLY -
           The ENTIRE WALL DISAPPEARS INTO THE CRACK -
           Like some GIANT ROCK CRUSHER -- PULVERIZING EVERYTHING -

           He hears ANOTHER CRACK -- And turns to the far wall -
           Another RIP IN THE FABRIC OF SPACE APPEARS -

           Then Blayne’s drawn to the window -- And looks outside -

           EXT. SCIENCE MUSEUM, EXPOSITION PARK, LA - ZERO TIME

           RANDOM CRACKS APPEAR all across the PARKING LOT -
           Then CRUMBLE -- Dragging great chunks of blacktop down -
           To an ENDLESS BLACK NOTHINGNESS BELOW -

           INT. EXHIBIT GALLERY, SCIENCE MUSEUM - PRE-DAWN

           Blayne turns to Emily -- Here, the room is perfectly intact -
           And quiet -

                                 BLAYNE
                        It’s working. 

           They share a brittle smile -- Then Blayne turns to leave -
                                 EMILY
                        Where are you going?

                                 BLAYNE
                        I can’t leave you here with 
                        Harper still alive.

                                 EMILY
                        How long do I have?

           He loves her enough to tell her the truth...

                                 BLAYNE
                        You can see the sunrise.

           And with that -- Blayne turns -- VANISHING -
           Leaving Emily very much alone...

           INT. EXHIBIT GALLERY/CONSTRUCTION SITE - ZERO TIME

           Blayne turns back to Emily -- Now FROZEN IN TIME...

           He looks at her -- So fragile -- So blameless...
           Drawn to her... He moves close... And kisses her...
           Softly... Lovingly... AND THERE’S AN ABSOLUTE SILENCE....

           IN EXTREME CLOSE UP -- As he pulls away -- THEIR LIPS STICK - 
           As if they were......CONNECTED........

           And touches his lip... And something inside smiles -
           BECAUSE HE HAS AN IDEA...

           Blayne has seen a way out.........

           EXT. SCIENCE MUSEUM, EXPOSITION PARK, LA - ZERO TIME

           Blayne jumps onto a MOTORBIKE as more of the PARKING LOT is 
           SWALLOWED by the GROWING CRACKS.....

           EXT. 10 FREEWAY - ZERO TIME

           Blayne speeds through the SUPER-SLOW-MOTION TRAFFIC -
           SWERVING around the practically motionless vehicles -
           As ALL AROUND is CRUSHED by the SPIDER-WEB CRACKS -
           BUILDINGS -- OVERPASSES -- EVERYTHING -

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, THE ESTATE - PRE-DAWN

           Harper is reacting to his COMPUTER SCREEN -
           The MAP OF EARTH TWO is FRAGMENTING as they lose contact -
           He backs away from the SCREENS in fury -
           As Blayne APPEARS... And the two men face off...

                                 HARPER
                        I was really hoping you’d be dead 
                        by now.

                                 BLAYNE
                        Not without saying Goodbye.
           Harper nods, understanding -- Blayne’s returning to Earth Two...
           Blayne holds out his hand... And Harper regards it spitefully...
           But, shakes it none the less...

           And Blayne pulls him close...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Throughout history, whenever a Emperor
                        has come to believe they were a God, 
                        they have perished at the hands of 
                        their own creation.

                                 HARPER
                        This isn’t over. I’ll find a way - 
                        To reconnect the Earths. And when 
                        I do - I’ll will hunt you down and 
                        I will kill you. 

           Blayne accepts the challenge...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Until then.

           Blayne releases Harper’s hand... And walks from the room... 
           No grand exit -- No vanishing tricks...

           Harper looks on --  Relieved and a little disappointed...
           He was expecting far worse... He looks to the window -
           And watches as Blayne climbs on his motorbike away...

           He gives a haughty little laugh....... AND SOMETHING HAPPENS -
           HE CHOKES ------- LIKE HE MISSED A BREATH.....

           And then he realizes ------------- HE CAN’T BREATHE -

           And now Harper begins to realize... Color drains from his face -

           AND THE WINDOW PANE CRACKS - Then ANOTHER -- THEN ANOTHER -
           He looks to the clock -- It’s hand is FROZEN IN TIME...

           FLASH INSERT -- IN THE LIBRARY -- A FEW MOMENTS AGO -

           Blayne shakes his hand........ And pulls him into ZERO TIME -

           BACK TO HARPER as realizes his fate... AND THE PRESSURE BUILDS -

                                 HARPER
                        No.. No...

           Then -- A CRACK APPEARS in the face of the clock -
           That OPENS TO A CREVASSE -- That SUCKS HARPER IN -
           His SCREAM ECHOES as he is pulverized to an oblivion...

           EXT. 10 FREEWAY - PRE-DAWN

           THE SUN BEGINS TO OVER THE HORIZON...

           WE SEE Blayne’s ZERO TIME GHOST STREAKING THROUGH TRAFFIC -
           The MOTORBIKE is a brilliant wisp moving faster than a bullet...
           We FOLLOW the ZERO TIME GHOST -
           EXT. SCIENCE MUSEUM, EXPOSITION PARK, LA - CONTINUOUS

           Blayne’s ZERO TIME GHOST flies into the parking lot -
           And the CAMERA RACES SEAMLESSLY TO -

           EXT. SCIENCE MUSEUM/CONSTRUCTION ZONE - ZERO TIME

           The entire LA BASIN IN ZERO TIME is crumbling away -
           Blayne steers the motorbike towards the GLASS ENTRANCE -
           Drops his head -- And Accelerates FASTER STILL -
           CRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS WALL -

           INT. EXHIBIT GALLERY, SCIENCE MUSEUM - DAWN

           THE SUN IS NOW BEGINNING TO RISE FULLY -

           Emily reacts to the sound of the GLASS WALL EXPLODING -
           And turns -- As Blayne APPEARS BEFORE HER -
           They embrace without thought -- Holding on tightly -

                                 EMILY
                        You have to leave.

                                 BLAYNE
                        No.

                                 EMILY
                        But you won’t be able to get home.

           Blayne looks to her... Searches her eyes...

                                 BLAYNE
                        I am home.

           They share a desperate smile and he holds her...

                                 EMILY
                        Whatever happens... Don’t let go.

           He holds her tighter still...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Never.

           They look to the SUN -- AS IT BURSTS OVER THE HORIZON...
           And still nothing... 

           And very gradually... Blayne relaxes his tight embrace...
           Fifteen seconds... Twenty... So he can see her face...
           And she finds a fragile smile....... It’s worked........

           But then........ Blayne stops cold........ Something’s wrong -

                                 EMILY
                        What?

           Her eyes -- THE CAPILLARIES ARE FILLING WITH BLOOD -

                                 BLAYNE
                        NO!

           Blayne throws his arms around her -- CLUTCHING HER TIGHT -
           And kisses her -- IT IS THE MOTHER OF ALL KISSES -
           Feeling every ounce of her -- Her CLOTHES -- HER SKIN -

           THEN THE NOISE -------------- But he holds her tighter still -
           And the kiss gets even bigger...........

           AND THE NOISE RECEDES............

           So he can feel HER BLOOD ------ HER HEART ------ HER SOUL -

           ALL CONNECTED ------ TO HIM -----

           AND HE TURNS THEM BOTH ----------- SEAMLESSLY TO -

           INT. EXHIBIT GALLERY/CONSTRUCTION SITE - ZERO TIME

           Blayne and Emily fall into a BLACK COLLAPSING ABYSS -

           As the last of ZERO TIME COLLAPSES -

           THE MUSEUM -- LOS ANGELES -- THE EARTH -

           ALL TUMBLE INTO AN INFINITE DARKNESS........

           The SCREEN BECOMES A COMPLETE FRAME OF BLACK......

           And that’s it........... For the longest time.........

           Nothing........... Silence........... Death..........

           But then.... There’s a KNOCK -- On a door....

           A few moments pass -- Before the door opens -

                                                                REVEAL:

           INT. ALICE’S TRAILER - DAY

           We’re inside Blayne’s Mother’s Trailer -- She opens the door -
           To find Blayne standing there...

                                 ALICE
                        Two visits in the same month?

                                 BLAYNE
                        There’s someone I want you to meet.

           He takes a step back..... And looks to his side....
           Inviting someone closer.........

           And Emily steps into the doorway....

                                 EMILY
                        Hi - I’m Emily.

                                 ALICE
                        Well, hello, Emily. I’m Alice -  
                        Eric’s Mother.

           They exchange warm smiles... And Alice invites her in...

                                 EMILY
                        What a beautiful home you have.
           She steps inside... And Alice immediately corners her son -

                                 ALICE
                        My Goodness, Eric - She’s lovely.
                        Her eyes are so beautiful.

           Blayne looks at Emily...

                                 BLAYNE
                        Yeah... They’re unique.

           He gives a wry smile...

           FADE OUT

                                       THE END
