           INT. GRADE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY (1980)

           THIRD GRADERS eat lunch as mischievous LAWAYNE FUNDERBURK 
           ogles his beloved Rocky Balboa lunch box.

                                 LAWAYNE 
                        I could look at Rocky all day.

           Our good boy MICHAEL YOUNG looks over at Lawayne and Rocky, 
           then sadly at his own red-and-black plaid lunch box.

           Michael’s eye is distracted by shy, cute BEVERLY PLOOF, a 
           couple of rows up and over, quietly reading.  He smiles as if 
           he could look at her all day.

           A KNOCK gets MRS. COOPER up to open the door for MICHAEL’S 
           MOM, who waves at her son.  He sinks down in his seat. 

                                 MRS. COOPER
                        Class, I’ll be in the hallway with 
                        Michael’s mother, so Michael that 
                        means you’re in charge.

           As she steps out, Lawayne taps Michael’s arm.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        I’m going to go look up Beverly 
                        Ploof’s dress!

           Michael is horrified as Lawayne gets down and crawls in front 
           of Beverly’s desk.  As promised he takes a good peek.  

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Mrs. Cooper and Michael’s mom sit by the classroom door.  

                                 MRS. COOPER
                        Michael is doing great.  He’s such 
                        a joy to have in my classroom.

                                 MOM
                        He’s always been such a good boy.  
                        I don’t know how I got so lucky.

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Lawayne scurries back to his desk.  He pops back up and leans 
           obliviously into Michael’s angry gaze.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Did you see that?  I looked up 
                        Beverly Ploof’s dress!
           INT. GRADE SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 MRS. COOPER
                        Michael’s getting straight A’s and 
                        he plays well with others.

           Mom beams.

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Michael trembles, then hauls back and SMASHES LAWAYNE IN THE 
           MOUTH.  Lawayne hits the floor and Michael jumps him.

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Mrs. Cooper is nearly teary-eyed.

                                 MRS. COOPER
                        Michael is about the sweetest, 
                        nicest boy I have ever taught.

           A COMMOTION OF SCATTERING DESKS AND YELLING CHILDREN is 
           followed by a BANG, BANG BANG against the door.

           The ladies jump up, and as Mrs. Cooper opens the door 
           Lawayne’s head falls into the hall.  Michael sits on his 
           chest.  Both women put their hands to their mouths.  
           Classmates gather around the two combatants.

                                 MRS. COOPER (CONT'D)
                        Michael Young!

           Michael freezes, allowing Lawayne to flip him and get on top.

                                 MRS. COOPER (CONT'D)
                        Lawayne Funderburk!

           Lawayne stops as he realizes Michael is looking past him.  
           Everyone follows Michael’s gaze to Beverly’s face as she 
           peers in bashfully from the back of the group.  They all look 
           back at Michael, who smiles serenely.  LAWAYNE’S FIST FILLS 
           THE SCREEN.

           A YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPH of five-year-old Michael morphs into 
           live-action of Michael posing for the shot.  There’s a FLASH.

                        Good, Michael.  Beverly’s next.

           Michael gets up and takes a step away as Beverly sits down.  
           Michael’s still in the shot, gazing at Beverly.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Michael?!

           He looks straight at the camera, turns red, then runs off.

           Most of the kids have their heads down as Beverly and six 
           others tap people and run to the front of the classroom. 

                                 MRS. COOPER
                        Okay, 7-Up.  

           Seven kids who raise their heads have hands up, including 
           Michael.

                        Michael?

           He hesitates, looking at Beverly.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Did Beverly pick me?

           Beverly blushes and is about to answer --

           11-year-old Michael runs alongside Beverly, who’s carrying a 
           football.  They’re both giggling.

                                 BOY (O.S.)

           Shaggy-haired, pimply-faced Michael walks by Beverly at her 
           locker.  He stops short when he sees a POSTER OF THE POGUES.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Beverly, hey.  I didn’t know anyone 
                        else here liked The Pogues.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah, they’re great.  My uncle told 
                        me about them.

           She waits for more.  Long pause.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah.  Okay.  Bye bye.

           Dressed in cap and gown, geeky senior Michael is pushed by 
           his buddy Andy in the direction of two chatting female 
           graduates, one of them Beverly.

           Michael takes the long, slow, last-chance walk toward the 
           girl of his dreams.

           As Beverly watches expectantly out of the corner of her eye, 
           Michael walks right on by, not stopping until he’s inches 
           from the brick wall.  He stands there, his back to everyone.  
           Beverly turns back around, disappointed.

           The face of MICHAEL YOUNG, now in his mid-30s, is a blank as 
           he drives a newer Honda through Boston traffic.  No longer 
           nerdy, he’s a well-groomed, confident professional.

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           Michael concentrates on his computer as VICTOR VALLEY, late 
           20s, sits in quiet contemplation.  Michael finally stops.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Shouldn’t you be working on the 
                        Seaview web site?  

                                 VICTOR
                        I’m trying to think of a woman for 
                        you.  Problem is you’re too picky.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t think so.

                                 VICTOR
                        Would you go out with a smoker?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.

                                 VICTOR
                        That’s twenty-five percent you’ve 
                        eliminated right from the start.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, the twenty-five percent who 
                        smell like smoke.

                                 VICTOR
                        So what else rules a woman out?

           Michael gives up working and turns toward Victor.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t have a list.  She does have 
                        to be smart.  And down to earth.

                                 VICTOR
                        What about drinking?

                                 MICHAEL
                        She can drink a little.

                                 VICTOR
                        That’s nice of you.  How about if 
                        she wears blue eye shadow?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.

                                 VICTOR
                        The reason she uses blue eye shadow 
                        is it’s the only thing that cures a 
                        fluttering eyelid condition.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Is that possible?

                                 VICTOR
                        Let’s just say it is.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m still kind of worried about the 
                        eyelid thing.  Why would it 
                        flutter?  Is it psychological?

                                 VICTOR
                        Forget it.  How about if she talks 
                        during movies?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.

                                 VICTOR
                        She can’t pronounce the word 
                        “gravitas.”

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.

                                 VICTOR
                        What if she once dated a guy who 
                        wore his baseball cap backwards?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh god no.

                                 VICTOR
                        She’s the most beautiful woman in 
                        the world, really nice, incredibly 
                        smart, but she had a boyfriend who 
                        wore his cap backwards.

           Michael thinks about it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        She can’t be that smart if she 
                        dated a guy who wore his cap 
                        backwards.

           INT. MICHAEL’S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Michael plops a briefcase and mail on a table, picks up the 
           phone and checks for messages.  He sees an envelope with a 
           hand-written address, opens it and reads “Panther Lake 
           Elementary Reunion” at the top as a PHONE MESSAGE begins.
                                 MEGAN (ON PHONE)
                        Hi Michael!  Megan Woolcott, 
                        remember me?  I got your number 
                        from Andy, hope you don’t mind.  I 
                        sent you an invitation to a reunion 
                        I’m heading so I’m really putting 
                        the squeeze on you here.  You may 
                        have heard they’re tearing down 
                        Panther Lake Elementary and some of 
                        us thought it would be fun to get 
                        together and talk about old 
                        memories.  I know it’s a long ways 
                        but I’m sure a lot of people would 
                        love to see you.  

           Michael looks equally irritated and curious.

           INT. ANDY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           ANDY TINGSTAD, mid-30s, unpretentious underachiever, holds 
           the phone while sitting at a computer desk.  This looks like 
           his teenage room in his parents’ house, which in fact it was.

                                 ANDY
                        So are you coming?

           INT. MICHAEL’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Michael rests up against the headboard.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why would I go to that?

           INTERCUT BETWEEN MICHAEL AND ANDY

                                 ANDY
                        My band’s going to play.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Andy, I’m not flying from Boston to 
                        Seattle to listen to your band.

                                 ANDY
                        Don’t you want to see anyone? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Those people are the reason I live 
                        in Boston now.  The only one I’d 
                        like to see again is Beverly.  I’ve 
                        been thinking about her a lot 
                        lately.  I Googled her.  Nothing.

           Andy blanches.
                                 ANDY
                        Beverly?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, no sign of a Beverly Ploof 
                        anywhere in the universe.  She must 
                        have married and changed her name.  
                        She was so smart, she must have 
                        done something internet worthy.  
                        Only losers can’t be Googled.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m not on Google.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well -- there’s probably too many 
                        Andy Tingstads to find your 
                        listings. 

                                 ANDY
                        No, there’s just one.  It isn’t me.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Huh.  Anyway, you haven’t heard 
                        anything about Beverly, have you?  
                        Is she still around?

           Andy hesitates.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, she’s still in Kent --
                        And she did get married.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh.

                                 ANDY
                        But then she got a divorce.

           Michael sits up.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Really?  Why didn’t you say 
                        something?

                                 ANDY
                        I thought you got over her.  I 
                        thought you were dating a lot.

                                 MICHAEL
                           (without enthusiasm)
                        Yeah, I’ve even got a blind date 
                        tonight.
           EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           As Michael approaches the door to the club he sees THE MOST 
           BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN BOSTON standing by the door -- SMOKING.  

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                        Michael?

           He wavers, weighing haunting beauty against a Virginia Slim.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I wish.

           INT. COMPANY AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Michael is giving a presentation in front of 100 fellow 
           office workers.  He’s self-assured and obviously admired by 
           his peers, especially the women.  Victor takes notice.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We are getting too careless in how 
                        we use our graphic interfacing 
                        tools.  I think a lot of you are 
                        forgetting our objective:  clarity 
                        and ease of use.  This software...

           INT. COMPANY CAFETERIA - DAY

           Michael and Victor carry lunch trays through the tables.

                                 VICTOR
                        I wish I could speak in front of 
                        the group like you do.  I stumble 
                        and mumble and sweat.  

           They pick a table in the corner.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’ll get better.  You know in 
                        high school I couldn’t even speak 
                        in front of the class.

                                 VICTOR
                        Because you were a nerd?

                                 MICHAEL
                           (defensively)
                        I wasn’t a nerd.  Just shy.  But I 
                        learned if I was prepared and acted 
                        like I knew what I was talking 
                        about, I had nothing to fear.  Now 
                        I feel as if I could say anything 
                        to anyone.  And they buy it.
           Victor looks across the room.

                                 VICTOR
                        Well Becky Hart was sure buying it.  
                        She’s intelligent.  What do you 
                        think of her?  No blue eye shadow.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sure, she’s academically smart.  
                        But emotionally she’s really 
                        screwed up.  She cried during 
                        Powerpoint training when she 
                        couldn’t get her Toolbox to open.

           Victor keeps looking.

                                 VICTOR
                        Lynn Fellows.  Now she’s bright.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I went out with her.

                                 VICTOR
                        Really?  What happened?

                                 MICHAEL
                        She was great.  Loves to read, 
                        loves art, loves to travel.

                                 VICTOR
                        So...?

                                 MICHAEL
                        She talks baby talk.

                                 VICTOR
                        I like that in bed.  It’s cute.

                                 MICHAEL
                        But if you’re not in bed it’s kind 
                        of scary.

                                 VICTOR
                        I don’t know --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Trust me, it’s not cute when you’re 
                        standing in line at Target.

           Victor looks around the room again.

                                 VICTOR
                        Kim Lewis.  What’s wrong with her?
                                 MICHAEL
                        She stabbed her last boyfriend.

                                 VICTOR
                        I heard it was self-defense.

                                 MICHAEL
                        He was sleeping.

                                 VICTOR
                        So she’s not perfect.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And besides that, she likes Celine 
                        Dion.  That’s one rule I do have -- 
                        she can either stab me or she can 
                        like Celine Dion, but not both.

           Victor shakes his head.

                                 VICTOR
                        Like I said, too picky.  You’ve now 
                        ruled out every woman in the world.  
                        You will die sad and alone. 

           INT. MICHAEL’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Michael watches TV from the couch while eating take-out.  He 
           goes to a bookcase and pulls out a YEARBOOK: “KENT-MERIDIAN 
           DIADEM ‘89” and sits back down.

           He looks at several PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIS FELLOW CLASSMATES.

           He finally stops on the SENIOR CLASS PHOTO OF BEVERLY PLOOF. 
           She has a pretty, kind face and long brown hair -- a look of 
           intelligence and empathy, with a warm inviting smile.

           Under “Veterinary Club” BEVERLY HUGS A BLACK LABRADOR.  A few 
           pages later there’s MICHAEL PLAYING BASKETBALL -- rail thin 
           and wearing unfashionable glasses and black socks.  

           Michael grimaces and flips more pages until he finds two in 
           the back stuck together.  He slips a fingernail along the 
           edge and cracks them open, revealing two pages titled 
           “SIGNATURES.”  One is blank but the other has a note:

                                 BEVERLY (V.O.)
                        “Dear Michael - We never did talk 
                        much, but I just want you to know 
                        that I think you’re the nicest boy 
                        I’ve ever met and I would have 
                        liked to have known you better...”
           INT. MICHAEL’S LIVING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Holding the yearbook in one hand and the phone in the other, 
           Michael reads excitedly while he paces the room.

                                 MICHAEL
                        “I wish I’d had the courage to tell 
                        you all this.  I guess it just 
                        wasn’t meant to be.  But if you 
                        want to get together this summer 
                        before you go off to college, 
                        please call me.  Love, Beverly.”

           He stops, waiting for a response.

           INT. ANDY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A wide-eyed Andy is sitting forward on his bed, disbelieving.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh my god.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN MICHAEL AND ANDY

                                 MICHAEL
                        She was crazy about me, too!  

                                 ANDY
                        You never saw that?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I would have run naked down the 
                        street to her house if I’d seen 
                        that!  She underlined “Love”!  She 
                        loved me!  Andy, I’m coming.

                                 ANDY
                        You’re what?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m coming to Kent to ask Beverly 
                        Ploof to marry me.

                                 ANDY
                        Marry you?  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well at least ask her out for 
                        coffee.  You said she was divorced, 
                        right?  When’s the reunion, 
                        Saturday?  I’ll fly out tomorrow.  
                        That gives me a week.  
                                 ANDY
                        Are you sure about this?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Andy, I’m 32 and I’ve never met 
                        another woman who came close to 
                        Beverly.  I’ll be dead in 40 years.  
                        I’m running out of time here.  

                                 ANDY
                        Why will you be dead in 40 years?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Law of averages.  Look, do me a 
                        favor.  See how much you can learn 
                        about her by tomorrow, can you?  If 
                        you could find out where she lives, 
                        if she’s seeing anyone, anything.

                                 ANDY
                        But what if she’s changed?  It’s 
                        been 15 years.  You probably 
                        wouldn’t even recognize her now.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’d know that face anywhere.  God 
                        she was cute.  And so shy.  I loved 
                        that.  I didn’t have the nerve to 
                        tell her that before, but I do now.

                                 ANDY
                        What if she’s 500 pounds?  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t care -- she’s not, though, 
                        right?  Did you hear something?  
                        Hell, it doesn’t matter.  She’s the 
                        one.  I’m coming.

           Andy looks very worried for his friend.

           INT./EXT. LEXUS - SEATTLE FREEWAY - DAY

           Michael talks on his cell phone as he drives a rented Lexus.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Victor, this is really important.  
                        Tell the bosses one of my parents 
                        is sick.  Probably dying.  We need 
                        time to have a heart-to-heart talk 
                        and forgive each other and hug 
                        before they pull the plug.  That 
                        kind of shit.
                                 VICTOR (ON PHONE)
                        Okay.  Which parent?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t care, you pick one.

                                 VICTOR (ON PHONE)
                        Where are you going?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m already there, Seattle.  You 
                        were right, there aren’t many women 
                        who have everything I’m looking 
                        for.  I’ve only met one so far.  
                        That’s why I’m going back to Kent 
                        to find Beverly Ploof.

                                 VICTOR (ON PHONE)
                        What’s a Beverly Ploof?

           EXT. GRADE SCHOOL PLAY FIELD - DAY (1981) - FLASHBACK

           Nine-year old Michael sits on a rock near a small creek just 
           past the gymnasium.  Beverly wanders by, her head coyly down.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Hi Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hi.  Where are you going?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’m going to jump over the creek.

                                 MICHAEL
                        But we’re not allowed over there.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Do you want to?  No one’s watching.  

           Michael looks around.  He gets up and walks over to her.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT'D)
                        Ready?  One, two --

           Michael sees something and stops, but Beverly jumps over and 
           falls to the ground.  MR. ANDERSON approaches.

                                 MR. ANDERSON
                        Just what is going on here?!

           Beverly looks like she might cry.
                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s my fault.  I pushed her.

                                 MR. ANDERSON
                        Beverly, get back over here.  And 
                        you Michael Young, follow me!

           INT. MICHAEL’S ROOM - DAY (1981) - FLASHBACK

           Michael’s MOM AND DAD stand over him as he sits contritely on 
           the edge of his bed.

                                 MOM
                        I don’t know what’s got into you!  
                        Fighting with boys!  Pushing girls!   
                        I’m at the end of my rope!  George, 
                        what are we going to do?

           Dad bends down, concerned, staring him right in the eye.

                                 DAD
                        Michael, I want you to be 
                        absolutely truthful with me right 
                        now.  Are you on drugs?

           Mom puts her hand over her open mouth.  Michael isn’t quite 
           sure what drugs are, but senses a good excuse.  He nods.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes.

           Mom SCREAMS.

                                 MOM
                        Oh my god, what are we going to do?

           She starts weeping hysterically.  Dad shakes his head.

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY (1981) - FLASHBACK

           A red-faced Michael and his class watch a DRUG PREVENTION 
           TROUPE perform a skit dressed in brand new punk clothing. 

                                 GROUP MEMBER
                        Hey, I’m going to take drugs, that 
                        would be so totally cool.

                                 GROUP LEADER
                        That’s not cool, that’s stupid.

                                 OTHER GROUP MEMBER
                        Yeah, why do you think they call it 
                        dope?
           Kids giggle.  Michael looks at Beverly, who rolls her eyes.  
           She catches his glance and shakes her head.  He smiles.

           INT./EXT. LEXUS - KENT STREETS - BACK TO THE PRESENT 

           Michael passes a “WELCOME TO KENT” sign... KENT-MERIDIAN 
           HIGH... KENT JUNIOR HIGH... PANTHER LAKE ELEMENTARY.  He 
           pulls up to the family home, a craftsman in need of paint.

           INT. MICHAEL’S PARENTS’ KITCHEN - DAY

           Poorly remodeled back in the 1980s, the room has a pale 
           yellow glow as the Youngs eat around an Oak Warehouse table. 

                                 MOM
                        You’re going to what?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Go see Beverly Ploof.

                                 DAD
                        I always liked her.  You should 
                        have asked her out.

                                 MOM
                        I thought she got married.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Andy says she’s divorced.

                                 DAD
                        Her dad’s an idiot.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why do you say that?

                                 DAD
                        Because he’s not very bright.  They 
                        come to square dancing once in a 
                        while.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Do they ever mention Beverly?

                                 MOM
                        We don’t talk to them.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why not?

                                 DAD
                        Because he’s an idiot.  And the 
                        missus can’t be too smart.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Why?

                                 DAD
                        She married the moron.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well, somehow Beverly turned out 
                        pretty bright.

                                 DAD
                        You should have hit on her a long 
                        time ago.  What a sweet girl.

                                 MOM
                        Yeah, she was so nice.  Why didn’t 
                        you ever ask her out?

           Michael stares at both of them.

           EXT. ANDY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           ANDY’S MOM smiles as she opens the front door for Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hi Mrs. Tingstad.  How are you?

                                 ANDY’S MOM
                        Good, Michael.  Come on in.

           INT. ANDY’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Andy comes down the stairs as she shows Michael in.  They 
           shake hands and half hug.

                                 ANDY
                        Hey buddy.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So how is everything?

                                 ANDY’S MOM
                        Andy still lives at home.

           INT. ANDY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Andy’s on his bed, surrounded by guitars, as Michael sits in 
           the desk chair.  Andy hands him a piece of notebook paper.

                                 ANDY
                        Megan gave me Beverly’s address and 
                        phone number.  Are you going to 
                        call her?
                                 MICHAEL
                        Maybe I’ll surprise her.

                                 ANDY
                        She works at the elementary school.  
                        Megan doesn’t think she has a 
                        boyfriend.

           Michael smiles at his good fortune.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Really?  Anything else?

           Andy hesitates.

                                 ANDY
                        No.  That’s about it.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        So Beverly’s a teacher.  That’s why 
                        I couldn’t find her -- teaching is 
                        where smart people disappear.  Or 
                        did she change her name?

                                 ANDY
                        Oh -- I forgot to ask. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s okay.

           He stares with some satisfaction at the paper.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        So, how’s the band?

                                 ANDY
                        We’re in the Golden Steer lounge 
                        all week.  And the reunion, that’ll 
                        be great.  Everybody asking what 
                        I’m doing and I have to say I live 
                        with my parents, don’t have a real 
                        job, and my band plays in bars.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey, your life’s as good as any of 
                        theirs.  At least you don’t wallow 
                        in your school day glory years like 
                        a lot of them, living in the past.

           Michael stops to look at a poster of the B-52’s and pauses.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        I know what will cheer you up.  
           INT. ANDY’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael types at the computer as Andy sits at his shoulder.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I saved some internet searches of 
                        our old classmates.  Look, Steve 
                        Fritts -- he came up on “Google 
                        Groups” -- he wants to know where 
                        he can buy used tires.

                                 ANDY
                        Used tires?

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re afraid of seeing a guy who 
                        can’t afford new tires.

                                 ANDY
                        I live in this room and I just 
                        bought new tires.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s what I’m saying.  Here’s 
                        Lyle Ecklebarger.  Arrest warrant!  
                        DWI.  You don’t drive drunk do you?

                                 ANDY
                        No.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s right.  You get drunk alone 
                        in your childhood bedroom of your 
                        parents’ house where you still live 
                        even though you’re 32 years old.  
                        You tell me which is worse.

           They both laugh.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Here’s one you’ll like:  Lawayne 
                        Funderburk.

           Andy suddenly stops smiling but Michael doesn’t notice.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Nothing!  The guy doesn’t even 
                        exist according to the rest of the 
                        world.  Maybe he died!  

           Andy forces a smile and laugh.
                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Here’s Joe Tuttle, dumb jock.

                                 ANDY
                        That jerk always bragged he was 
                        going to be rich and famous.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well apparently he’s trying to 
                        become rich and famous as a 
                        Substitute Delivery Technician 3 at 
                        Green River Community College.  

                                 ANDY
                        He’s a delivery driver!

                                 MICHAEL
                        I feel awful snooping like this.  

                                 ANDY
                        Me too.  What else does it say?

                                 MICHAEL
                        He makes ten-fifty an hour.  

           They both laugh, trying to keep straight faces as they go on.

                                 ANDY
                        That’s so embarrassing.  But I’m 
                        not laughing because he’s a 
                        delivery guy.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh me either!  It’s the dichotomy 
                        between his youthful braggadocio 
                        and the subsequent reality.

                                 ANDY
                        And that he’s not even a regular 
                        driver, he’s a substitute -- a 
                        class 3 substitute.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        At a community college -- and they 
                        call him a technician.

                                 ANDY
                        Exactly!  Nothing to do with Joe 
                        Tuttle being a delivery driver.  I 
                        mean look at me, I don’t even have 
                        a job and I find it funny.
           INT. MICHAEL’S PARENTS’ BATHROOM - DAY

           Michael is very serious again as he looks in the mirror.

                                 MICHAEL
                        “Beverly, I always adored you and 
                        thought you were the most special 
                        woman I ever met.”

           He shakes his head at this pathetic attempt.

           EXT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Michael pulls up to Beverly’s house, a very modest wood frame 
           that needs work.  Puzzled, Michael re-checks the address.  He 
           gets out holding a BOUQUET, walks to the front door, and 
           RINGS THE DOORBELL.  He takes a deep breath.

           The door opens and standing before him is a 10-YEAR-OLD 
           VISION OF BEVERLY -- only this is KATIE.  Michael is shocked 
           and speechless.  The girl waits a moment. 

                                 KATIE
                        Hi.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hi.  What’s your name?

                                 KATIE
                        Katie.  Who are you?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m Michael.  Are you -- are you 
                        Beverly’s daughter?

                                 KATIE
                        Yes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh.  Is your mother home?

                                 KATIE
                        No, she won’t be back until later.  
                        But my dad is.  Dad!

           Michael’s mouth drops.  He looks as if he wants flee but his 
           feet won’t move.  Katie smiles at him.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Those flowers are pretty.  Are they 
                        for my mom?
           Michael pauses.  In the doorway is big LAWAYNE FUNDERBURK.  
           Michael can’t quite place him.  

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Hey, what’s up?

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY (1980) - FLASHBACK

           Lawayne leans over to Michael.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        I looked up Beverly Ploof’s dress!

           EXT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - BACK TO THE PRESENT

                                 MICHAEL
                        ...Lawayne?

           EXT. GRADE SCHOOL PLAY FIELD - DAY (1983) - FLASHBACK

           Michael runs alongside Beverly with the football, giggling.

                                 BOY (O.S.)
                        Michael, look out for Lawayne!

           Lawayne comes out of nowhere and puts a sudden end to their 
           flirting with a CRUNCHING BLOCK THAT LEVELS MICHAEL.

           EXT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - BACK TO THE PRESENT

           Lawayne is eyeing the flowers and the dumbfounded Michael.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Yeah, I’m Lawayne.  Who are you?

           Michael shifts uncomfortably as Lawayne suddenly smiles.

                                 LAWAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Michael Young?  Well holy shit.

           He feints as if Michael’s going to punch him.

                                 LAWAYNE (CONT’D)
                        You aren’t going to hit me are you?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh, yeah, no, I was just, you know, 
                        stopping by to say hi.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        You brought me flowers, how nice.

           He takes them from Michael and hands them to Katie.
                                 LAWAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Here honey, put these on the table 
                        and get your stuff together.

           Katie runs off.  The men eye each other for a moment.

                                 LAWAYNE (CONT’D)
                        So, you looking for Beverly?  She’s 
                        still at school.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I just thought I’d say hello -- I 
                        heard you were divorced. 

           Lawayne laughs.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Well, this town sure likes to talk.  
                        We’re working on some things.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So you’re not divorced.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Oh she got mad and filed so 
                        technically we are.  So for now I 
                        got my own place.  I’m taking Katie 
                        for spring break.  Beverly’s busy 
                        anyway helping with the reunion 
                        stuff.  Guess we’ll see you there 
                        on Saturday huh?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, I guess so.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        You ready, Katie?

           The door closes and Michael, dazed, heads back to his car. 

           INT./EXT. LEXUS - KENT STREETS - DAY

           The saddest man in the world drives through downtown Kent. 

           INT. GOLDEN STEER LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Andy is on stage setting up equipment as Michael strides up.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Lawayne Funderburk.

                                 ANDY
                        What?
                                 MICHAEL
                        Beverly married Lawayne Funderburk.  
                        You hadn’t heard that?

                                 ANDY
                        They’re not divorced?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, but he’s trying to get her 
                        back.  And she has a daughter.  
                        Andy, she’s Beverly Funderburk!

                                 ANDY
                        Huh.  So now what?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m going to go buy more flowers.  

           EXT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Michael sits in his car in front of the house, clutching an 
           even BIGGER BOUQUET.  There’s a light on in the window.

           He hesitates at the bottom of the stairs, then steels himself 
           and boldly bounds up the darkened steps only to trip on the 
           top one and stumble noisily across the porch.  As he gathers 
           himself the door opens and in the shadows above him she 
           appears -- that familiar face.  She studies him for a moment.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Michael Young?

           Michael smiles, relieved.  He hands her the flowers.  He 
           summons all of his newfound confidence.

                                 MICHAEL
                        There’s something I’ve wanted to 
                        tell you for a long time -- I 
                        adored you from the time we were 
                        kids and I’ve always regretted that 
                        I didn’t have the nerve to tell you 
                        that.  I know this might not be a 
                        good time but I don’t want to spend 
                        my whole life wondering if you --

           He stops as she covers her mouth and gasps.  He waits, not 
           sure if this is a good sign.  Tears are forming in her eyes.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’ve waited all my life to hear you 
                        say that.
           She lifts up on her toes and kisses him very softly on the 
           lips.  When she pulls back he almost topples over from shock.  
           She takes his hand and leads him into the house.

           INT. BEVERLY’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A light in the corner gives off a romantic glow.  She drops 
           the flowers on a table and guides him into her bedroom.

           INT. BEVERLY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She turns on a nightstand lamp, pushes him onto the bed and 
           falls on him, kissing again.  She pulls his shirt off, then 
           his shoes before getting up and walking to the bathroom door. 

                                 BEVERLY
                        Why don’t you get comfortable.

           Michael takes off his pants, blinks and takes a deep breath.  

                                 BEVERLY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        How about some music?

           It takes Michael a moment to comprehend.  He gets up and 
           walks timidly out the door, in underpants and socks.

           INT. BEVERLY’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           He finds a rack of CDs, running his finger along them until 
           stopping on THE POGUES “IF I SHOULD FALL FROM GRACE WITH 
           GOD.”  With a happy flick he pops it out and puts it in the 
           CD player.  The MUSIC INTRO BOOMS THROUGH THE HOUSE.

                                 BEVERLY (O.S.)
                        Oh, I love this song!

           If I should fall from grace with God 
           Where no doctor can relieve me
           If I’m buried ‘neath the sod but the angels won’t receive me
           Let me go boys, let me go boys
           Let me go down in the mud where the rivers all run dry

           Michael sways to the music, then begins a little dance.  He 
           turns to see an OLD BLACK LABRADOR watching from a basket.  
           He leaps back, afraid, but the dog watches harmlessly.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Good boy.  Don’t hurt me.

           The dog stares.  Michael relaxes and looks at MEMENTOS ON THE 
           SHELF.  There’s a row of dolphin knickknacks, and below that 
           some photos -- Katie, Lawayne, Beverly, the dog, Beverly with 
           her sister Jill.  Oh yeah, Jill...
           EXT. SCHOOL PLAY FIELD - DAY (1981) - FLASHBACK

           Michael is trying to reach across the stream to help Beverly 
           back.  By the corner of the gym BEVERLY’S ONE-YEAR-YOUNGER 
           SISTER JILL is pointing them out to Mr. Anderson.

                                 JILL
                        There they are!  Beverly you’re 
                        going to be in so much trouble when 
                        Mom finds out!

           INT. BEVERLY’S LIVING ROOM - BACK TO THE PRESENT

           Michael leans in for a closer look at the photo of the two 
           sisters.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Jill?

           Let them go down in the mud where the rivers all run dry,
           Yeeeeeeeeooooowww!

           A look of terror.  It can’t be.  

           THE MUSIC HAS STOPPED.  The dog gets out of his basket and 
           runs by him, and as Michael turns he sees THE REAL BEVERLY by 
           the stereo, as angelic as he remembered.  He’s so paralyzed 
           he forgets he’s nearly naked.  Beverly looks him up and down.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Michael?

           A pause.  Hoping he’s wrong --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Beverly?

                                 BEVERLY
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m here with you -- with your 
                        sister, we, uh, we’re just --

                                 JILL (O.S.)
                        Hey, what happened to the music?

           Michael and Beverly look at each other.  She looks at the 
           flowers on the table, confused.  He works up his courage.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Beverly, I believe in complete 
                        honesty.  I thought Jill was you.
                                 BEVERLY
                        Jill was me?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I came here tonight to say, well to 
                        tell you -- oh god.

           He suddenly realizes he’s in his underwear and grabs a 
           comforter from the couch to wrap around himself.

                                 JILL (O.S.)
                        Michael?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Coming.

           He shakes his head at Beverly and lowers his voice.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        No, I’m not coming, I don’t know 
                        why I said that.  Beverly, I have 
                        to tell Jill the truth.

                                 BEVERLY
                        You can’t.  It will crush her.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ve got to --

           The bedroom door opens and Jill comes out wearing a bra and 
           panties.  The three of them couldn’t be more uncomfortable.  

                                 JILL
                        Oh, hey, you’re home early.

                                 BEVERLY
                        We ran out of decorations.

           Silence.

                                 JILL
                        So, you remember Michael Young.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Jill, do you believe in being 
                        totally honest?

           Beverly shakes her head “No” over Michael’s shoulder but Jill 
           ignores the signal.  

                                 JILL
                        Sure.  Why?
                                 MICHAEL
                        I feel awful but what I said to you 
                        was meant for your sister.  The 
                        truth is I thought you were 
                        Beverly.

           For a moment Jill doesn’t react, then smiles quizzically.  
           And then an UNBELIEVABLY HARD SLAP almost takes Michael down.

                                 JILL
                        Oh my god!  Oh my god!  You thought 
                        I was Beverly?!  Aaaawwwwww!

           She runs back to her bedroom and SLAMS THE DOOR.  Michael and 
           Beverly look at each other.  WAILING AND SOBBING comes from 
           the bedroom.  Michael walks over to the door and KNOCKS.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Jill, I’m sorry.  I really didn’t 
                        mean for this to happen.  Jill?

                                 JILL (O.S.)
                        Aaaawwwwwww....

                                 MICHAEL
                        Jill, listen, I know you’re upset, 
                        but I do need my clothes.  Jill?

           Michael turns and looks at Beverly, shrugging his shoulders.  
           Jill continues to cry.  Michael smiles meekly at Beverly.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        So -- how are you?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Most days, pretty good.  This isn’t 
                        one of those days.  How are you?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Good, good.  I live in Boston now.  
                        I design web sites.

           Silence.  Michael pounds on the door.  More crying.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        So, what, you and Jill live here 
                        together?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That must be nice.
           The sobbing escalates.  Beverly comes over and knocks.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Jill, can I come in?

                                 JILL (O.S.)
                        No!  Aaaaawwwww...

           Beverly shakes her head at Michael.  There’s a KNOCK AT THE 
           FRONT DOOR and aptly named BIG JIM peeks in.

                                 BEVERLY
                        This is really bad.  I think you’d 
                        better go.

           Michael pounds again on Jill’s door.

                                 BIG JIM
                        Hey, what’s going on in here?

           Big Jim bolts by Beverly and tackles Michael.  When they hit 
           the floor THE POGUES COME BLASTING OUT OF THE STEREO again 
           and the DOG STARTS BARKING.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Owww!

           The blanket falls away and Michael is nearly naked again.  
           Big Jim climbs on top of Michael and pulls his arms back.     

                                 BIG JIM
                        Are you bothering these ladies?

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s okay, Big Jim.

                                 MICHAEL
                        There was a misunderstanding, Big 
                        Jim.

                                 BIG JIM
                        Do I know you?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, I just assumed Beverly wouldn’t 
                        call you that for no reason.

                                 JILL (O.S.)
                        Aaaawwwww --

                                 BIG JIM
                        What did you do to her?
                                 MICHAEL
                        I told her I wasn’t going to sleep 
                        with her.

           Big Jim looks him over.

                                 BIG JIM
                        You’d think that’d be a good thing.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I can’t breathe, Big Jim.

           SIRENS AND FLASHING LIGHTS intrude from outside.

                                 BEVERLY
                        What’s going on?

                                 BIG JIM
                        I told my mom to call the police.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Jesus, does every guy in this town 
                        live with his mother?

           TWO POLICEMEN look in the open front door, then come in. 

                                 OLDER COP
                        It’s okay Beverly, we’ll handle it.  
                        Why don’t you come outside with me.

           As the Older Cop pulls Beverly out, the Younger Cop nods for 
           Big Jim to get off, then puts his knee on Michael’s back.

                                 YOUNGER COP
                        So you want to tell me what’s going 
                        on here buddy?

           Michael can barely talk, so the cop bends down to hear.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I adored her from the time we were 
                        kids but I never had the nerve to 
                        tell her back then so I came over 
                        tonight to tell her and see if she 
                        might feel the same way about me.

                                 YOUNGER COP
                        Was that before or after you took 
                        off your pants?

                                 BIG JIM
                        What’s he saying?
                                 MICHAEL
                           (louder)
                        I love her.

                                 JILL (O.S.)
                        Aaawwwww!

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not her.  The other one.

                                 YOUNGER COP
                        Have you been drinking?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I wish.

           The Older Cop comes back in with Beverly.

                                 OLDER COP
                        Okay, Beverly says it’s all right.   

           Beverly turns the stereo off and pets the dog.  Big Jim puts 
           an arm around her.

                                 BIG JIM
                        Beverly, if there’s anything you 
                        need, just let me know.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Thank you, Big Jim.

           He heads for the door, followed by the police.  Michael 
           covers himself with the comforter and stands up.

                                 OLDER COP
                        Young man, you get your act 
                        together.  We’ll be watching you.

           They leave.  Michael looks sheepishly at Beverly.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        I don’t think she’s coming out 
                        tonight.  I’ve got some stretch 
                        shorts that might fit you and 
                        Lawayne left some shirts here.

                                 MICHAEL
                        This might not be the right time to 
                        ask, but -- can I call you?

           Beverly studies him for a moment.  Jill is still sobbing.  
           Beverly looks at the door and back at Michael.
                                 BEVERLY
                        Let me think about that.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Okay -- okay.

           EXT. BEVERLY’S PORCH - NIGHT

           Michael comes out wearing plaid shorts and a shirt that’s way 
           too big.  He turns to Beverly in the doorway.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Good night, Michael.

           She closes the door.  He goes down the steps, looks at his 
           car and remembers --

                                 MICHAEL
                        My keys.

           He looks at the house, thinks better of it, then starts 
           walking down the sidewalk.

           EXT. KENT SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           Michael doesn’t get far before a truck with Lawayne and Katie 
           pulls up against the curb.  Lawayne turns to Katie.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        You stay in the car now, sweetie.

           He hops out and blocks Michael’s path.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What are you doing, Lawayne?

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Big Jim called and said there was 
                        some trouble.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Nothing happened.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Then how come you’re wearing my 
                        shirt and my wife’s shorts?

           Michael looks down at his clothes, then back at Lawayne.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m going home now, Lawayne.

           Michael steps around him and keeps walking.
                                 LAWAYNE
                        I’ll be watching you, Young.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Get in line.

           EXT. KENT SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           Michael walks by a fence as a BIG DOG inside starts GROWLING.  
           Michael growls back as the two track each other until the 
           fence ends.  Too late, Michael realizes it’s not enclosed.  
           He and the dog are face to face with nothing between them.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh hell.

           The dog GROWLS AND LEAPS.

           INT. MICHAEL’S PARENTS’ BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Michael crawls through the window and flops on the floor.  
           Lawayne’s shirt is ripped and Michael has a bite mark on his 
           arm.  He stares glumly at his disheveled image in the mirror.

           INT. MICHAEL’S PARENTS’ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A despondent Michael, arm bandaged, is on the sofa flipping 
           TV channels, pausing on a Cinemax sex movie.  The front door 
           opens and he tries to change channels but the remote sticks.

                                 MOM
                        We’re home.

           Michael frantically tries to make the remote work as his 
           parents sit on either side of him and look at the screen for 
           the first time.  CRUDE SEX NOISES come from the tube.

                                 MOM (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god.  Michael!

                                 MICHAEL
                        I was flipping by and the remote 
                        got stuck.

                                 MOM
                        Oh Michael.  Get it off of there!

           She shakes her head in disappointment.

                                 DAD
                        Son, maybe you should save that for 
                        your own home.
                                 MOM
                        Please change this Michael, please.  
                        Please, Michael.

           She’s starting to cry.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I can’t.

                                 MOM
                        You were such a nice quiet boy 
                        until you got interested in girls.

                                 DAD
                        Maybe we should let him watch it.  
                        That’s how he learns.

           SEX SOUNDS GROW LOUDER as Michael keeps trying to click.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t need to learn -- oh Christ.

                                 MOM
                        Oh, Lord, now he’s swearing.

           Dad takes the remote and clicks it.  A NEWS PROGRAM is heard.

                                 DAD
                        So, did you see Beverly?

           Michael opens his mouth but stops and gets up.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m going to bed.

           He walks out of the room.  His dad calls out after him.

                                 DAD
                        She’s a great girl.  Where’s your 
                        car?

                                 MOM
                        What happened to your arm?

           Dad turns to Mom and nods toward the TV.

                                 DAD
                        Did you notice that lady didn’t 
                        have any pubic hair?

           Mom sniffs and nods.
                                 MOM
                        What’s this world coming to?

           INT. GOLDEN STEER RESTAURANT - DAY

           Michael and Andy stare at each other across the table for a 
           moment.  Andy’s mouth is wide open.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And this morning the car was parked 
                        in front of our house.

                                 ANDY
                        Wow.  Wow.  So that’s it, huh?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.  I’m going over to the school 
                        today and ask her out.

                                 ANDY
                        Wow.  I thought you said you would 
                        know Beverly anywhere.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I did.  As soon as I turned around 
                        and saw her I knew it was her.

                                 ANDY
                        But didn’t you also know it was her 
                        when it was Jill?

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Michael walks by an open classroom door, stops and goes back.

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           He takes a look at the children’s artwork and writing on the 
           blackboard.  Hanging on the wall are MATH FLASHCARDS.

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY (1983) - FLASHBACK

           The TEACHER holds a MATH FLASHCARD: 9x7.  Michael, 11, stands 
           next to a boy seated at his desk.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sixty-three.

           Michael walks to the next desk.

                                 TEACHER
                         Andy, your turn to stop Michael.
           She flashes the card: 11x11.

                                 MICHAEL
                        One hundred and twenty-two.

           He moves, she flashes 8x14.  The CLASS MURMURS.  5x17.  4x19.  
           13x21.  The kids’ reaction grows.  He starts up the next row.  

                                 TEACHER
                        Beverly, show him what you got.

           Card: 7x13.  Michael pauses -- and pauses.  On purpose.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Ninety-one.

                                 TEACHER
                        Correct.  Beverly’s up.

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL GYM - DAY - BACK TO THE PRESENT

           Michael enters to find a half-dozen people decorating.  He 
           sees Beverly across the gym, but MEGAN WOOLCOTT cuts him off.

                                 MEGAN  
                        Michael!  It’s me, Megan!

           She hugs him, to his surprise.

                                 MEGAN (CONT'D)
                        Thanks for coming.  You look great.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You too.  I don’t want to interrupt 
                        -- I was just going to bother 
                        Beverly for a second.

                                 MEGAN
                        Sure, I’ll catch up with you later.

           Michael passes a PHOTO COLLAGE including the shot of him 
           playing basketball in black socks and glasses.  Horrified, he 
           grabs it and puts it in his pocket.  When he turns around 
           Beverly is watching him.

           EXT. GRADE SCHOOL PLAY FIELD - DAY

           The two walk along a path between the gym and the stream.

                                 BEVERLY
                        So you really thought you were 
                        going to have sex with me?
                                 MICHAEL
                        Well, you did drag me into your 
                        bedroom.  I thought.

                                 BEVERLY
                        You must have thought I was a slut.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh, no, I thought you were great.  
                        I respected your decision to have 
                        sex with me.  I mean --

                                 BEVERLY
                        You know, I don’t believe in sex 
                        before marriage.

           Michael LAUGHS before he can catch himself.  He sobers up, 
           then smirks, thinking she might be joking.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Seriously?  Well, that’s -- 
                        admirable.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I still don’t understand what’s 
                        going on here.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I just wanted to spend some time 
                        with you.  I always liked you.  And 
                        you liked me, I understand.

           She has a small, questioning smile.

                                 BEVERLY
                        That was a long time ago, Michael.  
                        And I have a really busy week.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I know I should have told you years 
                        ago but it’s never too late, right?  
                        Let me take you to dinner tonight.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I can’t.  Lawayne and I have a 
                        marriage counseling session at 
                        five.

           He looks pained.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        I promised him I would try it.  I 
                        owe him that much.  And Katie.
                                 MICHAEL
                        How about after that?

                                 BEVERLY
                        A teacher here at the school asked 
                        me out to dinner.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh, I see.  Where are you going?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Just down to the Golden Steer.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Okay, after your marriage 
                        counseling session with your 
                        husband and the date with that 
                        other guy, what are you doing?  You 
                        want to get a cup of coffee or 
                        something?

           She stares at him, not quite believing this, but impressed.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be at the restaurant.  He 
                        won’t even have to take you home.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        You know, you don’t seem like 
                        Michael Young.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s good though, right?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I should get back to work.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So what grade do you teach?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I don’t teach.  I’m a cook.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Cook?  

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL GYM - DAY

           They walk toward the kitchen doors.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You mean, you’re like old Mrs. 
                        Strenge with the hair net?
           Beverly points to a PICTURE ON THE WALL of herself wearing a 
           hair net:  “Mrs. Ploof - School Cook”

                                 BEVERLY
                        That’s right, I’m Mrs. Strenge.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You didn’t change your name?  
                        You’re still Beverly Ploof?

           He seems disappointed.

           INT. GOLDEN STEER RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Michael and Andy eat in a booth, but Michael’s distracted as 
           he watches Beverly and her date across the room, having fun.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What time do you start your set?

                                 ANDY
                        Nine o’clock.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m bringing Beverly in.

                                 ANDY
                        What?  Why?

                                 MICHAEL
                        We’ll have to sit close to talk.  
                        She’s still great.  It was weird 
                        today though.  I’m sure a lot of it 
                        was because of last night.  But she 
                        seems, I don’t know, like she’s not 
                        quite as joyful as she used to be.

                                 ANDY
                        Joyful?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah.  As a kid she was always so 
                        happy.  But it seems like she’s 
                        lost her sense of humor.

                                 ANDY
                        It could be the divorce.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sure.

                                 ANDY
                        Or you trying to screw her sister.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, I suppose.  But remember her 
                        shy little laugh?  She had the 
                        greatest laugh.  She didn’t laugh 
                        once the whole time we talked. 

           Across the room, Beverly LAUGHS. 

                                 ANDY
                        Like that?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, kind of like that.

                                 ANDY
                        That is a great laugh.

           Beverly LAUGHS EVEN LOUDER, almost falling out of the booth.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Now that one seemed forced.

           They watch as Beverly wipes away tears.

                                 ANDY
                        Look, she forced herself to cry 
                        tears of joy.

                                 MICHAEL
                        There’s something else.  I almost 
                        hate to say it.  I remember her 
                        being, well, more intelligent.

                                 ANDY
                        Intelligent?  What do you mean?

                                 MICHAEL
                        First off, marrying Lawayne.  It 
                        doesn’t make sense.  It’s like 
                        Madame Curie marrying Gilligan.  
                        And a cook?  I don’t get her lack 
                        of ambition.  Look at the house she 
                        lives in.  And I didn’t see a book 
                        in it.  She seemed too smart for 
                        the life she has going here.  Maybe 
                        I idealized her too much.  But 
                        there’s still something about her.  
                        And she’s still beautiful.  

                                 ANDY
                        Aren’t you being a little hard on 
                        her?  It’s been a long time.  
                        People change.
           More LAUGHTER from Beverly.  Michael shakes his head.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And she used to be so shy.

           INT. GOLDEN STEER RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Beverly says goodbye to her date and walks across to Michael.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Okay, here we are.  What did you 
                        have in mind?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Remember Andy Tingstad?  His band’s 
                        playing in the lounge.  It’s nicer 
                        now that they don’t allow smoking. 

           She looks flustered, but goes along with it.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Okay, if I don’t have to dance.

           INT. GOLDEN STEER LOUNGE - NIGHT

           THE BAND PLAYS “LAYLA” to a full dance floor.  Michael nods 
           at Andy, who looks tense.  Michael and Beverly sit next to 
           each other in a curved booth.  A WAITRESS is right on them.

                                 WAITRESS
                        What can I start you with?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’ll have a white wine, please.

                                 MICHAEL
                        A beer.

           The waitress nods and leaves.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        It’s funny, I just never thought of 
                        Beverly Ploof drinking.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Well, she does. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        So -- how was your date?

                                 BEVERLY
                        You want to know about my date?
                                 MICHAEL
                        I want to know everything about 
                        you.

                                 BEVERLY
                        He’s just a friend.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Seemed like a funny guy.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah, he’s very funny.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Do you like funny guys?

           Beverly looks past him, concerned.  He looks up just in time 
           to see a slightly buzzed Lawayne, holding a beer, push his 
           way into the booth, trapping Michael between the two of them.  

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Hey baby, how’s it going?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Who’s looking after Katie?

                                 LAWAYNE
                        She’s staying with my mom tonight.

           Lawayne pretends to just now notice Michael.

                                 LAWAYNE (CONT'D)
                        Michael!  Didn’t see you there.  So 
                        how’s your date with my wife going?  
                        Think you’ll get lucky tonight?

           He gives him a wink and a nudge, like guys do.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Lawayne, we talked about this.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Hey, the therapist said to be more 
                        honest.

           He leans over toward Beverly, squeezing Michael even more.

                                 LAWAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Anyway Bev, I was thinking.  If you 
                        feel our problem’s in the bedroom, 
                        I’m more than willing to work on 
                        it, maybe rent some educational 
                        videos, try something new.
                                 BEVERLY
                        You know the problem wasn’t in the 
                        bedroom.

           Michael looks extremely uncomfortable.  Beverly blushes.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Michael.  That didn’t 
                        come out right.

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, it’s useful information.

           Lawayne looks at Michael and does a double take.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Michael!  Shit, I keep forgetting 
                        you’re there.  Yeah, you should 
                        write that down.  The problem 
                        wasn’t in the sack.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I want you to leave right now.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        You heard her buddy.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I think she means you.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Aren’t there any married women in 
                        Boston you can hit on?

                                 MICHAEL
                        She’s not married.  

           Lawayne looks oddly hurt by this.  He looks down at his beer.  

                                 LAWAYNE
                        I just love you so much.

                                 MICHAEL
                           (to Beverly)
                        I think he means you.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        I love you.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I know you do.  Go home.  I’ll call 
                        you tomorrow.
           Lawayne looks as if he might cry.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        I’m sorry.  Michael I’m sorry.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s okay, Lawayne.

           Lawayne pats his shoulder and slides out of the booth.  
           Beverly is tearing up.  Michael isn’t sure what to do.

           On stage Andy has started playing the guitar introduction to 
           “CAN’T LET GO.”  The crowd lets out a whoop and starts 
           dancing.  Big Jim emerges, pointing at Beverly.

                                 BIG JIM
                        Hey Andy, Beverly’s here!  Have her 
                        sing it!  That’s her song!

           A shocked Michael looks at Beverly, shaking her head.  

                                 BIG JIM (CONT'D)
                        Come on Beverly, get up there!

                                 MICHAEL
                        You sing?

                                 BEVERLY
                        A little.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You sing with Andy?

           Big Jim grabs Beverly and carries her to the stage.  He sets 
           her in front of the microphone, where she shyly looks at 
           Michael, then Andy.  He nods and she timidly sings --

                                 BEVERLY
                        “Told you baby one more time, don’t 
                        make me sit all alone and cry.  
                        Well it’s over and I know it but I 
                        can’t let go...”

           Michael’s mouth drops.  The crowd urges her on, and as she 
           reaches the chorus Beverly sings more boldly --

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        “I got a big chain around my neck, 
                        and I’m broken down like a train 
                        wreck.  Well it’s over, I know it, 
                        but I can’t let go...”

           Big Jim points at Beverly’s feet at the instrumental break.
                                 BIG JIM
                        Do the dance!

           Beverly hesitates, then does a little soft shoe in place.

                                 BIG JIM (CONT’D)
                        No, the dance!  

           The CROWD AGREES.  Beverly relaxes and lets go, swirling 
           around the stage.  Michael can’t believe what he’s seeing.

                                 BIG JIM (CONT'D)
                        Stage dive!

           Beverly leaps from the stage and Big Jim and others catch her 
           and throw her back just in time to start the next verse.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        “Turn off trouble like you turn off 
                        a light...”

           Megan is suddenly pulling Michael from the booth.

                                 MEGAN
                        May I have this dance?

           She leads him onto the dance floor as Beverly sings on in 
           full voice.  Michael shakes his head and looks at Megan.

                                 MICHAEL
                        She used to be so shy.

                                 MEGAN
                        Look who’s talking.  Did you know I 
                        had a huge crush on you?   

                                 MICHAEL
                        What?

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (1989) - FLASHBACK

           Back to the scene of Michael moving slowly toward Beverly at 
           graduation, only now we see that Megan is the girl Beverly is 
           talking to.  Megan also eyes Michael hopefully as he nears.

                                 MEGAN (V.O.)
                        Oh god I wanted you so bad.  I 
                        would have done anything for you.
           INT. GOLDEN STEER LOUNGE - BACK TO THE PRESENT

           Michael’s eyes are wide open but he can’t speak.  As the song 
           ends Megan kisses him on the lips.  He finally blinks.  She 
           steps back and raises her eyebrows suggestively.  

                                 MEGAN
                        See you at the reunion.

           INT./EXT. MICHAEL’S CAR - NIGHT

           Michael and Beverly ride in awkward silence for a moment.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        So -- how long have you been 
                        singing with Andy?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Not too long.  He’s so talented.   
                        And he’s so sweet.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, he’s a sweet guy.    

                                 BEVERLY
                        You guys were pretty good friends.  
                        Do you still talk?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not as much as I’d like too.  In 
                        fact, I think I’m going to go find 
                        him tonight and have a good talk.

                                 BEVERLY
                        That’s nice.

           He pulls up in front of her house.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What are you doing tomorrow?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Tomorrow?  After I finish at school 
                        I have to pick up Katie and go to 
                        my parents’ house.  It’s my 
                        grandma’s 80th birthday.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Can I come?

                                 BEVERLY
                        You want to come to my 
                        grandmother’s birthday party?
           EXT. ANDY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Michael waits on the steps as Andy gets out of his car, 
           carrying a guitar case.

                                 ANDY
                        Hey, Michael.

           Andy puts his guitar down and sits beside Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re a little more familiar with 
                        Beverly than I thought.  Did you 
                        know she was married to Lawayne?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And that she had a kid?

                                 ANDY
                        If I had told you, would you have 
                        still gone over there?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t know.

                                 ANDY
                        You seemed so excited.  I didn’t 
                        want to stop that momentum you had.  
                        I figured it was worth a shot. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Do me a favor, in the future why 
                        don’t you let me decide if I want 
                        to make a fool of myself.

           Andy gives that a thought.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, I could do that.

           INT. BEVERLY’S PARENTS’ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Beverly opens the door to see Michael with THREE BOUQUETS.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Oh my.

                                 MICHAEL
                        One for your grandmother, one for 
                        your mother, and one for you.
                                 BEVERLY
                        Thank you.  I’ll go put these in 
                        water.  Take off your coat. 

           He puts his coat on a rack.  Jill comes down the stairs, 
           barely acknowledging him.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hi Jill.

           She grimaces and nods.  Michael puts an arm out to stop her.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Listen, I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry.  
                        Really, really sorry.  I feel 
                        terrible, I really do.  I’m sorry.

                                 JILL
                        So where’s my bouquet?

           She enjoys his discomfort.

                                 JILL (CONT'D)
                        Did you really think I was Beverly?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes.

                                 JILL
                        I guess that’s a compliment.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, she’s so great.  But you’re 
                        good too.  I mean as a kid you were 
                        a brat, but you’ve matured a lot.

                                 JILL
                        You thought I was a brat, did you?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh yeah.  Remember how you told on 
                        us to Mr. Anderson?

           She smiles and looks down, suddenly modest.

                                 JILL
                        That’s because I was jealous.  I 
                        always liked you.

           Michael is thrown by her openness.  She hugs him as Beverly 
           returns.  Michael half-shoves Jill away.  Beverly gives him a 
           look as Katie walks in behind her.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Hi Katie.

           Katie stares at him.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Katie?  What do you say?

                                 KATIE
                        Hi.

           INT. BEVERLY’S PARENTS’ DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Michael, Beverly, Jill and Katie are joined at the table for 
           cake by MR. and MRS. PLOOF and GRANDMA.  Grandma stares at 
           Michael.  She looks confused and irritated. 

                                 GRANDMA
                        Who’s he?

                                 BEVERLY
                        That’s Michael, grandma, he’s a 
                        friend of Lawayne and me.

                                 GRANDMA
                        What’s he doing here?

                                 BEVERLY
                        He came for your birthday.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Why?  I don’t know him.

                                 BEVERLY
                        He just wanted to say happy 
                        birthday.

           Grandma stares at him until he does.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh, yes, happy birthday.

           Grandma keeps staring.  Beverly points at the vase.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Michael brought you flowers.

                                 MR. PLOOF
                        Michael went to school with Beverly 
                        and Lawayne, grandma.  To be honest 
                        Michael, when you were a boy I 
                        thought you were retarded.
                                 BEVERLY
                        Dad!

                                 MRS. PLOOF
                        Mark!  What he means, Michael, is 
                        that you were just a little awkward 
                        around people -- socially retarded.

                                 MR. PLOOF
                        No, I mean literally mentally 
                        retarded, like the ones they have 
                        special classes for.  Only Michael 
                        never wore the big shoes.

           Beverly is trying to keep from laughing out loud.

                                 MRS. PLOOF
                        He was a nerd, honey!  That’s how 
                        they act.  No offense, Michael.  
                        And look how well he turned out.

                                 BEVERLY
                        And he got such good grades.

                                 MR. PLOOF
                        That don’t mean anything.  Even 
                        Rain Man could count.  And they 
                        inflate grades for the retardeds to 
                        boost their self-esteem.

                                 JILL
                        It takes some people longer to grow 
                        into themselves.

                                 MR. PLOOF
                        That’s what I’m trying to say, for 
                        crying out loud.  Considering how 
                        Forest Gump-like he was back then 
                        it’s amazing he’s sitting here now 
                        looking so normal.  

           Beverly nearly chokes from stifling a laugh at Michael’s 
           flustered reaction.  

                                 GRANDMA
                        Where’s Lawayne?  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Lawayne had to work tonight.  I’ll 
                        tell him to come see you.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Where’s he been?  It’s been ages.
                                 MICHAEL
                        You probably don’t see him much 
                        since the divorce.

           Grandma looks very confused.

                                 GRANDMA
                        What divorce?

                                 MRS. PLOOF
                        Michael --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Beverly and Lawayne’s divorce.

           Grandma drops her fork and clutches her heart.  

           INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

           Beverly, Michael, and an EMT GUY ride in the back as Grandma, 
           wearing an oxygen mask, is glaring at Michael.

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s not your fault.  We should 
                        have told her.  We didn’t want to 
                        upset her.  She loves Lawayne.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m sorry -- Grandma.

           Grandma winces.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Grandma is in her hospital bed, surrounded by everyone from 
           dinner.  She’s still glaring at Michael as THE DOCTOR enters. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Her heart is fine, she just got 
                        some cake stuck in her windpipe.

                                 MRS. PLOOF
                        Oh, that’s great.

                                 BEVERLY
                        See, Michael, it wasn’t you.

                                 MR. PLOOF
                        Oh yeah?  His comment probably made 
                        her do it.

           They all stare at Michael.  He looks to Katie for comfort, 
           but she looks disappointed.  The doctor starts for the door.
                                 DOCTOR
                        Well, anyway, she’s had a little 
                        excitement but she’s okay now.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Thank you.

                                 MRS. PLOOF
                        Did you hear that Mom?

           Grandma stares at Michael.  

                                 MR. PLOOF
                        I’d like to have a family meeting.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ll go in the hall.

                                 MR. PLOOF
                        No, that’s okay --

           He indicates he doesn’t want to talk in front of grandma.

                                 MR. PLOOF (CONT’D)
                        We’ll go out.  

           They leave Michael and grandma alone.  She looks him over.

                                 GRANDMA
                        They don’t make men like Lawayne 
                        anymore.

                                 MICHAEL
                        No they don’t.

                                 GRANDMA
                        And Beverly is the most wonderful 
                        person.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes she is.

                                 GRANDMA
                        What’s your name again?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Michael.

                                 GRANDMA
                        I understand why you’d be sniffing 
                        around her, Michael.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Uh -- thank you.

                                 GRANDMA
                        But what makes you so great?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m sorry?

                                 GRANDMA
                        What do you do?  Lawayne can take 
                        an engine apart and put it back 
                        together.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well, I could take one apart.

           She scowls at him.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Have you ever used a chain saw?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.

           She rolls her eyes in disgust.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Oh lord almighty.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I design web pages.

                                 GRANDMA
                        You mean that internet stuff?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Uh, yes.

                                 GRANDMA
                        You sit in a chair all day?
                        Staring at a computer screen?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Oh my, it just keeps getting worse. 
                        God what a life.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s okay.
                                 GRANDMA
                        Oh, it’s not your fault.  Men have 
                        fallen so far since my day.  Now 
                        adays you get twice the ego and 
                        half the man.  I’m so glad that 
                        when I was young you could still 
                        find a real one.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Those must have been good times.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Well, you just keep playing your 
                        little video games --

           She makes both her hands into play guns that she thrusts 
           forward as if shooting at something --

                                 GRANDMA (CONT’D)
                        -- going pow pow pow at the evil 
                        creatures on your little screen.  
                        When you’re my age you’ll wake up 
                        and wonder “my god what the hell 
                        have I done with my life?” 

           Michael looks very hurt.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s not really what I do.

                                 GRANDMA
                        I’m not blaming you entirely.  
                        Society did this to you.   

                                 MICHAEL
                        Society made me half a man?

                                 GRANDMA
                        And your parents, I’m guessing.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, that sounds about right.

           INT./EXT. MARK’S CAR - NIGHT

           The family and Michael pull up in front of Beverly’s parents’ 
           house.  Michael is slouched in the back seat, feeling very 
           much like half a man.  They get out in silence.  Beverly and 
           Katie stay with Michael as the others head for the house.

                                 MICHAEL
                        This isn’t going anything like I 
                        had planned.
                                 BEVERLY
                        You had a plan?

           Michael is turning red, his confidence gone. 

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, it’s okay, grandma’s fine.  
                        And besides, it will make a great 
                        story at the reunion.

           Michael blanches and she laughs.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m kidding.  Come on, you used to 
                        have such a good sense of humor.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, I’m sure I’ll laugh about it 
                        some day.  Probably about the time 
                        your grandma’s able to eat solid 
                        food again.

                                 BEVERLY
                           (smiling)
                        See, there you go.  Well, we should 
                        get in, but thanks for a truly 
                        interesting evening.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Okay, good night then.  

           He gets in his car and waves goodbye at Katie.  She gives a 
           small wave back as Beverly puts her arm around her.

                                 BEVERLY
                        What do you think of Michael?

                                 KATIE
                        I like him when he brings flowers.
                        But not so much when he almost 
                        kills grandma.

           INT. MICHAEL’S PARENTS’ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Michael slinks in, praying to be alone, but his parents are 
           on the couch.

                                 DAD
                        So how did it go with Beverly?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Great.  Really unbelievably great.
                                 MOM
                        Before you go to your room, I had 
                        something I wanted to say.

           Michael eases into the chair, dreading what may be coming.  

                                 MOM (CONT’D)
                        I called the cable company and had 
                        those dirty channels blocked.  I 
                        didn’t want you to find out when 
                        they don’t come on and you break 
                        our remote trying to get them.

           Michael looks at her for a moment.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Okay, Mom.  That’s probably best.

                                 MOM
                        I want you to know I love you no 
                        matter what you do.  Just don’t do 
                        it in my house.  Not in front of 
                        Jesus.

           She points to a crucifix on the wall.  Michael stares at 
           Jesus. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I hope He’ll forgive me.

                                 MOM
                        Of course He will.  He died for 
                        your sins.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Jesus died so I could watch 
                        Cinemax?

                                 MOM
                        Don’t be smart.  It was for all of 
                        our sins.

                                 DAD
                        Don’t worry, as soon as he gets a 
                        woman he won’t need that stuff.

           Michael leaps off the chair.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Okay!  I’m going to bed.
           INT. MICHAEL’S PARENTS’ KITCHEN - DAY

           Michael looks like hell, wearing a robe, his hair a mess, 
           slouched over the kitchen table and staring at a cup of 
           coffee.  Andy sits across from him, disbelieving.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Maybe I should just go home.

                                 ANDY
                        You can’t give up yet.  So you made 
                        out with her sister and choked her 
                        grandma.  All relationships go 
                        through rough spots.

           Mom and Dad enter, dressed to go out.

                                 MOM
                        What are you up to these days, 
                        Andy?

                                 ANDY
                        Still playing music.

                                 MOM
                        Oh that’s too bad.

                                 DAD
                        No real job, huh?

                                 MOM
                        Your parents were always very 
                        tolerant.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, they’re great.

                                 MOM
                        Hmmm.

                                 DAD
                        See you later.  

           As they leave Michael grins broadly.

                                 MICHAEL
                        By the way, the band sounds really 
                        good.  But why just do covers?  
                        Play something of your own.

                                 ANDY
                        People like to hear what they know.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Come on, you only live once.

                                 ANDY
                        Look who’s talking.  Call Beverly.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m too embarrassed.

                                 ANDY
                        Call her.  

           Michael looks at his cell phone on the table.  IT RINGS.  He 
           looks at the caller ID and gives Andy a surprised look.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hello?

                                 BEVERLY (ON PHONE)
                        Michael, hi, it’s Beverly.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hi Beverly.

                                 BEVERLY (ON PHONE)
                        I just wanted to tell you that 
                        Grandma’s doing great.  Anyway, I 
                        felt really bad about last night, 
                        and was wondering if you might want 
                        to have lunch today?

           Michael’s jaw drops.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well yeah, I think I can.

                                 BEVERLY (ON PHONE)
                        Meet me at the school in an hour?  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes.  Yes, I’ll be there.

                                 BEVERLY (ON PHONE)
                        Great, I’ll see you then.  Bye.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Bye.  Bye Bye.

                                 ANDY
                        Bye bye?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I panicked.
           INT. GRADE SCHOOL GYM - DAY

           The gym is empty.  Michael hears the CLANGING OF PANS and 
           notices the metal doors to the kitchen are open.  Inside is 
           Beverly, hair net and all, taking a tray out of the oven.

           He watches for a few moments as she scrapes cookies off the 
           tray.  She finally looks up to see him and smiles.

           EXT. GRADE SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY

           The two of them walk through the slides and swings.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You really looked like you knew 
                        what you were doing in there.

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s not hard.  It’s just baking.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I still can’t believe you’re a 
                        cook.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Why?  What did you think I’d be?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Everyone thought you’d be a vet.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I know, but things happened, then 
                        Katie came along and I kind of fell 
                        into this.  But I love it.  And I 
                        do volunteer work with animals so --

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’ve never wanted to get out of 
                        Kent?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Too late now.  It’s grown on me.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You would never move?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Katie has her friends here, her 
                        dad’s down the street, my parents 
                        are getting older and I want to be 
                        around for them.  And my grandma --
                        you never know what’s going to 
                        happen to her.  
           She grins.  He smiles weakly.  

           EXT. DOWNTOWN KENT SIDEWALK - DAY

           Michael and Beverly walk along the 1950s building fronts.

                                 MICHAEL
                        At least they didn’t ruin downtown.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah, it looks pretty much like it 
                        did when we were kids.

           Former jock JOE TUTTLE comes running across the street.  He 
           completely ignores Michael’s presence.

                                 JOE 
                        Beverly!  It’s great to see you!  
                        Man you look great.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Thanks Joe.  This is Michael Young. 

           He barely nods Michael’s way.

                                 JOE
                        Hey.  So, I was wondering if you’d 
                        thought about maybe going bowling 
                        or something? 

                                 BEVERLY
                        Well, I’ve been pretty busy --

                                 MICHAEL
                        What are you doing?

                                 JOE
                        Huh?

           Joe finally turns and acknowledges this other person.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Are you asking her out in front of 
                        me?  What makes you think she and I 
                        aren’t together?

           Joe looks at Beverly, then back at Michael, with an 
           expression that says he would find that highly unlikely.

                                 JOE
                        You’re kidding, right?
                                 MICHAEL
                        Wait a second -- Joe.  Joe Tuttle?

                                 JOE
                        Yeah.  Do I know you? 

                                 BEVERLY
                        That’s what I was trying to tell 
                        you -- this is Michael Young.

           Joe squints at him, still not registering.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We went to school together.  

                                 JOE
                        I don’t think so.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We were in the same year.

                                 JOE
                        Michael Young?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes.

                                 JOE
                        I don’t remember you.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We had classes together.

                                 JOE
                        Sorry.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We were both altar boys at St. 
                        Anthony’s.

                                 JOE
                        Huh.

           Joe shrugs.  Michael looks irritated, to Beverly’s delight.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We did that science project 
                        together -- the eruption of Mount 
                        St. Helens.

                                 JOE
                        I remember the mountain.  It was 
                        made out of clay.
                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s right.

                                 JOE
                        And the lava was made with syrup.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah.  But you don’t remember me?

                                 JOE
                        No.

           Beverly giggles.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You don’t remember being in Boy 
                        Scouts with me?

                                 JOE
                        Nope.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So you don’t remember jerking each 
                        other off in the pup tent?

           Joe looks, up, trying to remember.  Beverly tries to stop 
           from laughing.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?  Are you trying 
                        to remember us jerking each other 
                        off in a pup tent?

                                 JOE
                        Yeah.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well stop it, I was kidding.

                                 JOE
                        Oh.  I don’t get it.

           He finally recognizes something in Michael’s face.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Oh, wait!  I do remember you!  You 
                        were the beanpole in the yearbook 
                        who was playing basketball in black 
                        socks and taped-up glasses!

           Beverly laughs and turns away, almost crying.  
                                 MICHAEL
                        They weren’t taped up.

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, I remember you -- your hair’s 
                        different.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, it must be the hair.  I 
                        remember you Joe -- you’re the guy 
                        who dropped the wide-open pass in 
                        the end zone against Renton that 
                        would have put us in the state 
                        championship game.

           Joe’s mouth opens, then closes.  He’s obviously hurt.  

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, well, I’ve gotta go.  I’ll 
                        see you Saturday, Beverly.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Okay, Joe, see you there.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ll see you there, too, Joe.

           Joe stops and gives him a look, then hunkers off.  As soon as 
           he’s out of range Beverly explodes laughing again.

           INT. CAFE - DAY

           Half way through their meals, Beverly is still in a great 
           mood.  Michael is happy she’s finally opening up to him.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Hey, you made quite an impression 
                        on Joe Tuttle.

                                 MICHAEL
                        He had to be kidding, right?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I don’t think he was.  But bringing 
                        up the dropped pass -- you would 
                        have never said something like that 
                        before.  The grown up Michael Young 
                        is such a badass.

                                 MICHAEL
                        By the way, the pup tent thing was 
                        actually true.  My feelings were 
                        hurt that he didn’t remember.
           Her laugh sends a thrill right through him.  At last, this is 
           the Beverly he’d come looking for.  Michael seizes the moment 
           to get more personal.  

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D) (cont’d)
                        There’s something I have to ask 
                        you.  I have to be honest.

                                 BEVERLY
                        You do, don’t you?  Well, go ahead.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t get Lawayne.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Don’t get what?

                                 MICHAEL
                        You and Lawayne. 

                                 BEVERLY
                        Lawayne has his problems but he’s 
                        very sensitive.  He’s passionate 
                        about life.  He’s an animal lover.  
                        Everyone loves Lawayne.  Except 
                        you.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        He’s not smart enough for you.

           Her eyes narrow.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I don’t think you know Lawayne that 
                        well.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Do you mind my asking why you 
                        divorced him?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yes I do mind, actually.  That’s 
                        between him and me.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        So he cheated on you.

                                 BEVERLY
                        What?  

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re not really thinking of going 
                        back with him, are you?
                                 BEVERLY
                        I don’t want to talk about it.

           She looks wearily out the window.  He looks hurt.  

                                 BEVERLY (CONT'D)
                        Okay, I’ll tell you.  Our marriage 
                        was perfect until one day he ruined 
                        a beautiful lunch we were having, 
                        so I told him to get the hell out.

           Michael almost smiles.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Okay, sorry.  I’ll change the 
                        subject.  So -- what kind of movies 
                        do you like?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Movies?  I don’t know, all kinds.
                        I’m too busy to get out much.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What about music?  Who are you 
                        listening to these days?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Hmm, all sorts of things.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Do you like Celine Dion?

           He braces as he waits for her answer.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Celine Dion?  Yeah, I like some of 
                        her songs.

           He can’t hide his disappointment.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, she’s great.  I really like 
                        that...emotive...warbling...sound 
                        she makes.  Hey, I remember you 
                        were always a big reader.  Read 
                        anything good lately?

           Beverly is getting annoyed again.  She puts down her fork.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Is this some sort of quiz?  How am 
                        I doing? 
                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m sorry.  It’s just that I want 
                        to know about you.  

           She picks up her fork and plays with her food.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I finally read The Da Vinci Code.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh god, wasn’t that awful?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I thought the story was good.

           He reaches across the table for her hand.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m being a jerk.

           She looks at him, softening.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Hold that thought -- I’m vibrating.  

           Beverly pulls out her phone and reads a text message, 
           frowning.  She snaps the phone shut and looks at Michael. 

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        I have a question for you.  Do you 
                        like dogs?

           Michael blanches.

           INT./EXT. LEXUS - KENT STREETS - DAY

           Michael drives, with growing alarm.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So what kind of dog is it?

                                 BEVERLY
                        A pit bull.  Most of them are 
                        actually very sweet dogs.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Uh huh.

                                 BEVERLY
                        You’re not afraid of dogs, are you?

           Michael’s face reddens.
                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, a lot of people are.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s just that I got bit when I was 
                        a kid and I haven’t had much luck 
                        with them since.

                                 BEVERLY
                        You’ve never had a dog?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Never.

                                 BEVERLY
                        That’s so sad.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        So what do you have to do?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I tell them I’m from Canine Rescue 
                        and I’m there to inquire about 
                        possible dog abuse.  I ask if we 
                        can take the dog until the matter 
                        is investigated.  On this one we 
                        have reports that the guy kicks the 
                        dog and doesn’t feed it properly.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You shouldn’t be alone with someone 
                        like that.  I’ll go with you.

           She pulls into the driveway.

                                 BEVERLY
                        No, you have to stay in the car.  
                        Only trained personnel can be 
                        involved.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        This guy could be violent.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I know how to handle cowards like 
                        him.  I do it all the time.

           She gets out and turns to him, putting her hand out.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Stay.
           EXT. DOG OWNER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Beverly goes up to the door of this house with faded paint 
           and junk in the yard.  Michael watches as a GUY IN A 
           BACKWARDS CAP answers and he and Beverly exchange words.

           Michael sees the sad PIT BULL by a chain link fence on the 
           side of the house.  He gets out, sneaks up to the gate and 
           creeps in.  The dog looks wary but hungry for attention.  
           Michael bends down and creeps toward the dog, shaking.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s okay buddy.  I won’t hurt you.  
                        Please don’t hurt me.  So, what 
                        kind of music do you like?  You 
                        like Celine Dion?

           The dog’s tail starts wagging as Michael draws near.  He 
           slowly reaches out his hand and pets the dog.  The dog gets 
           more excited and starts licking Michael.

           At the front door Beverly pulls a $100 bill out of her purse.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’ll give you $100 for the dog.

                                 GUY IN CAP
                        Jesus, hell yes.  Take him!

           He grabs the money.

           In the yard Michael picks the dog up and starts for the gate.  
           Just as he’s opening it a young boy comes around the corner.

                                 BOY
                        What are you doing with Buster?

           As Michael opens the gate the kid bends down and picks up a 
           HANDFUL OF ROCKS AND STARTS THROWING.  Some hit the fence, 
           but a few hit Michael as he heads for the car.

                                 BOY (CONT’D)
                        Dad, dad!  He’s taking Buster!

           Beverly and the Guy in the Cap watch as the boy chases 
           Michael, rocks still flying.  Michael opens the car’s back 
           door and throws Buster in, then runs to the driver side.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Beverly, I got him!  Come on!  Run!

           Beverly watches Michael run - astonished and completely 
           charmed by his gallant and fearless act.  
                                 BOY
                        They’re getting away with Buster!

           Beverly walks by him and gets in the car.  Michael peels out.

                                 GUY IN CAP
                        It’s okay Sly, I’ll get ya a snake.

                                 BOY
                        A snake?  Okay.

           INT./EXT. LEXUS - KENT STREETS - DAY

           Michael breathes hard as Beverly looks on with admiration.

                                 BEVERLY
                        You’re my hero.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I can’t believe that guy didn’t 
                        come after us.

                                 BEVERLY
                        He said you looked too scary to 
                        mess with.

           Michael enjoys the moment.  He rubs his head where he got hit 
           and smiles at Beverly.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Can you believe that kid?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I think Buster’s better off without 
                        either one of them.

           She turns to look at Buster, who seems to agree.

           INT. ANIMAL CENTER BATHROOM - DAY

           Cleaning dog hair from his coat, Michael looks at himself in 
           the mirror with a self-satisfied grin.

           INT. ANIMAL CENTER - DAY

           Michael exits the bathroom to see Beverly across the room, 
           playing with Buster as people gather around.  

           EXT. GRADE SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Michael and Beverly get out of his car in the Panther Lake 
           Elementary parking lot and look out over the school.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Why are they tearing this down?

                                 BEVERLY
                        The school board says it’s out of 
                        date, and it would cost too much 
                        repair and modernize it.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        There go all our memories.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I loved going to school here.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I loved you going to school here, 
                        too.  Did you know that I was 
                        always watching you?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Sometimes.  I have to admit I did 
                        notice you a little too.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Really?

           EXT. GRADE SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY (1979) - FLASHBACK

           Seven-year-old Michael is running on the pavement as he 
           watches Beverly skipping rope.

                                 BEVERLY (V.O.)
                        I remember you running into the 
                        pole when I was skipping rope.

           Michael runs headfirst into a breezeway pole and drops.

           EXT. GRADE SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY (1981) - FLASHBACK

           A group of kids play dodge ball.

                                 BEVERLY (V.O.)
                        I remember you catching the dodge 
                        ball and saving me so I didn’t have 
                        to come out of the game.

           A ball bounces off of Beverly and Michael dives to catch it, 
           bringing him the reward of her grateful smile.

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY (1983) - FLASHBACK

           Beverly, 11, pulls a Valentine’s Card from the board.
                                 BEVERLY (V.O.)
                        I remember the time you were my 
                        secret Valentine.

           EXT. GRADE SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY - BACK TO THE PRESENT

           Beverly is smiling wistfully now.  Michael’s heart is racing.

                                 BEVERLY
                        They can’t take those memories 
                        away.

           She leans over and kisses his cheek.  

                                 BEVERLY (CONT'D)
                        Thank you for helping me with the 
                        dog.  You saved a life today.  So 
                        are you still willing to let me 
                        cook you dinner tonight?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Definitely.  I’ll be there.

           Michael gets in his car and Beverly starts for the gym.  He 
           watches her walk, and halfway there she turns and waves.  
           Michael is in love.

           EXT. ANDY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Michael bounds up the steps to Andy’s house.

           INT. ANDY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Andy’s slouched on his bed as Michael paces, very excited.

                                 MICHAEL
                        She’s not how I imagined her all 
                        these years.  She may be even 
                        better.  Andy, I heard the laugh 
                        today.  I want to be around that.  
                        It’s a great cure for the rest of 
                        life.  She’s the kind of woman who 
                        can really ease the pain.

                                 ANDY
                        What pain?

                                 MICHAEL
                        The pain.  Don’t you have pain?

                                 ANDY
                        Huh.  Yeah, I suppose I do.
                                 MICHAEL
                        And I think I have something to 
                        offer her.  She has a great life 
                        but I know she’s lonely. 

                                 ANDY
                        She probably has pain, too.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And I was wrong.  She’s about the 
                        most intelligent person I’ve ever 
                        met.  She knows exactly what she 
                        wants and doesn’t care what anyone 
                        else thinks about her -- even me.  
                        Everyone I know is so screwed up -- 

           Andy tilts his head.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        -- except for you -- but she’s so 
                        well grounded.  There’s no games, 
                        no drama.  And through all of the 
                        lunacy I’ve brought into her life 
                        this week, she’s been understanding 
                        and classy and given me every 
                        chance to redeem myself.

           He pauses as if he just realized something.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I think I even get her and Lawayne.  
                        She feels sorry for all creatures.  
                        She thought she could help him.  

           He sits down in the desk chair and leans close to Andy.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        And she’s a great mom -- I was 
                        watching her with Katie the other 
                        night.  She’s not one of those 
                        parents who think their kid is the 
                        center of the universe.  It’s just 
                        so natural, loving but firm.  She’s 
                        the adult, Katie’s the child and 
                        they love each other for that.  
                        She’s amazing.  You know, I would 
                        even move back to Kent if that’s 
                        what it takes.  I would play the 
                        town nerd again to be with her.  I 
                        love her Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        I know you do.
           INT. BEVERLY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Beverly and Jill are having coffee on the couch.

                                 JILL
                        He thinks he rescued the dog?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Don’t tell him.  But he’s scared of 
                        dogs, and it was a pit bull.

                                 JILL
                        A pit bull?  He is crazy for you.

                                 BEVERLY
                        You think?

                                 JILL
                        Hell, I never had a chance.

           Beverly smiles.  There’s a KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  She opens it 
           to find Big Jim.

                                 BIG JIM
                        Beverly, hi.  I, uh, had something 
                        I thought I should tell you.  It’s 
                        been kind of bothering me.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Is it about the other night?

                                 BIG JIM
                        Well, no, and yes.

           She gives him a curious look.

           INT. ANDY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Michael and Andy are sharing beers and memories.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I remember sitting in this very 
                        room, the two of us describing what 
                        we wanted in a woman.

                                 ANDY
                        Which was presumptuous seeing as 
                        how neither one of us had ever even 
                        seen a nipple at that point.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We’ve got to find you someone, 
                        Andy.  What are you looking for?
                                 ANDY
                        I wrote a song about that.

           He grabs his guitar and strums a faux-country tune.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        “I want a woman who knows who she 
                        is -- but isn’t that sure who a lot 
                        of famous historical figures are, 
                        like Magellan.”

           Michael smiles.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        “She likes to take long walks on 
                        the beach, which gives me time to 
                        watch TV without a bunch of 
                        yapping.”

                                 MICHAEL
                        Of course.

                                 ANDY
                        “Her skin should have a moist, 
                        glistening shimmer in the 
                        moonlight, but only if there is 
                        some sort of liquid on it.”

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s not asking too much.

                                 ANDY 
                        “But most of all, she’ll scratch me 
                        no matter where I itch.”

           He hits one final chord as Michael claps.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That shouldn’t be too hard to find.  

           INT. BEVERLY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Big Jim is seated across from the women, hesitating.

                                 BIG JIM
                        See, I was at the Golden Steer the 
                        other night while you were there.

                                 BEVERLY
                        With Michael.

                                 BIG JIM
                        Before that.
           INT. GOLDEN STEER RESTAURANT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Michael is telling Andy his initial negative reaction to 
           Beverly, but now we see Big Jim in the booth next to them.

                                 BIG JIM (V.O.)
                        Michael told his buddy some things 
                        about you I thought were -- well, I 
                        thought you should know.  He said 
                        you marrying Lawayne was dumb and 
                        he didn’t understand why you were 
                        just a cook, and he was surprised 
                        at how low class you were and that 
                        you weren’t nearly as smart as he 
                        remembered.  But you were still hot 
                        so he’d still try to nail you.

           INT. BEVERLY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY - BACK TO THE PRESENT

           Beverly stares at Big Jim.  She exchanges looks with Jill, 
           then, teary-eyed, looks away.

                                 JILL
                        Are you sure, Jim?

                                 BIG JIM
                        I wouldn’t lie to you.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        Thank you Big Jim, I appreciate it.

                                 BIG JIM
                        I thought you should know.

           She nods.  He stands up and pats her shoulder.

                                 BIG JIM (CONT’D)
                        You know how I feel about you. 

           He heads out the door.  Beverly and Jill sit for a moment.

                                 JILL
                        Do you believe him?

           Beverly nods.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Michael even said as much about 
                        Lawayne, and my job.  I felt like I 
                        was being judged.  I thought I 
                        understood why, that maybe he was 
                        just nervous.  I guess I was wrong.  
                                 JILL
                        What are you going to do?

           Beverly thinks, then looks back at Jill.

           INT. BEVERLY’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The door opens, and Michael is there with FLOWERS AND A GIFT, 
           grinning happily as Beverly smiles back.

           INT. BEVERLY’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Beverly pulls out a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY, with obvious delight.  
           Michael looks puzzled.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Can I pour you a drink?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Whiskey?  Isn’t that a little 
                        strong for this early?

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s never too early for the good 
                        stuff.

           She pours a glass and drinks it -- straight.  Then smiles.

           INT. BEVERLY’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           The table is full of Italian food, the light is low.  The 
           gift is on the table.  Beverly has a good buzz as she takes a 
           drink and eyes Michael.  Her dog Rex sleeps on the floor.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Now that is good bourbon.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah?  Well, this food is good.  
                        You are a great cook.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Well thank you.  So, when do I get 
                        to see my present?

           He hands it to her.  She unwraps it to find his YEARBOOK.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT'D)
                        Is this your yearbook?

                                 MICHAEL
                        You said you lost yours.
                                 BEVERLY
                        But I can’t take yours.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I want you to have it.  I’ll borrow 
                        it if I need to.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Thank you.  That’s very sweet.  Now 
                        -- I want to do something for you.   
                        I know you believe in honesty, so 
                        I’d like to just get some things 
                        out there and see where we stand.

           He looks a little nervous.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, that sounds great.

           She takes a deep breath.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Okay, here we go.  I -- I ---

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s okay.  I won’t judge you.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I voted for George W. Bush for 
                        president.

           Michael rocks back.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh god. 

                                 BEVERLY
                        Now I remember that you were always 
                        a little liberal --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well, moderate liberal.

                                 BEVERLY
                        So I wanted you to know up front.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Wow.  Okay, yeah, well, I can kind 
                        of understand that, in the 2000 
                        election.  I mean, who knew?  And 
                        Gore wasn’t very exciting.  That’s 
                        what you mean, right, 2000?  
           She starts shaking her head.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I mean by 2004 it was pretty 
                        evident -- 

           She shrugs.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Please tell me you didn’t vote for 
                        him in 2004.  And I’m not judging 
                        you but please, please say you 
                        didn’t.  You didn’t, right?  

           She screws up her face.  He puts down his fork and demands --

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Did you vote for George W. Bush in 
                        2004?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh my god!  I’m sorry, but ooooh.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        I just thought he was the best 
                        choice to stop the gays.

           Michael’s eyes get very wide.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Stop -- the gays?

                                 BEVERLY
                        I know you probably disagree, but I 
                        don’t believe in the gay lifestyle.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You don’t believe in it?

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s not natural.  God said men 
                        shouldn’t lie with other men.

                                 MICHAEL
                        God said?  I don’t remember you 
                        being that religious.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Oh, yeah, I’m way into it now.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Well, you know, I was raised 
                        Catholic, so --

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’m a member of the First 
                        Scientists congregation.

                                 MICHAEL
                        First Scientists?  That’s not like 
                        the Scientologists is it?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Oh, no --

           He looks relieved.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT'D)
                        -- First Scientists probably seem a 
                        little further out than 
                        Scientologists --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Further out?  

                                 BEVERLY
                        No, but hey, I don’t want to scare 
                        you, because I don’t believe in 
                        everything they preach.  Like the 
                        gay reservations.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Gay reservations?

                                 BEVERLY
                        First Scientists believe we should 
                        put the gays on reservations.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Reservations?  Like Indian 
                        reservations?

                                 BEVERLY
                        They think it would be better for 
                        them and us.  But I think that’s a 
                        little nutty.  That goes too far.

           He stares at her, trying to guess if she’s joking.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Your food’s getting cold.

           He looks down, takes a forkful and starts eating.
                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and I like Clay Aiken.

           He chokes on his food a little, grabs for his water.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        I know how you are about music.  So 
                        I wanted to be honest.

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, he’s a good singer.  

           He chokes on his words, takes another big drink of water.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’m so glad you said that!

           She grabs a remote and points it across at the stereo in the 
           living room.  CLAY AIKEN erupts from the speakers.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t he great?  It’s so romantic.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What?

           She hits the remote again to turn the music down.

                                 BEVERLY
                        There, I’ll turn it down a bit.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Thank you.  Thank you so much.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Now there’s a couple of more things 
                        I hate to bring up but if this 
                        continues you’ll find out sometime.

           He braces as she walks over to him, slowly pulling up on her 
           shirt and lowering her pants enough to show the small of her 
           back, where there’s a BIG BLUE TATTOO: “LAWAYNE FOREVER.”

                                 BEVERLY (CONT'D)
                        I have a “Lawayne Forever” tattoo.

           Michael’s mouth drops.  He jumps out of his chair.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Holy shit!  

                                 BEVERLY
                        It’s not that big.
           He looks pleadingly at her.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Damn it, Beverly, he looked up your 
                        dress!

           She smiles coyly and winks.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I know.

           He’s staggering now.  She covers up as he backs away.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ll be right back.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Oh, okay.  I’ll be right here.

           As soon as he’s out of sight she dips her hand in a water 
           glass and splashes her face.

           INT. BEVERLY’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Michael sits on the edge of the bathtub, holding his head.  
           He takes a few long breaths and gets up.  He looks at himself 
           in the mirror, his face flush and starting to sweat. 

                                 BEVERLY (O.S.)
                        Michael, do you want me to reheat 
                        your dinner?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, I’ll be out in a second.

           He wipes his face and braces himself, opening the door.

           INT. BEVERLY’S DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Michael returns to find Beverly back at the table, SMOKING.   

                                 MICHAEL
                        You smoke?!!!

                                 BEVERLY
                        I’m sorry Michael, I know you hate 
                        it but I love to smoke and it’s the 
                        last secret, I swear.

           She exhales a huge puff of smoke across the table and into 
           his face.  He slumps back down in the chair.
                                 MICHAEL
                        How long have you been smoking?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Since junior high. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You were smoking in school?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yeah.  I didn’t want you to know, I 
                        thought you might not like me.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m getting dizzy.

           He gets up again and heads for the bathroom.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Excuse me.

           As soon as he’s gone she stumbles around the corner.

           INT. BEVERLY’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Beverly wavers and crumbles onto the floor, holding her head 
           and coughing.  Rex comes over and licks her face.

           INT. BEVERLY’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Michael is splashing his face with water, trying to recover.

           INT. BEVERLY’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Rex is resting his head on Beverly, who is still hacking 
           away.  Her eyes are closed until she hears the bathroom door.  
           She lurches back up to her feet and into the dining room.

           INT. BEVERLY’S DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They both sit back down at the table.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Beverly --

           She pulls another cigarette out of the pack and lights it up.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        God damn you really smoke.

           She smiles, painfully.
                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Listen, Beverly, I haven’t done 
                        anything right this whole week and 
                        for that I’m sorry.  

                                 BEVERLY
                        No, it’s been very flattering.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You see, I’ve gone a little crazy 
                        ever since I found what you wrote 
                        in my yearbook.  I swear I never 
                        saw it until last week.  And I just 
                        had to come here and see if you 
                        might still feel that way about me.

                                 BEVERLY
                        What I wrote in your yearbook?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, about how you liked me and 
                        wished I had asked you out.  You 
                        don’t know what that meant to me.  
                        I went a little insane.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

           She blows smoke as he grabs the yearbook and finds the page.  
           He hands it to her.  She holds her head as she silently 
           reads.  As she nears the end of the note tears fill her eyes.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT'D)
                        That’s beautiful.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes it is.

                                 BEVERLY
                        But I didn’t write it.

           They look into each other’s eyes for a moment.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What?

                                 BEVERLY
                        That’s not my handwriting.

           His face is turning redder.
                                 BEVERLY (CONT'D)
                        I would have never written 
                        something like that in your 
                        yearbook for everyone to see. 

           Of course.  Michael can’t believe he didn’t think of that.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m such an idiot.

                                 BEVERLY
                        It was lovely that you thought I 
                        wrote that.  In fact --

           She stands up and starts reaching for him, but she stumbles 
           and puts her hand on the table for support.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Are you okay?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Not even close.

           She falls as he tries to grab her.  He gets down beside her.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Beverly!  Beverly!

           He lifts her up.  She looks at him, then slumps in his arms.

           EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Michael pulls up in the Lexus and runs to the passenger side 
           to help Beverly out.  She stumbles, so he picks her up and 
           carries her through the sliding glass doors.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM RECEPTION - NIGHT

           Still carrying her, Michael approaches the front desk.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        She passed out!

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Weren’t you here last night?

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT

           A FEMALE DOCTOR and Michael are in the hall just outside of 
           the recovery area.

                                 FEMALE DOCTOR
                        Don’t worry, she’ll be fine.  
           Jill, Lawayne, Katie, Mr. and Mrs. Ploof, and Grandma come 
           quickly down the hallway.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        What did you do to her, Young?

                                 FEMALE DOCTOR
                        It’s nothing serious, she just got 
                        light-headed from drinking and 
                        smoking.  You can see her now.

                                 JILL
                        Drinking and smoking?!!!

           They race into the room as Grandma glares at Michael.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM RECOVERY - CONTINUOUS

           Michael looks around the door as the family gathers around 
           Beverly.  There’s no room for him.

           INT. EMERGENCY WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

           Sitting forward, distracted, Michael waits.  He notices that 
           one of his hands has blue ink on it.  He starts rubbing it.  
           Katie comes out of Beverly’s room and sits beside him.

                                 KATIE
                        Hi.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hi.

           They sit quietly for a moment.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Katie, you know your mother’s going 
                        to be good as new, don’t you?

                                 KATIE
                        Yeah.

           More silence.

                                 KATIE (CONT’D)
                        Why was my mom smoking?

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s a long story, but I can tell 
                        you she will never do it again.

                                 KATIE
                        Do you like my mom?
                                 MICHAEL
                        Why sure, everyone likes your mom.

                                 KATIE
                        And you knew my dad, too, when you 
                        were my age, didn’t you?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sure.

                                 KATIE
                        My dad says he was the smartest one 
                        in your class.

           Michael takes a long pause.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Okay.  Sure, let’s say that he was.

                                 KATIE
                        He knows everything.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well -- he certainly knows a lot.  

                                 KATIE
                        He’s the best dad.

                                 MICHAEL
                        ...Yeah.

                                 KATIE
                        And my mom’s the best mom.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes she is.

                                 KATIE
                        Do you have kids?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No -- but if I did, I’d want one 
                        just like you.

           Jill comes out and motions for Michael to talk in private.

                                 JILL
                        She can leave in a couple of hours.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’d like to go clean up the mess 
                        before she goes home.
                                 JILL
                        I’ll go with you.

           INT. BEVERLY’S DINING ROOM, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Michael and Jill come in to find the all the lights on, the 
           stereo going, food still on the table.  Jill turns the stereo 
           off.  Rex looks up from his bed.

           They clear the table, going back and forth to the kitchen.

                                 JILL
                        So why was she smoking?

                                 MICHAEL
                        She said she loves it.

                                 JILL
                        She hates smoking.  And she only 
                        drinks a little wine.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Huh.  Do you know who she voted for 
                        president in 2004?

           Jill gives him a puzzled grin.  

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Your sister is upset with me, isn’t 
                        she?  

                                 JILL
                        Why do you say that?

                                 MICHAEL
                        She was trying to drive me away 
                        tonight.  Why else would she have 
                        you draw a tattoo on her back?

           Jill looks a little sheepish.

                                 JILL
                        You’ll have to ask her.  I can tell 
                        you she used to like you a lot. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Are you sure?

                                 JILL
                        Of course.

           She walks over and stands right in his face.
                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        What are you, an idiot?

           She notices the yearbook, still open to the page, and reads.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        That’s beautiful.  Too bad Beverly 
                        didn’t really write it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        How did you know?

                                 JILL
                        I know my sister’s handwriting.  
                        Besides, that looks like it was 
                        written by a guy trying to write 
                        like a girl.

           He looks at the note, confused.  He indicates the yearbook.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where should I put this?

                                 JILL
                        She’s got her books upstairs.

           INT. UPSTAIRS LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Michael looks over Beverly’s large, eclectic collection, 
           impressed.  He finds an open space and slips the yearbook in.

           INT. BEVERLY’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           As Michael comes down the stairs, the DOG WHINES.

                                 JILL
                        Oh, Rex didn’t get his walk.

           Michael goes over to Rex and squats down, nervously extending 
           his hand.  Rex lowers his head under it and Michael pets him.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ll take him.

           EXT. KENT SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           Michael walks Rex as Jill walks beside him.

                                 JILL
                        I have to tell you something.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why not, it’s a good night for it.
                                 JILL
                        When you came to the house that 
                        night, I had a feeling that you 
                        might think I was Beverly.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Really?

                                 JILL
                        But I always liked you and I 
                        thought well, maybe you had liked 
                        me, too.  You were the nicest guy 
                        and I’ve always ended up with the 
                        bad boys.  So when you said those 
                        things I let myself believe they 
                        were for me.  It was an awful thing 
                        for me to do.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t know what to say, Jill.

           She stops him and starts to tear up.

                                 JILL
                        Please don’t tell Beverly.  I 
                        couldn’t bear it if she knew.

           He nods.  She kisses him on the cheek.

           INT. GOLDEN STEER LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Andy’s band is finishing a song as a grim-faced Michael 
           enters and walks up to the stage.  As the crowd applauds Andy 
           nods at Michael, but he doesn’t respond.

                                 ANDY
                        Thank you.  Okay, we’re going to 
                        take a ten-minute break.

           Michael indicates the side door.  Andy jumps off the stage.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?

           Michael opens the door and they step outside.

           EXT. GOLDEN STEER RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           The two walk a few feet into the light.

                                 ANDY
                        So what happened?
                                 MICHAEL
                        Why didn’t you tell me you wrote 
                        that note in my yearbook?

           Andy looks down.

                                 ANDY
                        I tried.  Ever since you called.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Was it supposed to be a joke?

                                 ANDY
                        It wasn’t a joke.  I wrote it 
                        because I thought it might give you 
                        the courage to finally ask her out.  

           Michael studies him to see if he’s telling the truth.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        And when you found it and said you 
                        were coming to see her, I thought I 
                        should let you have your shot.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You made me look like a god damn 
                        fool.  And what’s the real deal 
                        with you and Beverly, anyway?  

           Andy rubs his chin and turns slightly away from him.

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY (1983) - FLASHBACK

           Michael stands by Beverly as the teacher holds the flashcard.  
           Now we see Andy flash the answer to Beverly with his fingers.

                                 ANDY (V.O.)
                        I always liked her, Michael.  You 
                        didn’t know that?

           Beverly smiles in appreciation at Andy.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Ninety-one.

           EXT. GOLDEN STEER RESTAURANT - BACK TO THE PRESENT

                                 MICHAEL
                        Then why didn’t you ask her out?

                                 ANDY
                        Because you liked her.  And you 
                        were my best friend.
           He turns and goes back in, leaving Michael speechless in the 
           glare of the parking lot lamp.

           INT. MICHAEL’S ROOM - DAY

           Michael is under the covers, staring at the ceiling.

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        Michael, it’s eleven o’clock.  Are 
                        you okay?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes, Mom.

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        We’re going to the store, do you 
                        want anything?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No thanks.

           INT. BEVERLY’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Beverly and Jill are in their robes, hunched over the table, 
           drinking coffee, recovering.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Michael cleaned up the house?

                                 JILL
                        Yeah, and then he walked Rex.

           Beverly lifts her head in surprise.  

                                 JILL (CONT'D)
                        I know he’s been acting really 
                        weird, but he’s still very sweet.

           INT. MICHAEL’S PARENTS’ KITCHEN - DAY

           Michael, disheveled, wearing his robe, opens the refrigerator 
           and looks inside for the longest time, not moving.  

           INT. GOLDEN STEER LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Andy and his band are playing a slow song as Michael watches 
           from a booth.  Jill slides in next to him.

                                 ANDY
                        “This is not my real face, I’m much 
                        more handsome than this...”
                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey.

                                 JILL
                        So, what’s going on?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Jill, I’ve decided to tell Beverly 
                        what you did that first night.

                                 JILL
                        What?!!

                                 MICHAEL
                        Unless you go to the reunion with 
                        Andy.

                                 JILL
                        Andy?

           He nods toward Andy singing.  She looks toward the stage.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Andy?

                                 MICHAEL
                        You said you wanted to go out with 
                        a nice boy.  Well he’s much nicer 
                        than me.

           She looks at Andy again.

                                 JILL
                        Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        “This is not my real voice, I sing 
                        much better than this...“

                                 JILL
                        I like this song.

           As the song ends the audience applauds.

                                 ANDY
                        That’s a song I wrote.

           Michael looks surprised.

                                 JILL
                        He writes songs?
           Michael shrugs.  Andy hops off the stage and walks over to 
           the booth.  He and Michael study each other for a moment.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Nice song.

           Andy smiles and sits down, finally focusing on this woman who 
           looks so much like Beverly.  He does a double take.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Andy, you remember Beverly’s 
                        sister, Jill.

                                 ANDY
                        Hi Jill.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Jill has something she wants to ask 
                        you.

           Jill looks at Michael, then Andy.

                                 JILL
                        Yeah, I was wondering if you’d go 
                        to the reunion with me?

           Andy looks at Michael, then back at Jill.

                                 ANDY
                        Sure.  My band will be playing a 
                        lot of the time, though.

                                 JILL
                        I don’t mind.  You guys are great.  
                        I could just sit and listen.

           Andy smiles and exchanges a pleased look with Michael.

           INT. MICHAEL’S PARENTS’ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Michael’s parents come in DRESSED IN SQUARE DANCE OUTFITS as 
           he watches TV on the couch.

                                 MOM
                        Well, we’re about to take off.  
                        We’re going square dancing.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s good.  Otherwise your dress 
                        would be too big.

                                 MOM
                        Too big for what?
                                 MICHAEL
                        Pretty much anything other than 
                        square dancing.

                                 MOM
                        Shouldn’t you be getting dressed 
                        for the reunion?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t think I’m going.

                                 MOM
                        What?

           She sits on one side of him, her dress puffing up almost to 
           eye level, as his dad sits on the other side, cowboy hat brim 
           almost in Michael’s face.

                                 DAD
                        You came all this way for the 
                        thing.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ve already seen everyone I wanted 
                        to see.

                                 MOM
                        What about Beverly?

                                 MICHAEL
                        That didn’t work out, Mom.

                                 MOM
                        Why not?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Turns out she was too smart for me.

                                 DAD
                        Well, she was pretty sharp.

                                 MOM
                        Still, you should go.

           Michael looks at the two of them in their colorful outfits.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why?

                                 MOM
                        Go show them all what a success 
                        you’ve become.
                                 DAD
                        Make us proud.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That would make you proud?

                                 DAD
                        There must be other women there who 
                        aren’t too smart for you. 

                                 MOM
                        Yeah, go get one of them.

           Michael thinks it over, the absurdity of his parents’ well-
           meaning, square dance attired pep talk lightening his mood.

           EXT. GRADE SCHOOL - NIGHT

           The whole school is lit up and RECORDED MUSIC DRIFTS FROM 
           LOUDSPEAKERS as Michael walks down a breezeway.

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

           The gym is now a dance hall as Michael strides in.  The first 
           thing he sees is the WALL OF PHOTOGRAPHS, including the 
           embarrassing one of him playing basketball, now twice the 
           size as the one he took down.  He’s deflated once again.

                                 ANDY
                        I didn’t give it to them.

           Michael turns to find Andy in a suit and Jill in a stunning 
           black dress, which catches Michael off guard.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Wow.  

                                 JILL
                        Hi.  Beverly’s going to be late.  
                        Lawayne was drunk so she had to get 
                        Katie and take her to her parents’.

           Megan slides up beside him, a red dress rivaling Jill’s.

                                 MEGAN
                        Hi Michael.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh, hey, it looks great.  The gym.

                                 MEGAN
                        This is Brian Clark.
           BRIAN steps up, looking a lot like Michael did in high 
           school, only he’s 35.  Andy laughs.

                                 BRIAN
                        Hi.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hi.

           Joe Tuttle barges in.

                                 JOE
                        Michael, right?  See, I remember.

                                 ANDY
                        Hi Joe, it’s me, Andy Tingstad.

           Joe looks at him.

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, Andy.  You were in band.

                                 ANDY
                        So what are you up to these days, 
                        Joe?

                                 JOE
                        I work for the university.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Really?  What do you do?

                                 JOE
                        I’m involved in transportation 
                        management.

           Michael and Joe exchange looks and suppress smiles.  Joe 
           points at Michael --

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Now I know what you do --

           Michael looks confused at that.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        So what are you doing, Andy?

                                 ANDY
                        Still in a band.  In fact, my group 
                        is playing tonight.

                                 JOE
                        Great.  What’s your day job?
           Michael mouths the word “lie” to Andy, who considers it.

                                 ANDY
                        Nothing.  That’s it.

                                 JOE
                        Wow, so how do you get by?

           Andy straightens up as if he’s proud about it.

                                 ANDY
                        I still live at home with my 
                        parents.

                                 JOE
                        Oh my god, you’re not one of those 
                        middle-age guys who live in their 
                        parents’ basement, are you?

                                 ANDY
                        No, I don’t live in my parents’ 
                        basement.

                                 JOE
                        Thank god.

                                 ANDY
                        I live in the attic.

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL GYM - LATER

           Michael slumps in a chair, alone at a table as Andy and his 
           band play a slow dance number.  Megan comes over.

                                 MEGAN
                        Dance with me.

           They go out on the floor and start to slow dance.  As they 
           turn, her date Brian can be seen standing on the sidelines.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        I talked to Beverly this morning.  
                        She told me about the yearbook.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Great.

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What are you sorry for?
                                 MEGAN
                        I did it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Did what?

                                 MEGAN
                        I glued the pages together.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why?

                                 MEGAN
                        I was jealous.  I didn’t want you 
                        to see a love note from Beverly.

           Michael isn’t sure what to say.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I see.

                                 MEGAN
                        I hope I didn’t ruin anything.  I 
                        could never forgive myself if I 
                        hurt you.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Don’t worry about it.  Most of my 
                        wounds are self-inflicted.

                                 MEGAN
                        I wish I could make it up to you.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What about the handsome guy you’ve 
                        got over there?

           They look at Brian, uncomfortably waiting on the sidelines.

                                 MEGAN
                        I found out that he’s planning to 
                        ask me to marry him tonight at 
                        midnight.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s good, isn’t it?

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah, it’s great.  He’s great.

           She rises up and whispers in his ear.
                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        But until then, I will still do 
                        anything you want me to do.

           She blows in Michael’s ear and his eyes get huge.

           Another turn and he sees Beverly standing in the doorway, 
           stunning in a dark green dress, watching him.  As they go 
           around again Jill is standing there.

                                 JILL
                        Mind if I cut in?

                                 MEGAN
                        He’s all yours.

           Jill and Michael dance in silence for a moment.  Beverly is 
           talking to a couple of friends, but keeps her eye on Michael.

                                 JILL
                        Is Andy really that nice or is it a 
                        big act?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s a very real and scary act.

                                 JILL
                        Does he really live with his 
                        parents?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Obviously.  I mean, look at him.

                                 JILL
                        That’s kinda cool.

           Jill sees that Michael is watching Beverly.  She leans in.

                                 JILL (CONT'D)
                        I’m not supposed to tell you this, 
                        but Big Jim told Beverly you 
                        thought she wasn’t very bright but 
                        you were going to nail her anyway.

           Michael stiffens.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s a lie.

           Jill smiles.  The song ends and they walk back to the table.

                                 JILL
                        I’ll be back in a few minutes.
           Michael sits down and watches Beverly mingling across the 
           room.  He works up the courage to go over, starting to get up 
           just as LYLE ECKLEBARGER and his wife LAURA pin him down.

                                 LYLE
                        Michael, it’s Lyle Ecklebarger.  
                        And this is my wife Laura.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hi Laura.

                                 LAURA
                        Hi.

                                 LYLE
                        She’s hot, don’t you think?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well...

                                 LYLE
                        Come on you can say it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Lyle, I feel a little strange 
                        commenting on your wife’s looks 
                        while she’s sitting right here.

                                 LYLE
                        Hell, I don’t mind.  You don’t 
                        mind, do you honey?

                                 LAURA
                        No I don’t mind.

           They both wait.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Okay Lyle -- your wife’s hot.

           Lyle looks very upset.

                                 LYLE
                        What kind of thing is that to say 
                        about my wife, Young!??

           Michael blinks.  Lyle and Laura start laughing.

                                 LYLE (CONT'D)
                        Hey, I’m just kidding you.  You 
                        probably forgot about my sense of 
                        humor.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, I sure did.

           Michael tries to see where Beverly is.  Lyle is digging 
           something out of his pocket.

                                 LYLE
                        I heard you’re doing well.  I’m not 
                        doing too shabby myself.  I got 
                        some land in Covington real cheap 
                        10 years ago and built this house.

           He shows Michael a photo of a huge suburban cul-de-sac home.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ah yes, that’s a nice big house to 
                        drive home drunk to.

                                 LYLE
                        What?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Lots of room to stumble around in 
                        there.

           He winks at Laura.  Lyle gives Michael an odd smile and 
           shoves another photo at him.

                                 LYLE
                        And here’s a picture of our granite 
                        countertops.

           Michael looks at this pathetic man and his wife.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re a lucky man.  A hot babe and 
                        granite countertops.

           Lyle smiles.  Michael sees that Beverly is finally alone, 
           just looking around.  He leaps up.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, I’ll be right back.

           Michael gets a few steps before Andy makes an announcement.

                                 ANDY
                        Beverly Ploof, would you join us 
                        for a song?

           The crowd applauds and Michael walks over by the wall as 
           Beverly takes the stage.  The band starts the upbeat intro to 
           “I LOVE THIS TOWN” as Beverly approaches the microphone.
           Michael watches, now enamored with this new Beverly.

                                 BEVERLY
                        “I love this town, like an unmade 
                        bed, I love this town of the living 
                        dead, I love this town, gonna paint 
                        it red, If I can spare a minute...”

           Michael’s too entranced to notice Lawayne walk up beside him.  
           Lawayne is bleary-eyed and shaky.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Why don’t you just go up and sit on 
                        her face?

           Michael gives Lawayne a cold glance.

                                 LAWAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Still stalking my wife?  I think 
                        it’s time you and I step outside.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Don’t be a child, Lawayne.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Afraid I’ll kick your ass?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes, actually, I am.

           Lawayne grabs him.  Michael looks around, not wanting to make 
           a scene.  He nods for Lawayne to follow him.

           EXT. GRADE SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

           Beverly’s singing wafts through outdoor speakers as Michael 
           and Lawayne stop by the playground equipment.  Lawayne has a 
           scary look in his eye.  Michael leans on the jungle gym.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So what do you want to do, hit me?

                                 LAWAYNE
                        That’s a start.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Look, Lawayne, I understand.  I 
                        know what it’s like to lose 
                        Beverly.

           Michael jumps inside the jungle gym.  Lawayne wavers, not 
           sure what to do.
                                 LAWAYNE
                        Come out of there, you coward.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You come in.

                                 LAWAYNE
                        Quit being childish.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re being childish.

           Michael backs away as Lawayne circles.  Lawayne puts one leg 
           in and Michael puts one leg out.  Lawayne takes his leg out 
           and stares at him.  Michael puts both feet back inside.  

           A long pause as Lawayne thinks.  Then Lawayne leaps through 
           the bars and grabs for Michael’s coat, ripping it.  Michael 
           jumps out the other side.  Lawayne runs out after him.

           Michael runs around the slide and Lawayne almost has him, so 
           Michael runs up the steps.  Lawayne circles around the slide, 
           then runs up the steps as Michael runs clanging down the 
           slide.  Lawayne gets to the top, but is too unsteady to run 
           down, so he sits and slides down. 

           Michael uses the head start to run back toward the gym, with 
           Lawayne about fifty feet behind.  

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL GYM - CONTINUOUS

           Beverly has just finished a chorus and steps back for an 
           instrumental break.  Megan comes up to the microphone.

                                 MEGAN
                        Okay, it’s time for our first award 
                        of the evening.  This is for the 
                        person who’s come the farthest, and 
                        the winner came all the way from 
                        Boston -- Michael Young!

           The crowd claps as Megan, Andy and Beverly look for Michael.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Michael?  He came all this way and 
                        he can’t make it to the stage!

           Just then Michael bursts through the door, running through 
           groups of people and tables.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        There he is!  Michael Young!
           Michael looks up at her, not knowing what’s going on as the 
           crowd applauds.  Lawayne comes racing in and spots Michael, 
           now scurrying through people on the dance floor.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Michael, you won the award for 
                        coming the farthest!  Come on up!

           Michael spots Lawayne closing in.  Instead of going for the 
           stairs he makes a running leap, flopping onto the stage.  
           Lawayne comes skidding up below him, not sure what to do.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Wow, what an entrance!

           Michel tries to pull himself together, but his clothes are 
           torn and tousled, his hair is askew, and he’s sweating and 
           winded.  Megan hands him the award.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Thank you.  First of all I just 
                        want to say that the only time I 
                        ever forgot my white gym socks and 
                        contact lenses was the day they 
                        took that damn photograph.  And 
                        second, there’s something I’d like 
                        to say to the lovely and talented 
                        Beverly Ploof...

           He turns toward her but before he can continue Lawayne’s hand 
           comes up and grabs Michael’s ankle, yanking him down onto the 
           dance floor.  Lawayne jumps on Michael as Big Jim comes in to 
           help him out.  Andy puts down his guitar and jumps on top of 
           them, as Jill and Megan join in to try to defend the boys.

           The bass player motions for Beverly to finish the song.  She 
           steps up to the microphone.

                                 BEVERLY
                        “Everyone’s friendly to your face, 
                        And everybody knows their place, As 
                        long as you respect their space, 
                        You won’t have to worry...”

           She stops, looking down into the fray.  

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, that’s enough!  Stop it!  

           The melee continues.  

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        Fucking stop it right now!!!
           The combatants freeze, looking up at Beverly. 

                                 ANDY
                        She used to be so shy.

           INT. NURSE’S OFFICE - DAY (1979) - FLASHBACK

           Seven-year-old Michael has a cut on his head that the NURSE 
           is cleaning up.  He lies on his back looking up.

                                 NURSE
                        How did you do this young man?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I ran into a pole.

                                 NURSE
                        Why did you do that?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I was looking at a girl.

                                 NURSE
                        A girl?  You poor thing.

           She notices that he’s staring at the ceiling.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        What’s so interesting up there?

                                 MICHAEL
                        The tiles are 12 inches by 12 
                        inches.  That’s 144 square inches, 
                        and there’s about three holes per 
                        inch so that’s 532 holes per tile.

           The nurse looks up at the tiles, amazed.

                                 NURSE
                        What grade are you in?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Second.

                                 NURSE
                        You’re not going to be staying in 
                        this little town when you grow up.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why not?  

                                 NURSE
                        There’s nothing for you here.
           INT. NURSE’S OFFICE - NIGHT - BACK TO THE PRESENT

           Michael is on his back, staring up at the tiles while Megan 
           bandages a cut on his arm.  Andy sits in a chair as Jill 
           wipes blood from his head.  Megan gives Michael a loving pat.

                                 MEGAN
                        There you go.  I have to get back.  
                        Only two hours until midnight.

           She looks at Michael suggestively as she heads for the door.

                                 ANDY
                        I’ll be ready to play again in a 
                        couple of minutes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Megan -- thanks.

                                 MEGAN
                        I’ll see you in a while.

           She smiles and winks before leaving.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where’s Beverly?

                                 JILL
                        I haven’t seen her.  

                                 ANDY
                        Why don’t you go find her?

           Jill kisses Andy’s head, much to Andy’s amazement.  He and 
           Michael exchange looks.  Michael stands up.

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Michael hurries down the hall, walking with purpose again.  
           As he passes an open classroom door, something catches his 
           eye -- Beverly sitting at a desk in the second row.  Michael 
           slides to a stop, goes back and enters the classroom.

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

           He walks quietly among the rows, then sits one row back and 
           one seat over from Beverly.  She’s sitting slightly forward, 
           staring at the desk.  He waits.  Silence.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So what happened to Lawayne?
                                 BEVERLY
                        I called him a cab.

           A long pause.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m not perfect, you know.  I never 
                        claimed to be.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh hell I know that.  You’re not 
                        even close.

           She lifts her head a little, mildly amused.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        But you’re much closer than I am.

           Michael opens up the desk and takes out a pen and notebook.  
           He rips out a page and writes a note on the next page of the 
           notebook: “Sorry, I borrowed a piece of your notebook paper.  
           Thank you.”

           He takes a $10 bill out of his wallet and puts it on top of 
           the notebook, then closes the desk, as Beverly watches him.  
           He writes on the other piece of paper.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        I heard what Big Jim said.  He lied 
                        to you because like every guy in 
                        this town he’s in love with you. 
                        But I did say some things that I 
                        regret, things I turned out to be 
                        very wrong about.  I was an idiot.

                                 BEVERLY
                        It doesn’t matter.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It does to me.  When I found that 
                        note in the yearbook I was so 
                        happy, even though I knew it was a 
                        long shot that you’d still be 
                        interested in me.  I’ve made a 
                        complete fool of myself this week 
                        but it was still worth it to see 
                        you.  You’re still the best person 
                        I’ve ever known.  You could 
                        actually be a tattooed fascist cult-
                        follower and considering your other 
                        virtues, you’d still be the best 
                        person I’ve ever known.  I love 
                        you.  I’ve always loved you.
           She fights back tears.  He hands her the piece of paper.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        I don’t want to bother you any 
                        more.  Here’s my address, phone 
                        numbers, e-mail.  If you ever want 
                        to see me again, or just talk, 
                        anything, I’d love another chance.  
                        If not, I understand.  Just give me 
                        a sign, any sign, and I’ll be here.

           She stares at the paper for a long time.

                                 BEVERLY
                        You were the best thing in my whole 
                        childhood, you know.  Every day I 
                        looked forward to seeing you at 
                        school.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I had no idea.

           She sniffs and laughs at the same time.

                                 BEVERLY
                        When I was a girl I always dreamed 
                        I would marry someone different 
                        than my dad, who didn’t say mean 
                        things all the time, who didn’t 
                        always make me explain why I wasn’t 
                        exactly the way he wanted me to be.  
                        Someone kind.  Like Michael Young.

           Beverly finally turns to face him.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry I didn’t write that note 
                        in the yearbook.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s okay --

                                 BEVERLY
                        Because whoever did write it knew 
                        exactly how I felt.

           Her words are both painful and encouraging to Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I wish we could go back fifteen 
                        years and start all over, but we 
                        can’t.  But we can go back a week 
                        and start again, if you wish.
           She searches for words, pauses, then stands up.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Remember playing 7-Up?  

                                 MICHAEL
                        7-Up?  Yeah.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Put your head down. 

           He obeys.  She taps him on the shoulder and walks to the 
           front of the classroom, hesitates, and walks out the door.   

                                 MICHAEL
                        Are you ready?

           Silence.  He looks up.  He’s alone.  He guesses anyway.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Did Beverly pick me?

           He smiles at his own pathetic joke, then looks confused.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Was that a sign?  Seriously, I 
                        mean, was that supposed to be a 
                        sign?  God, I’m terrible at this.

           EXT. GRADE SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

           Andy and his band are tuning up.  Michael walks up to the 
           open door and sees Beverly half way across the room with a 
           friend.  He watches for a moment, then backs up and takes a 
           few steps toward the parking lot.

                                 ANDY
                        Sorry about the interruption.  I 
                        have a request here from one of our 
                        special guests, an old Pogues song.

           He plays the opening chords of “RAINY NIGHT IN SOHO.”  
           Michael stops.  He walks back up to the door and peers in.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        “I’ve been loving you a long time, 
                        Down all the years, down all the 
                        days...”

           INT. GRADE SCHOOL GYM - CONTINUOUS

           Michael starts walking toward Beverly, who chats with her 
           friend while keeping an eye on Michael.
                                 ANDY
                        “And I’ve cried for all your 
                        troubles, smiled at your funny 
                        little ways...”

           Michael reaches her, but goes right on by.  Beverly 
           hesitates, then turns slightly, but doesn’t see him.  She 
           turns back, and there he is on the other side of her.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        “We watched our friends grow up 
                        together, and we saw them as they 
                        fell...”

           Michael holds out his hand and she takes it, following him 
           onto the dance floor.  Jill and Megan part before them.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        “Some of them fell into heaven, 
                        some of them fell into hell...”

           They slow dance.  Andy watches with a melancholy smile. 

                                 BEVERLY
                        I know you believe in being honest.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not so much anymore.

                                 BEVERLY
                        I didn’t request this song.

           He freezes.

                                 BEVERLY (CONT’D)
                        But I’m glad Andy played it.

           Michael smiles and dances her out a side door into the night.

           EXT. GRADE SCHOOL PLAY FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Andy’s singing can still be heard as Michael takes her hand 
           and walks her into the field, glowing from the lights.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Would you go out on a real date 
                        with me?
                                 BEVERLY
                        Yes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So you always liked me?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        As much as I liked you?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And the no sex before marriage 
                        thing was a joke, right?

                                 BEVERLY
                        Michael?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes?

           They’re at the stream.  She pushes him across.  He stumbles 
           to his knees, then looks up at her.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to get in trouble.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Yes we are.

           She jumps.

           I sang you all my sorrows
           You told me all your joys
           Whatever happened to that old song
           To all those little girls and boys
           Now this song is nearly over
           We may never find out what it means
           But there’s a light I hold before me
           And you’re the measure of my dreams
           The measure of my dreams

                                                      FADE TO BLACK
