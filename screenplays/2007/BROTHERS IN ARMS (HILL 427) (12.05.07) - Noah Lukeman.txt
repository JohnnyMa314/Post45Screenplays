           EXT. BRIDGE OVER THE RHINE DAY

           SEVERAL HUNDRED AMERICAN SOLDIERS stand at attention on both 
           sides of the captured bridge. They are lined up neatly, 
           frozen in one mass salute. They wait.

           TITLE: "Germany, March, 1945"

           The FAINT RUMBLE of a convoy of jeeps. It grows louder, and 
           into view come five jeeps. 

           TITLE:  "Based on a True Story"

           In the third jeep sits GENERAL GEORGE S. PATTON JR., 60s, 
           riding proudly, his uniform glistening in the sun.

           Patton taps his driver on the shoulder with his crop, and the 
           five jeep convoy slows, then stops. They sit in the middle of 
           the bridge.

           Patton rises from his vehicle and walks over to the railing. 
           He unzips his fly, and URINATES over the railing.

           The soldiers remain frozen at attention, waiting. 

           Patton smiles broadly. Several beats. Near him is MAJOR 
           ALEXANDER STILLER, in his 50s, short and wiry, with red hair 
           and a tough, leathery face that looks like it's seen too much 
           action. He carries a .45 on his hip engraved with notches of 
           his kills. His uniform is covered with decorations going back 
           to World War I. 

           Patton nods to him. They're old friends. 

           Patton finally re-zips his fly. He struts slowly down the 
           bridge until he reaches the other side. He turns.

                                 PATTON
                        Men. We are the only army to cross 
                        the River Rhine in 3,000 years. In 
                        my entire military career, what I 
                        am most proud of is having my name 
                        coupled with yours in this great 
                        event.

           Patton sinks to one knee. He reaches out on either side of 
           him and grabs a handful of earth in each hand, then slowly 
           rises, raises his arms and lets the earth fall through his 
           fingers.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                        Thus, William the Conqueror.

           Patton's eyes glaze over, staring into space with the look of 
           a man living history.

           EXT. HILL 427 - DAY 

           Dozens of German Tanks and HUNDREDS of elite infantry perform 
           target practice on Hill 427. 

           TITLE: 60 Miles Behind German lines

           An enormous white cross, over 100 feet tall, stands atop a 
           hill on the horizon. The French built it after World War I to 
           commemorate the enormous loss of human life in the area. It 
           will play a significant role in this story too.

           As the CAMERA CRANES OUT AND UP, higher and higher, over the 
           hill, past the enormous white cross. Into view comes:

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS HAMMELBURG - DAY

           THREE DOZEN U.S. POWS march. Sickly and malnourished, every 
           step is a battle. Their uniforms are ragged, and faces and 
           hands glow with frostbite. Completely dejected, most of them 
           don't even have the energy to look up.

           But if they look bad, that's nothing compared to wreckage 
           they walk through--the once charming town of Hammelburg is 
           nearly in ruins. 

           This is the end of the empire, and it shows.

           Allied bombardment has reduced a good bit of the town to 
           rubble. Chaos, anxiety and confusion rule. Civilians scamper 
           furtively from building to building. Rats rule the gutters.

           We see in everyone's eyes an extraordinary sense of 
           desperation. The terror of being in the wrong place at the 
           wrong time governs their days, and more so their nights. At 
           this point, the best rule of survival is to trust no-one.

           Near the front of the group is U.S. LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN 
           WATERS, 39, a tall, handsome, noble-looking officer with dark 
           hair and blue eyes. He's the son of a Baltimore banker and a 
           lifelong military man, trained at West Point, steeped in the 
           tradition of "Duty. Honor. Country." Behind him a bit, three 
           POWs talk quietly as they scuffle along.

                                 U.S. POW 1
                            (to the next man)
                        You know who that is, right?

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        Another upper-class waste of space?

                                 U.S. POW 1
                            (shakes his head)
                        Lieutenant Colonel Waters. Also 
                        known as Patton's son-in-law.

                                 U.S.POW 3
                        Fuck me.

                                 U.S. POW 1
                        Fuck us all if the Germans ever 
                        find out.
                            (beat)
                        They won't. He's been a POW since 
                        '43. 

           The procession reaches the top of a hill and a WHISTLE 
           sounds. They stop and raise their heads.

           Before them lies a massive POW camp, dozens of buildings 
           enclosed by towering barbed-wire. 

                                 WATERS
                            (softly)
                            We made it.

           He straightens, as do the other senior officers. No need to 
           yell at his men or give them a rousing speech. Their form 
           improves too. This leader commands attention quietly.

           The men are clearly relieved: the prospect of spartan 
           barracks behind barbed wire is a definite improvement for 
           them. They'll be less cold. And they might even get fed.

           EXT. HAMMELBURG POW CAMP DAY

           SIX GERMAN GUARDS step forward and meet SIX OTHER GERMAN 
           GUARDS at the gate. They open the massive gates to Hammelburg.

           Waters and his contingent into the center of the camp, 
           marching in very good form. Clearly he has his men's respect.

           HUNDREDS OF POWS await them in the camp, in even worse shape 
           than Waters' men. Unshaven, haggard and deathly malnourished. 

           ONE POW stares at a tree, mumbling to himself.

           ANOTHER POW sits on a rock, head in his hands.

           TWO MORE POWS argue loudly.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           All of this slowly comes to stop under the quiet gaze of 
           Waters. The long-term inmates look out at the group of newly 
           arrived prisoners.

           Waters observes the watchtowers. They are all manned by GERMAN 
           GUARDS. MORE GUARDS circle the perimeter, leading dogs.

           The POWS march neatly, in formation, and actually manage to 
           look like a sharp Army marching unit.

           The current POWS watch, in awe.

           TWO DOZEN GERMAN OFFICERS await them, lead by GERMAN GENERAL 
           VON GOECKEL, 60s, a proud, noble-looking officer. He has 
           rings about his eyes, and is clearly worn-out.

           The Americans come to a stop before Goeckel. Silence.

                                 WATERS 
                        United States Lieutenant Colonel 
                        John Waters.

                                 GOECKEL
                        General Von Goeckel. Welcome to 
                        Hammelburg. 
                            (beat)
                        I will not lie to you, Colonel:  
                        Berlin has thrust you upon us. Food 
                        is scarce, medical supplies close 
                        to none, and we can barely maintain 
                        current conditions for 1,500 men. 
                        We simply have no resources for 400 
                        additional prisoners. Rations will 
                        have to be cut further. Several 
                        prisoners will share a single bunk, 
                        and there is no wood for heating.

           After all the damage and desolation the Americans have seen 
           in their March from Poland, nobody is surprised by this.

                                 GOECKEL (CONT’D)
                        I do not tolerate insubordination. 
                        Any prisoner attempting to escape 
                        is shot on site. I assure you that 
                        several are shot each week. No 
                        prisoner has ever escaped from 
                        Hammelburg, and no prisoner ever 
                        will.
                            (Beat)
                        Follow our rules and we shall 
                        coexist peacefully. Questions?

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 WATERS
                        We have marched from Poland. 45 
                        days without adequate clothing or 
                        proper rations--through the coldest 
                        winter in 20 years. Many have died 
                        along the way, and many are close 
                        to death now. You'll have no 
                        trouble with us. 

           Goeckel nods back.

                                 GOECKEL
                        Good. Very good. I think we shall 
                        get along pleasantly.

           Waters raises his hands in a salute. Goeckel returns it.

           EXT. GERMAN HILLSIDE NIGHT

           CAPTAIN ABE BAUM, 24, 6-foot-two-inches tall and slim, a 
           tough, stubborn soldier with a short mustache. He is our 
           protagonist--a poor kid from the Bronx who is as driven as 
           they come. He became an officer the hard way: by earning it. 
           His rank should allow him the luxury of hanging back and 
           barking orders, but he's almost always up front--in the 
           middle of harm's way--driving his men forward. 

           He walks forward slowly, at a crouch, rifle in hand. He 
           suddenly stops, signaling to the TWELVE U.S. SOLDIERS behind 
           him.

           They stop, too. Several beats, as they watch:

           TWO U.S. SOLDIERS, about 50 feet in front of them, keep 
           walking forward.

           CLICK. The Two soldiers' faces are frozen with fear. Beat. An 
           EXPLOSION blows them off their feet. They hit the ground, 
           bloody, writhing in agony. 

                                 TWO SOLDIERS
                        Medic!  Medic!!!

           A MEDIC rushes up beside Baum.

                                 MEDIC 1
                        Sir, I can't go in there. I'd get 
                        killed.

           Baum gives the Medic a hard look. He removes his rifle and 
           hands it to him.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MEDIC
                        Sir, what are you doing?

           Ignoring him, Baum proceeds into the minefield, towards the 
           SCREAMING soldiers. This is about bravery, to be sure. But 
           it's more than that. It's about Baum having to prove he 
           deserves his place every day.

           He walks as gingerly as he can, gently placing one foot after 
           the other. Every time he steps, LEAVES CRUNCH under him.

           The Twelve Soldiers watch nervously.

           Baum gets closer. About ten feet away from the wounded 
           soldiers, Baum puts his foot down. CLICK.

           Baum immediately wheels. These mines are nasty: when 
           triggered, they fly up from the ground to the height of a 
           man's balls, and then they go off: spraying metal fragments 
           everywhere. 

           AN EXPLOSION hurls Baum forward, face first.

           After a moment, he painfully collects himself. Because he 
           wheeled, the shrapnel pierced his rear. He is injured, but 
           able to move.

           Through sheer force of will, he turns and crawls forward, 
           toward the wounded soldiers.

           He reaches a soldier and, panting, grabs him. He drags him 
           back towards his men.

           When he gets close, the Medic rushes out to meet him.

                                 BAUM
                        Get the other one first.

           Yup: that's a Bronx accent. The "r"s are soft. 

           The Medic looks at him, then goes off into the minefield, the 
           path now cleared, for the other wounded soldier.

           Baum's other men come rushing out to get him. He collapses.

           Across a room full of hospital beds. The good news is that 
           not too many of them are occupied at the moment. In the 
           corner, we find Baum, fully awake, restless despite his 
           injuries. He hears music and the sound of a crowd celebrating-
           -from downstairs perhaps?

           A nurse comes over to check on him.

                                 BAUM
                        Hey Karen, wanna dance?

                            (smiles)
                        Very funny. You're not even 
                        supposed to stand up for another 
                        week.

           Baum promptly stands up. Clearly it's painful, but he's doing 
           everything he can to cover it. His wry smile makes a well-
           timed appearance. He mock salutes her.

                                 BAUM
                        What does a man have to do to get a 
                        dress uniform around here?

           Karen laughs. He's a pretty successful flirt. She's game.

                                 KAREN
                        I'll be right back.

           Downstairs, a crowd of soldiers and nurses has taken over the 
           lobby for a makeshift celebration. We find them in full party 
           mode. Booze pours freely. Couples dance. Much needed laughter 
           abounds. 

           At the far door, we see a tall handsome man in uniform and 
           his date enter the party. It's Baum and Karen of course. 

                                 BAUM

           And just like that, they're whirling through the crowd. It 
           turns out they're both very good dancers. 

           He smiles. She smiles. He holds her close. They're both 
           having a great time.

           He dips her, twirls her. And as he reaches to pull her back 
           to him, a grimmace overtakes him.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                        I think I popped a couple of 
                        stitches.

           She winces, knowing how painful that can be.

           He pulls her through the crowd by the hand into...

                                                                     5C

           Baum clearly was prepared for this possibility. He retrieves 
           medical tape from his pocket, takes off his coat and then his 
           pants. And sure enough, he's popped a lot of stitches on his 
           legs. 

                                 KAREN
                        Oh god, you popped a bunch of them.
                            (she counts)
                        Eleven.

           Baum hands her the tape. 

                                 BAUM
                        No time for stitches in the field. 
                        Can you make a butterfly?

           She doesn't know what that is. He shows her: tape in the 
           shape of a butterfly that pulls a wound together. Eleven 
           times more, and he's as good as new (sort of). 

                                 BAUM (CONT'D)
                        Great. Let's get back out there

                                 BAUM
                        You're not the first one to tell me 
                        that.

           She laughs harder.

           The next morning: Baum is in bed again. A doctor comes by to 
           examine him. Lifts up the hospital gown and sees the carnage 
           Baum has inflicted on his legs, and those 11 butterflies.

                                 ARMY DOCTOR
                        Where have you been?

                        I never left the bed.

           They both know he's lying through his teeth. But he's a 
           charming liar. Plus the doctor knows what he's been through, 
           and cuts him a break.

           EXT. HAMMELBURG POW CAMP DAY

           HUNDREDS OF POWS stand on a food line. Each holds a small 
           bowl and spoon and eagerly watches the food being served.

           On line stands Colonel Waters.

                                 VOICE
                        Sir?

           Waters turns to find POW SECOND LIEUTENANT RICHARD BARON, 21, 
           emaciated, six foot one and 130 pounds (he's lost 45 pounds). 
           With him are THREE OTHER POWS, all emaciated.

                                 BARON
                        Lieutenant Baron, Sir. Any news 
                        from the outside?

                                 WATERS
                        Sorry, Lieutenant, I'm in the dark.

           They are each doled out a ladelful of soup, and they all find 
           a quiet place at the side of the mayhem.

           Waters looks at his bowl suspiciously, mixing it with his 
           spoon. Small chunks float in the green liquid.

                                 POW 4
                        Maggots.

           Waters looks at him.

                                 POW 5
                        They call it "hornet soup." I just 
                        take em out.

           POW5 pulls them out, one at a time. POW4 eats them.

                                 BARON
                        That's the big debate around here--
                        whether to eat them or not. Ya 
                        know, protein and all.

           Suddenly, a SHOT rings out. All heads turn.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A U.S. POW lies face first on the barbed wire fence, shot in

           INT. US ARMY FORWARD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           General Patton walks down a hallway, Major Stiller at his 
           side. Stiller speaks in hushed, reverent tones. 

                                 STILLER
                        Are you sure about this?

                                 PATTON
                        This army may have millions of men. 
                        But I've only got three kids--none 
                        of them expendable.
                            (beat)
                        You've seen the intelligence. 
                        They're starting to kill our 
                        officers in the POW camps. If we 
                        don't act now...  

           He doesn't even want to finish that sentence.

           We can see Stiller is still resistant to the idea, but he's 
           smart enough to know he had better just listen first.

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        How long have you known Bea?

                                 STILLER
                        Since before she was born.

                                 PATTON
                        Then you'll understand: with all 
                        the power invested in me by the 
                        greatest military machine in human 
                        history, what am I supposed to tell 
                        my daughter? "I'm very sorry honey, 
                        I couldn't save your husband"?

                                 STILLER
                        Sir...with all due respect, 
                        Hammelburg is 60 miles behind enemy 
                        lines--in the wrong direction. 
                        We've never sent a task force that 
                        deep without support.
                            (beat)

                        They could run into a full 
                        division. From a tactical point of 
                        view...it could be suicide.

           Patton turns and looks directly at Stiller. He breaks into a 
           grin.

                                 PATTON
                        Then we're gonna need a damn good 
                        man to lead it.

           Stiller thinks Patton has annointed him. He actually smiles.

                                 STILLER
                        Yes sir.

           Patton blows through the door into a room full of officers, 
           Stiller trailing him. 

           INT. ABRAMS' FORWARD HEADQUARTERS DAY

           We're in the office of LIEUTENANT COLONEL CREIGHTON ABRAMS, 
           30, Commander of the 4th Armored Division's Combat Command B, 
           a battle-hardened leader with a broad, fleshy face. He stands 
           behind his desk, chewing hard on the stub of a cigar. The man 
           always has a cigar in his mouth, with the possible exceptions 
           of meal and shower time. 

           Beside him stands LIEUTENANT COLONEL HAROLD COHEN, 40s, 
           Commander of the 10th Infantry Battalion, wiry, good natured, 
           but tough as nails. Steel-rimmed glasses, covered with grime, 
           sit on his long and narrow face, and he pores over a map with 
           Abrams. He's from Spartanburg, South Carolina--with a big 
           Southern accent.

           As tough as Abrams and Cohens are, they look kind compared to 
           Major Stiller. And of course Patton inspires a bit of awe too. 

           Salutes all around.

                                 PATTON
                        Where's Baum?

                                 ABRAMS
                            (to Cohen)
                        Bring him in

           Baum is ushered in through a side door. To say he's surprised 
           is to understate considerably. Holy shit: General Patton. He 
           salutes. Takes in a deep breath.

           Abrams hands Patton a piece of paper: clearly the dossier on 
           Baum. Patton looks it over for a moment.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 PATTON
                        Captain Baum. You're one hell of an 
                        unusual officer...dropped out of a 
                        Bronx high school at 16 to work in 
                        a garment factory. Your folks lose 
                        their jobs?

           Baum nods.

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        God-damned Depression. 
                            (he glances at the paper)
                        No college degree. Didn't go to 
                        West Point. Enlisted under-age with 
                        parental consent. Note in the file 
                        from a training camp officer 
                        complaining about your lack of 
                        respect for authority. "A stubborn 
                        individualist," it says here.

           A pause. It's getting tense in this room--Patton seems to be 
           pointing out all of Baum's shortcomings. Abrams, Cohen and 
           Baum might as well be holding their breath.

                                 PATTON (CONT'D)
                        Vomited in front of your whole 
                        platoon during basic training. Then 
                        swore you'd never touch a never 
                        drop of alcohol until the war's 
                        over. Have you?

                                 BAUM
                        First and last time for everything, 
                        sir.

           Good answer. Patton understands.

                                 PATTON
                        History of clashes with superior 
                        officers in the European theater, 
                        including one whose attempt to 
                        court marshall you was over-ruled.

           Jesus. He's not sparing any of the gory details. And then 
           Patton grins.

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        You'll be perfect...I like a man 
                        who has a lot to prove.

           Baum breathes. 

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Now it's time for Patton to pay a compliment. We see yet 
           another reason why he's such a great leader: he pushes, 
           prods, screams, cajoles, flatters...whatever it takes to get 
           the most out of his men.

                                 PATTON (CONT'D)
                        You rose from private to captain in 
                        four years?
                            (doesn't wait for an 
                             answer)
                        I've been in this army one helluva 
                        a long time, and I don't believe 
                        I've ever seen that before. Well 
                        done, son.

           It has the desired effect on Baum. He's a proud man, but 
           never more so than now.

           And then Patton's back to the task at hand.

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        Captain, you've been picked to lead 
                        a task force. 

           ON STILLER, who suddenly realizes he's not leading this 
           mission. He's doing everything he can to hold in his anger. 
           It's not quite working.

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        Take it 60 miles east, to 
                        Hammelburg, liberate 200 POWS and 
                        bring them back.

           Baum stares at them, not sure if he's even allowed to speak. 
           But the daunting nature of the proposal compels him. Here's a 
           nice surprise: Baum may not have had many advantages growing 
           up, but he's really smart, and articulate.

           This is one charismatic, confident man.

                                 BAUM
                        Sir, that's an awfully long way for 
                        a task force. A mission like that 
                        really needs at least a combat 
                        command--

                                 ABRAMS
                        We've been down this road. We don't 
                        have 3,000 men. You've got 294. 
                        That's it.

           Baum looks at them, registering just how crazy this sounds.

                            (pacifying, points to map)
                        Intel reports almost no resistance 
                        in this area. The Germans aren't 
                        expecting us to come this way. And 
                        you'll have air support...weather 
                        permitting.

           Even Cohen knows this doesn't sound promising.

                                 ABRAMS
                        Are you up for leading this?

                                 BAUM
                        Of course, sir. But the whole 
                        brigade just came off 36 hours of 
                        hard fighting. There's thousands of 
                        guys out there who haven't slept.

                                 STILLER
                        Tough shit.

           They turn and look.

           Stiller grins back and it's more like a frown, his face 
           breaking into a map of hard lines and wrinkles.

                                 STILLER (CONT’D)
                        I haven't slept in three years.

                                 BAUM

                        Major Stiller. My aide.

           Baum looks at Abrams and Cohen, smelling something fishy; 
           they avert their eyes.

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        Very good, gentleman. I'll leave 
                        you to work out the details. 

           And he's out the door. Baum has a million questions running 
           through his head. Most of them are not encouraging.  

                                 BAUM
                        Sir, may I ask: why a POW camp? We 
                        came across one a few weeks back 
                        that had 5,000 men, and we went 
                        right by.

                        Abe, we're wasting time.

           Abrams gestures for everyone to follow him. They walk into:

           Baum takes his place between Abrams and Cohen, studying the 
           map on the wall with them.

                                 ABRAMS
                        Speed is the key. You'll have to 
                        get there and back before they can 
                        organize a defense. Ya got 24 
                        hours, max.

           The map is a complicated tangle of roads, rivers, bridges and 
           strategic points, heavily marked with military positions.

                                 ABRAMS (CONT’D)
                        Most of the German defenses are here, 
                        in Aschaffenburg. We're gonna help 
                        break you through the German line 
                        about a mile south of there, at a 
                        small town, Schweinheim. Intel says 
                        you might get a little flack in the 
                        center of town, but most likely 
                        you'll be through before they wake 
                        up. 

                                 BAUM
                        We can't go around?

                                 COHEN
                        It's the only road...unless you'd 
                        prefer to get bogged down in a 
                        muddy field?

           Cohen moves his finger along the map.

                                 COHEN (CONT’D)
                        Your first objective is finding the 
                        highway: 26. It's only eight miles 
                        from Schweinheim. It shouldn't be 
                        mined. If you can find that, you'll 
                        pick up good speed, and cruise all 
                        the way to Gemunden. After 
                        Gemunden, you'll need to find 
                        another highway: 27. It leads right 
                        to Hammelburg. At top speed, the 
                        whole run could be made in three 
                        hours.

                        I don't see the POW camp.

           Abrams and Cohen exchange a look.

                                 ABRAMS
                        We don't know where it is.

           Baum looks at them, dubious.

                                 STILLER
                        Find a local. Choke it out of him.

           They all turn and look; Stiller grins back.

           They turn back to the map.

                                 BAUM
                        All of these lines crossing 
                        Gemunden. I don't like it. Looks 
                        like rail lines. Could be a troop 
                        depot.

                                 ABRAMS
                        Intel says no resistance. You'll 
                        have to go on that.

           Baum points to the river.

                                 BAUM
                        Did they say anything about whether 
                        any of these bridges are still 
                        standing.

                                 COHEN
                        We don't know. 

           This gets worse by the minute. Baum paces the room, 
           thinking...and then he forges ahead.

                                 BAUM
                        You said 200 POWS?

                        OK. I'll need 30 half tracks to 
                        bring em back.

                                 COHEN
                        Done.

                                 BAUM
                        I'll need a company of tanks--light 
                        tanks to run point, and Shermans to 
                        blast through when we need to.

                        10 Shermans and 5 light tanks. 

           Baum stares back, not liking the sound of this, either.

                                 BAUM
                        I'll need heavy guns. 105s. At 
                        least 10 of them. Our Shermans 
                        can't beat those Tigers.

                                 COHEN
                        You got three.

           Baum's anxiety rises. He's covering the best he can, but this 
           is sounding really bad.

                                 BAUM
                        I'll need jeeps. For recon, and for

                                 COHEN

                        I can only spare 100.

                        That's not enough, sir. None of 
                        those vehicles can make it 60 miles 
                        and back without refueling.

                        That's all we've got. Find a way. 
                        Capture enemy vehicles--siphon.

           Baum's anxiety jumps another 10 points. How the hell is he 
           supposed to get this done?

           clamped down so hard on his cigar, and his hands are both

                        fueled, under-equipped task force 
                        60 miles behind enemy lines. You 
                        want me to travel unknown, unmarked 
                        roads--at night--and find a camp 
                        whose location we do not know, 
                        rescue 200 men, and return within 
                        24 hours--all with no divisional 
                        support. Is this correct, sir?

                        those bridges.

                                 BAUM
                        If there is one.

                                 STILLER
                        Sounds like fun, huh?

           They turn and look at him.

                                 STILLER (CONT’D)
                            (smiling)
                        Don't worry. I'm coming with ya.

                                 ABRAMS
                        Captain Baum is leading this task 
                        force. He gives the orders.

                        I'm not disputing that, sir. It's 
                        his show. I'm just coming along.

                                 COHEN
                        What for?

           Stiller breaks into an evil smile.

                                 STILLER
                        For the laughs.

           They stare at him, wondering if he's joking.

           He's not.

                                 STILLER (CONT’D)
                        You pull this off, Patton will give 
                        you the Congressional Medal of 
                        Honor.

                                 BAUM
                        You don't need to bribe me.

           The room is silent. Abrams and Cohen are now really 
           uncomfortable. Baum leads the way out of a tense situation. 
           He breaks into a grin.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        If I didn't know better, I'd say 
                        you boys were trying to get rid of 
                        me.

           On Stiller coming toward us in a hurry. He's trying to catch 
           up to the guy walking briskly in front of him--Baum.

           Now that they're out of earshot of senior brass, Stiller is 
           going to piss all over Baum.

                                 STILLER
                        Should we call your daddy and get 
                        permission for you to go on this 
                        mission too? 

           If Baum could kill Stiller right now, he would. But of course 
           he can't. Hitting an officer is an invitation to immediate 
           court martial. Baum needs to finesse his way into getting 
           some respect from Stiller, despite his youth.

                        We don't have a phone in our 
                        apartment: it's the Bronx. But you 
                        probably know that already from my 
                        file.

           Stiller acknowledges he's seen Baum's file with a nod. Baum 
           is thinking about just the right way to verbally counter-
           punch. And then he lands on it...

                                 BAUM (CONT'D)
                        One Sunday in the spring--must have 
                        been 1939--my father asks me to the 
                        come to the front window of our 
                        apartment. It was a beautiful day, 
                        except for one thing. We look down, 
                        and there's my older brother Bernie 
                        getting beat up--because he's 
                        Jewish.
                            (beat)
                        They're calling him "kike," hitting 
                        him in the head and kicking him, 
                        hard. It wasn't good. And the only 
                        thing my father says? "Don't ever 
                        let that happen to you."

           Baum's eyes are ablaze, piercing with intelligence and street 
           smarts. 

                                 BAUM (CONT'D)
                        My father was a giant of a man. So 
                        if I needed his permission to sign 
                        up because I wasn't yet 21, there's 
                        no shame in that; it's one of the 
                        proudest moments of my life.

           And now Baum gets right up in Stiller's face--he's 
           intimidating when he's mad.

                                 BAUM (CONT'D)
                        Just so we're clear: once we're 
                        behind enemy lines, I don't need 
                        permission to do anything from 
                        anybody, least of all from you.
                            (really threatening)
                        If I tell you to wipe my ass, you 
                        damn well better do it.

           Stiller gets the message. 
           EXT. SCHWEINHEIM SUNSET

           A huge convoy of German vehicles RUMBLES down the cobblestone 
           streets. At its head rides GERMAN SS MAJOR VON LAMBERT, 20s, 
           ruthless. He signals, and the convoy stops.

           Von lambert exits and a HALF DOZEN SS OFFICERS and A DOZEN SS 
           SOLDIERS exit with him. Von Lambert approaches a house, his 
           boots ECHOING off the cobblestone. He stops and looks up.

           A white flag hanging from a window is quickly pulled indoors.

           Von Lambert nods to a fellow Officer, who immediately runs 
           into the building with Another Officer.

           Von Lambert waits.

           FAINT SCREAMING, followed by the sound of people SCRAMBLING 
           DOWN STAIRS.

           In the doorway appear the two SS Officers, dragging TWO 
           ELDERLY GERMAN CITIZENS, a husband and wife. An SS Officer 
           holds up the white flag and hands it to Lambert, who looks at 
           it with disgust. The wife CRIES.

           Von Lambert steps up, calmly raises his gun and with TWO 
           QUICK SHOTS, shoots the Elderly Man and Woman dead.

           Von Lambert looks up, craning his neck around him.

           All of the town citizens watching from their windows 
           immediately retract their heads back into their homes.

                                 VON LAMBERT
                            (loudly)
                        Anyone who does not fight the 
                        Americans will be shot on sight.

           A NOISE, and Von Lambert turns. A group of TOWN CITIZENS, 
           including small boys and elderly men, approach.

                                 BOY
                        We will fight, sir!

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        Give us weapons.

           The crowd CHEERS, becoming more emphatic.

           Von Lambert smiles.

                                 VON LAMBERT
                        Distribute grenades and rifles.
           EXT. SCHWEINHEIM OUTSKIRTS DIRT ROAD SUNSET

           DOZENS OF U.S. SOLDIERS work getting the Sherman tanks ready, 
           tinkering beneath them, adjusting gun mechanisms.

           Baum walks quickly across rough terrain.  SERGEANT ELLIS 
           WISE, 20s, follows, hurrying to keep up. Wise has been with 
           Baum since they trained together in England. He's a brilliant 
           map reader--no small thing when you're in a foreign land 
           trying to find your way.

           Stiller is right behind them. Baum looks at him over his 
           shoulder, annoyed by his presence; but he lets it go, 
           realizing he won't shake him.

           EXT. SCHWEINHEIM OUTSKIRTS DIRT ROAD SUNSET

           SERGEANT CHARLES GRAHAM, mid 20s, sits atop his tank turret, 
           checking and re-checking the mounted machine gun atop his 
           gigantic 105mm Sherman tank. He holds up the ammo and lets it 
           fall gently in his hand, WHISTLING to himself. Here's an 
           unusual man--seriously battle hardened, and really happy 
           about it. Give him adversity, and he'll give you a smile. A 
           Southerner. He may have very little formal education. But 
           he's a brilliant technician who knows everything about his 
           machinery, can fix damn near anything. 

           Graham takes off his shirt and puts on a fresh one.

           TWO PRIVATES, 20s, watch him while scrubbing the sides of 
           their tanks with grease.

                                 PRIVATE 1
                        What's he doing?

                                 PRIVATE 2
                        In case he gets hit.

           Private 1 stares back, puzzled.

                                 PRIVATE 2 (CONT’D)
                        Your clothes are what they'll stuff 
                        into ya if ya get wounded. Dirty 
                        clothes infect a wound.
                            (beat, smiles)
                        Might make the difference in 
                        keeping that leg.

           Private 1 looks down at his leg. He turns pale.

           PAN TO: Baum, Wise, and Stiller walk quickly over a dirt road 
           and come upon the rear of the convoy.

                        sir. As you requested, Sergeant 
                        Graham is bringing up the rear. His 
                        three tanks are equipped with our 
                        heaviest artillery: 105s.

           A Soldier spots Baum's group and scrambles off his tank, at 
           attention. Others catch on and do the same. 

           Graham looks up from his guns, and slides down the tank. He 
           extends his hand, grinning. 

                                 BAUM

                            (serious southern drawl)
                        Wouldn't want to be anywhere else, 
                        sir. This beats the hell out of 
                        frying up short-orders at the Hotel 
                        Lexington grill.

           Baum laughs. 

                                 GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I heard you requested me, sir. I 
                        won't let you down.

                                 BAUM
                        Some fine machinery here, Sergeant.

                                 GRAHAM
                        You might want to try not being out 
                        in front of it for once, sir. In 
                        case you haven't heard, this god-
                        damn war is almost over. Be nice if 
                        you lived through it.

                            (smiles)
                        Nah, I'll just keep running around 
                        between the bullets.

           Graham laughs. Baum moves on. As Graham watches him go, a 
           Private approaches.

                                 PRIVATE 3

           Graham searches for the right way to say this.

                        Let's just say he's not the team-
                        building type.  More like he pushes 
                        himself to do the impossible. And

                        army. Got in so fast that the 
                        Seventh was pissed he crossed into 
                        their territory; Patton had to 
                        order him back. If they'd let him 
                        stay, they wouldn't have been

                        Private. Baum don't quit.

           EXT. SCHWEINHEIM OUTSKIRTS DIRT ROAD SUNSET

           Baum and his group approach the next set of vehicles: the 
           half tracks. They resemble massive pickup trucks, but are 
           white and over 20 feet long and able to hold about 15 men in 
           the back. On the hood of their cabs are mounted machine guns.

           DOZENS OF SOLDIERS form a line, loading drums of fuel and 
           shiny boxes of ammunition. Others sit patiently in the back, 
           waiting, rifles in hand. A few soldiers eat; some take trips 
           to piss. The air is tense.

                        The infantry and half tracks, sir,

           CAPTAIN ROBERT LANGE, 20s, new to this group and nervous 
           about it. He approaches, flanked by THREE SOLDIERS. They 
           salute and join Baum as he walks.

                                 BAUM

                        No leg stretching and no piss

           Baum reaches the Sherman tanks. Enormous, armed with 75mm 
           cannons, they make an impressive site. DOZENS OF SOLDIERS 
           crawl beneath, adjusting various mechanisms. Others sit on 
           the tanks, covering them like ants, checking their rifles.

           Baum, Wise and Stiller have reached a small hilltop, 
           overlooking the outskirts of Schweinheim. From here we can 
           see for miles: the small, German country towns and rolling 
           hills look idyllic in the sunset.

           Positioned about a half mile before them is a huge contingent 
           of U.S. tanks and troops, sitting quietly in an orchard, 
           waiting to attack Schweinheim.

                        how small we are. They'll send a 
                        battalion and have us surrounded 
                        within an hour. We don't have 24 
                        hours. We've got 10.

           Baum looks at his watch. The minute hand is approaching the 
           top of the hour--just about time to move out. He storms off 
           down the hill. Stiller follows, as usual.

                        doesn't mean he isn't an asshole.

           CAPTAIN RICHARD PANCAKE, 40s, a capable Captain from West 
           Virginia, turns toward us. He is surrounded by a contingent 
           of tanks, with INFANTRY milling about.

                        don't blast a clean hole through 
                        the line.  We have to be through 
                        this village in half an hour. Can 
                        you do it?

                        I can not be late.

           Baum turns and runs off.

           Pancake looks after him, wondering. He turns to his men.

                                 CAPTAIN PANCAKE
                        All right, you hot shots, light em up.

           A CACOPHONY OF TANK IGNITIONS.

           EXT. SCHWEINHEIM OUTSKIRTS HILLTOP SUNSET

           Just as Baum reaches his waiting men, a HUGE EXPLOSION forces 
           him to stumble.

           The sky lights up as dozens of U.S. tanks fire at the small 
           village of Schweinheim.

           EXT. SCHWEINHEIM NIGHT

           A horrific hail of FIRE from U.S. tanks lands squarely upon 
           the small village of Schweinheim.

           The corner of a building is BLOWN to pieces.

           A second story window is SMASHED.

           A massive church door is BLOWN to bits.

           The barrage dies down, and the night becomes eerily silent. 
           Smoke and dust linger in the air.

           Nine U.S. tanks break from the contingent and slowly advance.

           There is no reaction from Schweinheim whatsoever. All that 
           can be heard is the eerie SQUEAKING of the U.S. tanks, as 
           they inch their way forward.

           The tanks are almost upon the village when a GERMAN SOLDIER 
           appears in the middle of the road, popping up out of a hole 
           in the ground. With perfect discipline, he steadies himself 
           on one knee and calmly raises a Panzerfaust (a German 
           bazooka) to his shoulder. He takes aim and FIRES.

           INT. LEAD U.S. TANK NIGHT

           The driver spots the enemy, but too late.

           They all brace themselves.

           EXT. SCHWEINHEIM NIGHT

           The missile sails through the night and lands squarely on the 
           U.S. tank. A loud THUD. Beat. It EXPLODES.

           The tank catches fire and stops, blocking the narrow main 
           street. The entire U.S. motorcade is stuck behind it. 

           Suddenly, DOZENS OF GERMAN SOLDIERS poke rifles and machine 
           guns out of windows and cellar hatches, FIRING.

           Young men appear on rooftops, firing Panzers. Old women 
           appear at windows, dropping grenades.

           SEVERAL U.S. INFANTRY, accompanying the tanks, are hit. 
           Others take cover and return FIRE, but many Americans fall.

           EXT. SCHWEINEHIM OUTSKIRTS NIGHT

           Pancake stands in his jeep, watching the scene.

                                 CAPTAIN PANCAKE
                        Why the hell aren't they moving?

           Four out of the five soldiers in the tank are dead. The 
           fifth, bloody, moves to the steering wheel, shoves the tank 
           into gear and accelerates.

           A CHEER in the U.S. camp as they watch the tank move and the 
           road start to clear. Pancake chews roughly on his cigar.

           EXT. SCHWEINHEIM NIGHT

           The tank, still in flames, goes to the side of the road.

           The street is now clear. The other tankers advance, FIRING. 
           German soldiers start to fall.

           Grenades are dropped out of house windows on infantry.

           Baum stands in his jeep, watching through his binoculars. 

           On the horizon, the firefight continues to rage in 
           Schweinheim.

           Agitated, he checks his watch: 24:00. He snatches the CB from 
           Wise's hands.

                                 BAUM

           Baum hurls down the CB. He is red in the face. Major Stiller 
           comes up beside him.

           A backup platoon of U.S. tanks descends on Schweinheim, 
           FIRING. Buildings BLOW up. Germans fall.

           U.S. infantry pour into the scene, ahead of the tanks. They 
           run into the village, firing from the hip.

           But the fighting is bloody. The Germans shoot from well-
           concealed hiding places deep inside of narrow windows, houses 
           and alleyways. For every German that falls, a U.S. soldier 
           falls too. It is hand-to-hand.

           U.S. SOLDIER 1 removes a grenade from his vest and throws it 
           into a window. It EXPLODES. He removes another and throws it 
           into the second floor window. It EXPLODES.

           Stiller breaks into a grin. Baum may never give up thinking

           U.S. tanks and infantry hurry to the side of the narrow

           fall.

           A great noise GROWS on the horizon. The U.S. soldiers stop 
           and look up.

           Into the town of Schweinheim RUMBLES task force Baum, SIRENS 
           BLASTING. The convoy takes heavy FIRE.

           CONTINUED:

           The bullets mostly bounce off the armor, and the infantry 
           clinging to the tanks and on the half tracks manage to stay 
           mostly out of the line of fire. They're rolling through so 
           fast that little real damage is done. 

           Baum's jeep is almost out of the town now...

           Suddenly, a Panzerfaust WHISTLES through the night. The 
           rocket rings past Baum's head, missing him by a few feet.

           It smashes into a building, EXPLODING, sending shrapnel 
           everywhere.

           A soldier in Baum's jeep SCREAMS and clutches his face. Baum 
           reaches up and pulls back the soldier's hands: his face is 
           bloody. Shrapnel has torn it apart.

           The soldier falls, convulsing, in the back seat. 

                                 BAUM

                        We need a medic up here now!

           Baum holds the soldier's face, trying to staunch the blood. 
           The trauma prompts Baum to lose his composure for just a 
           second. He covers: 

                                 BAUM
                        You're gonna be all right.

           EXT. REAR OF CONVOY NIGHT

           Sergeant Graham rides in the open hatch of his tank. He spots 
           the source of the rocket fire: a lone GERMAN SOLDIER 
           positioned in a tower.

           Graham expertly positions his gun, taking his time. He FIRES, 
           holding with both hands as his machine gun shakes violently.

           The German falls from the tower, SCREAMING, and lands with a 
           THUD.

           Baum & Co roll out of town and into the countryside.

           EXT. FOREST ROAD NIGHT

           The convoy slows and the medic jeep pulls up next to Baum's 
           without stopping. So does Stiller's.

           Medic Zeno jumps down from his jeep and hops into Baum's.

           Baum shakes his head, and Zeno examines the dying Soldier.

           Zeno turns to Baum and shakes his head. Stiller eyes Baum 
           carefully, looking for a misstep.

                                 BAUM
                            (to Zeno)
                        Fix him up the best you can and 
                        leave him on the side of the road. 
                        Maybe the Germans will find him.

                                 ZENO
                        What if they don't?

           Baum and Zeno both know it's likely nobody will find this 
           soldier before he dies. But neither dares say it. 

           We see clearly in Baum's face that this is so wrong. War is 
           full of loss. But losing a man this way--because you're 
           forced to leave him like a dying dog on the side of the road-- 
           is completely unnecessary. 

           The moment has a surprisingly big impact on Baum: now more 
           than ever, he can see that it's not enough to fearlessly drag 
           his men into harm's way. He needs to protect them too. 

           Zeno picks up the soldier and exits the jeep. He lays him by 
           the side of the road, administering to him.

           Baum turns to Stiller.

                                 BAUM
                        You still here for "the laughs"?

           Stiller stares back, not giving Baum an inch.

           The convoy suddenly stops when it reaches a fork in the road. 
           HEAVY FIRE now rains on them from all sides.

           The hatch opens in the lead tank and out pops Graham, looking 
           from a crumpled map to the confusing, twisting streets.

           Baum pulls up beside them.

           Graham, confused, looks over to Baum. Baum, in turn, looks to 
           Wise, who rapidly scans his map.

                                 WISE
                        Right. I'd say right.

           CONTINUED: (2)

           The convoy comes back to life, making a sharp right.

           EXT. SCHWEINHEIM ELSEWHERE NIGHT

           The convoy makes a turn, and the countryside spreads before 
           them. They've made it.

           The infantry riding on the lead tanks CHEER, and the vehicles 
           behind them flash their lights and sound their HORNS.

           INT. BERLIN HEADQUARTERS MORNING

           A frantic control room. FOUR GERMAN OFFICERS AND SIX AIDES 
           rush about in every direction. Lights blink everywhere; 
           PHONES ring off the hook; maps are sprawled about on tables.

           A GERMAN COMMANDING GENERAL, 60s, stands holding the phone, 
           flanked by his subordinates. He removes his glasses, clearly 
           agitated, and hands the phone to his Aide.

           With a somber face he reaches across the map and moves 
           several small arrows across the German lines.

           The others look at him with grave expressions.

                                 COMMANDING GENERAL
                        Patton's broken through. It may be 
                        the entire Third Army.

                                 GERMAN GENERAL 1
                        But why there?

                                 COMMANDING GENERAL
                        He's positioning himself for 
                        Berlin. He's trying to flank us.

           He takes the icons representing German forces and positions 
           them south. His men look up.

                                 COMMANDING GENERAL (CONT’D)
                        We're going to meet them with the 
                        entire strength of the German army.

           EXT. HAMMELBURG TOWN NIGHT

           GERMAN HAUPTMANN KOEHL, 50s, a battle-scarred veteran, poorly 
           shaven, sits by himself on the porch of his barracks, awake 
           in the middle of the night, staring into space, smoking.

           An AIDE rushes to him, phone in hand. 

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Koehl takes it, listens, then hangs up. He gets up slowly and 
           heads to the door of the barracks, casually picking up a 
           metal garbage can and lid on the way.

           INT. HAMMELBURG BARRACKS NIGHT

           Koehl flips on the light, revealing rows of sleeping GERMAN 
           SOLDIERS--most of them really old, or really young. It's the 
           end of the war, and everyone's been drafted.

           Koehl holds out the metal can close to a soldier's ear and 
           SMASHES the metal lid into it.

           The Soldier jumps up in bed, as do all the others.

           Koehl has a huge, bloodthirsty smile on his face.

                                 KOEHL
                        The Americans are coming!

           Koehl seems to welcome the onslaught. His new recruits look 
           on in abject terror.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD OUTSIDE SCHWEINHEIM NIGHT

           It's QUIET now, the sirens cut off, and the terrain becomes 
           increasingly rural. The country road rises and falls as they 
           pass sprawling orchards and small farms. It is pitch black, 
           the night lit only by the headlights on Baum's vehicles.

           The convoy starts to slow, then comes to a stop.

           Baum stands in his jeep (we'll see this a lot--even in 
           battle). He signals to his driver and they pull out and speed 
           to the front.

           They screech to a stop beside the lead tank.

           Hoffner holds a flashlight to his map, confused.

                                 HOFFNER
                        It's not marked.

           They all get out and walk to the intersection. It is a giant 
           circle, roads leading out of it in every possible direction. 
           There are no signs.

           Stiller pulls up in his jeep beside them.

                                 STILLER
                        What's the story?

           CONTINUED:

           Baum ignores him, and instead steps forward and studies the 
           intersection, turning in place.

                                 WISE
                            (to Stiller)
                        We're looking for the main highway 
                        to Hammelburg, sir. Without it--

                                 BAUM
                        Without it, we're fucked.

           They all look back down at the map. It is old and 
           complicated, very hard to read. 

           Zeno and Demchak are close enough to overhear.

                                 ZENO
                        Ya know, I grew up there.

           Demchak looks at him.

                                 ZENO (CONT’D)
                        Hammelburg.

                                 DEMCHAK
                        No shit.

                                 ZENO
                        My people lived there 200 years--
                        then Hitler came to power and our 
                        neighbors suddenly hated us for 
                        being Jews.
                            (Beat)
                        Shit, it's like coming home. My 
                        father taught half the Germans 
                        around here how to shoot. That's 
                        what Hammelburg really is: a giant 
                        training ground. They use the whole 
                        area for target practice.
                            (beat)
                        I got a real bad feeling about 
                        this.

           Several beats. Baum & company are still looking at the maps. 
           There's no clear answer. Baum will have to go on a hunch.

                                 BAUM
                            (to Graham)
                        Back up your tanks and head left.

                                 STILLER
                        Shouldn't we send out recon first?

                            (to others)
                        Move out.

           They jump back in their jeeps, and the vehicles ROAR to life. 

           EXT. RURAL ROAD NIGHT

           Increasingly rough terrain, as the pitted road narrows. Baum 
           and Wise look out at the road, increasingly worried.

           A HONKING up ahead. A rough bump, and the terrain changes to 
           smooth pavement. A large sign reads: "26."

           Baum smiles.

                                 WISE
                        Good work, sir.

                                 BAUM
                        We're not there yet. Top speed.
                            (into radio)
                        Full speed ahead.

           All of the vehicles begin to gain speed.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS SMALL GERMAN VILLAGE NIGHT

           The convoy cruises at good speed. Suddenly, it slows.

                                 BAUM
                            (into CB)
                        What now?

                                 VOICEOVER
                        We're approaching a village, sir.

           Wise checks the map with the flashlight.

                                 BAUM
                            (into CB)
                        No slowing. Don't fire unless 
                        you're fired upon. Return fire on 
                        the run.

           The convoy gains speed again.

           EXT. GERMAN VILLAGE NIGHT

           The village is quiet. Baum studies the buildings. This town 
           looks exactly as sleepy as the last one did--and we know what 
           a nightmare that turned into. 

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           If Baum and everyone in the task force has a fair amount of 
           anxiety, we understand it completely. 

           Approaching the front of the village...

           ON BAUM...still all quiet from the village. Will the noise of 
           the American convoy wake the Germans? Are they already lying 
           in wait?

           The Americans blow through to the middle part of the village. 
           More vulnerable here than anywhere else. Baum damn near holds 
           his breath. But still no fire.

           They race through the far end of the village, and out into 
           the countryside again. Not a single shot fired. Relief all 
           around. That was better.

           EXT. RURAL ROAD DAWN

           First light appears on the horizon. Daybreak.

           The convoy ROARS on.

           Baum checks his watch:  0:500. He rubs his eyes, exhausted.

                                 NUTTO
                            (on the CB, false cheer)
                        Good morning, Captain Baum.

           Baum smiles. Nutto's great at breaking up tension.

                                 BAUM
                        What's so good about it?

                        You sure are cranky when you don't 
                        get enough sleep.

           Baum laughs.

           Nutto, riding in the open hatch, raises his binoculars.

           A convoy of ten German trucks heads toward them.

                                 NUTTO (CONT'D)
                            (down into tank)

           The cannons on the tanks swivel, and the infantry cock and 
           raise their rifles. 
           INT. U.S. TANK MORNING

           Nutto drops down into the tank. He grabs the CB.

                                 NUTTO
                            (into CB)
                        Sir, we've got enemy coming our 
                        way. At least ten vehicles. I can't 
                        tell if they know we're U.S.

           EXT. CONVOY MORNING

           Baum's raises his binoculars and studies them.

                                 BAUM
                        They don't.

                        Let em get close. Then fire at will.

           EXT. TANK MORNING

           Nutto watches with his binoculars.

           The tanks are 100 yards away and closing fast, their SOUND 
           rising. The Germans HONK twice, cheerily, as they approach.

           EXT. CONVOY MORNING

                                 BAUM
                        Not yet....

           EXT. TANK MORNING

           The tanks are yards away.

                                 NUTTO
                        Fire!

           A TREMENDOUS SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS, as the U.S. tanks FIRE 
           their cannon at point blank range into the convoy of trucks.

           The trucks are blown to bits, German soldiers falling out in 
           every direction.

           The U.S. infantry open fire and massacre whoever's left.

           A U.S. soldier in the rear suddenly stops firing.

           The German soldiers, now nearly all dead, are actually 
           teenage girls, dressed in German uniforms. They crawl, 
           bloody, their light blond hair spilling out from their caps.

           The U.S. Soldier leans over the side and VOMITS.
           EXT. CONVOY MORNING

           Baum's jeep passes, and he surveys the scene.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS GEMUNDEN MORNING

           The convoy rolling smoothly through the countryside, then 
           slows as it approaches a small city.

           This city is criss-crossed with railroad tracks and has a 
           river running through it. All the shutters are closed tight. 
           The SILENT town seems deserted in the early morning light.

           The men look slowly about, looking for a trap. Behind them, 
           on the horizon, black smoke rises in huge clouds.

                                 BAUM
                            (into CB)
                        Stop here.

           The entire convoy comes to a stop and they all survey the 
           bridge on the far side of the city. Lange comes up to Baum.

                                 LANGE
                        I'll cross first, sir.

                        I appreciate that, Lange. But we 
                        need tanks first. And recon before 
                        that. Hoffner!

           Hoffner comes running up.

                        Why are we stopping?

                                 BAUM
                            (not looking at him)
                        Recon.

                                 STILLER
                        What for? We're losing time. We 
                        have to take that bridge.

                                 BAUM
                        That's exactly what for. It could 
                        be mined.

                                 STILLER
                        There's no choice--it's the only 
                        way.

           Baum turns and stares Stiller down.

                                 BAUM
                        This is my task force, Major.

           Stiller stares back, but less defiantly this time. He's seen 
           Baum in action now, and is beginning to respect the man. Baum 
           senses this, opens up a bit.

                                 BAUM (CONT'D)
                        We've already lost the element of 
                        surprise...I never hated a sunrise 
                        more in my entire life.  
                            (beat)
                        So we definitely can't afford to 
                        lose this bridge. It's the only 
                        direct route to our target.

                                 STILLER
                        Fair enough.

           Baum is pleasantly surprised. Maybe he won't have to fight 
           Stiller the whole way to Hammelburg and back.

                                 BAUM
                        This whole thing makes zero sense 
                        to me. We are always asking men to 
                        take risks, but they are calculated 
                        risks. We know we have a chance.
                            (beat)
                        Who was asleep when they calculated 
                        these odds? 

           Stiller doesn't engage. In fact, he doesn't even look over to 
           Baum. Nonetheless, Baum keeps prodding, trying to get 
           something out of Patton's aide. 

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        The target is not militarily 
                        significant. We're seriously under-
                        manned. And we've gone in alone.
                            (beat)
                        Any time anyone goes behind enemy 
                        lines, the division follows, and in 
                        force. 

           Stiller has to acknowledge that Baum is right. He's also 
           mindful of all the men the task force has lost (and probably 
           will lose). Plus, they're a long way from the prying 
           oversight of General Patton. Stiller decides to trust Baum.

                                 STILLER
                        You ever heard of Lieutenant 
                        Colonel John Waters?

                                 BAUM
                            (impatient)
                        No. 

                                 STILLER
                        It's a name you won't want to 
                        forget...Patton's son in law.

           All of a sudden, the whole insane mission makes sense to 
           Baum. And yet, of course, it's senseless: hundreds of 
           soldier's lives are being seriously endangered to save one 
           man.  

                                 BAUM
                        You know him?

                        I was at the wedding.

           Baum deflates. He can't help it. Stiller notices.

                                 STILLER (CONT'D)
                        What are you gonna do about it?

                                 BAUM
                        I'm going to tell the men.

           Stiller is shocked. This just isn't done. Soldiers are given 
           orders. And those orders are to be followed. Rationales and 
           reasons: those are things to be kept among commanders.

                                 STILLER
                        What?

                                 BAUM
                        The war will be over in a month--
                        two at the most, right?

           Stiller agrees.

                                 BAUM (CONT'D)
                        So that makes this the worst 
                        mission at the worst possible time. 
                        They won't quit, but--for what 
                        they're going through--they deserve 
                        to know.

                                                     CUT TO:

           The camera takes Baum's point of view, panning across his key 
           men. Clearly he's just told them the truth:

           ON LANGE: in shock

           ON HOFFNER: unhappy, but too exhausted to summon a strong 
           reaction.

           ON WISE: unbe-fuckin-lievable.

           ON GRAHAM: ready to shoot someone.

           And then to...

                        If Stiller was in Texas right now, 
                        I'd make sure he got the death 
                        penalty.

           Graham pulls out his pistol and cocks it.

                                 GRAHAM
                        We don't have to go to Texas to get 
                        that done.

           The men laugh.

                                 BAUM
                        This is the mission we've been 
                        given. I know you all will help me 
                        get it done.

           And with that, the bond of trust between Baum and his men is 
           sealed. 

           EXT. GEMUNDEN BRIDGE MORNING

           Hoffner's jeep crawls forward, two other jeeps beside him. 
           They stop about twenty yards short of the bridge.

           He gets out and his men follow, hurrying to the side of the 
           road.

                                 SOLDIER1
                        Looks clear, sir.

                                 HOFFNER
                        It's not.
                            (points)
                        There.

           In the dirt at the base of the bridge is a slight bulge.

                                 HOFFNER (CONT’D)
                        Mined.

           The Recon Soldiers all stare.

                                 HOFFNER (CONT’D)
                        We could shoot them from here. But 
                        it would ruin the road. We'll have 
                        to pry them out.

           The Recon Soldiers look terrified.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                            (points)
                        You two with me. These mines are 
                        sturdy, but not that stable. Grab 
                        em hard and quick. Use both hands. 
                        Take em to the side of the road and 
                        hurl em down that ravine.

           The Two Recon Soldiers stare, swallowing.

                                 HOFFNER (CONT’D)
                        The rest of you provide suppressing 
                        fire, and throw these.
                            (handing it to them)
                        Smoke grenades. Don't stop throwing 
                        until we're back. Let's move.

           Hoffner rises, hurling a smoke grenade far into the bridge.

           It lands with a HOLLOW THUD. Smoke begins to pour out of it.

           Hoffner runs for the bridge, followed by Soldiers 1 and 2.

           The other Recon Soldiers throw smoke grenades furiously. When 
           they're empty-handed, they raise their rifles and begin to 
           fire at the structure at the far side of the bridge.

           Hoffner and his men squat in the middle of the road, prying 
           the round, heavy mines from the dirt.

           Suddenly, German FIRE begins to hail down on them.

           Recon Soldier 1 stops, raises his rifle and takes aim.

                                 HOFFNER (CONT’D)
                        Leave it! Deal with the mines.

           Recon Soldier 1 re-straps his rifle, flinching every time a 
           bullet whizes by; with shaking hands, he pries at the mines.

           The Other Recon Soldiers FIRE back at the structures. 

           Hoffner finally extracts a mine. Holding it with both hands, 
           he runs awkwardly to the side of the road and hurls it down 
           the ravine. It EXPLODES.

           He runs back to work on the next one, but the smoke's 
           beginning to lift.

                                 HOFFNER (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn it, more smoke!

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           The Other Soldiers nervously reach down and fumble with their 
           smoke grenades. One of them drops his.

           Soldier1 SCREAMS and falls. He's hit. The German fire 
           INTENSIFIES.

           Baum pulls up to the base of the bridge. He immediately 
           surveys the situation and jumps out and runs, under FIRE, to 
           Hoffner and his men.

           Baum runs up next to Hoffner, takes a knee and quickly pries 
           out a mine. He hurries to the side of the ravine and chucks 
           it. It EXPLODES.

           Hoffner pries loose the last one, and does the same. EXPLOSION.

           Baum grabs the wounded soldier by the shirt collar and pulls 
           him as they all run back to the jeeps.

                                 BAUM
                        I got you, soldier!

           This is a welcome change in Baum--definitely an improvement 
           over the expected "get your ass back in the god-damn vehicle, 
           soldier." Several men notice the difference.

           Hoffner has seen Baum's bravery before--and always admired 
           him. But he likes the team approach even better. 

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                            (to Hoffner)
                        Take positions on the side of the 
                        road and pin down the enemy.

                                 HOFFNER
                        Yes, sir.

                        Lange: Get your infantry up here!

           EXT. CONVOY ELSEWHERE MORNING

           Lange puts down the CB, looking very pale.

                                 LANGE
                        Shit. It's always us.

           EXT. GEMUNDEN BRIDGE MORNING

           Stiller hurries over to Baum, grabs his arm and pulls him 
           aside.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                        Don't you pull a stunt like that 
                        again, Captain. You are Commander 
                        of this mission, not a recon 
                        soldier.

           Baum knows Stiller is right. But he's been up front the whole 
           war. Nobody, least of all Baum, is at all confident that he 
           can lead any other way.

           The tanks RUMBLE UP. Baum walks forward and waves them on. 
           Nutto's Sherman tanks RUMBLE towards the large bridge, joined 
           by Lange's company of INFANTRY, who walk cautiously, rifles 
           raised, alongside the tanks.

           The Shermans reach the bridge and begin to cross. Nutto, 
           bringing up the rear, just reaches the base of the bridge. He 
           rides in the open hatch, and looks out.

           Many large buildings sit on the other side. But, ominously, 
           no sign of life. 

           The tanks crawl across the bridge, SQUEAKING.

           PANZERFAUST FIRE. German rockets explode all around the 
           Americans. Several infantry fall, wounded and dead. Worse, 
           the lead tank is hit. It burns and blocks the way.

           Dozens of German troops now pour out of the buildings.

                                 NUTTO
                        Holy shit.

           Several U.S. SOLDIERS scurry out of the lead tank, all 
           bleeding and dazed, abandoning it.

           The burning tank has created a bottleneck effect--the rest of 
           the convoy is stuck, sitting ducks.

           Lange, though, continues forward and waves his men on, 
           continuing fearlessly forward.

                                 LANGE
                        MOVE!

           Lange's infantry keep moving under his leadership, continuing 
           to cross the bridge on foot under HEAVY FIRE and without 
           without the protection of the tanks.

           But the German FIRE is too intense, and they begin to fall.

           Nutto jumps down and grabs a retreating U.S. Soldier.

           The Soldier runs past a disbelieving Nutto.

           EXPLOSION. Baum and Nutto are both blown off their feet.

           They both lie on the ground, covered in blood.

           A wounded Baum struggles to his knees and stares at his right 
           hand in disbelief. A huge piece of shrapnel sticks all the 
           way through it, cutting it to the bone.

           Medics Zeno and Demchak rush to Baum and Nutto's side.

           Baum holds up his bloody and shaking hand.

                                 BAUM
                            (through clenched teeth)
                        Yank it out.

                                 ZENO
                        Sir?

                                 BAUM
                        Do it!

           Zeno pauses, then reaches down and with one hand on Baum's 
           shoulder, yanks the shrapnel out.

           Baum SCREAMS, and Zeno wraps the bleeding hand in bandages. 
           Baum slowly breathes.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        Good. Now get me on my feet.

           Zeno places a hand under Baum's shoulder and yanks him to his 
           feet. Baum reels in pain and looks down to see another piece 
           of shrapnel has gone through his right knee, to the bone.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        Again.

           Zeno gives Baum a worried look, then sinks to his knees and 
           grabs the piece of Shrapnel. Wise comes up behind Baum and 
           holds him steady.

           Zeno yanks. Baum SHRIEKS. Zeno wraps the bleeding knee.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Baum is unsteady, but standing. He gets control of his 
           breathing, then looks over and sees Nutto on the ground, 
           Demchak by his side.

                                 DEMCHAK
                        He's hit bad, sir. I count ten 
                        pieces of shrapnel, at least.

           Baum crouches down by him. Nutto has shrapnel in his legs, 
           his arms, his chest and his neck. It doesn't look good, and 
           Nutto can see the look in Baum's eyes.

           Nutto tries to cover a rising concern that he's about to die. 
           Ever the ladies man:

                                 NUTTO
                        Damn it, I never screwed a girl 
                        with big tits.

           Baum laughs in spite of everything.

                                 BAUM
                        If that's your motivation, you're 
                        gonna live.

           Baum lifts him up by his shoulders. Nutto tries to walk--it's 
           not going well. Blood oozes out from under his combat jacket.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        You've had enough.
                            (to Demchak)
                        Get him back to the half tracks.

           The German FIRE intensifies, and Baum surveys the bridge, and 
           sees some of the infantry have managed to cross it.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        Where the goddamn hell is our air 
                        support?

           As if in answer to the question, Germans toss grenades out of 
           nearby buildings (from the upper floors). They land amidst 
           the task force. More carnage. 

       64A
           INT. TANK NIGHT
                                                                    64A

           Four U.S. tank crew members hear the grenade EXPLOSIONS, 
           which sound exactly like...

                                 TANKER
                        PANZERFAUST! EVACUATE!

           The Americans climb out of the tank as fast as they can go.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

           As soon as they touch ground, a German soldier appears in a 
           second-floor window. He jumps down onto the tank. Jumps in. 
           Slams the lid tight.

           The German turns the US tank turret around--and starts firing 
           on the Americans with their own tank!

           This lasts for about a minute before the Americans blow the 
           tank to bits. 

           And that's when things get really bad: Suddenly, the entire 
           bridge BLOWS UP!

           Several U.S. Infantry fly through the air, instantly dead, 
           and the three tanks on the bridge plunge into the ravine, 
           with several more Infantry SCREAMING on the way down.

           There is a momentary lull in the fighting, everyone in shock.

                                 BAUM 
                        DISENGAGE! 500 yards back! 
                            (to Wise)
                        Get me a goddamn prisoner! Go into 
                        homes if you have to.

           EXT. FAR SIDE OF GEMUNDEN BRIDGE DAY

           A dozen American infantry find themselves completely 
           surrounded by three times as many German Soldiers, guns 
           pointed at them. Realizing the futility, they raise their 
           hands in surrender.

           EXT. MID CONVOY DAY

           Baum stands beside his jeep, a map laid out in front of him. 
           He bleeds all over the map, clearly in pain.

           Stiller studies the map with him, while Zeno looks worriedly 
           at Baum's hand.

                                 ZENO
                            (softly, to Baum)
                        You've lost a lot of blood, sir. 
                        You need medical attention. If you 
                        continue in this condition you'll 
                        risk damaging your nerve endings--

                                 BAUM
                            (ignoring him, looking at 
                             map)
                        There's no other bridge on this 
                        map. How can there be no other 
                        bridge?

           CONTINUED:

                                 ZENO

                                 BAUM
                            (wheels, annoyed)
                        I heard you, and I don't quit.

           Wise and THREE U.S. SOLDIERS approach, dragging a GERMAN 
           CIVILIAN.

                                 U.S. SOLDIER
                        We broke into a house and dragged 
                        him out. As far as we know, he 
                        wasn't engaged in the fighting.

           Baum looks at the German viciously; Baum seems a little crazy-
           -his wounds and exhaustion have gotten to him. He gets close 
           to the German.

                                 BAUM
                        What is this place? A marshalling 
                        yard?

           Zeno TRANSLATES. The terrified German answers in a rush.

                                 ZENO
                            (straining to understand)
                        This is where they drop off the 
                        soldiers...they come by train...

                                 BAUM
                        How many?

           The German speaks quickly.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                            (more firmly)
                        How many soldiers are on the other 
                        side of that river?

                                 ZENO
                        This is where they come together--

                                 BAUM
                        HOW MANY!?

                                 ZENO
                            (beat)
                        Ten thousand.

           Baum and Stiller exchange a look. There is a moment of 
           paralyzing silence.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 BAUM
                        Where's another bridge?

           Zeno repeats in German. The terrified German answers in a 
           rush, clearly protesting his ignorance.

                                 ZENO
                        He says he doesn't know of any 
                        bridge...the bridge was in this 
                        town...we destroyed it...he is 
                        peaceful...not a fighter--

                                 BAUM
                        Aw, Christ--

           Baum pulls out his pistol, COCKS it and holds it to the 
           German's face.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        WHERE THE GODDAMN HELL IS A 
                        BRIDGE!?!?

           The Civilian is visibly shaking.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        WHERE!?!?

           Baum's eyes are bulging open; he seems as if he's lost it.

           Beat. A heavy, tense silence.

           The German, crying, feebly points north.

                                 GERMAN CIVILIAN
                        ...Burgsinn.

           The German collapses to the ground, crying.

           Baum quickly turns to the map and traces it with his finger.

                                 BAUM
                        Burgsinn....It's ten miles north.

           Baum turns to the German.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        You better not be jerking us off. 
                        If you are, so help me god, I'll 
                        shoot you myself.
                            (to Wise)
                        Tie him to a tank.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Baum hurries off towards his jeep, flanked by his men, 
           BARKING orders as he goes.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        I want this entire convoy backed up 
                        200 yards. All men inside the half-
                        tracks, ready or not.

           Wise comes up beside Baum.

                                 WISE
                            (softly)
                        Sir. Ten thousand.

           Baum doesn't curse out Wise, which is almost certainly what 
           he would have done in the past. He's holding his temper, 
           searching for a solution.

                                 BAUM
                        This is not a kamikaze run, 
                        Lieutenant. We'll fail if we don't 
                        find a way to protect ourselves.

           Wise appreciates Baum's new approach: this kind of leadership 
           cements loyalty. 

           INT. PATTONS' HEADQUARTERS DAY

           A flurry of activity. Blinking lights and RINGING phones 
           everywhere. Aides rush about, answering phones, carrying 
           papers, hanging new maps and taking down old ones.

           Patton stands over a map table, flanked by Six Aides. He 
           looks distracted.

                                 PATTON AIDE 1
                        Sir, both divisions are on a 
                        collision course. If we don't do 
                        something by--

                                 PATTON
                            (turns to other Aide)
                        Tell me, Major, what have you heard 
                        from Task Force Baum?

           The Aides around the table look at each other; they fall 
           silent.

                                 PATTON AIDE 2
                        Nothing, sir.

           Beat.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        We have received reports of enemy 
                        movement in that area.

                                 PATTON
                        What kind of movement?

           The Aides look at each other, afraid to say it.

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        Well!?

                                 PATTON AIDE 2
                        A division, sir.  Maybe two.

           Very bad news. Patton stares into space, ignoring all the 
           activity around him.

           EXT. ROAD TO BURGSINN DAY

           The convoy climbs a steep road, flanked by dense, dark woods. 
           The tanks GROAN as the incline gets steeper.

           The light tanks lead the way, and tied to the front sits the 
           German Civilian, hanging on for dear life, looking terrified.

           The column nears the top of the hill when suddenly a small 
           caravan of official-looking German cars appears. They stop 
           short at the sight of the Americans.

           The lead tank stops, and Sergeant Graham pops his head out of 
           the hatch. The entire convoy grinds to a halt behind him.

           Before them sit two German jeeps and a long black limousine, 
           covered with swastikas. The German soldier in the lead jeep, 
           young and nervous, raises his rifle.

           Graham smiles. He casually moves his fixed machine gun side 
           to side, gesturing as if to say anything other than surrender 
           would be a bad idea.

           The German drops his gun and raises his arms.

           The door opens to the German vehicle, and out comes a GERMAN 
           GENERAL 2, dressed in a long, black leather coat with Nazi 
           insignias and medals. He slams the door, BARKING REPRIMANDS 
           at his men, and removes his gray gloves and haughtily 
           approaches Baum's contingent.

           Baum pulls up.

           The General, upon seeing Baum, walks right up to him, YELLING 
           indignantly in German.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                        He says he demands to speak to the 
                        commanding officer...he expects 
                        treatment befitting his rank...he 
                        is one of The Fuhrer's personal--

                                 BAUM
                        I'm not interested.

           The General falls silent.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                            (to Graham)
                        Mount him as a hood ornament. Maybe 
                        the Germans will think twice before 
                        shooting.

                                 GRAHAM
                            (smiling)
                        Yes, sir.

           Baum approaches the German civilian tied to the tank.

                                 BAUM
                            (to Civilian)
                        This goddamn bridge of yours better 
                        come soon.

           The Civilian looks more scared than before.

           Graham's men grab the arms of the indignant General and place 
           him squarely on the front of the tank, tying him down.

           The General is shocked. He looks over, and sees beside him 
           the German civilian. The Civilian smiles and salutes weakly.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS BURGSINN DAY

           The convoy continues on the narrow, rural road.

           Suddenly, the Civilian SPEAKS excitedly in German, pointing.

           In the distance, behind a crop of trees, covered in moss, 
           lies a small, ancient bridge.

           Graham breaks into a huge smile.

           The Civilian is also smiling. The German General turns to the 
           Civilian, scorning, and slaps him with his glove. The 
           Civilian is at first shocked. Then he reaches back and slaps 
           back the General, who is even more shocked.

           They come to a stop before the small, stone bridge.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Baum pulls up and walks onto the bridge. The convoy watches.

                                 BAUM
                        Get Lieutenant Wrolson up here.

           Wise rushes off.

           Baum walks up and down the bridge, inspecting it.

           A jeep pulls up and Wrolson jumps out and runs to Baum.

           Wrolson looks closely at the bridge. He takes several steps 
           backward, looking from side to side. He scurries down the 
           bank of the river, and examines it from below.

           The underside of the bridge hangs with moss.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        Will it hold?

                                 WROLSON
                        The jeeps and half tracks will be 
                        fine. Light tanks, too. It's the 
                        Shermans I'm worried about.
                            (beat)
                        It's a risk.

                                 BAUM
                        How much of a risk?

                                 WROLSON
                        Hard to say. Depends on the support 
                        beams. They look sturdy, but with 
                        this kind of growth, it's 
                        impossible to tell.

           Baum takes another look up and down the bridge.

           Sitting on the far side is a small sign: "Hammelburg, 17k."

           Baum comes to a decision.

                                 BAUM
                        Get the Shermans up here.

           Graham's tanks move to the side, making room for the six 
           heavy Sherman tanks, which RUMBLE forward.

           Nutto, wounded, bleeding, wrapped in bandages, pops his head 
           out of the open hatch of the lead tank. 

           Baum is shocked. Nutto smiles.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 NUTTO
                        Couldn't let you boys have all the 
                        fun.

           Baum shakes his head in admiration.

                                 BAUM
                        Send one of your men across first.

                                 NUTTO
                        That'll be me.

           Despite Baum's protest, Nutto's own tank rolls forward, he 
           smiling as it RUMBLES across. The bridge GROANS and bends in 
           protest, and the entire convoy watches in suspense. Beat.

           But it keeps going. Soon, it is over the bridge.

           The entire convoy CHEERS.

                                 BAUM
                        All right, move it out. One at a time.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD DAY

           The vehicles rise and fall on a small country road. Up and 
           down rolling hills, they pass farms and endless cows.

           As they come to the top of a hill, they see a small country 
           village spread out before them.

           EXT. GRAFENDORF DAY

           They approach to an odd sight: 30 RUSSIAN SOLDIERS work the 
           fields with hoes, guarded by a DOZEN GERMAN GUARDS. The 
           Russians are emaciated and sickly, dressed in rags. Baum has 
           seen a lot in this war. But this hits him hard.

           They all stop and stare up at the Americans.

           When they see the size of the American force, the German 
           Guards lower their weapons and raise their hands.

           Baum pulls to the front. Stiller does, too.

                                 BAUM
                            (to Zeno)
                        Tell them to drop their weapons.

                                 ZENO
                            (using a loud speaker, in 
                             German)
                        Drop your weapons.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The German guards do as they're told.

           As freedom dawns on them, the Russian POWS break into a SHOUT 
           OF JOY. They run for the Americans, grabbing and kissing them.

           The Americans are at first shocked, then smile back, trying 
           to politely fend off the emotional Russians.

                                 RUSSIANS
                        Amerikanski! Amerikanski!

           The German Guards turn and begin to run for the forest.

           Several Russians chase after them, hoes held high.

           The Russians speak effusively to Baum.

                                 ZENO
                            (to Baum)
                        They say they want to help 
                        us...they hate the Germans...they 
                        want to fight....weapons....

                                 BAUM
                        Tell them to raid the local police 
                        station and do whatever damage they 
                        can.

           Zeno translates. The Russians say something back.

                                 ZENO
                        They want the General.

           Baum looks over at the German General.

           The German General scowls back at him.

           Baum grabs him by the collar and hurls him off the tank.

           The Russians CHEER, grabbing at the General.

                                 BAUM
                            (to German civilian)
                        How far to Hammelburg?

                                 ZENO
                        Past Grafendorf...about 7 kilos.

           Zeno turns to Baum, smiling.

                                 ZENO (CONT’D)
                        I think we might actually make it.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Baum smiles. He agrees. 

           The German civilian says something to Zeno.

                                 ZENO (CONT'D)
                            (to Baum)
                        Sir, he says his wife is very 
                        pregnant, due any day now. And he 
                        promises to keep our secret.

                                 BAUM
                        Boy or girl?

           The German seems to understand this.

                                 GERMAN CIVILIAN
                        Junge.

                                 BAUM 
                            (nods)
                        If the SS finds out what he's done, 
                        they'll kill him, his wife and his 
                        unborn son.
                            (beat)
                        Let him go.

           Zeno unties the German Civilian, who nods in thanks and runs 
           off.

           The convoy ROARS back to life. The Russians cheer. As his 
           jeep departs, Baum turns back to see the Russians beating the 
           shit out of the German general. Given everything the Germans 
           did to the Russians in the last four years, this particular 
           dose of Russian rage is understandable. But that doesn't make 
           it pretty. The German general is on the ground now--getting 
           kicked visciously from all sides. A Russian raises a hoe and 
           brings it down into the General's skull. War is indeed hell.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE BEYOND GRAFENDORF DAY

           They enter thicker and thicker countryside.

           Baum watches the woods carefully, when suddenly his jeep 
           SLAMS to a stop. He hits his head hard on the windshield.

                                 BAUM
                        What the hell!?

                                 WISE
                        I don't know, sir. There must be--

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                            (raising his hand)
                        Wait!

           Baum cranes his neck, listening. A FAINT ROAR.

           On the horizon, a tiny German plane comes into view.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                            (screams)
                        SPOTTER PLANE!

           From the tankers to the infantry to the wounded, every man 
           raises his gun and FIRES at the approaching plane.

           But the weaving plane flies too high, and is going too fast. 
           They all miss. A black and white cross can be seen beneath 
           the plane's wings as it flies off into the horizon.

           Baum is crestfallen. Stiller pulls up beside him.

                                 STILLER
                        Now they know how small we are.

                                 BAUM
                            (irritated)
                        They don't need a plane for that. 
                        Now they know where we are.

           They ponder the ramifications, none of them good.

           INT. GERMAN COMMAND POST NEAR HAMMELBURG DAY

           The room is frantic with activity, AIDES rushing about, 
           answering PHONES. OBERST HOPPE, a German officer in his 40s 
           with a youthful face, intense eyes and thin lips, is in 
           charge. He stands calmly amidst the chaos, scanning a large 
           map laid out on a table. Several AIDES stand beside him and 
           look down as Hoppe rests his finger on a spot. Hoppe puts a 
           marker--a small U.S. flag--in the place. There are a string 
           of U.S. markers across the map, starting from Schweinheim.

                                 HOPPE AIDE1
                        It could be a reconnaissance 
                        mission.

                                 HOPPE AIDE2
                        Perhaps they are spearheading a 
                        second front.

                                 HOPPE AIDE1
                        It looks like they are heading 
                        North.

           CONTINUED:

           Hoppe stares. They all look at him, waiting.

                                 HOPPE
                        No.
                            (beat)
                        They're not heading North. They went 
                        North because they couldn't find a 
                        bridge. They're heading East. 

           All eyes look east. Hoppe runs his finger along the map.

                                 HOPPE (CONT’D)
                        They're coming here.

                                 AIDE2
                        But why?

                                 HOPPE
                        Call up a division from Gemunden. 
                        Have them coordinate positions with 
                        the division Berlin ordered. We 
                        will completely encircle the 
                        Hammelburg area. 
                            (beat)
                        Patton might beat us to Hammelburg, 
                        but there's no way he's getting 
                        out.

           The Aides hurry off. Hoppe turns to the window and stares out 
           the glass.

                                 HOPPE (CONT’D)
                            (to himself)

                            (shakes his head)
                        Suicide!

           EXT. GERMAN COUNTRYSIDE AFTERNOON

           Baum's convoy continues up and down rolling country hills. As 
           they dip down another hill, the CAMERA CRANES UP TO REVEAL:

           On the horizon, THOUSANDS OF GERMAN SOLDIERS and hundreds of 
           tanks mobilize in a massive column, slowly but surely heading 
           south.

           EXT. HAMMELBURG VILLAGE AFTERNOON

           Koehl inspects his company of FIFTY GERMAN SOLDIERS, who 
           stand at attention in front of their tanks. Koehl walks up 
           and down the line slowly, looking them over from head to toe: 
           scared, lanky teenage boys, dressed in uniforms too big for 
           them, with shocks of blond hair. 

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           And very old men: in their 70s. This is the desperation that 
           comes with the end of a war.

           In the background, DOZENS OF HAMMELBURG CIVILIANS run through 
           the streets, hurrying into buildings and closing doors and 
           windows tight behind them. The town bell RINGS as the streets 
           empty out.

           Koehl is oblivious, focusing on his men.

                                 KOEHL
                        Many of you have never seen battle. 
                        But I know your hearts. They are 
                        the same hearts that have lead 
                        Germany to victory for 2,000 years. 
                            (beat)
                        Today will be a day you shall look 
                        back on and say: even in our 
                        darkest hour, even as the 
                        Fatherland buckled under the wave 
                        of Americans, one village had the 
                        courage to make a stand.

           EXT. GERMAN COUNTRYSIDE AFTERNOON

           The convoy reaches the top of a hill and stops. 

           Baum pulls to the front and raises his binoculars.

           The idyllic, empty town of Hammelburg lies stretched out 
           before them. On the horizon sits the enormous white cross we 
           saw at the beginning of the film. The view is commanding.

           Graham pops out of the hatch in the tank beside him. Stiller 
           pulls up.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Where's the camp, sir?

           Baum lowers his binoculars and points to a small dirt road 
           leading out of town. On top of a far hill sits a massive 
           barbed-wire fence guarding the Hammelburg POW camp.

                                 STILLER
                        Town's quiet. Think it's a trap?

                                 BAUM
                        Yes. 
                            (beat)
                        But we've got no choice.

           The tanks RUMBLE back to life, and start down the hill.
           INT. KOEHL'S TANK HAMMELBURG AFTERNOON

           Koehl sits in his tank, sweating, watching Baum's convoy 
           approach. Beside him, on their guns, sit THREE TEENAGE GERMAN 
           SOLDIERS, sweating and nervous.

                                 KOEHL

           Baum looks about warily as the convoy approaches the town.

           The poorly-greased white star of a Sherman comes into view. 
           The long German 88mm cannon SWIVELS into place.

                                 TEENAGE GERMAN SOLDIER
                            (nervous, whispering)
                        Hauptmann Koehl? What did you do 
                        before the war?

                                 KOEHL
                        I was a priest.
                            (screams)
                        FIRE!

           Koehl braces himself and his Gunner pulls back the firing 
           mechanism. It EXPLODES with a ROAR, and the kickback knocks 
           the unprepared Teenage Soldier off his feet.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE AFTERNOON

           The German shell lands 20 feet short of the first American 
           tank, sending mounds of earth high in the air and showering 
           the U.S. tanks with dirt.

           The convoy grinds to a sudden halt.

           He SLAPS the closest German Soldier hard on the head.
           INT. POW BARRACKS AFTERNOON

           DOZENS OF POWS, including Baron, race to the windows at the 
           sound of the explosions, pressing up against the glass.

                                 BARON
                        They're coming for us!

           The whole room CHEERS.

           INT. VON GOECKEL'S OFFICE HAMMELBURG MORNING

           Waters is lead into a large General's office, the walls 
           covered with German memorabilia. Von Goeckel sits behind his 
           desk, looking old and worn out. 

           Waters notices that something is different: Goeckel's steel 
           helmet now sits on his desk, and he wears a Luger on his hip. 
           The door is CLOSED behind them, leaving just the two of them.

                                 VON GOECKEL
                            (softly)
                        Sit, please.

           Waters sits.

                        Not many Generals are assigned to 
                        administer prisoner camps--
                        especially in a desperate Germany. 
                        Haven't you wondered?

                                 WATERS
                        I did. But I didn't think it fit to 
                        ask.

                                 VON GOECKEL
                        It's my lung. A chest wound in the 
                        trenches of World War One. I've 
                        been assigned to desk duty ever

                        I've served my army 37 years, and

                        governments come and go in that 
                        time. And yet I'm still here.

           He smiles weakly, and Waters back.

                                 VON GOECKEL (CONT’D)
                        This government, too, has numbered 
                        days. Yet I don't think I shall 
                        survive this time.

                        Army our way?

           Waters doesn't know what to say.

           Von Goeckel suddenly stands and puts on his helmet.

                                 VON GOECKEL (CONT’D)
                            (formally)
                        I shall be sounding the air raid 
                        sirens shortly. I advise you to 
                        prepare your men. The Americans 
                        will be firing in your direction, 
                        too, when they fire at us.

           Von Goeckel steps in close.

                                 VON GOECKEL (CONT’D)
                            (softer)
                        You are my prisoner now, but very 
                        shortly I may be yours. If that 
                        should happen, I hope I could 
                        expect the same courtesy and 
                        respect I have shown you.

           Beat. Von Goeckel raises his hand in a salute. 

           Waters, instead, extends his hand. Von Goeckel slowly reaches 
           out and takes it.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE AFTERNOON

           Baum, using his binoculars, spots the hidden German tanks in 
           the forest.

                                 BAUM

                        jeeps up that hill. Go straight for 
                        the camp. Shermans in the lead--
                        now! Graham: take out that 
                        sonofabitch. 

           The vehicles in Baum's convoy re-align in new formation. The 
           heavy Sherman tanks ROLL to the front, face off against the 
           German tanks. The rest of the convoy--several half-tracks, 
           light tanks and jeeps--fork away from the battle and head up 
           the steep hill, straight for the Hammelburg POW camp.

           CONTINUED:

           A Sherman FIRES at the lead German tank, and it's a direct 
           hit. 

           But the shell merely BOUNCES off the thicker German armor.

           Baum's face drops in disbelief.

           The German tank swings its massive 88mm cannon. It FIRES back 
           and hits the Sherman, which EXPLODES.

           FIVE AMERICAN SOLDIERS jump out of the burning tank. They run 
           several yards, on fire and SCREAMING, then collapse.

           INT. KOEHL'S TANK HAMMELBURG AFTERNOON

           Graham, riding in the open hatch, stops at the top of a knoll 
           and raises his binoculars.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Range 1,000 yards. Fire at will.

           The huge cannon on his tank SWIVELS into place. It FIRES.

           Smoke shells EXPLODE in front of the German tanks, creating a 
           dense fog.

           The other U.S. tanks use the cover to get into position. 
           German shells EXPLODE all around them.

           Baum has had enough: every request he makes for air support 
           through morse code signals via Sidles is getting them 
           nowhere. He opts for risky, direct radio contact. And he's 
           screaming. We can only hear his side of the conversation.

                        power, god-damn it.

           He slams down the receiver.

           The Soldiers around Baum look at each other, their 
           expressions showing that, for the first time, they realize 
           the air support will not come.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE AFTERNOON

           The smoke lifts, and the Germans FIRE again. A direct hit: 
           another Sherman EXPLODES.

           A Sherman FIRES back. Again, it's a direct hit, but again the 
           shell merely BOUNCES off the thicker German tank.

           An EXPLOSION comes from the other direction and Baum turns to 
           see one of his half-tracks on the hill on fire. He wheels and 
           sees a German tank pointing its cannon in that direction.

           EXT. ELSEWHERE COUNTRYSIDE AFTERNOON

           Lange is seated in the passenger seat, rifle raised, FIRING, 
           as his half-track races up the hill, swerving left and right, 
           narrowly avoiding EXPLOSIONS. 

           Lange stands in his seat and aims his rifle.

           EXPLOSION. Lange's half-track is blown on its side, sending 
           him and all his men in the back flying hard onto the ground. 
           Many are dead on impact. Lange is unconscious and bloody.

           beside the wounded Americans.

           Suddenly, FIRE hails down on them from the top of the hill. 

           TWO HUNDRED GERMAN SOLDIERS, positioned at the base of the 
           Hammelburg POW camp, fire down.

           Zeno and Demchak ignore the bullets, crouching low and 
           attending to as many wounded as they can.

           give him a shot of morphine, and raise his head and give him 
           a sulfur tablet with water. Then they move on.

           With several vehicles on fire and caught in a crossfire, the 
           convoy heading up the hill grinds to a halt. Most of the 
           infantry jump out and take positions on the ground. Some fire 
           up the hill at the Germans. A few turn and fire helplessly 
           back at the German tanks.

           EXT. HILLSIDE AFTERNOON

           They take off up the hill, amidst EXPLODING German shells.

           They pull up alongside a U.S. soldier who sits beside a half-
           track, cowering, holding his helmet with both hands.

           Stiller is with him--providing cover in the thick of the 
           action--shooting back for all he's worth.

           Baum jumps out and runs up beside the soldier.

           Baum grabs the Soldier and runs with him back into the cab of 
           a half-track. The soldier starts it and drives up the hill.

           Suddenly a German shell hits the half-track carrying the 
           gasoline, and there is a TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION, knocking Baum 
           back off his feet. 

           Dazed, covered in soot, Baum gets back on his feet and 
           continues up the hill; he hurries to an abandoned jeep and 
           grabs the CB.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        Graham! Take out those goddamn tanks!

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE AFTERNOON

           Graham needs no prodding; he has just finished positioning 
           his canon and FIRES one of his monstrous 105mm shells.

           It connects with a German tank, which EXPLODES.

           Graham FIRES again, and another German tank EXPLODES.

           INT. POW BARRACKS AFTERNOON

           The POWs cheer.

           EXT. HILLSIDE AFTERNOON

                                 BAUM
                            (into CB)
                        Graham! Three O'Clock!

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE AFTERNOON

           Graham turns and sees a convoy of German supply vehicles, 
           heading for the German tanks.

           Graham repositions his cannon. He FIRES.

           A German gas truck EXPLODES which a tremendous shock wave, 
           causing all six German vehicles to EXPLODE. AMMUNITION goes 
           off in every direction.

           INT. KOEHL'S TANK HAMMELBURG AFTERNOON

           Koehl, dripping with sweat, contorts with rage.

                                 KOEHL
                        Sheisse! SHEISSE!!!!
           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE AFTERNOON

                                 BAUM
                            (voiceover)
                        Graham! We need you up here now!

           Graham FIRES several smoke missiles, creating a large cloud 
           in front of the German tanks, and then turns for the hill.

           Left behind in the carnage are five smoldering Sherman tanks 
           and dozens of U.S. bodies.

           INT. KOEHL'S TANK HAMMELBURG AFTERNOON

           The Teenage German Soldiers interpret Graham's retreat as a 
           victory, and CHEER, joyously grabbing each other.

           The battle over for now, Koehl sits back and with shaking 
           hands takes out a pack of crumpled cigarettes. He fumbles to 
           get one out and lights up, exhaling deeply. Surveying the 
           damage, he allows himself a small smile.

           INT. POW BARRACKS AFTERNOON

           Artillery SMASHES a piece of the wall, sending shrapnel 
           everywhere. Several POWS take cover; Waters stands at the 
           window, and merely flinches.

           The door flies open, and in marches General Von Goeckel with 
           his aide, HAUPTMAN FUCHS.

                                 VON GOECKEL
                        The Americans will kill us all! You 
                        must stop them!

                                 WATERS
                        How?

                                 VON GOECKEL
                        It is against the rules of the 
                        Geneva Convention to fire on a POW 
                        camp!

                                 WATERS
                        Then surrender.

                                 VON GOECKEL
                        I am surrendering. To you.
                            (removes holster and gun 
                             and hands it to him)
                        I am your prisoner. The camp is in 
                        your control. This is now your 
                        responsibility.

           An EXPLOSION shakes the building.

                                 U.S. OFFICER
                        We'll get killed if we go out there!

           The Americans all look at each other, unsure what to do. 
           Waters is the only one who lacks uncertainty. His job is to 
           save lives, even if it means risking his own. 

                                 WATERS
                        I'll go.

           He begins to head out of the room. One American (POW 6) 
           stands to join him.

                                 FUCHS
                        I'll go too.

           Waters wonders: can he be trusted?

                                 FUCHS (CONT’D)
                        You'll need a translater. 
                        Otherwise, they'll shoot you. 

           Waters removes a hidden American flag from under one of the 
           bunks, and they head out.

           EXT. POW CAMP LATE AFTERNOON

           Waters, Fuchs and one pow march through the camp, shells 
           EXPLODING all around them, Waters clutching the American flag.

           In the distance looms the huge barbed-wire fence, with 200 
           GERMAN SOLDIERS dug in, firing at the Americans.

           Suddenly, a GERMAN SOLDIER marches directly towards them. He 
           SCREAMS IN GERMAN at Waters, and raises his rifle. Waters 
           holds up the flag to indicate they are on a peaceful mission.

           The Soldier suddenly raises his rifle and FIRES at Waters, 
           hitting him point blank. Waters goes flying backwards through 
           the air and lands on his back.

           The Soldier now turns to Fuchs. Fuchs is terrified. He 
           SCREAMS frantically back at the Soldier in German. The 
           Soldier finally lowers his gun.

           Fuchs and POW 6 run over to Waters, who is bleeding badly 
           from the leg. POW 6 staunches the wound as best he can.

                                 FUCHS
                        We must turn back. This Soldier is 
                        out of his mind.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Fuchs and the POW each grab Waters and carry him towards the 
           barracks. The American flag lies abandoned on the ground, 
           covered in blood.

           EXT. HILLSIDE SUNSET

           The U.S. convoy is still stuck on the hill, under withering 
           FIRE, with infantry still scattered about, out of their 
           vehicles.

           Baum runs up the hill, grabbing infantry by the arms and 
           prodding them; he guides about a dozen soldiers into the back 
           of a half track. Baum then jumps into the cab, starts it up 
           himself, and PEELS OUT, speeding straight for the POW fence.

           FIRE intensifies on both sides as Baum leads the charge, the 
           soldiers in the back FIRING like crazy. Soldiers all up and 
           down the hill see what Baum's doing, and they rally, all 
           suddenly charging, too.

           Suddenly, there is a huge EXPLOSION in the POW camp and 
           several GERMAN SOLDIERS go flying in the air, dead.

           Graham and his 105s have arrived. They are spread out, in 
           desert formation, with packs of infantry clustering behind 
           them. Weaver's tanks join them, and they all fire into the 
           POW camp. 

           EXPLOSION after EXPLOSION.

                                 GRAHAM'S AIDE
                        Almost out of ammo, sir.

                                 GRAHAM
                            (smiling)
                        This war's too damn short! FIRE!

           He loads a huge shell into the 105mm cannon, aims and fires.

           OMITTED

           EXT. HILLSIDE SUNSET

           Baum drives his half-track right into the barbed-wire fence, 
           soldiers FIRING point blank at each other. The massive fence 
           bends, but won't give.

           Graham's tanks pull up beside him, and together, they mow 
           down the fence.

           The remaining German Soldiers run, but don't get very far. 
           Most are shot in the back.
           INT. POW BARRACKS SUNSET

           A great CHEER, and all the POWs storm out.

           EXT. POW CAMP SUNSET

           The American POWs come running out. A few of them grab rifles 
           off the dead bodies and FIRE at the fleeing Germans.

           The rest of them are CHEERING WILDLY, storming the American 
           forces. They crawl all over the tanks, and jump into jeeps. 
           They hug and kiss every American soldier they can find.

           The American soldiers are at first pleasantly surprised, but 
           then completely overwhelmed: they are so swarmed with 
           prisoners, they literally cannot move.

           A major logjam, with nearly 1,500 POWs descending on the 
           small task force.

           The Nazi flag is hastily lowered, and the American flag (the 
           same bloody one left behind when Waters was wounded, is 
           raised on the pole).

           INT. MESS HALL SUNSET

           Some POWs storm the kitchen. A lone GERMAN CHEF, 50s, tries 
           to keep them back, but they beat him down.

           They grab box after box of food--rations, medical supplies, 
           canned foods, red cross packages. They throw them around, 
           tear them open and eat what they can on the spot.

           EXT. POW CAMP SUNSET

           Baum's jeep pulls up into the mayhem, Stiller beside him.

           Baum stands in his jeep. Stiller does, too. They are both 
           horrified by the number of prisoners--and by their condition.

                                 BAUM
                            (yelling over the din)
                        200 prisoners? There's more than a 
                        thousand here. 

           Baum is nearly sick over this situation: the impossibility of 
           success just became all the more clear.  

                                 STILLER

                        How do you propose we get all these 
                        men back? When we had all our 
                        vehicles--which we don't--we had 
                        room for 200.

                                 STILLER
                        They can walk.

                                 BAUM
                        No they can't. Look at them.

                                 STILLER
                            (shrugs)
                        Then they'll have to stay.

           POWs rush their jeeps, hugging them. The POWs are 
           frighteningly skinny, their faces starved and covered in 
           blisters.

           Stiller jumps down from his jeep.

                                 BAUM
                        You're sure you'll recognize him?

                                 STILLER
                        I'll find him.

           Stiller marches off into the mayhem, elbowing his way through 
           the crowd. This time, Baum follows. 

           Stiller grabs a POW by the arm.

                                 STILLER (CONT’D)

                        No idea, Major. Ya got any 
                        cigarettes?

           Stiller brushes him aside and grabs another one.

           INT. POW CAMP OFFICER BARRACKS NIGHT

           Stiller rushes into the room, and is shocked at the sight.

           On an operating table lies Colonel Waters, blood everywhere, 
           unconscious. MAJOR ALBERT BERNDT, 37, an orthopedic surgeon 
           from Portsmouth, Pennsylvania, stands over him, having just 
           sowed up his leg. He looks up at Stiller.

           Beat.

                                 STILLER
                            (to Baum)
                        That's him.

           Baum is horrified: all this way to rescue a man who's about 
           to die before their eyes.  

           Stiller is equally on edge.

                                 STILLER (CONT’D)
                        Will he make it?

           A very long pause.

                                 BERNDT
                        I don't know.

                                 STILLER
                        What are the odds?

                                 BERNDT
                        It's difficult to say.

           Clearly, it's difficult because Berndt isn't at all confident 
           that Waters will survive.

                                 STILLER
                            (screaming)
                        God-damn it--I'm getting a 
                        prognosis out of you if it's the 
                        last thing you do in this life!

           Berndt is shocked by the outburst. But he knows he had better 
           say something specific. 

                                 BERNDT
                        An inch higher and he would've lost 
                        the leg--and perhaps his life--on 
                        the spot. He's lucky. But he's 
                        still bad off. There's a serious 
                        risk of infection.

           Stiller deflates. It's much worse than he thought.

                        How soon can we move him?

                                 BERNDT
                        You move him now, and you're 
                        signing his death certificate. If 
                        he pulls through...he can't be 
                        moved for at least a week. 

           Stiller's face drops. Baum looks even worse.

           EXT. POW CAMP ELSEWHERE NIGHT

           Baum jumps up on the hood of a jeep, surrounded by hundreds 
           of POWs. The crowd QUIETS.

                                 BAUM
                        We've fought for 24 hours straight 
                        to get to you. 

           The crowd CHEERS.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        We lost a lot of good soldiers on 
                        the way. We also lost a lot of 
                        vehicles. And unfortunately, the 
                        Third Army is not right behind us. 

           He points west.

                        They're about 60 miles that way.

           The crowd of POWs suddenly realizes: this isn't the end of

                        fight our way out. 

           Baum steps down from the jeep, and there is general confusion 
           and chaos, as the POWS MUMBLE amongst themselves.

           Baron and FOUR POWs huddle.

                                 POW 4
                        You gonna fight?

                                 BARON
                        Hell yes.

                                 POW 5
                        That's nuts. You'll get killed.

                                 BARON
                        They came all this way for us--I'm 
                        gonna help em make it back.

           HUNDREDS OF POWS storm the tanks, fighting for a spot. 

           Baron finds a spot on top of one of the lead tanks. His 
           friend, POW 4, is stuck in the mass of bodies below; Baron 
           reaches down and helps him up.

           At the same time, hundreds of the weaker prisoners file back 
           into the camp. They're heeding Baum's suggestion: if they 
           want to live, they had better stay put.

           Baum heads to his jeep and lays out his map on the hood with 
           his bandaged hand. His surviving officers--Stiller, Graham, 
           Nutto, and Hoffner--come up beside him. Wise is there too.

           A NOISE, and from the other direction a badly wounded Captain 
           Lange approaches, limping. They all turn and look, as if 
           staring at a ghost.

           Baum shakes his head in admiration.

                                 BAUM
                        Good to have you back.

           Baum puts his arm around Lange's shoulders. The difference in 
           Baum's behavior isn't huge, but the impact on the men is. 

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                            (checks his watch)
                        We lost a lot of time here: four 
                        hours at least. And if we stick 
                        around much longer, we're gonna be 
                        slaughtered.
                            (turns to the map)
                        We've got to get back to that 
                        highway. It's our only chance of 
                        gaining enough speed. There are 
                        only two ways there: one is here--
                        South--the other, North.

                                 STILLER
                        North is closer.

                                 BAUM
                        True. But we can't go back the way 
                        we came. The enemy will be dug in. 
                        We're going South. And we're 
                        sending recon first--

                                 STILLER
                        There's no time for recon--

                                 BAUM
                        We got no choice. We can't afford a 
                        firefight at night. Look at those 
                        half-tracks and tanks. They're 
                        covered with prisoners. We'd lose 
                        every one of them.

           Nobody's arguing with that sound logic. Not even Stiller, who 
           used to torture him just "for the laughs" has come to truly 
           respect Baum.

                        and probe South. Hoffner, go with

           Baum salutes with pride, and Lange returns it.

           The POWs swarm the tanks, which are now dangerously 
           overcrowded. On one tank, the cannon cannot even move because 
           so many POWs block its path.

           EXT, SOUTHERN ROAD FROM HAMMELBURG - NIGHT

           Nutto, in his tank, and Hoffner and Lange, in their jeeps, 
           lead the mini convoy of three tanks, jeeps and half-tracks.

           EXT. SOUTHERN VILLAGE NEAR HAMMELBURG NIGHT

           Hoffner approaches a small village and stops at the 
           periphery, cutting the ignition. He stares.

           A huge roadblock, with overturned trucks blocking the narrow 
           road. The village itself is eerily quiet.

                                 HOFFNER
                            (whispering to his driver)
                        There.

           His Driver squints into the blackness and finally sees it: 
           several German tanks lie hidden at the side of the road, 
           covered in camouflage, their cannons pointing at the road.

           Hoffner gestures, and his driver STARTS the jeep and makes a 
           U-turn, keeping the headlights off.

           Baum sits on the hood of his jeep, waiting. He is beyond 
           exhaustion; his eyes close as he sits.

           Suddenly, the faint ROAR of vehicles. Baum's eyes open wide.

           The convoy pulls up in front of Baum. Nutto, Hoffner and 
           Lange hurry over, and Baum jumps off the hood. Several 
           Officers and POWs crowd around to listen.

                        OK. We go North.

                        can find any smaller roads 
                        connecting to the highway--hell, go

                        Yes, sir.

           They hurry back to their vehicles and the mini convoy ROARS 
           off into the darkness, in the opposite direction.

           Hundreds of POWs mill about, clearly disappointed.

           Nutto and Hoffner approach a village. Nutto and Lange wait,

           Hoffner pulls up and stops: roadblock.

           EXT. NORTHERN COUNTRYSIDE NEAR HAMMELBURG NIGHT

           Hoffner and his driver bounce along the rough road, the 
           terrain rising and falling. They finally reach a small 
           hillside, and look out and see the highway in the distance.

           Hoffner breaks into a smile. He picks up the CB.

           Everyone scrambles to find a spot on their vehicles, and the

           Baum's jeep pulls out in front, and they all follow.

           EXT. NORTHERN COUNTRYSIDE NEAR HAMMELBURG NIGHT

           Nutto's convoy--six tanks and six half-tracks--wait with 
           Hoffner. Nutto stands on his tank and faces his men.

           A TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION.

           Nutto, Hoffner and Lange are all knocked off their feet and 
           fly through the air. They both land hard, ten feet away, 
           unconscious.

           CANNON FIRE from Koehl's hidden tanks pounds the convoy.

           Within seconds, three American tanks are on fire.

           DOZENS OF POWS are sent flying into the air, landing hard, 
           most of them dead on impact.

           The Americans slowly gain their wits, and one or two tankers 
           aim their cannon and return fire. 

           Baron grabs a rifle from a fallen soldier, takes aim and 
           FIRES back.

           But the Americans are outmatched by the heavy German armor. 
           The few hits they manage bounce right off the German tanks.
           INT. TANK NORTHERN COUNTRYSIDE NEAR HAMMELBURG NIGHT

           Koehl, face covered in sweat, CHEERS madly with his CREW.

           EXT. NORTHERN COUNTRYSIDE NEAR HAMMELBURG NIGHT

           Baum pulls up over a hill and sees the fight on the horizon, 
           the night lit up with flames, his men being decimated.

           He slams on his brakes, and the entire convoy comes to a 
           hasty stop behind him.

                                 BAUM
                            (into CB)
                        Nutto! Hoffner!

           EXT. NORTHERN COUNTRYSIDE NEAR HAMMELBURG NIGHT

           Hoffner sits unconscious in his jeep, his driver dead beside 
           him.

           Baron runs to the jeep, dodging FIRE, and grabs the CB.

                                 BARON
                        They're hit, sir!

                                 BAUM
                            (voiceover)
                        Disengage! Get those men back here!

           Baron runs amidst the mayhem.

                                 BARON
                            (screaming)
                        Disengage! Baum's orders!

           EXT. NORTHERN COUNTRYSIDE NEAR HAMMELBURG NIGHT

           Baum watches as his force slowly and awkwardly starts to 
           retreat on the horizon and head back in his direction.

           He stares, crestfallen. Beside him, Wise waits with his map 
           spread out. Baum snaps out of it and looks at the map.

           Stiller pulls up beside them.

                                 STILLER
                        Where to now?

                                 BAUM
                            (looking at the map)
                        All the roads are blocked.

                        We're gonna have to go cross-
                        country, and that's impossible at 
                        night.
                            (beat)
                        We're gonna take the high ground, 
                        regroup, and take off again at 
                        first light. There's a hill back 
                        that way. Hill 427. Follow me.

           Baum makes a U-turn, and his jeep races ahead. Stiller and 
           the convoy begin to awkwardly make U-turns and follow.

           EXT. HILL 427 LATER THAT NIGHT

           The wounded American soldiers MOAN as they are attended by 
           medics Zeno and Demchak, who dole out shots of morphine and 
           sulfur tablets. With Stiller, Graham, Wise, Moses, Weaver and 
           Wrolson by his side, Baum surveys the rows of wounded, laid 
           out beside each other neatly on the grass. Behind him, high 
           up on the hill, is the enormous white cross we saw at the 
           beginning.

           He stops beside Lange, who is badly injured, bloody and 
           barely conscious. Baum kneels down and holds his hand.

                                 LANGE
                            (smiling weakly)
                        Not bad for my first day, huh, 
                        Captain?

                                 BAUM
                        You've got more heart than any vet 
                        I've known.

           Baum's eyes well up as Lange passes out.

           Baum steels himself. He stands and faces the others.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        Put all the wounded in that barn 
                        and put a red cross on the roof.

                                 ZENO
                        Yes, sir.

           Baum helps all the healthy men carry injured soldiers into 
           the barn. 

           Baum surveys the rest of the force. Only 3 medium tanks, 3 
           jeeps, and 12 half-tracks remain of Task Force Baum. Of the 
           original 294 soldiers, there are only about 80 left. Some 
           check their weapons, some sit dejectedly, nursing wounds; 
           most sleep where they sit.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Milling among them are about 30 POWs, all that's left of the 
           70 that came with the task force. Three POWs suddenly stand 
           and take off into the wood. Baum addresses his troops.

                                 BAUM
                        We leave at first light, heading 
                        due west across country. And we're 
                        not stopping until we find that 
                        highway.

                                 WISE
                        Sir, we still won't have enough gas 
                        to make it back.

           Baum looks back at him, glassy-eyed from exhaustion.

                                 BAUM
                        That's what war's all about, 
                        Sergeant.

           EXT. WITH COLONEL KOEHL - NIGHT

           An German aide rushes up to Colonel Koehl with a piece of 
           paper.

                                 KOEHL'S AIDE
                        They have retreated to hill 427, 
                        sir.

           Koehl looks over the piece of paper and smiles. He turns to 
           his map, and moves dozens of red arrows around a tiny spot, 
           in the center of which sits one tiny blue arrow.

                                 KOEHL
                        Our firing range.
                            (smiles)
                        They're finished.

           EXT. HILL 427 PRE-DAWN

           A German tank quietly rolls its way through the woods, 
           followed by 10 German tanks.

           INT. TANK HILL 427 PRE-DAWN

           Koehl drives the lead tank, the Three Soldiers by his side.

           EXT. HILL 427 DAYBREAK

           Baum stands in his jeep, watching the sun break over the 
           horizon.

           CONTINUED:

           All his men sit at the ready in their vehicles.Baum raises 
           his hand slowly, then brings it down. All the vehicles START 
           UP WITH A ROAR.

           INT. TANK HILL 427 DAYBREAK

                                 KOEHL
                        FIRE!

           EXT. HILL 427 DAYBREAK

           RAPID CANNON FIRE hits the Americans from every direction. 
           It's a mix of tanks and more than 30 teenage German soldiers 
           each with his own Panzerfaust. They have completely 
           surrounded the Americans, and they all FIRE simultaneously.

           A WALL OF FIRE.

           Within seconds, one American vehicle after another is blown 
           to bits. American soldiers and POWs go flying in the air, 
           dead and wounded in every direction.

           The barn, filled with American wounded, is BLOWN UP.

           Baum raises his rifle and FIRES back. Stiller raises his 
           pistol and FIRES, too.

           Graham stands atop his tank, manning his machinegun with both 
           hands, FIRING for all he's worth. His tank FIRES its 105mm 
           canons, causing some damage on the German side.

                                 GRAHAM
                            (screams, smiling)
                        They've got us surrounded again-- 
                        the poor bastards!

           An American machinegunner FIRES back, but within seconds is 
           blown away.

           Baron and several POWs take positions behind vehicles and 
           FIRE back.

           The fire is so intense that an enormous tree is cut cleanly 
           in half. It falls with a CRASH onto the battlefield.

                                 BAUM
                            (to Sidles)
                        Goddamnn it, radio air support!

           Sidles, sitting beside Baum, taps his Morse Code furiously.

           Baum turns and finds Wise, right beside him, has been shot; 
           he's unconscious.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Baum quickly turns and surveys the scene. Only about thirty 
           men are left fighting. The rest are dead or wounded. The 
           entire hill is on fire. It looks like Armageddon.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                            (shouting)
                        Retreat! Into the woods!

           The Americans run for the woods. Baum, runs, too, limping 
           badly, joined by Stiller, Sidles and several others.

           Baum turns and sees Graham, alone, still atop his tank and 
           FIRING, smiling.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                            (turning and screaming)
                        Goddamn it, Graham, retreat!

           Graham keeps FIRING. Suddenly, a shell EXPLODES near him, 
           knocking him off his tank and onto the ground.

           Dazed, he gets up, grabs a rifle, and takes off for the 
           woods.

           INT. TANK HILL 427 DAYBREAK

           Koehl and his men CHEER, hugging each other.

           EXT. WOODS NEAR 427 DAYBREAK

           Roughly two dozen U.S. soldiers converge around Baum, shells 
           EXPLODING all around them.

                                 BAUM
                        Break into groups of three. Fan 
                        out. Head West.

           They all sprint into the woods, in small groups. Baum takes 
           off, too, limping, joined by Stiller and Sidles.

           EXT. WOODS NEAR 427 MORNING

           Three U.S. Soldiers sprint up a hill. 

           At the base of the hill, a GERMAN OFFICER appears, flanked by 
           SIX GERMAN SOLDIERS and TWO BARKING DOGS.

           One of the German Soldiers raises his rifle and takes aim at 
           the fleeing Americans.

           The German Officer puts his hand on the Soldier's rifle and 
           forcibly lowers it. The Soldier turns and looks at him.

                        Send in the dogs.

           They let loose the BARKING German Shepherds.

           The Shepherds sprint up the hill, chasing the Americans down. 
           One of them bites an American's leg. He falls.

           The other two soldiers stop and try to pull off the dog.

                                 GERMAN SOLDIER
                        Halt!

           The Three soldiers look up and see A DOZEN GERMAN SOLDIERS 
           looming over them.

           They raise their hands in surrender.

           EXT. HILL 427 MORNING

           Baron and TWO OTHER POWS race down a wooded hill, towards a 
           stream. They stop short at the periphery, glancing warily at 
           the open space.

           They all decide to run for it, and burst out of the woods.

           They run across the stream, legs SPLASHING.

                                 VOICE
                            (screaming)
                        AMERIKANER! AMERIKANER!

           They look over and see TWO GERMAN CHILDREN running across a 
           small bridge, for the woods, and pointing in their direction.

           Suddenly, THREE GERMAN SOLDIERS appear from out of the woods. 
           They casually approach, rifles raised.

           Baron and the others stop mid stream and raise their hands.

           EXT. WOODS NEAR 427 MORNING

           Graham sprints through the woods with THREE OTHER AMERICAN 
           SOLDIERS, the sound of BARKING DOGS growing louder.

           They all suddenly stop short. They stand on the precipice of 
           a steep ravine.

                                 SOLDIER1
                        What now?

                        It's too steep. We won't make it.

           Graham starts to scramble down the steep cliff, rocks 
           crumbling. The angle is so steep, he slides more than climbs.

           The Three Soldiers look at each other then all at once run in 
           the opposite direction, up the hill.

           A SQUAD OF GERMANS with dogs appear, and bears down on the 
           three men. One of them FIRES a warning shot.

           The three men stop and raise their hands.

           Graham, unseen, clings to the side of the cliff.

           EXT. WOODS NEAR 427 MORNING

           Baum, Stiller and Sidles race through the woods, Baum 
           limping, the sound of BARKING DOGS closing in.

           A SQUAD OF GERMANS appears on the horizon, and all three dive 
           into the dirt. They lie frozen as the Germans come close.

           The Germans get to within feet of them, then keep walking. 

           The three of them exchange a look, then slowly rise to their 
           knees. Stiller snatches Baum's dogtags from his neck and 
           hurls them into the forest. Baum looks at him, shocked.
           CLICK.

           They look up and see THREE GERMAN SOLDIERS standing over 
           them. GERMAN1 has his pistol raised and pointed.

           Stiller and Sidles slowly raise their hands.

           Baum, though, reaches for his .45, but his hand is too 
           heavily bandaged now to get it.

           German 1 FIRES. Baum is shot, and is knocked on his back. The 
           bullet tore away his fly and cut through his inner thigh. 
           Blood pours from his leg.

                                 BAUM
                        You son of a bitch. You shot my

           German 1 LAUGHS.

           Zeno races through the forest with TWO OTHER AMERICAN 
           SOLDIERS. They suddenly stop short, as they run into THREE 
           GERMAN SOLDIERS with their rifles raised and aimed. Zeno and

                        Zeno?

           Zeno stares back, slowly comprehending.

                                 ZENO
                        Ralph?

                        You know this guy?

           Zeno and Ralph stare at each other, shocked.

                                 ZENO
                        From high school.

           German 3 walks up to American 1 and examines his dogtags.

           Ralph steps up and tears off Zeno's dogtags. He pretends to 
           examine them.

                                 RALPH
                            (to German 3)

           German 3 looks at Ralph suspiciously, then moves on.

           EXT. HILL 427 DAY

           Zeno and Ralph sit together on the hood of a jeep, Ralph 
           smoking and relaxed, Zeno looking devastated. They look out 
           at the carnage before them: the field is still on fire, and 
           corpses lie everywhere.

                                 RALPH
                        What made you do all of this?

           Zeno shakes his head, and stares with a vacant, hollow stare.

                                 ZENO
                        I wish I knew.

           INT. BARN DAY

           Baum lies on the floor of a barn, in a long row of wounded 
           bodies. Beside him sits Stiller. At this point, there's no 
           tension between them. They've been through hell together. 
           Stiller finally decides to ask the question he's been curious 
           about since they met.

                                 STILLER
                            (quietly)
                        You know what's amazing to me? You 
                        could have skipped all of this. 

           Baum looks at him, not quite sure where this is going.

                                 STILLER (CONT’D)
                        ...could have spent the whole war 
                        stateside.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Baum doesn't respond. Stiller persists.

                                 STILLER (CONT’D)
                        You did turn down a spot on the 
                        Army boxing team, right? 

                                 BAUM
                            (nods)
                        I didn't sign up to fight 
                        Americans. I did it to fight the 
                        enemy.

           Stiller respects the hell out of Baum for that.

           Of the FOUR GERMAN GUARDS who stand at the doorway, three 
           suddenly exit, leaving only one Guard.

           Baum notices, and slowly reaches over and grabs his helmet. 
           He grips it tightly in one hand, and begins to raise it, 
           preparing to use it as a weapon to strike the German Guard.

           Stiller reaches over and grabs Baum's wrist. Baum looks over 
           at him. Stiller shakes his head.

           After a moment, Baum relents. He drops the helmet and lays 
           back down with a thud. He passes out.

           Suddenly, SIX GERMAN GUARDS enter the barn and march directly 
           to Stiller.

                                 GERMAN GUARD1
                        Major?

                                 STILLER
                        Yes.

                                 GERMAN GUARD1
                        You are the ranking officer here?

                                 STILLER
                        Yes.

                                 GERMAN GUARD1
                        Then you are the Commander of this 
                        force?

           Stiller realizes they might be looking to execute the 
           commander. He glances at Baum, and makes an instant decision.

                                 STILLER
                        Yes.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Baum nods in thanks. Stiller nods back. There's respect 
           between these two now. Even admiration. Their relationship 
           has come a long way.

           German Guard 1 nods to his men, and they all swoop down and 
           grab Stiller and pull him up off his feet. 

           Stiller jerks his arm away roughly, and throws them off. 

           They stare back, caught off guard by his strength. Stiller 
           marches himself, dignified, out of the barn, the German 
           Soldiers following him closely, guns raised.

           INT. HAMMELBURG POW CAMP HOSPITAL DAY

           The door bursts open, and TWO POWs rush in, carrying Baum, 
           unconscious and covered in blood. 

           Dr. Berndt rushes over. They put Baum on a cot.

                                 BERNDT
                        This is the officer the Germans are 
                        looking for?

           The POW nods. Berndt cuts off the officer patches from Baum's 
           uniform, hands them to the POW.

                                 BERNDT (CONT’D)
                        Get rid of this.
                            (to the other POW)
                        Mark him down as a returned POW.

           The two POWs hurry off.

           Berndt turns to Baum, who opens his eyes slightly.

                                 BAUM
                            (groggily)
                        My compass...careful with it...I'll 
                        need it to escape...

           Baum passes out.

           TITLE: "6 DAYS LATER"

           EXT. WOODS NEAR AMERICAN LINES DAY

           Graham, emaciated, with a look in his eyes like a wild 
           animal, comes to the edge of the woods and stops. Out of 
           breath, he stands there, watching.

           On the road are THREE GERMAN OFFICERS, their backs to him, 
           talking to each other.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Graham runs up behind them and COCKS his .45.

           The three German Officers slowly turn.

                                 GRAHAM
                        HANDS UP!

           They slowly raise their hands.

                                 GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        YOUR GUNS!

           They slowly reach down and hand Graham their pistols.

                                 GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Where are the lines? The Americans?

           The Germans shrug.

           Graham steps up and raises his pistol to German 1's face.

                                 GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        AMERICANSKI!!!

           The nervous Officer gestures in a Western direction.

           Graham looks in that direction. The FAINT CANNON FIRE seems 
           to be coming from there. He takes off.

           EXT. WOODS NEAR AMERICAN LINES DAY

           Graham comes upon A DOZEN GERMAN SOLDIERS running for their 
           lives. They run right past him, not even noticing him.

           Graham turns in the direction they're running from and sees a 
           PLATOON OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS approaching, FIRING as they go. 
           He breaks into a huge smile and heads off towards them.

           They FIRE at him.

           He crouches down, then gets up with his hands high.

                                 GRAHAM
                        I'm an American! HOLD YOUR FIRE!

           The Platoon stops firing as it approaches Graham. THREE 
           AMERICAN SOLDIERS step towards him. They scowl, rifles raised.

           Graham's smile drops.

                        I'm not a spy! I'm with the 4th 
                        Armored!

                        Look!

           Graham takes off his dogtags and hands it to Soldier 5.

           INT. ARMY FORWARD HEADQUARTERS DAY

           Graham is lead into a tent and faces off with a COLONEL, 50s.

                        Sergeant Graham, you are being

                            (exploding)
                        Goddamn it! Somewhere in this 
                        country there's a Third Army 
                        headquarters. You ask them about 
                        Task Force Baum. When they tell you 
                        they've heard of it--and they will--
                        you tell them you found somebody 
                        who knows what happened to it.

           The Colonel gives Graham a long, hard look.

           INT. PATTON'S FORWARD HEADQUARTERS DAY

           Patton lowers the phone, crestfallen.

           Flanked by SIX AIDES, he walks over to his wall map, staring. 
           He gestures to one of his Aides, and leaves the room.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Patton Aide 1 hurries over to the wall and removes the small 
           red arrow positioned deep behind enemy lines.

           THREE REPORTERS, sitting in the back of the room, stand up 
           and rush the Aide.

           INT. HAMMELBURG POW CAMP HOSPITAL DAY

           Baum, in a hospital bed, opens his eyes, and the room slowly 
           comes into focus.

           Standing over him is Dr. Berndt, who looks down patiently.

           Baum nods, relieved. He looks around and realizes that he is 
           in the POW hospital, and that it is nearly empty.

                                 BAUM
                        Where am I?

                        Hammelburg.

           The irony of that isn't lost on Baum.

                                 BAUM
                        So I'm a prisoner in the same damn 
                        camp I liberated?

           Berndt nods.

                                 BAUM (CONT'D)
                        Where...is everyone?

                                 BERNDT
                        The Germans evacuated the camp. 
                        They moved the POWs--deeper into 
                        Germany, I suppose. They only let a 
                        few stay--those too sick to be 
                        moved. Aside from you, there's only 
                        myself and Colonel Waters--

                                 BAUM
                        Waters?

           Dr. Berndt nods.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        Can I see him?

           Dr. Berndt leaves. Baum stares at the ceiling, thinking. 
           Several beats.

           A SQUEAKY NOISE as Colonel Waters pulls up in his wheelchair, 
           beside Baum.

                                 WATERS
                        Captain.

           Baum looks over. He studies Waters.

                        bets.

           They both smile weakly.

                                 BAUM

                        hear you were, too.

           Baum nods, relieved. He looks back at the ceiling. Beat.

                                 BAUM

                        We did some damage, but...I failed

                                 WATERS
                        No you didn't.

                                 BAUM
                        I didn't make it back.

                                 WATERS
                        But you made it here. Most officers 
                        never would have come close.

           Waters studies him.

                                 WATERS (CONT’D)
                        Baum...you may not be a West 
                        Pointer. But you're forgetting 
                        something.

           Baum looks at him.

                                 WATERS (CONT’D)
                        Patton chose you.

           Baum appreciates that. It means a lot coming from a career 
           military officer. 

                                 WATERS (CONT’D)

           Baum gazes at him directly for a long time. Several beats.

                                 BAUM
                        No.

           Water looks back for several beats. Finally, he is satisfied. 
           He looks greatly relieved.

                                 WATERS
                        Thank you.

           Waters WHEELS away.

           Baum stares at the ceiling.

           TITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER

           INT. HAMMELBURG POW CAMP HOSPITAL DAY

           THE RUMBLE OF U.S. TANKS. Dr. Berndt runs to the window and 
           looks out excitedly.

           EXT. HAMMELBURG POW CAMP DAY

           Dozens of U.S. tanks roll over the barbed-wire fences,  
           crushing them beneath their treads.

           Dr. Berndt runs towards them, waving his hands frantically.

           INT. HAMMELBURG POW CAMP HOSPITAL DAY

           FOUR U.S. OFFICERS burst into the room. Two of them carry a 
           stretcher, and they hurry to Colonel Waters.

           They don't say a word to anyone else. They don't even look at 
           Baum.

           They put him onto the stretcher and rush him out of the 
           hospital before he can react.

           Baum raises his head and watches through the glass. 

           They carry Waters to a small Army airplane which has landed 
           in the midst of the camp. They load him, and the plane 
           immediately starts its PROPELLERS and TAKES OFF.

           Baum lays his head back down, and stares at the ceiling. 

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The Americans may be here. But after all Baum has done, he 
           might as well be invisible to them. Not a good feeling.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. ARMY HOSPITAL - DAY

           A much better facility. Baum has clearly been moved from the 
           Hammelburg POW camp to a proper army hospital. In this one, 
           almost all of the beds are full. The place hums with medical 
           attention, too.  

           The hospital door BURSTS open again, and in struts General 
           Patton, flanked by SIX AIDES (none of them Stiller).

           One of the aides yells out

                                 PATTON AIDE 1
                        Attention!

           Lots of men scramble out of their beds and stand at 
           attention. 

           Not Baum. No chance he's doing that now. He's staying in bed. 

           Patton and his aides all march directly towards Baum.

           Aide 1 holds a small box in front of him and opens it, 
           displaying a shining medal. He formally reads a pronouncement:

                                 PATTON AIDE 1 (CONT’D)
                        For extraordinary heroism in 
                        connection with military operations 
                        against an armed enemy in Germany: 
                        the Distinguished Service Cross. 

           Patton steps forward, takes the medal from its case, and pins 
           it on Baum's shirt.

           Patton salutes. Baum salutes back.

                                 PATTON
                        I always knew you were one of the 
                        best, Baum. You did one helluva 
                        job.

                                 BAUM
                        Thank you, sir.

                                 PATTON
                        They thought the entire 4th was 
                        attacking. They moved a division 
                        down to meet you. 
                                 (MORE)

           CONTINUED:
                                 PATTON (CONT'D)
                        By the time they figured it out, we 
                        were able to get 100 miles deep in 
                        the north without a shot fired. 
                        Never seen anything like it in my 
                        entire career. Helluva a diversion, 
                        son.

           Baum stares back quietly. 

           Patton doesn't say a thing. He just sits down on the edge of 
           the bed, hoping to forge a bit more of a bond.

           What Baum knows could immediately end Patton's career and mar 
           his legacy. Both men are keenly aware of this. 

           Still Baum doesn't speak. And Patton doesn't dare open his 
           mouth--but he's begging with his eyes. The tension in the 
           room is brutal.

           Finally, Baum makes a decision:

                                 BAUM
                        General...
                            (beat)
                        I can't believe you would have sent 
                        us to Hammelburg just to rescue one 
                        man.

           General Patton is immediately relieved--we see it clearly. 
           Baum's given him an opening, and he's going to take it. 

                                 PATTON
                        That's right, son. I wouldn't.

           Baum nods. They have an understanding: Baum is a team player. 
           He isn't going to be the stubborn individualist bent on 
           defying Patton's authority. 

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        You know, Task Force Baum has been 
                        classified Top Secret. Use 
                        discretion when discussing it.

                                 BAUM
                        That goes without saying.

           The deal is sealed. Patton straightens himself, preparing to 
           go.

                                 PATTON
                            (formally)
                        Is there anything I can do for you?

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 BAUM
                        As a matter of fact, there is.

           Patton stares back.

                                 BAUM (CONT’D)
                        You can get me back to my men.

           Patton smiles broadly.

                                 PATTON 
                        You're forgetting the Geneva 
                        Convention, son. You're a POW now. 
                        You can't fight again.
                            (beat)
                        You've got nothing to prove to me.

           Baum takes a lot of comfort from this. If the man he regards 
           as the best field general in the war says Baum measures up, 
           well that's pretty damn meaningful.

           And then it occurs to Baum: he knows a way out of this one. 
           Baum smiles himself.

                                 BAUM
                        You're General George S. Patton, 
                        aren't you?

           Patton smiles even more broadly.

           He turns and struts towards the door, his boots CLICKING, 
           followed closely by his Aides. He stops just before he 
           reaches the door and turns to Baum, a big smile on his face.

                                 PATTON
                        I'm gonna get you back to your 
                        unit.
                            (beat)
                        And you give em hell!
