           INT. CLIFF'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           CLIFF CANTER(22) lays face down on his bed.  His normally 
           messy brown hair is plastered to his forehead, and he is 
           wearing a trench coat.  His eyes start to flutter open.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Oh my god.  

           Cliff slowly raises his head, and allows his eyes to adjust.  
           He sees MOLLY RYAN(21), a tall and athletic auburn haired 
           beauty.  Cliff smiles a cotton-mouthed smile with dried 
           saliva all over his face.

                                 CLIFF
                        Molly.

           Cliff follows her shocked brown eyes to his hand: an empty 
           bottle of tequila.  Then to the night stand: a pile of used 
           condoms.

                                 CLIFF (cont'd)
                        Huh?

           Cliff hears a NEIGH. At the other end of the room a horse 
           paws at the ground.  Cliff shoots to his feet.

                                 CLIFF (cont'd)
                        Molly!  I can explain!

           Cliff's trench coat swings open, revealing the women's 
           lingerie he is wearing underneath.

                                 CLIFF (cont'd)
                        I normally don't drink.

           She turns to leave but Cliff grabs her wrist.

                                 CLIFF (cont'd)
                        No, no, no.  That came out wrong.  What I 
                        meant was . . . it's not how it looks.

           The horse NEIGHS again.  Cliff and Molly look and see a 
           condom hanging out of the horse's rear end.  

                                 MOLLY
                        You're sick.

           She turns and leaves the room.  Cliff opens his mouth to call 
           after her.  The image FREEZES.

           INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE- PRESENT

           Cliff sits in a chair, shaking his head.  Across from him a 
           DOCTOR(50's), listens intently.

                                 CLIFF
                        I mean, honestly.  Put yourself in her 
                        shoes.  How can it not look how it looks 
                        when there's a condom hanging out of a 
                        horse's ass and I'm clinging to an empty 
                        bottle of tequila?  How can one possibly 
                        explain that?  

           INT. CLIFF'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Cliff is in total shock.

                                 CLIFF (V.O.)
                        But that's kinda the point.  You can't 
                        explain yourself when you've been 
                        cockblocked.  And I'd been cockblocked.

           The condom falls out of the horse's ass as he takes a shit on 
           Cliff's rug.

                                 CLIFF (cont'd) (V.O.)
                        And butt good.

                        All I ever wanted was to fall in love.  I 
                        didn't want to "get laid" or "bump 
                        uglies" or "pound pelvis" - I was very 
                        unlike my contemporaries in that way - I 
                        just wanted to meet a cool girl that was 
                        worth spending time with.

                        I always thought it was me: the way I

                        But no.  You see, every step of the way, 
                        there was always someone making sure it 
                        didn't happen for me.  Some cockblocker.

                                 DOCTOR
                        I'm sorry.  I don't think I'm familiar 
                        with this practice.  This . . . 
                        "cockblocking."

                        have said the exact same thing.  But it 
                        goes on all the time, and most people

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL PARTY - YEARS EARLIER - NIGHT

           YOUNG CLIFF(16), wearing jeans and a flannel, sits on a couch 
           with an ATTRACTIVE GIRL. 

                                 CLIFF (V.O.)
                        Like the guy who won't leave you alone 
                        with that girl you've been dreaming about 
                        for years . . .

           SOME GUY sits on the end of the couch.  He smiles at Cliff 
           and cracks another beer.  Cliff shakes his head and goes into 
           the bathroom.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL PARTY - MINUTES LATER

           Cliff comes back from the bathroom, only to find the guy and 
           the attractive girl making out like crazy.  They stop and 
           look at Cliff.  The guy's hand emerges from inside the girl's 
           shirt, through her collar, and he waves to Cliff.

                        then some guy tells you "what a nut-job 
                        that girl is" and how "you don't want to

           The preppy guy and hotty are standing at the altar kissing as 
           the room applauds.  Cliff watches on, from the audience.  The

                                 CLIFF
                        You're a good friend, Fish.

                                 FISHER
                        Shit, man, I'm the best.

           Cliff gives Fisher a hug.  A water balloon comes through the 
           window, drenching Cliff and Fisher.

                        Queers!

           Fisher turns to the window.  In the building across the way, 
           he sees RICK(23) and RICK(24), fraternity types similar in 
           every way.  

                                 RICK #1
                        Up top, bro!

           They high five like a couple of real idiots.

           Cliff slams the window closed.

                        Shhh.  They'll hear you.

                                 FISHER
                        Yes, I know that.  That's why I was 
                        yelling.

                                 CLIFF
                        Well, geeze, you don't want to piss 'em 
                        off.

                                 FISHER
                        Why not?

                                 CLIFF
                        What if they did something to us?

           Fisher removes his hat and wrings the water out.

                        Something else.

           EXT. CLIFF'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Fisher slings a bag over his shoulder, puts the box of pizza 
           under his arm, and climbs onto a bike.   They look up at the 
           Ricks, who are spitting on passers-by.  

                                 FISHER
                        Listen to me, man, you can't let people 
                        walk all over you.  If you don't say 
                        anything, what's to stop people from 
                        doin' shit like that?  Stand up for 
                        yourself, boy.

           SLAM.  Cliff is hit by Molly, who was running in the opposite 
           direction.  He goes down.

                                 CLIFF
                        Hey, watch where you're goin', asshole!

           He looks up and sees her.

                        That's more action than he's seen in 
                        years!

           Cliff closes his eyes.  

                                 MOLLY
                        You all right?

                        But I'm pretty sure I dropped that 
                        somewhere else.  A ways back, actually.

                        Well, I hope you find it.

           Cliff smiles.

                                 CLIFF
                        Me too.

           Molly puts her headphones back on her head.

                                 MOLLY
                        You should keep your head up when you 
                        walk, though.
                          (beat)
                        That smile's too cute to hide.

           She smiles and waves as she takes off running.  Cliff watches 
           her go.

           Cliff watches her go.  Fisher watches an OLD WOMAN drive by 
           on a motorized cart.

                        That's disgusting.

                                 FISHER
                        Clifford, I don't judge a woman by her 
                        color, creed, or age but, rather, by the 
                        content of her pocketbook.  You see an 
                        old woman.  I see a single woman wearin' 
                        more gold than Mr. T.

           Fisher kicks off and rides away.  He rings a bell on his bike 
           as he passes the old woman.

                                 FISHER (cont'd)

                        shot.

           SPLASH!  Another water balloon hits Cliff, drenching him.

           INT. KID'S GYM - DAY

           A converted gym in the back of the fitness center, filled 
           with all kinds of colored mats, balls, and foamed athletic 
           equipment.  A huge group of kids sit, staring at Cliff.

                                 FISHER
                        Welcome aboard!

                                 CLIFF
                        I thought you said I'd be a camp

                        more counseling than these blossoming 
                        young adults?

           A GIRL(5) runs up and pulls on Cliff's arm.

                        Camp starts at nine and parents pick up 
                        and drop off their kids all day, until 
                        five.  This is Boris, he handles the 
                        morning shift.

           BORIS(45), a heavy set Russian with a thick accent, extends a 
           hand.  He has a Castro-style beard.

                                 BORIS
                        Hello, comrade.

                        Don't see them as harmless children.  See 
                        them as forty-seven tiny proletariats 
                        capable of revolution.  Together we can 
                        break their will.

           Cliff looks at the wide-eyed, harmless kids staring at him.  
           Boris exits.  Fisher turns to Cliff.

                                 FISHER
                        Yeah, he's a little intense, but he gets 
                        the job done.

                        So you take over at noon.  You'll have 
                        weekends off. You can use the gym's 
                        facilities mornings, before work.

           A pause.  Cliff looks around.

                        sitter.

           Fisher exits.  The door closes behind him like a drawbridge, 
           and a series of locks are heard.  Cliff exhales.

           INT. LIFETIME FITNESS - RECEPTION DESK - LATER

           Cliff is sifting through the drawers.  Fisher leans over the 
           counter.

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           A SMALL BOY sits on the toilet, pants at his ankles.

                                 SMALL BOY
                          (screaming at the top of his 
                           lungs)
                        HELP!

           INT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - AFTER

           Cliff sifts through the storage closet.  He finds the 
           turpentine and closes the door.  He is about to leave, when a 
           snapping sound catches his attention.  He moves to 
           investigate.

           INT. TOWEL STORAGE ROOM - SAME TIME

           Cliff creeps around the corner into a large storage room.  He 
           stops in the entrance.  He sees the back of an OLDER MAN, 
           sitting on a pile of towels.  A fly buzzes.  The man snaps 
           his towel.  No more buzzing.  Cliff slowly backs out, amazed.

           INT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME

           Cliff makes his way through the locker room.  Fisher finds 
           him.

                        Yeah, I just . . .

           They hear a MAN'S VOICE singing to himself around the corner.  
           They step toward the showers to take a look.

                                 FISHER
                        The hell . . .

           INT. SHOWER AREA - SAME TIME

           ROD(25), a hard-bodied personal trainer with a tan as fake as 
           his personality, stands in front of a scale, wearing only a G-
           string, and his finely groomed mullet.  He looks in the 
           mirror and starts gyrating his hips.

                                 ROD
                          (singing)
                        Ain't nothin' but G-string, baby.
                          (hopping on the scale)
                        This scale is the one that weighs me.

           He watches the numbers, then smiles.  He looks in the mirror 
           and kisses at his reflection.  He then grabs one of his pecs 
           with both hands and licks it.

                                 FISHER
                        Damn.

           Rod turns around, casually.

                                 ROD
                        What's up, brotha man?

                                 FISHER
                        Yo, Cliff.  This is Rod.

           Rod is staring at himself in a wall-sized mirror.  Cliff nods 
           to Rod's reflection.

                                 FISHER
                          (sniffing)

                                 ROD
                        That's body oil.  I like to lube up

           Rod holds up his hand, and Fisher reluctantly slaps it.  Rod 
           exits.  Fisher shakes the grease off his hand.

           INT. POOL - MINUTES LATER

           Rod dives into the pool and a huge ring of oil seeps out 
           around him.

           INT. LIFETIME FITNESS - SAME TIME

           Cliff and Fisher watch Rod begin to swim laps.

                        Oh, right!  Sorry.  I'm just used to 
                        looking at the top of your head.

           Fisher coughs on the water he's drinking.  They look at him.

                                 FISHER
                        I'm sorry.  My mind's in the gutter.  How 
                        can we help you?

                                 MOLLY
                        Actually, I'm interested in a membership.

                                 CLIFF
                        Oh.  Well, you'll want to talk to Mr. 
                        Fisher, here -

           Fisher squeezes Cliff's balls from behind, quieting him 
           instantly.

                                 FISHER
                        You know what, Cliff, I was gonna go 
                        check on the kids for a while, so if you 
                        wouldn't mind taking care of Miss . . .

                          (releasing Cliff's balls)
                        Perfect.  Cliff is great, he'll tell you 
                        everything you need to know.

           Rod steps in.  He strikes a pose that is identical to a life-
           size stand-up of himself, that he is standing next to.  The 
           caption reads:  NEW MEMBERS - FREE SESSION WITH ROD THE BOD!

                                 ROD

                        Is there something I can help you with?

           Molly looks from the stand-up Rod to the real Rod.

                                 MOLLY
                        That's all right.

           Rod looks at Cliff.  

                                 ROD
                        Ooh.  Was this guy helping you?

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah.

                                 ROD
                        Yeah.  That's no good.  See I got a real 
                        important job I need him to do.

           Rod looks around for a job to give Cliff.  He steps close to 
           him, so that Molly can't hear their conversation.

                                 ROD (cont'd)
                          (indicating some large bags)
                        I'm gonna need you to throw away that 
                        cement. A.S.A.P.

                                 FISHER
                        Yo, Rod.  I'm headin' that way all ready.  
                        I'll handle it.

                                 ROD
                        Yeaahhh . . .You're black, right?

           A long pause.

                                 FISHER
                        Yeah . . .

                                 ROD
                        Yeah, that won't work.

                          (defensive)
                        Why not?

                                 ROD
                        I wouldn't want people to think we give 
                        the shit jobs to the black guys.  
                        Besides, we don't want you nosin' around 
                        the parking lot, right bro?

           Fisher just stares at him.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER

           Cliff heaves a bag of cement into the dumpster.  He bends 
           over and grabs his back.  He hears a MAN'S VOICE, yelling.

                        There's the son of a bitch who stole our 
                        cement!

           Cliff looks up.  He sees three burly CONSTRUCTION GUYS 
           running toward him.  They surround him.  

                                 CONSTRUCTION GUY
                        Grab his ankles, T-Bone.

           INT. OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Molly sits in a chair.  Rod is behind a desk.  He stares at 
           her intently.  He gives his trademark, grotesque smile.

                                 ROD
                        Okay.  Name?

                          (flaring his nostrils)
                        I like that.

           Molly leans forward and takes the form.

                                 MOLLY
                        You know what?  I can just fill this out.  
                        Save us some time.

                                 ROD
                        Ooh.  And brains.

           Molly smiles.  

           EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

           The construction guys toss Cliff's limp body into the 
           dumpster.  They dust off their hands and head in.  Moments 
           pass.  

           The older man from the towel room, cigarette dangling from 
           his lips, walks toward the dumpster carrying a bag of 
           garbage.  He tosses the bag in.

                                 CLIFF
                        Umph.

           The older man stops and listens.  Nothing.  He shakes it off, 
           reaches behind the dumpster and pulls out a can of beer.  He 
           cracks it and starts drinking.

                        Uuuu . . .

           The older man steps up on the dumpster and looks in.  He sees 
           Cliff's lifeless body.  Staring at Cliff, the older man 
           doesn't notice his ashes fall into the dumpster.  A small 
           fire starts at Cliff's feet.

           The older man notices.  

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Oh, shit.

           He goes to pour his beer on the fire, but it's empty.  He 
           jumps down and grabs another from behind the dumpster.  He 
           quickly cracks it and pours it on the fire, but it has grown 
           and one beer isn't enough.  

           He reaches for another, but can't find one.  He pulls out the 
           box.  Empty.  Thinking quickly, the older man hops up on the 
           dumpster.  He looks around, quickly, then unzips his fly.

           INT. OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Molly holds a small cup in her hands, filled with urine.  She 
           hands it to Rod.

                                 MOLLY

                        again?

           Rod smiles a perverse grin, as he slides the sample off the 
           table and into his lap.  A moment of silence.

                                 ROD
                        I've been looking over your application.

                        Pediatric gynecology.

           Molly puts it together.

                                 ROD (cont'd)
                        That's a joke.

                                 MOLLY
                        That's sick.

           A beat.

                                 ROD
                        You didn't think that was funny?
                          (Molly shakes her head)
                        Really?

                                 MOLLY
                        Really.

           INT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           The older man slaps Cliff, and his head flops, lifelessly, 
           from side to side.  The older man looks around to make sure 
           no one is watching.  He takes one last drag off of his smoke, 
           and puts it out on Cliff's hand.

                                 CLIFF
                          (shooting up)

                        It's all right.  Fisher took care of it. 

           INT. KID'S GYM - SAME TIME

           The kids are all seated quietly.  Boris stands in front of A 
           SMALL GIRL.  He speaks at her, through a megaphone.

                        Thank god.

           INT. LIFETIME FITNESS - RECEPTION DESK - LATER

           Earl drops Cliff's charred shoes into the garbage outside the 
           men's locker room.  Fisher is behind the reception desk.

                                 CLIFF
                        Wow.  I mean, the ass kicking I 
                        understand.  But was it really necessary 
                        for them to douse me in beer, light me on 
                        fire, then piss on me?

           A nearby door opens.  Rod and Molly exit.  Molly spots Cliff 
           and waves.  Cliff waves back.

                        Yeah.  I think you might have made a 
                        mistake on those -

                        away that cement.

                                 ROD
                        I said garbage.  I said throw the garbage 
                        away.  Why would you throw away cement?

                                 CLIFF
                        I don't know.

           Rod looks at Cliff, then at Molly.

                                 ROD
                        You know, somethin', Clint.  If you would 
                        have paid attention to what I was saying, 
                        instead of undressing this fine lady with 
                        your eyes . . .

           Rod takes a moment to do just that, as Molly is turned 
           around.  He mouths: OH YEAH . . .  She turns back.

                                 ROD
                          (quickly turning to Cliff)
                        Then you wouldn't have ended up looking

           Cliff takes one last look at Molly, as Rod shows her the 
           facilities. He then checks out the cardboard stand-up of Rod.

           INT. CLIFF'S APARTMENT  - NIGHT

           Cliff looks in the mirror, at his scrawny body.  He flexes.

                        Yeah, boy.  You going after a little Miss 
                        Molly, huh?

           Cliff's smile quickly fades to a look of consternation.

                                 CLIFF
                        Fisher, don't try and help me out.

           EXT. COLLEGE BARBECUE - YEARS EARLIER

           Cliff stands over a grill, tending to the cooking brats.  He 
           is chatting up a SEXY DAME.

                        You're quite the chef.

           Fisher steps up, holding a forty.  He's drunk.

                          (indicating cooking meat)
                        Psh, woman, you think those are big you 
                        should see Cliff's dick!

           Fisher holds out his hand for five.  Cliff slaps it, 
           reluctantly.

                                 FISHER (cont'd)
                        My man!

           Cliff lets out a nervous laugh.  The sexy dame walks away.

                        A'ight.  I'll hang back.  If that's how 
                        you wanna play it.

           Fisher smiles and punches Cliff playfully in the chest.  
           Cliff is knocked back a few steps.

           Cliff and Fisher head out.  Rod emerges from the shower, 
           glowering.  Two TEENAGERS see Rod.

                                 FIRST TEENAGER
                        Jesus, man.  Put a towel on.

           They pass him.

                        It looked like an egg.

           Rod grabs a towel and wraps it around himself, stalking off.

           INT. FITNESS AREA - SAME TIME

           Molly is stretching out in front of a treadmill.  Cliff 
           approaches a Stairmaster.  He steps on, and the steps just 
           sink down.  He steps off, embarrassed.  Molly spots him.

                                 MOLLY
                        Cliff!

           He turns.  She waves him over.

                        No.  I'm an employee so, you know, it's 
                        probably not a good idea if I hit any of 
                        the equipment.

           Cliff sees Fisher standing nearby, pretending to clean some

                        Awesome.

           She climbs on and starts pressing buttons.  Her treadmill 
           starts moving, and she works into a slow jog.  Cliff follows 
           suit.

           Rod watches on, seething.  DEVIN(20's) and MICKEY(20's), 
           Rod's buddies and fellow trainers, stand beside him.  They, 
           too, are purveyors of fine mullet, though smaller than Rod's.

                                 DEVIN
                        Why don't you just go over there and tell 
                        her she's got a great rack?

           Rod shakes his head.

                        Or a tight ass.  That'll work, too.

                        You'd think that, wouldn't you?  But this 
                        one's different, boys.  She doesn't go 
                        for the usual fare.

                        She looked at me like I was some kind of 
                        pervert.  And that's usually my closer.

           Mickey and Devin shake their heads.

                        Dr. Molly.  That's sex . . .
                          (catching himself)
                         . . .ist.

                                 MOLLY
                          (confused)
                        What is?

                                 ROD
                          (thinking quickly)
                        Well, I mean . . .they have waiters and 
                        waitresses, they should have doctors and 
                        doctresses.

           Molly laughs.  Rod laughs along with her.  Cliff can't 
           believe what he is hearing.  

                                 MOLLY
                          (looking at Cliff, laughing)
                        Did you hear that?

           Cliff quickly smiles.

                                 CLIFF
                        Yeah.  
                          (giving Rod a thumbs up)
                        Good one, man.

                                 ROD
                        Yeah, I'm a pretty funny guy.
                          (off Molly's laughter)
                        Wow, what a great laugh.

                                 MOLLY
                        Thanks.

           A beat.  Rod milks the pause, staring at Molly.

                                 ROD
                        Anyway, Molly, I was thinking - if you're 
                        not doing anything tonight - 

           Cliff's eyes go wide.

                                 ROD (cont'd)
                        We could hang out.  You know, have some 
                        dinner.  Watch MacGuyver.

           Rod strokes his mullet.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, that's really sweet, Rod, but I'm 
                        baby-sitting for my brother tonight.

                                 ROD
                        That's cool.  Now that I think about it, 
                        I actually got something goin' myself.

                                 MOLLY
                        But another time, maybe?

                                 ROD
                        Yeah, I can probably do that.  I'll call 
                        you.

           Rod fires the finger gun at Molly.

                                 MOLLY
                        Bye.

           As he leaves, Rod pulls the plug to Cliff's machine out with 
           his foot.  SLAM!  Cliff's machine comes to a screeching halt.  
           His feet don't.  Cliff goes flipping over the front of the 
           machine and hits the floor.  Molly hops off her machine.

                                 MOLLY (cont'd)
                        Cliff! 

           Cliff sits up.

                                 MOLLY (cont'd)
                        Are you all right?

           He clutches his side.  Rod is nearly on top of them.

                                 ROD
                        What the hell are you doin', man?  You 
                        almost ended your life, there.

                                 CLIFF
                        I don't know what happened.

                                 ROD
                          (looking at Molly)
                        I'll tell you what happened.  You were 
                        screwin' around on a very serious piece 
                        of equipment.  Have you ever even used a 
                        treadmill before?

           Cliff looks at Molly.

                                 CLIFF
                        Not really.

                                 ROD
                        Jesus, man, this ain't a toy.  You could 
                        have seriously injured yourself.

                                 MOLLY
                        He's right, Cliff.

           Rod puts his arm around Molly.

                                 ROD
                        And you can't just hop on here every time 
                        you want to impress a girl.  A treadmill 
                        is not a pick-up line, and a way to a 
                        girl's heart is not through her sports 
                        bra.
                          (he turns to Molly)
                        Which reminds me, I still owe you a free 
                        session.

           Earl taps Cliff on the back.

                                 EARL
                        Ahh, excuse me, were you using this 
                        machine?

           Cliff looks at Earl.  Then at Molly.

                                 CLIFF
                        Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was.

                                 EARL
                        I'm really sorry, sir.  I accidentally 
                        pulled the plug.

           A pause.  Cliff is trying to put it together.  Rod's eyes are 
           wide.  Earl plugs the machine back in and walks away.  Molly 
           looks at Rod.

                                 ROD
                          (begrudgingly)
                        Just be more careful.  

           He trudges off.

                                 MOLLY
                        Should we finish it out?

                                 CLIFF
                        You go ahead.  
                          (rubbing his side)
                        I think I'm gonna call it a day.

           He heads off.

                        Hey, Cliff.

           He turns back.

                                 MOLLY (cont'd)
                        Tomorrow morning, same time?

                                 CLIFF
                        I don't know, every time you run anywhere 
                        near me, I seem to end up scraping myself 
                        off the floor.
                          (beat)
                        But, yeah, I think I'll risk it.

           She smiles and he heads off.

           INT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Cliff is putting on his shirt for work.  Rod enters the room.

                                 CLIFF (cont'd)
                        Hey, Rod -

                                 ROD
                        Listen, Clint, I don't even think telling 
                        you this is necessary, after you made 
                        such an ass of yourself on the treadmill, 
                        but just in case.
                          (stepping closer to Cliff)
                        You're new here, so maybe you don't know 
                        the rules, but Rod the Bod gets first 
                        crack at all the new members.  Once I'm 
                        through, you and your kind can fight it 
                        out for sloppy seconds.  You got that?

           Cliff nods.  Rod leaves.

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           Cliff enters the bathroom and steps up to a urinal.  He 
           checks his stream for a moment, then looks up.  Earl has 
           appeared right next to him.

                                 CLIFF
                        AHH!!!

           Cliff sprays urine all over himself.  He regains his 
           composure.

                        Listen, kid, I didn't come here to make 
                        small talk.

                                 CLIFF
                        Neither did I, to be honest.

                                 EARL
                        You're being cockblocked.

                        Cockblocked?

                        Yeah.  And in a big way, too. I didn't 
                        pull the plug on that machine.  It was . 
                        . . someone else.

                        What?  Why?

                                 EARL
                        Because he's cockblocking you.
                          (beat)
                        You know?  Blocking your cock.

           Cliff looks at him blankly.

                                 EARL (cont'd)
                        He's purposely making you look like an 
                        ass so that gal won't go for you.  I did 
                        all I could, taking the heat for your 
                        dive, but he'll be back.

                                 CLIFF
                        Are you saying . . . Rod pulled the plug?  
                        On purpose?

                        Why are you telling me this?

                                 EARL
                        Because it's wrong.  What he's doing is 
                        wrong.

                        And she seems like a nice girl.  I'd like 
                        to see her with a good man.

           Cliff nods to himself.  He looks to Earl.

                                 CLIFF
                        Thanks-

           Earl is gone.  Cliff turns back to the urinal, but thinks 
           better of it.  He heads for a stall, opens the door, and 
           finds Earl crouched on the toilet, hiding.

                                 EARL
                        Just ignore me.  I'm not even here.

           Cliff nods and turns around.  He exits.

           INT. KID'S GYM - LATER

           Cliff reenters the gym, zipping up his fly.  He pats Fisher 
           on the back.

                                 CLIFF
                        Thanks for filling in.

           Something catches Cliff's eye.  He works his way through the 
           crowd to the back of the room where a SMALL BOY(7), has been 
           staple-gunned to the wall.  

                                 CLIFF 
                        What happened?  Are you all right?

                          (sniffling)
                        They said I have a girl's name.

                        Well . . . who cares what other people

                        What is it?

           The boy shakes his head.

           INT. KID'S GYM - LATER

           Cliff is talking to Fisher as parents begin to pick up their

                        hang out tonight like I promised.

                        I hate to bail on a friend like this, but 
                        somethin' came up.  
                          (handing Cliff an envelope)
                        Here are the tickets, but I don't know 
                        where you're gonna be able to find two 
                        other people to go to Pokemon on such 
                        short notice.

           Betsy's eyes light up.  

                                 BETSY
                        Pokemon 4: The Wrath of Pikachu?!

                        Ah, listen, you guys wouldn't be 
                        interested in something like that, would 
                        you?

                        You know what, I think my brother is 
                        going to explode if I say no . . .

           Sure enough, Betsy is holding his breath and is bright red.

                                 CLIFF
                        That'd be unfortunate.  Especially for 
                        the janitorial staff.  
                          (off Molly's laugh)
                        So it's a date?
                          (beat)
                        I mean, it's . . .an informal gathering . 
                        . .of newly acquainted people . . .at a

           Molly smiles and exits with Betsy.  Cliff waves until she is 
           out of sight.

                                 CLIFF
                          (to Earl)
                        That was genius, man!  Where'd you come 
                        up with those tickets?

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Earl is walking down a city street.  He passes a MAN IN A 
           GIANT POKEMON COSTUME, waving and standing next to a sign 
           that reads: POKEMON 4: THE WRATH OF PIKACHU!  SNEAK PREVIEW!  
           TICKETS ON SALE!  A car revs it's engine.

                                 VOICE FROM CAR (O.S.)
                        Hey, Pokemon!  You suck!

           A brick hits the giant Pokemon and knocks it flat.  Tires 
           squeal as the car pulls away.  A GIANT COSTUMED SUBWAY SUB 
           runs over to help.  The sound of a car in reverse, is 
           followed by another brick, knocking the sub down, as well.

                                 VOICE FROM CAR (cont'd) (O.S.)
                        Yeah!  Up top!

           Earl hears them high five, and pull away.  He surveys the 
           fallen characters around him, then takes passes from each, 
           and continues on his way, making sure no one has seen.

           INT. LIFETIME FITNESS - RECEPTION DESK - PRESENT

           Earl sips from a Subway soft drink container.

                                 FISHER
                        Shit, Earl, if Rod can cockblock, what 
                        was that, a cock-assist?

                        It's called "wing-manning."  I acted as 
                        your wing man.  And yes, it's one of the 
                        few known defenses against the cockblock.

                        Now listen carefully.  It is essential 
                        you get a good-night kiss, tonight.  
                        Physical contact is taken very seriously 
                        by women and if you kiss her - if you can 
                        achieve that base level of intimacy - Rod 
                        should be forced to concede.  It's like a 
                        dog marking his territory . . .without 
                        the urine, of course.  In most cases.  
                        You understand?

           Cliff nods.  He looks at Fisher.

                        That's amazing.  Who knew this was such 
                        an intricate practice.  
                          (turning to Earl)

           A LITTLE GIRL points to the vending machine.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        He's back there.

           They look behind the vending machine.  There he is.

                        Sorry.  Whenever I give out sage like 
                        advice, vanishing mysteriously just seems

           hand to give Betsy a high-five.

           The marquee reads: POKEMON 4: THE WRATH OF PIKACHU!

           INT. MOVIE THEATRE - SAME TIME

           Cliff, Betsy, and Molly watch the movie.  Betsy is totally in 
           to it.  Cliff and Molly are totally confused.

                                 MEW-MEW

                        This is not good, Mew-Mew.  Mew-To has 
                        nearly doubled in size!

           A universal GASP from all the children in the theatre.  Cliff 
           looks around, confused.

                                 MEW-TO
                          (on screen)

                                 MEW
                        Mew-Mew!

           An anime wall breaks and a nondescript yellow creature comes 
           flying through the air.

                                 MEW/MEW-MEW
                          (on screen)
                        Mew-mew-To!!!

           All the kids cheer.  Cliff looks around, further confused.

           EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

           Cliff, Molly, and Betsy exit the theatre.

                                 BETSY
                        Wasn't that awesome, Cliff?

                        You're not a big Pokemon fan?

                        What can I say?  I was raised on the 
                        Muppet Show.

                                 MOLLY
                        Get out.  I love the Muppets!  Who's your

                                 CLIFF
                        Gonzo.  No question.

                        He's up there, for sure.  But for us 
                        gals, we've never had as great a roll 
                        model as Miss Piggy.  She really knew how 
                        to flex those feminine wiles . . .

                        chocolate?

                        You think?

                          (still laughing)
                        That is by far the worst Miss Piggy I 
                        have ever heard in my life.

           They continue to walk.

           EXT. BETSY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Cliff's car pulls into the driveway.  Molly, Cliff, and Betsy 
           get out.

           Betsy runs into the house.

                                 CLIFF
                        She's a good kid.

                        He's a good kid.  I'm sorry.

                                 MOLLY
                        It's okay.  You're definitely not the 
                        first to make that mistake.

                                 CLIFF
                        Why Betsy?  If you don't mind me asking.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, it's a long and sordid tale of lost 
                        love.  Basically, there was this girl, 
                        Betsy.  My dad's dream girl, and when he 
                        finally got a chance to take her out, 
                        some guy told her he was a . . .a 
                        transvestite priest, with an affinity for 
                        clown porn.

                                 CLIFF
                        Oh my god.

                                 MOLLY
                        And she never spoke to him again.

                                 CLIFF
                          (to himself)
                        The cockblock.  It's everywhere.

                        What?

                                 CLIFF
                        Nothing.

                                 MOLLY
                        Anyway.  He vowed to name a child after 
                        that girl -his lost love . . .my mother 
                        named me, and Bets got the shaft.

                                 CLIFF

                        Which reminds me.  Good luck finding 
                        another boy named Betsy.  I've been 
                        looking for years.

           Molly smiles.  A pause.  There's the moment.  They lean in to 
           kiss, but stop suddenly when a siren sounds, and bright 
           lights appear.

                                 VOICES (O.S.)
                        Neighborhood Watch!  Nobody move!

           Molly covers her eyes from the blinding light.  Rod emerges 
           from the light. 

                                 ROD
                        Molly!  What are you doing here?

                        I live here.

           Rod throws his arms out in surprise, pointing his high-
           powered flashlight at Cliff, who grabs his eyes and hits the 
           ground. 

                                 ROD
                        Wow!  That's crazy!  What a coincidence!
                          (a beat, as Cliff stands up)
                        I'm sorry.  Did I scare you guys?  We're 
                        Neighborhood Watch.  You know, just out 
                        patrolling the streets, keepin' 'em 
                        clean, helpin' old people, you know . . .

                        It is, isn't it?  Anyway, this looked 
                        like a potential date rape situation so, 
                        you know, better safe than sorry.

           The penis rises, towering over them.  Anime Earl goes 
           slamming into the giant cock.  Out of the top of the giant 
           cock, Rod's head emerges, laughing a sinister laugh.

           Mew-mew begins to run away.  The giant Rod cock begins moving

           Anime Cliff starts to run toward Molly.  Just as he is about 
           to reach her, the giant Rod cock bats him aside, sending him 
           flying through the air and off a cliff.   The giant cock 
           bends over and swallows Molly whole.

                        Time-outs for all of you!

           Cliff looks up, just in time to see the biggest toddler come 
           flying at him.  All hell breaks loose.  Kids are screaming, 
           and the toddlers are beating on Cliff, Earl, and Betsy.

                                 ROD
                        HEY!

           Everything stops.  The only sound is the whistle, every time 
           Betsy breathes.    

                                 ROD (cont'd)
                        Get off of them!

           He pulls everyone apart.  Molly enters.

                        Betsy?

                        Molly, it's not my fault.

                        Cliff . . . it's your job to take care of

                        Molly, just calm down.  He's breathing.  
                        Everything will be fine.  I'll take you

           Cliff runs for the entrance.  A HOT NURSE wheels a 
           WOMAN(40's), with a TRACHEAL RING in her throat, past Fisher.

                        It's okay.  I'm here, sweetie.  Rod's 
                        here.  

           She fights with all her might not to be pulled in.

                                 MOLLY
                        No, Rod, it's okay -

           He pulls her harder.

                        Go on, darlin'.  Have a good cry.  

           She fights to get away.

                        No.  Really.  I'm fine.

           Molly shakes it off.

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - NEW YEAR'S EVE 1979

           The house is alive with the 70's.  Lava lamps, bead doors, 
           bean-bag chairs, and disco clothes.

                        It was New Year's Eve 1979.  I was living 
                        in New York City and I was on the verge 
                        of pushing men's fashion to new heights.

           A tasty 70's groove kicks in, as YOUNG EARL enters the party.  
           He is wearing platform shoes with lava lamps in the base, 
           bell-bottoms that could house a family of midgets, and the 
           widest collar known to man.  He is known and greeted by all.

           They laugh.  The guy walks away.

                        And what's with that hair?

           Earl picks out his own fro, lovingly.  Earl and Max have a 
           good laugh.

                        But it wasn't a joke.  It was the end of 
                        an era.  It was the end of free love, and 
                        the beginning of "me" love.  It was the 
                        beginning of the most narcissistic, self-
                        centered, self-indulgent period in 
                        American history.

           Everyone stands around watching the countdown on the

                        Less than a minute, everyone!

           The party goers cheer.  Everyone seems to be coupling up.  
           Earl looks around.  He spots a YOUNG DAME standing alone.  He 
           approaches.

                                 EARL (cont'd)
                        Hi there.  I'm Earl.

                                 YOUNG DAME
                        Hi.  I'm Ellen.

                        Ellen, it's a special night.  And you 
                        deserve to spend it with a special

           She smiles and takes his hand.  Before they move, ARMANI GUY 
           is there.

                        This guy, two months ago, shows up at his 
                        parole meeting - I'm a counselor -

                                 YOUNG DAME
                        Parole meeting?

                                 EARL
                        I think, maybe -

                                 ARMANI GUY
                        Statutory rape.  But that's neither here 
                        nor there.  Anyway, he was fed up.  He 
                        told me he wasn't going to let genital 
                        herpes ruin his life.  

           Earl is totally confused.  The girl edges away from him as 
           Armani guy continues to speak.

                                 ARMANI GUY (cont'd)
                        And I'm proud of him.  I'm proud that he 
                        still has the balls - chancre infested 
                        though they may be - to approach an 
                        attractive woman like yourself, and offer 
                        to give you the gift that keeps on 
                        giving.  Thank you, miss. For supporting 
                        our little petri dish, here.  And maybe 
                        even taking a little home for yourself.

           Armani guy extends his hand.

                                 ARMANI GUY
                        I'm Dave, by the way.

           She shakes his hand.

                        Ellen.  Listen.  It's a special night.  
                        And you deserve to spend it with a

                        And that was it.  I had become victim to 
                        the first cockblock of the modern era.  

           A RANDOM GUY pops his head in the room.

                                 EARL
                        And I've been here ever since.

                                 CLIFF
                        But why?

                                 EARL
                        Because I was scared.  I was scared to 
                        reenter a social scene where a man's 
                        sexual advances toward a woman could be 
                        subverted by another man.  And I just 
                        lost it.  I lost my swagger, my pannage, 
                        my confidence.  I couldn't find the balls 
                        to approach women anymore, now that I 
                        knew what could happen - now that I knew 
                        about the cockblock.

           A pause.  Cliff and Fisher take in the story.

                        So you've been hiding.  Here.  In the

                        Staring at saggy balls.

                        Why I need to help you.  To vindicate 
                        myself.  The world's already lost one 
                        good man to the cockblock.  Let's not 
                        lose another.

                        One: Never cockblock without cause.  Only 
                        when your own territory is in danger. 

           Earl nods to a situation developing at the bar where some GUY 
           is moving in on a MAN and his DATE.

                                 EARL (cont'd)
                        Two: Never cockblock a friend.  Should be 
                        obvious, but you'd be surprised what guys 
                        will do for a piece of ass.

           Cliff looks at Fisher and nods.

                                 EARL (cont'd)
                        And the third and most important rule of 
                        cockblocking: never get involved in a 
                        cockblocking war.

           Cliff nods.

                                 EARL (cont'd)
                        Now, in what I like to call this "living 
                        laboratory" we can study a few of the 
                        more common manifestations of the 
                        cockblock.

           Earl scans the crowd and spots a proper specimen for study.

                                 EARL (cont'd)
                        First.  The very shameless "third man in" 
                        maneuver.  These two have initiated 
                        conversation, undoubtedly the hardest 
                        part of meeting women.  And the young man 
                        entering . . . now . . .

           Another MAN enters the group.

                                 EARL (cont'd)
                        Is the third man in.  He knows these two 
                        guys, acts like he's there to talk to 
                        them and . . .

           The man sits down.

                                 EARL (cont'd)
                        Ends up making himself comfortable.  He 
                        has piggy-backed onto their initiation 
                        and, due to the now uneven ratio, has 
                        decreased the odds considerably that 
                        anyone will see any action.

           Earl looks around and finds another example.

                                 EARL 
                        Ooh, and here's something you should 
                        definitely be aware of.  It's actually a 
                        female cockblock known as the "ugly 
                        friend."

                                 CLIFF
                        The ugly friend?

           Earl nods and indicates a HOT GIRL with an UGLY FRIEND, both 
           talking to an ATTRACTIVE MALE.

                                 EARL
                        See, this guy and this gal are really 
                        hitting it off, but her "ugly friend" 
                        isn't gonna let it happen, because she's 
                        jealous, see.  She's had enough of always 
                        being in the shadows and she thinks, "if 
                        I can't get any, then nobody can."  A 
                        very loose canon, the ugly friend.

                                 FISHER
                        But if you've got a wing man-

                                 EARL
                        Exactly.  The wing man can perform what 
                        we call "taking one for the team," 
                        hooking up with ugly friend, so that his 
                        partner can get some true action.

                        Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta hit the 
                        little boys room.

           He gets up and leaves.

                        Geeze.  This cockblocking stuff is a lot

                                 FISHER
                        Shit.  Rod in the house.

                        on his headboard.  Another piece of ass.

           Cliff stands up.  Fisher grabs his shirt.

                                 FISHER
                        Whoa.  What are you doing?

                        cockblockin'.  After what Earl just said.

                        What am I gonna say to him?  You're a

                        This is the only one way to deal with a

           Cliff heads over to Rod.  Earl returns to the table a moment 
           later.

                                 EARL
                        Where'd he go?

           Fisher nods to Cliff, who is approaching Rod and his girl.

           AT THE BAR

           Rod strokes his mullet, talking to his girl.

                                 ROD
                        It's where I derive my power from, 
                        really.  Without my hair, I'm nothing.  
                        Sometimes, I have dreams where I'm a 
                        superhero, and the hair acts as a cape.

           The girl nods, impressed.  Cliff approaches.

                        And I think I got a nibble.

           She laughs.

                        That's great, Clint.  Why don't you take 
                        off so I can, ahh . . .do some stuff to 
                        this gal, if you know what I mean.

                        That was subtle, but I think I got it.

           Cliff takes a moment.  He looks at the girl and snaps his 
           fingers.

                        Rod has told me so much about you.  Three

                        Probably takes the fun out of it.  
                        Anyway.  It was really nice meeting you.
                          (Cliff looks to Rod)
                        Rod.

           He nods and walks away.  Rod is devastated.

           AT THE TABLE

           Cliff returns and sits down.

                                 EARL
                        What did you just do?

           A loud SMACK penetrates the bar.

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                        ASSHOLE!

           A moment later, Rod is at the table.  He places his hands in 
           front of Cliff.  His face is dripping with the girl's drink.

                                 ROD
                        You just dug your own grave, pal.  See, I 
                        can be the nice guy.  I can make Molly 
                        think I'm sweet, and charming - I can be 
                        a pussy, just like you, if that's what it 
                        takes to tap that ass.  I can play your 
                        game.  
                          (beat)
                        But now we're gonna find out if you can 
                        play mine.

           He walks away.  Earl gets up and leaves without saying a 
           word.

           EXT. BAR - NIGHT

           Earl is making his way across the parking lot.  Cliff exits 
           the bar and follows him.

                                 CLIFF
                        Earl.  Earl!

           Earl spins around.

                                 EARL
                        What did I say?  What did I just say?
                          (beat)
                        I said never - which clearly didn't mean 
                        now - cockblock without cause.

                        He had it coming, man.  How else can I 
                        deal with a guy like that?

                                 EARL
                        Subtlety, subversion, and sabotage.  The 
                        three esses of cockblocking.  That was 
                        obvious, ill-planned, and, most 
                        importantly, will have painful 
                        consequences that I wouldn't wish on any 
                        man.

           Earl turns and walks away.  Fisher runs up.  Cliff turns to 
           him.

                                 FISHER
                        Where'd he go?
                          (looking into darkness)
                        Damn.  The old fool did it.  He vanished 
                        mysteriously.

           A horn HONKS. Fisher and Cliff jump.  They look up and see 
           Earl in his car.  He leans out the window.

                                 EARL
                        Get the hell outta the way!

           They step aside.  He drives past them and down the road.

           INT. CLIFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Cliff enters his apartment and throws his keys on the table.  
           Fisher follows him in.

                                 FISHER
                        Earl was just being dramatic.  It ain't 
                        as bad as all that.  

           Cliff walks over to the window and exhales.

                                 RICK #2 (O.S.)
                        Damn, man!  Don't you get any pussy?

           Cliff looks up at the Ricks.

           THE RICKS' WINDOW

           The Ricks lean out, taunting Cliff.

                        your balls if you let him!  Up top, bro!

           Rick #2 holds his hand up for five but Rick #1 shakes his 
           head and goes back into their apartment.

           INT. CLIFF'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           Cliff stares up at the Ricks, fuming.

                                 CLIFF
                          (to himself)
                        How about you assholes get a life and 
                        leave me the hell alone.

           Cliff turns away.

                                 RICK #1 (O.S.)
                        What'd you say, bitch?

                        Ahh, no thanks! I . . . I got my own dog.

           Cliff winces at his own excuse.

                                 RICK #1 (O.S.)
                        Fuckin' pervert.

           Cliff nods his head in agreement and closes the window.

                                 FISHER
                        Call her.

           Cliff walks over to the phone, picks it up and dials.

           Barry White plays softly.  Cliff plugs in one last lava lamp 
           and surveys the room: bean bag chairs, lava lamps, a black 
           light and a series of psychedelic posters.

                                 FISHER
                        Well?

           Fisher steps back from a poster he has just put up: a 70's 
           black-light poster of two naked, black people with huge afros 
           making love.  Cliff looks around the room.

                        You're sure about this?  

                                 CLIFF
                        Yeah.

                                 CLIFF
                        I'm all right, Fish.

                                 FISHER
                        A'ight.  Do it to it, bro.

           They slap five.  Fisher turns to the door.  Someone knocks.

                                 CLIFF
                        She's here.

           They look at each other.

                                 CLIFF (cont'd)
                        In the closet.  In the closet.

           Fisher nods.  He jumps in the closet.

                                 FISHER
                        Listen, man, just open the door, kiss her 
                        like she's never been kissed, and end 
                        this thing.

           Cliff nods.

                                 CLIFF
                        Okay.

           Cliff closes him in the closet.  Another knock.  Cliff runs 
           his hand through his hair, adjusts his shirt, and exhales.  
           He opens the door, grabs face, and . . .

                        before I have to get serious, homes!

           A beat.  Cliff nods.  He reaches into his wallet.

                                 CLIFF
                        Okay, all I have is a fifty so . . .

           He rides away, down the hall.  Cliff closes the door and 
           exhales.  Another knock.  Cliff regains his courage, opens 
           the front door, grabs face and . . .

           Rod grabs Cliff's cheeks.

           He moves Rod toward the door.  Rod turns back.

           Fisher shakes his head.

           Cliff is still nodding.  Rod makes his way to the couch.

                        You guys want beers?

           Molly nods.  He hands her one.

                                 MOLLY
                        Cliff?

                        No.  No thanks.  I have a bit of a 
                        drinking problem.

           A pause.  Cliff thinks about what he's said.

                                 CLIFF (cont'd)
                        I mean . . .I have a problem with

                          (beat, Cliff clarifies)
                        I mean-  Last time I had a beer I pissed  
                        my pants and french kissed a dog for a 
                        dollar.

           Cliff exhales.

                        Wow.  That almost came out really wrong.

           Fisher shakes his head. 

           INT. CLIFF'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Molly is laughing hysterically.  

                                 ROD
                        And every day, I would come home from 
                        school, and my mom would ask me what 
                        happened to my underwear!

           Molly tries to stop laughing.

                                 MOLLY
                        Why didn't you just tell her?

                                 ROD
                        What was I gonna say?  Mom, pack me a 
                        better lunch because the bullies that 
                        steal it tear my underwear out of my 
                        pants whenever I get carrots?

           Molly laughs even harder.

                        I know, it's not.  I just, I bet you were 
                        so cute . . .

                        One time . . . this kid made me drink my 
                        own urine.

           He chuckles.  Molly and Rod don't.  Cliff's laughter slowly 
           trails off.

                                 ROD
                        Anyway, that's why I got into personal 
                        fitness.  I didn't think anyone should 
                        ever have to feel that helpless.

                        Wow.  That's great.

           A moment passes.  Molly looks at her watch.

                        Geeze.  I gotta get outta here.

           She stands up.  Cliff stands up and opens his mouth, but Rod 
           has beaten him to the punch.

                                 ROD
                        Well, thanks for coming over, Molly.  I 
                        had a great time.

                                 MOLLY
                        Me too.
                          (looking at Cliff)
                        With both of you.

           She heads to the door.  Rod follows her.

                                 MOLLY (cont'd)
                          (turning back)
                        I'll see you tomorrow, guys.

           Rod closes the door and walks past Cliff, into Cliff's room.

           Cliff opens his mouth to object, but stops himself.  

           EXT. CLIFF'S APARTMENT - MORNING

           The sun has risen over Cliff's complex.

           INT. CLIFF'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Rod is asleep in Cliff's bed.

           INT. CLIFF'S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Cliff is asleep on the couch.

           INT. CLOSET - MORNING

           Fisher is asleep in the closet.

           EXT. CLIFF'S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Cliff and Fisher are in Cliff's car.  Rod stands next to the 
           window.

                                 ROD
                        Thanks again for lettin' me stay.

           Cliff waves and pulls out.  Rod watches them go.  He pulls a 
           key out of his pocket and smiles, mischievously.

                                 ROD
                        I'll be seein' you.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Cliff and Fisher walk toward the entrance of the fitness 
           center.

                                 EARL (O.S.)
                        Psst.

                        Earl?

           Earl drops out of a tree behind them.  Cliff and Fisher jump.

                        Listen, I just wanted to apologize for 
                        last night.  You're new at this, and I 
                        should have been more understanding.
                          (beat)
                        People make mistakes, Cliff, and that's

                        It does matter.  It always matters.  You 
                        just broke the unspoken rule of 
                        cockblocking: never trust anyone who's

                        Knew what was gonna happen, Earl?  That 
                        your chance to make up for some mistake 
                        you made twenty years ago would get 
                        screwed up?  Well guess what?  That's my 
                        dream girl he's stealing.

           Fisher turns back to Earl, who is trying to climb back into 
           the tree.

                                 FISHER
                        Earl, man, it's obvious you can't vanish 
                        mysteriously so why don't you just stop 
                        tryin', dawg.

           Fisher heads into the building.  Earl falls from the tree and 
           hits the ground with a thud.

                        Cliff -

                                 CLIFF
                        No.  I don't need his help.  Kiss a girl.  
                        How hard is that?  
                          (beat)
                        I can handle this on my own.

           Cliff stares at Earl, hard, from across the way.

                                 CLIFF (cont'd) (V.O.)
                        But nothing could have been further from 
                        the truth.

           MONTAGE - MAJOR COCKBLOCKS: THE RISE OF ROD AND FALL OF CLIFF

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CLIFF'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Rod conspiratorially pulls a key from his pocket.  He scans 
           the hall to make sure no one is watching.  He slips the key 
           into the door, opens it, and enters.

           INT. CLIFF'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Rod appears to be wallpapering.  He smiles deviantly as he 
           applies a moist sponge to some paper on the ceiling.

           INT. CLIFF'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Cliff and Molly lay down on his bed.  He leans in for the 
           kiss, but she turns away at the last minute and looks at the 
           ceiling.  He looks up and sees pornography plastered to the 
           ceiling.  A picture of a naked woman peels off, and flutters 
           down on top of Cliff's face.

           (cid:13)           INT. LIFETIME FITNESS - DAY

           Cliff walks past the gym, and stops when he sees Rod spotting 
           Molly on the bench press.  Rod smiles and waves.

           INT. CLIFF'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Rod slips into the apartment, again.  He moves to a table, 
           sits down, and pulls a LARGE BURRITO out of a paper bag.  He 
           smiles and takes a huge bite.

           INT. CLIFF'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Cliff opens the door and lets Molly in.  He smiles, but 
           follows Molly's disgusted face to the toilette, where there 
           is a huge pile of unflushed shit.

           INT. LIFETIME FITNESS - DAY

           Cliff exits the locker room and sees Rod with his arm around 
           Molly, posing for a photograph.  The flash goes off, and the 
           photographer returns the camera to Rod.  Rod hugs Molly and  
           Cliff's heart sinks.

           INT. CLIFF'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Cliff and Molly enter his room and find a huge poster of an 
           underwear model, with Molly's face superimposed in the 
           picture.  Cliff just closes his eyes.

           INT. CLIFF'S CAR - AFTER

           Cliff exhales.

                                 CLIFF
                        I'm . . .I'm really sorry.
                          (beat)
                        I just haven't been myself, lately.

                                 MOLLY
                        Cliff . . .
                          (she searches for words)
                        I-  I don't know what happened.  I mean, 
                        I like you . . .I want to like you . . .
                          (beat)
                        Things just got weird.

                                 CLIFF
                        I know.  I know.  It's . . .See . . .

           He can't explain.

                                 CLIFF
                        Forget it.

           A pause.

                                 MOLLY
                          (nods her head, emphatically)
                        Okay.

                                 CLIFF
                        What?

                                 MOLLY
                        No, that's a good idea.  Let's just 
                        forget it.  All of it.  Start fresh.  
                        We'll hang out all day tomorrow and 
                        create some new memories.  Whattaya say?

                                 CLIFF
                        Definitely.  And I promise, things will 
                        be different.

                                 MOLLY
                        Okay.  I'll pick you up at seven.

                                 CLIFF
                        In the morning?
                          (off Molly's nod)
                        Geeze, that's early.

                                 MOLLY
                        Trust me.  The sooner we start fresh the 
                        better.

           Cliff nods.

                                 MOLLY (cont'd)
                        See you tomorrow.

           She gets out of the car. 

           EXT. MOLLY'S HOUSE - AFTER

           Cliff pulls away.  Molly walks toward her front door.  

                                 ROD
                        Molly.

           She jumps.  Rod is on the doorstep.

                        Neighborhood Watch?

                        Huh?

                        Listen, Molly, I was wondering . . .would 
                        you like to have dinner with me?

                        Yeah . . .I actually have plans tomorrow.

                                 ROD

                        Really?  Doin' what?

           INT. CLIFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Cliff enters the apartment.  He closes the door behind him.  

           INT. CLIFF'S BEDROOM - LATER

           Cliff has bedded down and is about to nod off, when there is 
           a knock at the door.

           INT. CLIFF'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           The knocking continues.  Cliff answers, and sees Rod, Devin, 
           and Mickey standing there.

                                 ROD

                        it's about time you and I sat down for a 
                        brew.  Here, have a drink!

           Rod pulls a beer from a bag.

                                 CLIFF
                        I'm really tired and, the thing is, I'm 
                        not a big drinker.

                                 ROD
                        I know.  Come on.  What's one beer gonna 
                        do?

                        If I have a beer can I go back to bed?

                        Of course.  Here, have a seat.  I'll grab 
                        you a brew.

           Cliff sits down.  Rod goes to the counter and empties half a 
           beer.  He refills it with Jack Daniels, and brings it to 
           Cliff.

                                 CLIFF
                        Thanks.
                          (sipping it)
                        Wow.  That's really strong.

                                 ROD
                        It's an ice beer.  Go on.  Drink up.

           He tips Cliff's can back for him.  A horse NEIGHS.

                                 CLIFF
                        What was that?

                        Nothin'.  Now polish this and hit the 
                        hay.

           Devin and Mickey lose it.  They die of laughter.

                        Hay is for horses!

           Cliff is totally confused.  Rod smacks Devin, who stops 
           laughing.  Cliff takes another sip, cringing as he does.

                        Let's do this.

                        The rest is just images.  Flashing

           MONTAGE - FLASHES OF IMAGES

           -Cliff being dragged by his feet.

           -A horse being led through the apartment.

           -Cliff being dressed in women's lingerie.

           -The bottle of Jack Daniels being poured on Cliff and his 
           bed.  Devin strikes a match and holds it over Cliff.  Rod 
           grabs his hand and shakes his head "no."

           -Rod places the empty bottle in Cliff's hand.

           INT. CLIFF'S APARTMENT - MORNING

           A knock.  No response.  Another knock.  Molly pushes open the 
           all ready ajar door.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Cliff?

           She looks around and moves toward his bedroom.

                        Cliff.  You ready?

           She enters his room.

                        Oh my god.

           A moment passes.  Molly emerges from the room, livid.  Cliff 
           follows her, wearing women's underwear.

                        I am so sorry you had to see this.  It's 
                        no sight for a lady.  Especially an

                        Logic would say an elephant.  Because the

                        So.  Whattaya think I should do, doc?

                        Well, Cliff, to be honest, I'm stumped.  
                        I mean, in my twenty three years as a 
                        dermatologist I've never heard a problem 
                        like this.

KID'S GYM - DAY

           The kids sit in rows, quietly.  Boris paces in front of them.  
           A LITTLE GIRL sneezes.

                        Number eight!  On the wall!

           The little girl stands up sheepishly, and walks to the wall 
           at the far end of the gym.  She stands facing it.  A pause.

                                 BETSY
                        Where's Cliff?

           Boris walks over and gets in Betsy's face.

                                 BORIS
                        Number fourteen.  Stand up.

                                 BETSY
                        My name is Betsy.

                                 BORIS
                        You are number fourteen.  Don't ask so 
                        many questions.  And get on the wall for 
                        having girl's name.

           Betsy's lip begins to quiver.  She runs out of the gym.  
           Boris turns to a small girl.

                        She will be caught.

           Fisher shakes his head.

                                 FISHER
                        Man, those kids hate that guy.  And they 
                        love you.  Come on.  If nothing else, do 
                        it for them.

           Cliff considers it.

                                 CLIFF
                        Too late, Fish.  I got my stuff all 
                        packed and I'm walking out of here while 
                        I still have my pride.

           Fisher looks in the box.

                                 FISHER
                        That box is empty, yo.

                        So it is.  I just want people to know I'm 
                        quitting.  That they won't have Cliff 
                        Canter to push around anymore.

           A random PERSONAL TRAINER appears.

                                 PERSONAL TRAINER
                        Yo, Clint.  I need that box.

                                 CLIFF
                        Here you go, man.

           Fisher grabs Cliff.

                                 FISHER
                        Look, man, you're overreacting.  Nobody 
                        really believes you nailed that horse.

           A RANDOM GUY pats Cliff on the back and NEIGHS like a horse.

                                 FISHER (cont'd)
                        We know you didn't.

                        Who's we?  Does that include Molly?

                                 FISHER
                        Well . . .no.

                                 CLIFF
                        Then it doesn't matter.  She gave me more 
                        than enough chances, Fish.  Porn on the 
                        walls, shit in toilet . . .she gave me 
                        the benefit of the doubt.  And you know 
                        what?  I was too much of a pussy to stand 
                        up to Rod.  And now some kid's pony is in 
                        my apartment, and she thinks I deflowered 
                        it, and I can't blame her for not wanting 
                        anything to do with a guy like that.

           Cliff exits the building.  Fisher shakes his head.  Some 
           OLDER WOMEN are heading for the pool.  Fisher smiles and 
           nods.

           silent.  Molly stares at them.  She turns to Boris.

                        What?

                                 BORIS
                        She is big cry baby.  There is no room 
                        for big cry babies, here -

           Molly slaps Boris.  His lip begins to quiver.

                                 MOLLY
                        You should be ashamed of yourself.  
                        Treating children like that.

                                 BORIS
                        Sorry.

                                 MOLLY
                        And shave that beard.  Looking like a 
                        dictator is not something to be proud of.  

           He nods and runs out of the room.

           INT. LIFETIME FITNESS - LATER

           Molly is walking down the hall with Betsy.  Earl sees her and 
           rushes over, but Rod gets there first.  Earl dives behind a 
           plant and listens in.

           He grabs her wrist.

                                 ROD
                        Wait a minute.  Molly, we're friends.  
                        And when you tell me it's not a good 
                        time, that throws up red flags that say, 
                        "I need to be with people right now."

                        You need to get out.  And I'm just the 
                        man to take you. 

           He lifts her chin up but, because her face is already up, he 
           forces it toward the ceiling.

                                 ROD (cont'd)

                        Great.  Tomorrow.  We do the town.

           She smiles and leaves.  Rod watches her go. He looks in the 
           mirror and blows himself a kiss.

                                 ROD
                        Rod the Bod, you are the ladies' god.  Up 
                        top, stud!

           He high fives with his reflection.

           Cliff falls down on his bed.  He rolls over and finds himself 
           face to face with Earl.  He leaps up.

                                 CLIFF
                        AHH!

           Earl awakens.

                                 EARL
                        I was wondering when you'd come back.

                                 CLIFF
                        Jesus, what the hell are you doing here?  
                        You scared me half to death!

                                 EARL
                        We need to talk.

                        There's nothing left to talk about.  It's

                        No, you were right.  I broke the rules. I 
                        played his game.  I started a war, and 
                        Rod finished it.

                        He finally talked Molly into going on a

                        You and I know that, but she doesn't.

                        Look, I can't give Rod credit for much, 
                        but one thing I can say is that he knows 
                        how to land women.  And, on top of that, 
                        he's a great cockblocker.  And this one 
                        was text book.  He drives her out of your 
                        arms and right into his.  It's like 
                        getting a girl on the rebound without the 
                        baggage of her previous relationship.

                        Oh, great.  Well, as if this couldn't get 
                        any worse -

                                 EARL
                        Wait.  Listen.  This is our chance to set 
                        this right.  This is our chance to 
                        eliminate Rod from the picture for good.

                        How?  Are you gonna tell her all the 
                        horrible things you know about Rod?  And 
                        then what?  You look like the desperate 
                        man he's painted you as, willing to do 
                        anything to win her over.

                        No, my friend, we're going to win this

                        Because what I am about to tell you is 
                        over twenty years of my rumination on how 
                        to counter the cockblock.  It is so 
                        secret in nature, that I can only reveal 
                        it's intricacies to you at a location

           Cliff, Earl, and Fisher sit at a table.  Loads of overweight 
           women with bad hair bowl behind them.

                                 FISHER
                        Damn, those are some husky bitches.

                                 EARL
                        Like I said.  Ne'er a man to be found.

                        Okay.  Here it is.  See, the "cockblock" 
                        is based on the principal of blocking 
                        another man's cock.  But, even in it's 
                        finest execution, the cockblock only 
                        succeeds in making the guy look bad.  See 
                        there's nothing to stop him from trying 
                        to get back into the girl's good graces.

                        But the bushwhack reverses that 
                        principal.  In essence you are whacking a 
                        woman's bush: you're making her look bad, 
                        so that the guy is turned off.

                        So instead of the chick being freaked out 
                        by the dude, the dude is freaked out by 
                        the chick, and he doesn't want nothin' to 
                        do with her no more.

                        What can I say.  The "bushwhack" is my

                                 EARL
                        That may be true.  But if I can see my 
                        brainchild executed in my lifetime, I can

                        Hey, Fish.

                                 FISHER
                        Listen, I heard about everything. . .
                          (touching her arm)
                        And if you ever need to talk, I'm here.

                                 MOLLY
                        Thanks.

           She walks away.  Fisher proudly holds up her purse.

           INT. TOWEL STORAGE ROOM - AFTER

           Fisher enters and finds Cliff and Earl.

                                 EARL
                        Did yo get it?

           Fisher tosses the purse to Earl.

                                 CLIFF
                        What?  How -

                                 FISHER
                        I didn't always work at a gym, you know.

                                 EARL
                        Okay.  You guys know what to do?

           They nod. 

                                 EARL (cont'd)
                        Let's do it.

           They all put hands in the middle.

                                 EARL (cont'd)
                        One . . . two . . . three . . .

           INT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           Rod is freshening up.  He is wearing a polo shirt and khaki 
           pants.  Earl and Cliff converse, loudly around the corner.

                        What?  About Molly?

           Rod's eyes perk up.

                                 CLIFF (cont'd) (O.S.)
                        To be honest I'm a little relieved.  I 
                        don't how much more rectal bleeding I 
                        could have taken?

                                 ROD
                          (to himself)
                        Rectal bleeding?

           He looks around the corner.

           AROUND THE CORNER

           Earl is holding an ice-pack on Cliff's bare ass.  Rod's eyes 
           go wide.

                                 CLIFF
                        She was really aggressive with that 
                        thing.

                                 EARL
                        I just can't believe she carries it in 
                        her purse.

                                 CLIFF
                        Well, you can't blame her.  I think she 
                        just misses having one of her own.  You 
                        know since the operation.

           Rod's eyes narrow.

           INT. LIFETIME FITNESS - LATER

           Rod is striding toward the exit.  Fisher stops him.

                                 FISHER
                        Excuse me, Rod?

                        What?

                                 FISHER
                        Whoa.  Little tense are we?  Nervous 
                        about the big date?

                                 ROD
                        How do you know about that?

                          (beat)
                        Anyway, Molly left her purse here, so if 
                        you wouldn't mind giving it to her, 
                        that'd be great.

           Earl sets the purse on the counter with a THUD.  The sound of 
           metal hitting the counter reverberates in Rod's ears.  He 
           picks up the purse and takes off.

                                 FISHER (cont'd)
                        Thanks.

           INT. ROD'S CAR - AFTER

           Rod drives along.  He digs through the purse and pulls out a 
           giant, metallic dildo.  He stares at it in amazement.

                                 ROD
                        One of her own . . .before the operation?

           He hits it against the dashboard, which cracks.

                                 ROD
                        Good god.

           He adjusts himself in his seat.  He looks at it for a moment, 
           then reaches into her purse, pulling out a small vial.  He 
           picks up and reads it.  His eyes narrow.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - EVENING

           Cliff's car pulls off to the side of the road, a few doors 
           down from Molly's house. 

           INT. CLIFF'S CAR - LATER

           Cliff is in the driver's seat, Earl is in shotgun, and Fisher 
           is in back.

                                 CLIFF
                        Gonorrhea?

                        genital corrective surgery, and a good

           EXT. MOLLY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Rod gets out of his 1980 Camaro with T-tops, and walks to 
           Molly's door.  She comes out and follows him to his car, 
           noticing the license plate: HOT ROD.

                        Now, we sit back and watch it all unfold.

           Cliff starts the car and they follow the car.

           MONTAGE - ROD AND MOLLY HAVING A GOOD TIME

           -Laughing and eating at an outdoor restaurant.  At a nearby 
           table, Cliff looks at Earl, who checks his watch and nods his 
           head.

           -Rod and Molly playing mini-golf, seemingly having a good 
           time.  Cliff stares at Earl, who taps his watch.

           -Rod and Molly at the beach, playing Frisbee.

           EXT. CLIFF'S CAR - AFTERNOON

           The car is parked at the edge of the beach, next to the pier.

           INT. CLIFF'S CAR - AFTERNOON

           Fisher has a pair of binoculars.

                                 EARL
                        Kissing.

                                 CLIFF
                        What?

           Cliff grabs the binoculars and looks.

           THROUGH THE BINOCULARS

           It does look as though they are kissing.

           INT. CLIFF'S CAR - SAME TIME

           Cliff throws down the binoculars.

                                 CLIFF
                        That's it.  I'm sorry, Earl.  But this 
                        just isn't gonna work.

           Cliff gets out of the car and takes off, toward the pier.

           EXT. THE PIER - SAME TIME

           Cliff is walking at a clipped pace toward the pier.

           INT. CLIFF'S CAR - SAME TIME

           Fisher is looking through the binoculars.

                        Earl, I don't know man, looks to me like 
                        they're just talkin'.

                                 EARL
                        Oh, they are.

           Earl smiles.

                                 FISHER
                        You lied to him?

                                 EARL
                        I had to do something to get him off his 
                        ass.

                                 FISHER
                        Damn, Earl.  That boy's gonna get his ass 
                        kicked.

           Earl smiles and nods.  His smile fades.

                                 EARL
                        You think?

           They jump out of the car and take off after Cliff.

           EXT. THE PIER - NIGHT

           Molly and Rod are at the end of the pier, eating ice-cream 
           and talking.

                                 MOLLY
                        You know, Rod.  I was really wrong about 
                        you.  I mean, when I first met you, I 
                        thought you were like this sleazy, gym 
                        guy with a mullet.

                                 ROD
                        What's a mullet?

           A beat.

                                 MOLLY
                        But, I guess I was wrong.  I mean, you're 
                        really a sweet guy.

           Cliff approaches.

                        Cliff?

           Fisher and Earl have nearly caught up, but stop ten feet away 
           from Cliff.  He makes eye contact with them and Fisher moves 
           to help, but Earl grabs his arm and holds him back.

                                 ROD
                        Holy shit, what are you doin' here?  Did 
                        you follow us, you little horse-fuckin' 
                        pervert?

                                 CLIFF
                        No.

                        Yes.  Okay, fine.  I followed you.
                          (beat)
                        Aren't you disgusted by her?

           Molly's eyes go wide in surprise.

                                 MOLLY
                        Excuse me?

                                 CLIFF
                        I mean she rectally ravages men with a 
                        metallic dildo, she's got a raging case 
                        of gonorrhea, and . . . and she's had 
                        corrective surgery on her penis, for 
                        god's sake!

                                 MOLLY
                        What?

                        Doesn't that turn you off in the least?

                                 ROD
                        Actually, I was excited we had so much in 
                        common.

                                 MOLLY
                        What?

           Fisher looks at Earl.

                                 EARL
                        Well that backfired.

           Cliff just stands there for a moment.  He looks to Earl, who 
           is now standing amidst the crowd that has gathered.

                                 CLIFF
                        My name is Cliff.

                                 ROD
                        What are you talking about?

                          (turning to Rod)
                        My name is Cliff.  Not Clint.  Cliff.  
                        And you make me sick.  You are hanging 
                        out with the coolest girl on the planet, 
                        and all you can do is spit out lines that 
                        are about as sincere as a greeting card.

                                 SECOND TEENAGER
                        It's true, man.  

                                 FIRST TEENAGER
                        Yeah.  He's a total cheese ball.

           The teenagers walk off.

                                 CLIFF
                        And the worst part is, you don't even 
                        really like her.  You just want to play 
                        her, and then throw her away like a used 
                        condom.

                                 ROD
                        Who said anything about throwing away 
                        used condoms?

                        That's what I'm talking about.  You're 
                        not a lady's man, Rod.  And you never 
                        will be.  And cockblocking guys like me 
                        is just your way of making up for your 
                        own shortcomings as a man.

           Cliff tries to move.  Earl stops him.

                                 EARL
                        He's right, kid.  It's the unwritten rule 
                        of cockblocking.  You can never tell a 
                        female that it's going on.

                                 CLIFF
                        I thought it was never trust anyone who's 
                        cockblocked you?

                        What about never cockblock a cockblocker.

                                 ROD
                        That's the golden rule.

           Cliff thinks about this for a moment, then shakes his head.

                                 CLIFF
                        You know what?  I don't care.  These are 
                        stupid rules for a practice that doesn't

                        Molly, this has all been one stupid 
                        display of testosterone.

                        I was wearing gloves.

                        Wait a minute, aren't you flattered?  
                        That I went to such lengths to be with

                        Dr. Molly, pullin' a little reverse 
                        psychology.  I like that.

                        No.  It's not reverse psychology, it's . 
                        . .forward psychology.

                        Wait, so, what you're telling me is that 
                        the horse and the condom is a deal 
                        breaker, and your anger is not a thinly

                        gonna work out.  The timing is just 
                        wrong.  It's not you it's me.

           Earl snaps the towel once again, wrapping it around Rod's 
           head.  Rod grabs at his face, but Earl simply gives a good 
           tug, sending Rod reeling toward the end of the pier.

           Fisher's hand reaches out of the water, grabbing a ladder.  
           He has the obese woman in his arms.  The crowd cheers.

           Fisher starts the engine.  He turns back to Cliff and waves.

           Molly looks at Cliff and smiles.  They kiss under the setting

           Fisher's lap, and they drive off together.

           Molly and Cliff are kissing in front of the window.  They

                        Just ignore them.

           Cliff nods.  He leans in closer.

                                 RICK #1 (O.S.)
                        Lick her butt, dude!

           Cliff tries hard to tune them out.

                                 RICK #2 (O.S.)
                        Make her fart on you, man!

           They high five.  Cliff pulls back.

           Molly turns to the open window.

                          (yelling)
                        Why don't you two assholes go out and 
                        find your own girls and show a little

                        masturbate tonight!

           A pause.

                                 RICK #1
                        Sorry.

                        We're sorry.

           The sound of a window closing.  Cliff is stunned.

                        You've had big night. I figured I'd

           They lean in and kiss, long and good.  

           INT. LIFETIME FITNESS - MORNING

           Cliff and Molly enter, together.  They look totally happy, 
           and totally disheveled.  The female bowler from earlier 
           approaches them.

                                 FEMALE BOWLER
                        Cliff!

           INT. KID'S GYM - DAY

           The are sitting in rows, quietly.   Fisher enters with Cliff

                                 KIDS
                        CLIFF!

           They mob him.  Boris approaches Molly.  She looks at his 
           face.  He has shaved the beard, which has been reduced to a 
           Hitler style mustache.  Molly just stares at him.

                                 BORIS
                          (smiling)
                        I shaved beard, like you said.  It's much 
                        better now, no?  

           Molly is speechless.  Fisher steps in.

           Boris looks at Molly and smiles.

                        Thank you.

                        I feel like new man.  

           Boris puts on his sunglasses and exits.

                        Are you sure we should let him go,

           EXT. THE STREET - MORNING

           Boris stands on the street trying to hail a cab  Down the 
           way, a group of Hasids notice Boris.  To them, he appears to 
           be "seig heiling" a cab.  He turns to them and smiles, 
           kindly.    

           The Hasids smile at each other, and a chain drops out of one 
           of their robes.  They start toward him.

           INT. KID'S GYM - MORNING

           The kids quiet and gather around Cliff.

                                 CLIFF
                        Okay, guys, I have a very special guest 
                        today . . . professional bowler . . . 
                        Betsy Jones.

           The female bowler enters to applause from the kids.  Betsy's 
           eyes go wide.  A SMALL GIRL pokes Betsy.

                                 SMALL GIRL
                        Another boy named Betsy, Betsy!

           A SMALL BOY leans over to Betsy.

                                 SMALL BOY
                        You could be a bowler, too, Betsy!

                        Shh.  Like you said, I'm full of secrets.

           They embrace for a passionate kiss.  Earl watches on, 
           proudly.  A tear forms in his eye.

                        There's the bravest young man I've ever 
                        met.  He faced a cockblock the likes of 
                        which I've never seen.  And he won, using 
                        the best defense their is.  Confidence.

                                 FIRST TEENAGER
                        Cockblock?  Is that like when I do 
                        whatever my girlfriend tells me because 
                        I'm afraid she'll withhold sex if I 
                        don't?

           Earl smiles broadly.  He puts his arm around the teenager.

                        No, son, that's called "pussy whipped."  
                        And that's a whole other story.

           A whip CRACKS.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
