           INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE -- DAY

           DETECTIVE SERGEANT THOMAS BRANT sits across a desk from DR. 
           LEONARD. Brant hails from Ireland. Mid thirties, powerfully 
           built, a pit-bull.

                                 DR. LEONARD
                        Now Sergeant, I’d like you to 
                        tell me once again about your 
                        violent urges.

           Brant observes a large “Thank you for Not Smoking” sign as 
           he whips out a pack of Weights. Cranks a battered lighter, 
           FIRES UP, exhaling deeply. 

                                 DR. LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        I must insist you extinguish 
                        that.

                                 BRANT
                        And you’ll do what exactly if I 
                        don’t -- arrest me?

           A cloud of smoke rises. The doctor sighs, makes a note on 
           Brant’s chart with a heavy gold pen.

                                 DR. LEONARD
                        I’m not sure you realize the 
                        gravity of your situation -- 

                                 BRANT
                        Nice pen.

                                 DR. LEONARD
                        Sergeant?

                                 BRANT
                        Nice pen I said. Says a lot about 
                        you.

                                 DR. LEONARD
                        Is that so? Pray tell.

                                 BRANT
                        You like a solid phallic symbol 
                        between your fingers.

                                 DR. LEONARD
                        Sergeant Brant, you’ve been 
                        charged with bugging the 
                        Superintendant’s office, 
                        brutality by an accused rapist, 
                        demanding freebies from a Pizza 
                        Express -- should I go on? My 
                        report will be a major factor in 
                        whether you remain in the Force.

           Brant shoots to his feet, startles the doctor.
                                 DR. LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        Sergeant Brant...sit down.

           Brant moves around the desk, plants his right foot on the 
           doctor’s chair like he wants a shoe shine, blows a plume of 
           smoke up Dr. Leonard’s significant nose.

                                 BRANT
                        Thing is Doc, this is the only 
                        work I can do. If I get bounced 
                        I’m sure I’d do something truly 
                        reckless.

                                 DR. LEONARD
                        Are you threatening me, sergeant?

           Brant doesn’t move. Dr. Leonard wafts the smoke away.

                                 DR. LEONARD (CONT’D)
                        I should think not.

           Then BAM!...Brant HEAD-BUTTS the doc on the ridge of the 
           nose. Back goes the doctor, arse over feet, chair along 
           with him. 

           Brant is rapidly opening desk draws, finds what he’s 
           looking for: bottles and bottles of booze. It’s a mini off 
           license. Whisky, gin, vodka -- all the big boys.

                                 BRANT
                        Knew it!

           Brant yanks the doctor up by his lapel, rights the chair, 
           pouring a shot of GLENFIDDICH with his free hand -- SMASHES 
           the doctor’s forehead into the desk, sticks him before the 
           shot. 

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Get that down you, Frasier. Go 
                        on, don’t be shy.

           The DAZED doctor does what he’s told. Brant pours again.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, now you’re cooking.

           The doctor knocks back shot 2. Brant leans over him, fixes 
           the doctor’s tie, straightens his lapel.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Christ, look at you -- a new man.
                              (then)
                        I’ll leave you to it.

           Brant is out of the office without a backward glance.
           INT. WAITING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           A pretty SECRETARY at a desk. Brant strides through.

                                 BRANT
                        He’s asked not to be disturbed 
                        for the next hour. 

           PHONE BOX -- MOMENTS LATER

           Brant COLLIDES with a phone box. Snatches the receiver, 
           dials numbers from memory --

                                 DI CREST’S VOICE
                        Hello?

                                 BRANT
                        DI Crest please.

                                 DI CREST’S VOICE
                        Speaking.

                                 BRANT
                        DI Crest, I hate to rat out a 
                        fellow officer...it’s Dr. 
                        Leonard, our shrink.
                              (a pause)
                        He’s drinking on the job. Even as 
                        we speak he’s got his tongue down 
                        a bottle of malted.

                                 DI CREST’S VOICE 
                        I see. Your name, officer?

           Brant thinks a sec.

                                 BRANT
                        PC McDonald.

           And hangs up. Face to face with an advertisement.

           “Madam with Whip Expertise, Requires Strong Male For 
           Disciplinary Lessons. Ask for Kitty.”

           SOUND EFFECT: A cracking whip. Then briefly: The Rawhide 
           theme song: “Rollin’ Rollin’ Rollin’...”

           Brant smiles.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Oh yeah...

           He writes down the number with Dr. Leonard’s gold pen.
                                 THE SUPER (V.O.)
                        Brant is for the high jump.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE SUPER’S OFFICE -- DAY

           CHIEF SUPERINTENDANT BROWN sits behind his enormous desk. 
           The Super in his fifties. Thinning hair dyed black. 

           CHIEF INSPECTOR ROBERTS stands before him. Roberts in his 
           late fifties, slick gray hair, an imposing figure. Right 
           now he’s getting a bollocking.

                                 THE SUPER
                        I blame you, Roberts.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Yes sir.

                                 THE SUPER
                        How many times have I told you to 
                        reign Brant in?

                                 ROBERTS
                        Many...many times, sir.

                                 THE SUPER
                        I don’t care for your manner, 
                        Roberts.

                                 ROBERTS
                        No sir.

           The PHONE RINGS, the Super snaps up the receiver.

                                 THE SUPER
                        What?
                              (a pause)
                        Yes, he’s right here.
                              (a pause)
                        I see.

           The Super slowly replaces the receiver, a shift in his 
           energy.

                                 THE SUPER (CONT’D)
                        Take a seat, Chief Inspector.

           Roberts doesn’t like the sound of this one bit. The Super 
           removes a bottle and two glasses from his desk drawer, 
           pours a big shot for himself, a bigger one for Roberts.

                                 THE SUPER (CONT’D)
                        Drink that like a good man.

           Roberts downs the shot.
                                 THE SUPER (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid I have some bad news.
                              (then)
                        Your wife...she’s been in a car 
                        accident.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Is it serious?

                                 THE SUPER 
                        She’s dead.

           Roberts stares into his empty glass. The Super is back 
           pouring.

                                 ROBERTS
                        How did it happen?

                                 THE SUPER
                        She was rear-ended in Dulwich. 
                        Killed instantly.

           Roberts takes in the news, sinks the second shot. 

                                 THE SUPER (CONT’D)
                        We’ll get you home. Your boy will 
                        have to be told.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Boy?

                                 THE SUPER
                        Yes, your son.

                                 ROBERTS 
                        I have a daughter.

                                 THE SUPER
                        ‘Course you do. My memory isn’t 
                        the machine it once was. Let’s 
                        get you going, eh?

           The Super comes round his desk as Roberts staggers to his 
           feet. Now a confession.

                                 ROBERTS
                        I never liked her, you know?

                                 THE SUPER
                              (a pause)
                        It’s shock, Chief Inspector. You 
                        don’t mean that.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Listen up, you prick -- Christ, 
                        you’re so used to barking orders 
                        you don’t hear anybody. 
                              (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROBERTS (CONT'D)
                        I loved Fiona -- I just didn’t 
                        like her very much.

                                 THE SUPER
                        I’m going to forget that last 
                        outburst. We’ll put it down to 
                        trauma.

           A knock on the door.

                                 THE SUPER (CONT’D)
                        Come in.

           PC McDONALD breezes in. McDonald is a handsome Scot, blond 
           and blue-eyed, eager to impress, too eager. His accent is 
           flavoured with a Sean Connery-esque burr. 

                                 THE SUPER (CONT’D)
                        Ah, PC McDonald, good. Please see 
                        to it that the Chief Inspector 
                        gets home and stay with him.

                                 MCDONALD
                        Yes sir.

           INT. VOLVO -- DAY

           McDonald and Roberts climb into a Volvo. McDonald adjusts 
           his rearview mirror. Checks himself out, then checks out 
           Roberts in the backseat.

           Roberts still in shock. He catches McDonald’s eye.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Got a cigarette?

                                 MCDONALD
                        Don’t smoke, sir.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Me neither -- what the fuck has 
                        that got to do with anything?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. POLICE STATION -- DAY

           PORTER NASH climbs the steps in front of the police 
           station. Nash is a handsome and openly gay sergeant. Mid-
           thirties, blond, once described as a young Michael York. 

           Above the entrance we see the Metropolitan Police motto: 
           “Working Together for a Safer London.” Nash heads inside.
           FRONT DESK

           Nash walks up to the Duty Sergeant, a barrel-chested man in 
           his sixties, name of INGLIS. 

                                 NASH
                        I’m Porter Nash. Superintendant 
                        Brown said to talk to you about 
                        getting a locker. 

           INT. CHANGING ROOM 

           Nash loads items into his locker as he’s pelted with 
           HATEFUL looks from his new colleagues. Nash is smart. He 
           knows the score. 

           INT. TOILET

           Nash strides into the toilet, pulls up at an item of 
           GRAFFITI scrawled on the wall, freshly sprayed, one or two 
           letters still running: 

           “PORTER NASH SUCKS COCKS.” 

           INT. CANTEEN 

           The first coffee-break of the morning and the canteen is 
           jammed. Nash enters, a hush falls. All eyes on the new man. 

           No one wants to miss this. They know Nash has seen the 
           graffiti, what’s he going to do? A couple of coppers have 
           taken bets, reckon he’ll crack, burst into tears.

           Nash crosses to the counter, says to the tea lady, GLADYS:

                                 NASH (CONT’D)
                        Tea and two sugars, please.

           Old Gladys hasn’t had a “please” since 1986, she admires 
           Nash’s manners. He receives his tea, walks back across to 
           the room -- no ones taken their eyes off him -- stops at 
           the door to address the crowd. Total silence now.

                                 NASH (CONT’D)
                        Even I’d drawer the line at 
                        blowing Brant. 

           Nash turns on his heels, heads out. A moment. Then:

           Rapturous APPLAUSE, howls of APPROVAL.

           Nash is in. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. CAR BOOT SALE -- CLAPHAM COMMON -- DAY

           Our first look at our killer, BARRY WEISS, a nasty piece of 
           work, brown hair shaved to a grade 1, over six feet tall, 
           muscles. He looks like he could go two rounds with a T-Rex. 

           Weiss is patrolling a car boot sale, hands in his pockets.

           A couple of SOMALIANS are selling dog toys out of the back 
           of a yellow Datsun. It’s a front. Weiss walks up, sifts 
           through the toys indifferently: rubber balls, bones, bells.

                                 WEISS
                        Got anything for a Pekinese?

           The Somalians share a look.

           DATSUN  -- LATER

           The first Somalian stands by the car, on look-out.

           Inside the Datsun, Weiss watches the second Somalian remove 
           an object from the glove compartment wrapped in an oil 
           cloth. Uncovers it to reveal: A GLOCK. 

           Weiss takes the gun, handles it with brutish awe. A 9mm 
           killing machine. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           ESTABLISHING SHOT -- CREMATORIUM -- DAY

           A big, nondescript building resembling a bank. 

           INT. CREMATORIUM -- SAME

           Chief Inspector Roberts and Detective Brant stand before a 
           coffin. A couple of ATTENDANTS remove flowers. Brant 
           produces a HIP FLASK.

                                 BRANT
                        Get that down yah.

           Roberts drinks, grimaces, the booze burning.

                                 ROBERTS
                        My daughter wouldn’t come.

                                 BRANT
                        Smart girl.

                                 ROBERTS
                        You think I should have gone for 
                        a burial?
                                 BRANT
                        Nah, it’s all the same deal. 
                        You’re saving a few bob, the 
                        misses would be pleased.

           WELSH CHOIR MUSIC plays over the sound system. It’s some 
           God awful boy band. One of the attendants steps forward.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Mr. Roberts, it’s time.

           Roberts is too distraught to move. Brant leads him to the 
           coffin, takes Roberts’ hand and places it on the box. He 
           goes ahead and speaks for him.

                                 BRANT
                        We’ll miss you, love.

           They step back. CRANK of the conveyor belt, the coffin on 
           its way...

           INT. POLICE STATION -- DAY

           PC McDonald arriving at work, bright eyed and bushy tailed.

           He saunters into the changing room, then --  WOAH! -- half 
           staggers, recoiling: there’s a DEAD RAT pinned to his 
           locker.

           INT. CANTEEN

           McDonald crossing the room with a cup of tea and a bacon 
           sandwich. Arrives at a table where some fellow PC’s are 
           gleefully swapping stories about Detective Brant. 

                                 MCDONALD
                        Morning boys.

           No sooner is McDonald sitting than the PC’s are STANDING, 
           looking at him like he’s dog shit. McDonald frowns, 
           clueless.

                                 MCDONALD (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Sarge, what’s going on?

           STATION CORRIDOR -- LATER

           McDonald has approached Inglis, the Duty Sergeant. Inglis 
           is a fellow Scot.

                                 INGLIS
                        Like you don’t know.
                                 MCDONALD
                        Sarge, come on, cut me some 
                        slack. We’re from the same town. 
                        I was pals with your Tommy. Did I 
                        do something?

                                 INGLIS
                        You shopped the Doc.

                                 MCDONALD
                        I did what?
                              (then)
                        Doc? What doc?

                                 INGLIS
                        The one you’re seeing, the 
                        shrink. 

           McDonald just stares at Inglis, perplexed.

                                 INGLIS (CONT’D)
                        Now come on, lad, own up. You 
                        called CIB and dropped him right 
                        in it. They went over there the 
                        other day and found him pissed as 
                        Oliver Reed, trying to get his 
                        leg over his secretary.

                                 MCDONALD
                        I wasn’t seeing any shrink.

                                 INGLIS
                        Whatever. The word on you is that 
                        you’re a fink, McDonald. A rat.

           Inglis walks off.

           INT. MINICAB -- DAY

           Outside the crematorium, Brant and Roberts slide into a

                                 BRANT

                        Horses. Quick as you can.

           The minicab pulls away. Brant turns to Roberts.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get you legless.
           INT. MINICAB -- LATER

           Pulling up outside a rundown pub...

           Roberts ducks out, Brant leans in -- flashes his WARRANT 
           CARD to the DRIVER -- 

                                 DRIVER
                        Not even a tip?

                                 BRANT
                        You got lost. Twice. Here’s a 
                        tip: buy a fucking A to Z.

           INT. PUB -- NIGHT

           Roberts and Brant ensconced at a table. The pub is bang 
           next door to a mental asylum so no extra credit points for 
           guessing the caliber of clientele. Brant fits right in. 

           Pints, shots, cigarettes. A blur of colour and grief. 
           Roberts almost coping. Almost.

           This next bit down the line, the night well underway, 
           Roberts and Brant as pissed as newts.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Where’s Fiona?

                                 BRANT
                              (not following)
                        What?

                                 ROBERTS
                        The urn, Brant -- where the 
                        fuck’s the urn?

           Brant looks at the table. Nothing but empty glasses and a 
           heap of butts in the ashtray. 

                                 BRANT
                        Someone must have nicked it.

           Roberts opens his mouth, too stunned to speak. Brant starts 
           laughing raucously. After a moment Roberts joins in.

           WPC ELIZABETH FALLS enters her flat. She’s black, early 
           thirties, a tight police uniform accentuating her curves. 
           Falls has been around the block more than once, but it 
           suits her. She makes trouble look good. 

           She collects a pile of post at her feet and flicks through 
           it, stops at an envelope marked: “Metropolitan Police.” 

           Opens the letter, “Dear Ms. Falls, we regret to inform 
           you...”

           Falls has changed out of her uniform. She wears a Tupac 
           Shakur T-shirt, sipping Jack Daniels and Coke, dialling 
           numbers on her cordless phone.

           He plucks his Glock from a table, poses in the full length

           He spies a young POLICEWOMAN outside a Chicken Palace doing 
           up her tunic, strides toward her. 

           Pulls out the Glock -- BAM! -- caps the Policewoman in the

           broke his stride --

           He turns the corner fast, adrenaline surging through him, 
           his brain electric. Strokes the Glock though his jeans.

           She gives him a twirl -- looking foxy, a white sheath, 
           heals. Pity Nash plays for the other team. 
           Falls sits, taking in Nash.

           the walls. Actual books on a bookshelf. 
           Brant has awoken on the sofa. In his clothes. Holding a 
           tumbler of cooking sherry. A classic hangover: big, 
           roaring, merciless.

           He sticks The Pogues on -- crosses into the kitchen and 
           flips through a wad of take-out menus... spies two YOUNG 
           PUNKS out the window trying to break into his car.

           Brant plucks a wooden hockey stick -- a HURLEY -- from the 
           living room wall, heads out.

           EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

           Brant steps up.

                                 BRANT
                        Help you, lads?

           The two Punks turn and straighten. Well whatdoyouknow.... 
           WIGGERS. White kids acting like they’re from the hood. 
           Brant is flat out delighted.

                                 WIGGER 1
                        Give us your wallet, bitch!

           Brant swings the hurley -- takes out the first Wigger below 
           the knees, he goes down in a moaning mess.

                                 BRANT
                        This, mates, is a hurley...made 
                        from the finest ash. If you don’t 
                        know, and shame on you that you 
                        don’t, it is used in the Irish 
                        game of hurling, a cross between 
                        hockey and murder.

           WIGGER 2 pulls out a Stanley Knife, goes:

                                 WIGGER 2
                        Gonna cut you, honky...gonna cut 
                        you bad.

                                 BRANT
                        Honky?

           Brant loves that, fires up a Weight. Wigger 1 is trying to 
           stand. Brant kicks him in the face without looking at him, 
           says to Wigger 2:

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Is that a Stanley? Jesus wept, 
                        I’ve been trying to get hold of 
                        one of those babes for like... 
                        ages. I have this carpet that 
                        keeps turning up.
           Wigger 2 lunges with the Stanley -- Brant simply steps 
           aside, let’s the hurley talk, CRUSHES the kid’s nose -- 
           let’s the hurley talk some more, CRUSHES the kid’s balls.

           Brant hunkers down and goes through Wigger 1’s pockets -- 
           uncovers fifty quid in notes and a wrap of cocaine.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Alleluia.

           Searches Wigger 2. Uncovers another fifty, another wrap of 
           coke...and a flavored condom. 

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        I like you two, you’ve got your 
                        priorities straight.

           He stands, pausing to take in the two kids squirming side 
           by side, offers a word of reassurance: 

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        You think you hurt now, wait till 
                        morning.

           INT. BRANT’S FLAT

           Brant sticks the condom in the spice rack, chops a fat line 
           of coke -- about to do the honors when the phone rings. He 
           snaps it up. 

                                 BRANT
                        What?

                                 THE SUPER’S VOICE
                        Sergeant Brant! Where’ve you 
                        been? Get your botty down to the 
                        Oval, an officer is down.

                                 BRANT
                        Sir?

                                 THE SUPER’S VOICE
                        On the double, sergeant!

           The Super hangs up. Brant stares at the dead phone.

                                 BRANT
                        Botty?

           Dips out of the shot...an ALMIGHTY SNORT. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. ROVER -- NIGHT

           Nash and Falls driving to the crime scene in Nash’s car, 
           passing drug dealers, junkies, tramps with shivering dogs. 

           This seems a million miles away from iconic Big Ben London. 
           In reality it’s just up the street.

                                 NASH
                        So much for clubbing. Sorry 
                        Falls. 

                                 FALLS
                        There’ll be other nights.

                                 NASH
                        I mean about the sergeant’s exam. 
                        Sorry you didn’t pass.

                                 FALLS
                        Brant said they’d never flunk a 
                        black chick. 

                                 NASH
                        Brant was wrong. 

                                 FALLS
                        Brant’s never wrong.  

           Falls watches the riffraff out the window. Nash overtaking 
           cars, nosing through red lights -- 

                                 NASH 
                        When I was stationed at 
                        Kensington there was a sergeant 
                        named Carlisle -- one of the best 
                        cops I’ve ever known. I was 
                        taking a lot of flak for being 
                        gay...one day Carlisle took me 
                        aside, gave me a bit of advice 
                        I’ve never forgotten, said, “Make 
                        them deal with it. Put it right 
                        in their faces. Whatever you do 
                        don’t hide who you are.”

                                 FALLS
                        Did it work?

                                 NASH
                        Yes and no. Point is, Carlisle 
                        showed me it’s about one thing at 
                        the end of the day. It’s about 
                        being a copper. Everything else 
                        is irrelevant.

                                 FALLS
                        He was white, hetero?
                                 NASH
                        Yes.

                                 FALLS
                        Easy for him to say then.

           Nash takes a deep breath. This next bit is hard for him. 
           His words underscored with rage.

                                 NASH
                        He was decapitated in a high-
                        speed chase. The driver of the 
                        stolen vehicle was fourteen. You 
                        think the colour of Carlisle’s 
                        skin mattered then, or what his 
                        sexual orientation was?

                                 FALLS
                        Sorry.

           They are coming up on the crime scene, a mess of blue 
           lights, police cars, chaos.

                                 NASH 
                        Word is out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Chief Inspector Roberts buried in his armchair, sipping 
           whisky, trying to fend off the shakes. 

           Across the room the TV is on. A REPORTER speaks from a 
           bustling crime scene...

                                 REPORTER ON TV
                        The dead policewoman has been 
                        identified as Sandra Miller of 
                        Camberwell --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CRIME SCENE -- OVAL TUBE STATION -- NIGHT

           CAMERA makes a quick SWEEP of the area, takes in: POLICE 
           CARS, UNIFORMS, DRONE of a circling HELICOPTER, a CROWD of 
           spectators and reporters penned behind a crisscross of 
           yellow tape. A TENT has been erected. 

           It has all the pizazz and hoopla of a film premiere.

           We find Falls and Nash at the entrance to the tent. SANDRA 
           MILLER’S BODY lying flat under a tarp flecked with blood, 
           her boots sticking out the end. Falls has to look away.
           Sound of a WOLF WHISTLE. Falls swings around: it’s Brant.

                                 BRANT
                        That is some dress.

                                 FALLS
                        You look shocking.

           She’s not kidding. Brant’s face resembles a collapsed lung. 
           Bloodshot eyes, stubble, yesterday’s clothes. 

                                 BRANT
                        I’ve been consoling the Chief 
                        Inspector. His wife passed.

                                 FALLS
                        Yeah, I heard.

                                 NASH
                        How is the Chief Inspector?

                                 BRANT
                        Overjoyed. He just doesn’t know 
                        it yet.

           Superintendant Brown storms over, PC McDonald in tow. 

                                 THE SUPER
                        Was there something, Brant?

                                 BRANT
                        Yes sir. There’s a witness.

                                 THE SUPER
                        What, why wasn’t I told?

                                 BRANT
                        I’ve been trying to tell you for 
                        the last half hour...
                              (gestures to McDonald)
                        but your whipping boy said you 
                        were busy.

           Brant shoots a look of contempt at the Scot. Falls and Nash 
           try not to laugh. None of this lost on McDonald.

                                 THE SUPER
                        Alright, Brant -- where is this 
                        witness?

           The Super addresses the assembled officers...

                                 THE SUPER (CONT’D)
                        The rest of you -- go home, 
                        you’ll be briefed in the morning. 
           ...as he follows Brant and McDonald over to the WITNESS 
           standing by the kerb. Witness late twenties, street smart, 
           a pair of MUZZLED PITBULLS at his feet.

                                 THE SUPER (CONT’D)
                        You say you saw the Shooter?

                                 WITNESS
                        Yeah. Looks like him.

           Witness indicates McDonald. 

                                 THE SUPER
                        That’s a bloody policeman!

                                 WITNESS
                        He had the same hair, blond and 
                        cut tight, you know, like a nancy 
                        boy.

                                 THE SUPER
                        And you just happened to see the 
                        shooting? What were you doing 
                        loitering on a street corner?

                                 WITNESS
                        I sell The Big Issue.
                              (pointing)
                        Over there -- by the tube -- 
                        that’s my patch. 

                                 THE SUPER
                              (to Brant)
                        Take him to the station -- get a 
                        full statement.

                                 WITNESS
                        What about my customers? This is 
                        my busiest time -- the pubs shut, 
                        people get the guilt going.

                                 THE SUPER
                        You’ll be compensated.

                                 WITNESS
                        Yeah, like I believe that.

           The Super moves away with McDonald. Brant and Witness face 
           off. 

                                 BRANT
                        It’s you and me, boy.

           INT. MCDONALD’S CAR

           McDonald and The Super climb into McDonald’s Volvo. 
           McDonald behind the wheel, pensive, something on his mind.
                                 MCDONALD 
                        It was Brant. He’s the one who 
                        reported the shrink to CIB. I 
                        know it.

                                 THE SUPER
                        Why would Brant do that?

                                 MCDONALD
                        Because he’s Brant. He’s the rat, 
                        not me.

                                 THE SUPER 
                        Now now, careful there -- you 
                        don’t want Brant on your case. He 
                        bites...like a bastard.

                                 MCDONALD
                        I’m not afraid of him. 

                                 THE SUPER
                        I hate to be the one to say it,

           Witness seated, making himself comfy, pits curled at his

                        got attacked last Christmas at 
                        Camberwell Billiards. Couple of 
                        skinheads. You showed up, kicked 
                        the bastards down two flights of 
                        stairs. One of ‘em had a pool cue 
                        up his arse the whole way down.

           Dunlop sits up straight -- something about the caller’s 
           tone -- hits a record button on a tape machine.

           Weiss hangs up.

           Dunlop lights a cigarette, shifts awkwardly in his chair, 
           knows he’s fucked up. He’s about to rewind the tape when 
           the phone rings again, Dunlop whips it up --

                                 WEISS
                        Seven it is.

                                 DUNLOP
                        May I ask, seven what?

                                 WEISS
                        Seven more cops to kill. Bye.

           Weiss hangs up, immediately focussed on something across 
           the street... 

           WEISS’ POV

           Parked outside a fish and chip shop -- A POLICE PANDA. 

           WEISS

           He checks for the GLOCK tucked in the waistband of his 
           jeans, leaves the phone box quickly.

           POLICE PANDA -- CONTINUOUS

           YOUNG COP sitting in the driver’s seat, his partner getting 
           the cod and chips in, police radio beeping and squawking. 
           Weiss arrives at the open window.

                                 WEISS
                        Yo there, copper.

           Young Cop takes in Weiss with cautious contempt.

                                 YOUNG COP
                        You want somefink?

                                 WEISS
                        Thing!
                                 YOUNG COP
                        What?

                                 WEISS
                        It’s something, not somefink. You 
                        think you’d at least be able to 
                        speak properly.

           Young Cop debating what to do. Finally:

                                 YOUNG COP
                        Get lost. 

                                 WEISS
                        But I have a question: What would 
                        you do if I called you a cunt?

           Young Cop begins to open the door.

                                 WEISS (CONT’D)
                        Ah...just as I thought.

           Weiss whips out the Glock and shoots the Young Cop in the 
           face. The COP’S HAT is BLASTED out the opposite window, 
           BLOOD FOUNTAINS onto the steering wheel, the dashboard -- 

           Weiss shoots him a second time, upper lip history, row of 
           teeth revealed, the Young Cop appearing to die smiling.

           Weiss tucks the Glock away and is instantly on the move, 
           crosses to a bus on the other side of the street, hops on. 

           INT. BUS -- CONTINUOUS

           The bus pulls away. Weiss with his arm hooked around a 
           pole, BUZZING like a fridge -- 

           EXT. BUS -- CONTINUOUS

           Weiss leaves the bus, crosses the street, boards a 36 
           heading in the direction he just came from --

           INT. 36 BUS -- CONTINUOUS

           Weiss finds himself a window seat on the top deck, the 36 
           SLOWING as it approaches the POLICE PANDA, a CROWD forming 
           on the pavement around the dead cop’s hat, a woman 
           SCREAMING --

           Collective GASP as the passengers inside the bus rush to 
           the windows --

           Weiss loving it.

                        a media circus --

           With a flourish the Super produces today’s Sun. We haven’t 
           seen this headline: “’MET’ YOUR EXECUTIONER.” 

                                 THE SUPER (CONT’D)
                        Sergeant Nash arrives from the 
                        prestigious West London branch of 
                        our glorious Met. It is my 
                        opinion he will instill a level 
                        of professionalism greatly 
                        lacking in our primitive South 
                        East Division. 

           A round of JEERS from the ensemble. 

           Brant and Nash are taking no part in the antics. Nash is 
           watching Brant carefully. Brant expressionless. His silence 
           says it all.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CANTEEN -- LATER

           Brant sits alone smoking a Weight. If he were a porcupine 
           he’d be using his spikes about now. Nash approaches.

                                 NASH
                        Get you something?

           Brant answers without looking at him.  

                                 BRANT
                        A Sid Vicious. Two club milks. 

           Nash heads off to the counter.  
           BRANT’S TABLE

           Nash sets the teas down. Brant wordlessly snatches the club 
           milks, gobbles them up like an animal. Afterwards to Nash:  

                                 BRANT 
                        Sorry, would you have liked one?

           Brant rolls one of the Club Milk wrappers into a ball, 
           bounces it off a passing recruit’s head. 

                                 NASH
                        Are you as black as you’re 
                        painted?

                                 BRANT
                        Are you as nancy as they say?

           It’s a stare down. Neither man blinking.

                                 NASH
                        Thing is, Brant -- if there’s a 
                        problem, I need to know about it. 

                                 BRANT
                        We’ve already got a problem. Some 
                        sick fuck is killing policemen 
                        and he’s only just started.

                                 NASH
                        I meant between us.

                                 BRANT
                        I know what you meant. I’m not 
                        your average thick Paddy -- least 
                        not always. Problem? Not unless 
                        you follow me into public 
                        toilets. We’re working together 
                        for a safer London, right?
                              (then)
                        So I don’t get to be head boy. 
                        Big fuckin’ deal. Less paper work 
                        for me, that’s what I say.  

           Brant hammers out his cigarette as he rises to his feet, 
           takes a final slurp of tea. 

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Hadn’t you better tell me to move 
                        my arse? Go fight the day? Come 
                        on, Sergeant, at least pretend 
                        you know what you’re doing. 

           He takes off. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. FALLS’ HOUSE -- DAY

           Falls is vacuuming her sitting room, broad strokes, a sense 
           of rhythm. Her flat is tidy but it doesn’t clean itself. 
           Sound of the DOORBELL. 

           Falls shuts off the vacuum, crosses to the front door and 
           opens it...to reveal a Hitler Youth. 

                                 HITLER YOUTH
                        Can I come in?

           He’s all of fifteen with second-rate tattoos, shaved head, 
           Doc Martens and black combat trousers. Goes by METAL.

                                 FALLS
                        Not dressed in that shit you 
                        can’t.

                                 METAL
                        I’m in trouble.

           Falls holds the door open wider. Metal slinks in. 

           They face off across the living room, Metal hopping from 
           one DM to the other, wired on drugs or adrenaline or both. 

                                 METAL (CONT’D)
                        Can I get a brewski?

                                 FALLS
                        No. What did you do?

                                 METAL 
                        I think we killed a geezer.

           Falls moves to a shelf, selects a bottle of Jack Daniels, 
           pours two hefty wallops into glasses.

                                 METAL (CONT’D)
                        Rocking.

           Hands him a glass, he drinks deep.

                                 FALLS
                        Sit down.

           Metal parks himself on the sofa, sputtering, the JD burning 
           his lungs.

           We’re not sure what’s going on here -- the relationship --
           but it’s becoming clearer. Falls is some sort of mother 
           figure to this gobshite.

                                 FALLS (CONT’D)
                        Talk.
                                 METAL
                        Me and the unit were patrolling 
                        Vauxhall --

                                 FALLS
                        Looking for bovver?

                                 METAL
                              (with a shrug)
                        Just keeping it safe for white 
                        blokes.

           Suddenly Falls POUNCES on him, grabs his ear like she 
           intends to rip the thing off, Metal SQUEALING like Bo Peep. 

                                 FALLS
                        John, you know the rules. Foul my 
                        home with that racist shit and 
                        you eat those Doc Martens.

           Next Falls gives him a slap. The boy throws his arms up, 
           cowering.

                                 FALLS (CONT’D)
                        Now who’d you hurt?

                                 METAL
                        A sand nigger --
                              (catches himself)
                        Sorry...an Arab-type guy.

                                 FALLS
                        How bad?

                                 METAL
                        He wasn’t moving.

           Falls steps away, her face creased in concentration, then:

                                 FALLS
                        Okay, I’ll look into it.

                                 METAL
                        Thanks, I --

                                 FALLS
                        Shut up, I haven’t finished. If 
                        he’s dead you’re on your own. In 
                        fact, I’ll nick you myself. Go 
                        home and wait till you hear from 
                        me. 
                              (then)
                        It’s choice time, John. After 
                        this, if the man lives, you 
                        either quit them Nazis or quit 
                        coming here. Follow?
                                 METAL
                        Yes, ma’am.

           Metal moves across the room, head bowed. Falls holds the 
           door open for him. 

           He stops and looks at her on his way out, sheepish, scared.

                                 METAL (CONT’D)
                        Are we like...you know...still 
                        mates?

                                 FALLS
                        I don’t know.

           She slams the door.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. INVESTIGATION ROOM -- POLICE STATION -- DAY

           A conference room has been converted into the 
           investigation’s HEADQUARTERS. A war room in the middle of a 
           war.

           A HIVE of activity -- policemen poring through files of 
           known police haters, fielding calls, reviewing grainy CCTV 
           footage, drinking tea, mounting photos, maps of SOUTHWARK -- 

           CENTRE STAGE: Porter Nash answering questions and giving 
           orders, composure personified.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PUB -- THE MOON UNDER THE WATER -- AFTERNOON

           An old-school Irish pub on the Balham High Road. A huge 
           saloon awash with colour photos of the homeland.

           RADNOR BOWEN sits alone nursing a warm glass of bitter. 
           Radnor in his sixties, an ex car thief, dressed in a 
           hideous SHELL SUIT resembling a Kandinsky painting.

           Brant storms in, makes a beeline for the bar, has a brief 
           word with the BARMAN, a roadie-type, receives a large 
           brandy and a bag of crisps. No money exchanged.

           Brant comes over, sits opposite Radnor, lights a Weight. 

                                 BRANT
                        Been here long?

                                 RADNOR
                        Just arrived.
                                 BRANT
                        Come on then. You’re a snitch: 
                        start snitching.

                                 RADNOR
                        I’m onto something.

                                 BRANT
                        What?

                                 RADNOR
                        I need paying first.

           Brant grins, all teeth, no warmth -- drops his cigarette in 
           Radnor’s bitter.

                                 BRANT
                        Oh. Sorry.

           Suddenly Brant’s hand shoots forward under the table. 
           Radnor scrunching his face in agony.  

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Bony fucker, aren’t you?

           Now we see what’s happening under the table: Brant is 
           twisting Radnor’s knee and twisting hard. Radnor grunts 
           like a spooked mule. 

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        I doubt you’ve got any Irish 
                        blood in you, Radnor. Nah, you’re 
                        one of these English geezers with 
                        your poncy quiff and fucked shell 
                        suit. Me now, I’ve got a wild 
                        streak of the Celt, and that 
                        makes me unpredictable.
                              (a beat)
                        Them Oirish, did you know they 
                        invented knee-capping?

           Radnor manages to shake his head, teeth clenched, eyes 
           reduced to chinks.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Oh yeah. Knee-capping, it’s a 
                        nasty business. Doctors fix you 
                        up as best they can, but they 
                        can’t fix the limp. Nah, the 
                        limp’s for life. “Radnor the 
                        Gimp” -- how does that strike 
                        you?

           Brant finally releases Radnor -- the snitch rapidly 
           massages his knee, breathing hard, wipes a glob of sweat 
           from his temple -- 

           Brant is tucking into the cheese and onion crisps. 
                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Okay, what you got?

                                 RADNOR
                        A bloke’s been shooting his mouth 
                        off. He was in that armpit of a 
                        gym on Rye Lane, beat a 
                        homosexual half to death there. 
                        When the management had a word 
                        and mentioned the police he said: 
                        “I’ll be giving them something to 
                        worry about very soon.”

                                 BRANT
                        That’s it? Fuck, if we pulled in 
                        every wanker who said that we’d 
                        have enough suspects to fill 
                        Wembley. 

                                 RADNOR
                        Seriously, he’s a nutter.

           And speak of the devil...the nutter strides right into the 
           pub. BARRY WEISS. Brant clocks him out of professional 
           habit. 

                                 BRANT
                        What’s the nutter’s name?

                                 RADNOR
                        I don’t know. I’m meeting up with 
                        the fella who’ll give me that.

           Weiss has taken a stool at the bar. Brant is twenty yards 
           from our killer and doesn’t even know it.

                                 BRANT
                        Don’t bother, I’ll go to the gym 
                        myself, ask the manager.

           Brant stands, downs his brandy. Radnor looking desperate.

                                 RADNOR
                        Don’t I get something?

                                 BRANT
                        I’ve left you the rest of my 
                        crisps, you greedy bugger. What 
                        more do you want?

           And he’s off.

           THE BAR

           Now it’s Weiss’ turn to clock Brant. The Barman pulling 
           Weiss a pint.
                                 BARMAN
                        That’s a cop and his snitch.

                                 WEISS
                        Yeah?

                                 BARMAN
                        Yeah, that piece of filth who 
                        just left, he’s Detective Brant, 
                        a right animal. And the git in 
                        the shell suit’s been flogging 
                        him information.

           The Barman attempting to impress Weiss. It worked.

                                 WEISS
                        Get a lot of cops in here, do 
                        you?

                                 BARMAN
                        Crawling. Sometimes I can’t see 
                        the door for all the pig shit.

           Weiss half-considers going after Brant, but is lured by his 
           freshly pulled Stella. Room temperature, the way he likes 
           it. Holds a fiver out to the Barman.

                                 WEISS
                        Keep the change.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BALHAM HIGH ROAD -- CONTINUOUS

           Brant leaves the pub, his coat whipping in the wind, walks 
           to his four door Rover lounging in a bus lane. Peels away.

           PC MCDONALD’S VOLVO emerges from a parking space across the 
           street. The young Scot is on Brant’s tail. 

           EXT. RYE LANE/PECKHAM --LATER

           If Queens is the mother of melting pots, Peckham is her 
           noisy kid sister. A mix of cultures living on top of one 
           another: Caribbean, Indian, Nigerian, Chinese, etc.

           Brant marches along the packed street, sidesteps a live 
           chicken and ducks into “Peckham Fitness,” a gloomy gym.

           McDonald watching him from the doorway of a Kebab shop.

           EXT. SECLUDED STREET/BATTERSEA -- LATER

           Brant parks in front of a rundown building. Heads inside. 
           EXT. BUILDING ENTRANCE -- MOMENTS LATER

           The building is divided into flats. McDonald has followed 
           Brant here. He walks up, checks the names on the buzzers.

           Most of the names faded or missing. Except one. Buzzer 
           three: KITTY RUSSELL. Who’s Kitty Russell?

           McDonald steps back, peers up. A RED GLOW emanating from 
           one of the windows. Yep, third floor.

           Tilts his head like a bewildered dog. For a second there --
           surely not -- McDonald thought he heard the crack of a 
           WHIP...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NASH’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Porter Nash comes home exhausted from a long day. Removes 
           his jacket, pours a glass of water. Slides a vegetarian 
           meal in the microwave, zaps it. 

           In the living room Nash sits down to eat. Sticks on the TV. 
           Big Brother. Deal or No Deal. Friends. The usual shit.

           The doorbell rings. He looks up. 

           DOOR

           Nash opens the door to Brant.

                                 NASH
                        Sergeant?

                                 BRANT
                        Evening all. Not disturbing you, 
                        am I?

           Brant the last person he expected.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Well, you going to ask me in?

           SITTING ROOM

           Brant walks in, circles the room.

                                 NASH
                        I’m in the middle of eating.

                                 BRANT
                        Go ahead, I’d some Tex-Mex 
                        earlier. 
           Brant observes Nash’s veggie meal on the glass coffee 
           table: lentils, rice, Hare Krishna cuisine. 

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Christ, what the hell’s that? You 
                        need to get some meat in you, a 
                        thick juicy steak, get the blood 
                        flowing.

           Brant is giving himself the tour. Spacious white walls, 
           spacious fitted carpet, spacious. 

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        The Japs have a word for this 
                        type of bare look, don’t they?

                                 NASH
                        Yes. Minimalist.

                                 BRANT
                        Shite’s the word I had in mind.
                              (then)
                        Don’t I get a drink, first time 
                        in your pad and all that?

                                 NASH
                        Under the hi-fi, help yourself.

           Brant hunkers down, pulls the door open to reveal a range 
           of spirits. 

                                 BRANT
                        Jesus on a bike, no wonder you 
                        stay home. Hit you with anything?

                                 NASH
                        No, I’ve got some water thanks.

           Brant goes for Armagnac in a heavy crystal glass. Crosses 
           to the window to check out the view.

                                 BRANT
                        Isn’t that the old police 
                        training college?

                                 NASH
                        It is. 

                                 BRANT
                        Thought so. They used to host 
                        this poxy dinner and dance thing, 
                        every year around Christmas. I 
                        scored there once. 

                                 NASH
                              (a pause)
                        Uh, nice as this chat is...can I 
                        ask you why you’re here?
                                 BRANT
                        I need your advice.
                              (then)
                        I don’t care about you being a 
                        pillow biter. Fuck, I don’t give 
                        a toss what people do, long as 
                        they keep it to themselves. But I 
                        respect you, there’s not many I 
                        do.

           This a kind of truce. Nash needs a drink now, goes to the 
           cabinet under the hi-fi, pours himself a scotch.

                                 NASH
                        What’s the problem?

                                 BRANT
                        I’m losing it.

                                 NASH
                        In what way?

                                 BRANT
                        I’m blacking out. Not often -- 
                        but enough to be worried. I don’t 
                        want to talk, eat -- takes a huge 
                        effort to drag myself out of bed.
                              (a beat)
                        I just stare at the wall, do 
                        nothing, absolutely nothing.

           Both men are sitting now.

                                 NASH
                        It’s burn out.

                                 BRANT
                        What?

                                 NASH
                        Yeah, your brain’s on melt down. 
                        A couple of days doing nothing -- 
                        you’ll start to come back.

                                 BRANT
                        You sound pretty sure.

                                 NASH
                        Well I am, been there myself.

                                 BRANT
                              (surprised)
                        You? 

                                 NASH
                        Sure, I could barely work a 
                        microwave. I was fucked. 
                                 BRANT
                        How long ago was this?

                                 NASH
                        Not long, last year.

           Nash grabs a pack of cigs. Menthol Super Kings. 

                                 NASH (CONT’D)
                        We’d a pedophile on the loose, 
                        luring children into his car at 
                        Holland Park. The kids were too 
                        traumatized to identify him -- 
                        plus he was a showbiz agent, 
                        major connections. The guys at 
                        the nick, they just about classed 
                        me on par with him...because of 
                        my sexual orientation, yeah? Put 
                        used condoms in my locker, sugar 
                        in my petrol tank. Usual stuff.

           He lights a cig, takes a deep drag.

                                 NASH (CONT’D)
                        I was under massive pressure, 
                        knocking back Valium, shots at 
                        breakfast, two packs a 
                        day...anyway, I took matters into 
                        my own hands. Broke into the 
                        pedophile’s house, four in the 
                        morning, mashed his balls with a 
                        baseball bat.
                              (a beat)
                        Took a leave of absence after 
                        that -- I was burnt out -- hid in 
                        my house. Went back to work 
                        expecting the axe. They ended up 
                        transferring me.

           Loud SNORE from Brant. He’s fallen asleep. The Animal. Head 
           thrown back, mouth open, dribbling split.

           Nash doesn’t know whether to be insulted or amused. Settles 
           for something between the two.

                                 NASH (CONT’D)
                        Wanker.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NASH’S APARTMENT -- MORNING

           Brant wakes up, surprised to find himself horizontal on 
           Nash’s sofa, blanket pulled over him. He rolls into a 
           sitting position, yawns ferociously, scratches his arse.
           NASH’S KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           Nash is showered and shaved, tucking into a bowl of muesli, 
           dollop of organic yogurt, swirl of honey, oh yeah. 

           Brant comes in and wordlessly sits opposite Nash. Takes out 
           a Weight, fires up.

                                 NASH
                        Don’t you want breakfast?

                                 BRANT
                        Coffee. Two sugars.

           As Nash gets the coffee: 

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Did you interfere with me?

                                 NASH
                        Yeah, right.

           Nash hands Brant a big mug of coffee. Awkward pause.

                                 NASH (CONT’D)
                        So...any idea who we’re looking 
                        for?

                                 BRANT
                        A psycho, the kind that whistles 
                        while he works, hardest to catch. 
                        I checked out a gym on Rye Lane 
                        yesterday, got the name of a guy 
                        in Nunhead who’s Worth a visit.

                                 NASH
                        You want me along?

                                 BRANT
                        Nah, you’re head boy, got enough 
                        on your plate.

           Nash pushes his muesli away. The sight of Brant this early 
           has killed his appetite.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Uh, last night, what I was 
                        saying...

                                 NASH
                        Stays with me.

                                 BRANT
                        I was just tired.

                                 NASH
                        Needed some shut eye, sure.
           Brant nods, glad that’s over with. Gulp of coffee --

                                 BRANT
                        I’m off.

           He stands and moves to the door.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        The other thing...

           Nash looks at him.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        About you being a good cop.

                                 NASH
                        Yeah?

                                 BRANT
                        I meant it.

                                 NASH
                        Thanks.

           Brant hesitates, turns back, adding: 

                                 BRANT
                        For a pooftah.

           A second later we hear the SLAM of the front door.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MCDONALD’S CAR --  DAY

           McDonald is parked across from Nash’s apartment. He’s been 
           here all night, got the stubble and cat breath to prove it. 

           Seeing Brant exit the building he sits up straight and 
           lunges for a CAMERA on the passenger seat.

                                 MCDONALD
                        Smile you fucker. 

           Clicks a few shots.

           Brant drives off. McDonald ducking down.

           When he sits up again McDonald is delighted to see Porter 
           Nash... leaving the very same building.

                                 MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        When it rains.

           Lifts his camera, clicks more shots.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. WEISS’ FLAT -- DAY

           Barry Weiss revving himself up for the next kill. Sticks on 
           Iron Maiden’s The Number of the Beast. Doing his thing:

           50 Push-ups, 3 cans of Special Brew, bout of mirror posing. 

           Weiss checks the Glock for ammo. The clip’s empty. Ah, 
           shit. He looks genuinely vexed.

           But only for a sec. SLAMS the clip back in -- Iron Maiden 
           GUITARS picking up momentum -- strides out of the frame.

           EXT. CAR BOOT SALE -- CLAPHAM -- DAY

           Weiss hurries along in search of the yellow Datsun. Stops 
           in his tracks --

           The Somalians are being questioned by a man and woman, 
           OFFICIAL types. Possibly immigration, possibly fuzz. It’s 
           all the same to Weiss.

           WEISS

           He drifts over to a beat up Fiat estate. YOUNG SID JAMES 
           selling workman’s tools: saws, levelers, nails, drills...

           Weiss’ imagination dancing. Picks up a buzz saw: nah, too 
           heavy. Picks up a staple gun: too fiddly. 

           Finally...a HAMMER. Feels it in the palm of his hand. 
           Rubber handle, nice and light, sweet. 

                                 YOUNG SID JAMES
                        All hand tools half price, mate.

           Things looking up for Weiss suddenly. He treats Young Sid 
           James to his horror show smile.

                                 WEISS
                        My lucky day.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MEGA SUPERMARKET -- DAY

           Chief Inspector Roberts shuffles along with an empty 
           basket. Roberts looks dreadful. He hasn’t bathed or shaved 
           for days. He stops in an aisle, perplexed: washing powder, 
           as far as the eye can see. Where the fuck’s the wine?

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. POLICE STATION -- DAY

           Brant talking to the Duty Sergeant, Inglis. Falls walks up.

                                 FALLS
                        Uh, Brant, can I have a word?

           Brant turns, takes her in. 

                                 FALLS (CONT’D)
                        Got something I need to discuss. 
                        Could I buy you a cup of tea?

                                 BRANT
                        I like tea. Sure, after you.

           INT. CANTEEN -- CONTINUOUS

           Falls and Brant roll in.

                                 BRANT 
                        Make mine a Sid Vicious, alright? 
                        I’ll grab a table.

           A TABLE

           Brant sitting by the window smoking. The station carpark is 
           visible down below. 

           Falls plonks down a tea for Brant, a coffee for herself.

                                 BRANT 
                        Any biccies?

                                 FALLS
                        Oh, sorry.

                                 BRANT
                        You’ll know next time. I’m 
                        partial to the Club Milks.

           A pause. There’s history here, you can sense it. Maybe a 
           kiss...maybe a one night stand. Whatever it was they’ve 
           made their peace with it. Finally Falls manages:

                                 FALLS
                        Tea and two sugars...why’s it 
                        called a Sid Vicious?

                                 BRANT
                        You ever see Sid and Nancy? 

                                 FALLS
                        Long time ago.
                                 BRANT 
                        There’s this scene where Gary 
                        Oldman, wrecked on every chemical 
                        known to man, shouts at his 
                        record company rep, who’d asked 
                        him what he wanted to drink, “Cup 
                        a tea, yah cunt, and two sugars.”

           Falls smiles.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        When you were in rehab...you meet 
                        any celebs? 

                                 FALLS 
                        Can’t say. Secrecy pact. 

                                 BRANT 
                        Right right, you can’t recover 
                        and tell. Well that’s no fun. 
                              (a beat)
                        So...what can I do for you?  

                                 FALLS
                        I need a favour.

           Brant gives her a look, “Well, yeah, obviously.” She 
           continues tentatively.

                                 FALLS (CONT’D)
                        A friend of mine is in trouble. I 
                        need to get him off the hook.

                                 BRANT
                        Police trouble?

                                 FALLS
                        Right.

                                 BRANT
                        How bad?

                                 FALLS
                        He and his mates gave a bloke a 
                        good kick in.

                                 BRANT
                        Someone you’re riding?

           The question surprises her.

                                 FALLS
                        What? No. Nothing like that. He’s 
                        a kid.

           Brant has to think a sec. Sucks his tea, like he’s draining 
           it past his gums, then: 
                                 BRANT
                        There’s a DI who owes me one from 
                        way back. We share a snitch in 
                        Brixton. He’ll be able to help. 

                                 FALLS
                        Name?

                                 BRANT
                        Stokes. Craig Stokes.

                                 FALLS
                        Thanks.

                                 BRANT
                        Now you owe me one.

                                 FALLS
                        I guess I do. That a bad thing?

           And she gets the wolf smile.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE MOON UNDER THE WATER PUB -- DAY

           Barry Weiss is standing in the shadows of a boarded up 
           chemist. He drinks Stoli from the bottle.

           SERGEANT CROSS emerges from the pub. Cross in his late 
           forties, six foot tall, an almighty paunch. He has a 
           playful exchange with a couple of young POLICEMEN driving 
           by in a Vauxhall Astra, walks off.  

           Weiss follows him. 

           EXT. SIRINHAM POINT

           Block of ugly ex-council flats, a cross between a sky 
           scraper and a gigantic spark plug. Sergeant Cross lives 
           here. He walks along with fish and chips and a four pack of 
           London Pride.

           Passes a group of RAUCOUS KIDS playing football. Couple of 
           dustbins serving as goal posts. 

           Weiss is a ways back wolfing down a bag of chips.

           INT. CORRIDOR -- SECOND FLOOR

           Cross stops at a door in an ash-coloured corridor, takes 
           his keys out, enters his flat.
           Weiss pokes his head around the corner. Presses down the 
           corridor, observes a stack of SKY TV magazines outside 
           Cross’ door. 

           Checks the HAMMER tucked against his spine, makes sure it’s 
           not too far down his jeans, easily reachable --

           Knocks.

           After a second or two:

                                 SERGEANT CROSS’ VOICE
                        Who is it?

                                 WEISS
                        Cable guy.

           Cross opens the door.

           INT. SERGEANT CROSS’ FLAT -- CONTINUOUS

           Weiss looking around with excitement, the Stoli bubbling in 
           his blood -- he sees a photo on a shelf: A YOUNGER SERGEANT 
           CROSS, first day on the job, dressed in a crisp uniform, 
           helmet, HOPEFUL SMILE...

                                 SERGEANT CROSS 
                        There a problem? I just paid the 
                        bill --

                                 WEISS
                        Funny, you are the Bill.

           This sets off Cross’ antennae.

                                 SERGEANT CROSS
                        You’re not the usual bloke --

           Weiss realizes he’s gone too far. Whips out the HAMMER, 
           takes a HUGE SWING at Cross --

           MISSES. Nothing but fresh air. It’s the vodka. Gotta be.

           The momentum of the swing has taken him past Cross...who 
           unleashes a RABBIT PUNCH to the back of Weiss’ neck -- 
           Weiss FLIES into the shelf of photos, DROPPING the HAMMER -- 

           When he turns around he sees Cross unwinding a second 
           PUNCH, but at the last second Cross TRIPS on the HAMMER, 
           staggers --

           Weiss SLAMS into Cross with a mid-level tackle that propels 
           the Sergeant off his feet -- sends him CRASHING to the 
           floor --
           Weiss on top of Cross SCREAMING -- reaches for the hammer 
           and starts RAINING BLOWS -- the scene quickly lost in a 
           Technicolor blur of blood and gore. 

           Weiss stops -- blood splattered on his face, chunk of brain 
           on his jacket sleeve --

           This is too much for even Weiss. With revulsion he jumps 
           away from Cross’ body, doubles over -- and THROWS UP.

           INT. CROSS’ BEDROOM -- LATER

           Weiss stands in grimy Y-fronts going through Cross’ meagre 
           wardrobe. Selects a pair of slacks; Bay City Rollers T-
           shirt circa 1976; battered leather jacket; pair of black 
           leather dress shoes, cop specials.

           SPARE ROOM

           Weiss has changed into Sergeant Cross’ clothes. Less 
           rattled now, he’s helped himself to one of Cross’ beers. He 
           snoops through drawers. 

           Finds Cross’ old police helmet, the one from the photo.

                                 WEISS
                        Sweet!

           Sticks it on. Next he finds a bullet proof vest with the 
           “Met” insignia on it. And finally...an address book. Full 
           of names and addresses of -- yep -- cops. 

           Bingo. Weiss whistles, pockets the address book.

           LIVING ROOM

           Weiss goes through the dead sergeant’s pockets, finds his 
           WARRANT CARD, forty quid in notes, some loose change -- 
           through this we steer clear of Cross’ ruined face.

           Weiss throws his TROPHIES (helmet, bullet proof vest, 
           address book, warrant card) into a carrier bag he found 
           under the sink.

           Next he builds a mound on top of Cross’ dead body 
           consisting of the soiled clothes, SKY TV magazines from the 
           corridor, newspapers. 

           Squirts LIGHTER FLUID onto the mound, strikes a MATCH...

           FLAMES leaping up, Weiss out the door.
           EXT. SIRINHAM POINT

           Out front the game of football is still in progress. Kids 
           shouting, arguing. Weiss crosses the frame quickly.

           A plume of BLACK SMOKE is pouring from a second story 
           window...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BRANT’S HOUSE -- DAY

           Brant arrives home, crosses to the kitchen, opens the 
           fridge, a few cans of beer, some old take-out food. He 
           doesn’t go for anything, just stares in, motionless... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PHONE BOOTH -- DAY

           Weiss on the phone.

                                 WEISS
                        There’s a blaze at Sirinham 
                        Point. That’s an estate on Meadow 
                        Road, spitting distance from the 
                        Oval Cricket Ground.

           INT. TABLOID OFFICE -- INTERCUT

           Harold Dunlop of The Tabloid, sitting bolt upright at his 
           desk. He’s taken a few calls today, but this was the one he 
           was waiting for. 

                                 DUNLOP
                        A blaze?

                                 WEISS
                        As in a big fucking fire. 
                              (then)
                        I suppose you’ll be wanting to 
                        know what your angle is?

                                 DUNLOP
                        Uh, yes...yes please.

                                 WEISS
                        In a flat on the second floor, 
                        you’ll find number three. 

                                 DUNLOP
                        A third policeman?

                        Very good, Columbo. I used a new 
                        system.

                                 DUNLOP
                        Can you...be more clear?

                                 WEISS
                        I pulverized the fucker with a 
                        hammer. Clear enough for you? 

           Weiss hangs up.

           Dunlop rewinds the tape, a flicker of a smile. The phone 
           rings again, he grabs it, hears:

                                 WEISS (CONT’D)
                        I almost forgot -- I have a name.

                                 DUNLOP
                        Name?

                                 WEISS
                        Is there an echo? Don’t keep 
                        repeating everything I say, it’s 
                        getting on my nerves.
                              (a beat)
                        “The Blitz.” As in Blitzkrieg. 

           Dunlop writes down “The Blitz” -- underlines it.

                        Yes.

           Weiss hangs up again.

           More police cars, fire engines, helicopters...

           FIREMEN struggle to tame the second floor blaze. Residents 
           being evacuated. The kids who were playing football now 
           part of a clutch of disorganized spectators.

           INT. INVESTIGATION ROOM -- DAY

           HQ is a maelstrom of panic. Phones ringing off the hook, 
           policemen rushing around. 

           Porter Nash waist deep in flak and frustration.

           PRECOCIOUS PC slaps a Tabloid in front of him.

                                 PRECOCIOUS PC

                        Evening edition -- 

           The headline hits Nash like a sucker punch: “BLITZ STRIKES 
           AGAIN.”

           Nash at boiling point, doesn’t know whether to curse, throw 
           his chair, or simply laugh. Instead he yells to the room:

                                 NASH
                        Where the hell is Brant?

           INT. BRANT’S FLAT -- NIGHT

           Brant sits in the shadows of his living room, no lights on, 
           watching the wall. 

           Across the room a PHONE is ringing. Brant doesn’t move, 
           doesn’t even blink, his mind a vacuum of white noise.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WATERLOO STATION -- MORNING

           A throng of commuters frantically crisscross the massive 
           station. 

           We find Barry Weiss by a row of lockers. He opens a rented 
           locker, looks left and right, begins loading in objects 
           from a holdall: the hammer, the Glock, the trophies from 
           Sergeant Cross’s flat, a batch of dog-eared crime books.

           He shuts the locker, takes off.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ROBERTS’ HOUSE -- MORNING

           CAMERA MOVES CAUTIOUSLY through Chief Inspector Roberts’ 
           Dulwich house, taking in: 
           Take-out pizza boxes; dirty glasses and crockery; avalanche 
           of unread post; empty bottles of booze; plants dead or 
           dying; ornaments coated in dust --

           BATHROOM

           Roberts is shaving. He wears one of his wife’s old pink 
           dressing gowns. Bald knees pathetically exposed.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NASH’S OFFICE -- MORNING

           Nash has been given Roberts’ old office adjacent to the 
           conference room. Nash hasn’t made it his own yet, hasn’t 
           had time. 

           We find Nash poring through a pile of morning newspapers. 
           Naturally the Press has gone ape. He is about to pounce on 
           a CHOCOLATE CROISSANT when Brant enters.   

                                 NASH 
                        Jesus Christ, Brant, where’ve you 
                        been?

                                 BRANT
                        I can’t say.

                                 NASH
                        What does that mean?

                                 BRANT
                        Uh, I can’t account for my 
                        movements. That the right lingo? 

           Brant has taken a seat on the other side of the desk. His 
           unshaven face has a blasted sheen.

                                 NASH
                        You do know another policeman’s 
                        been killed?

           Brant just stares back with tired eyes. Nash sighs.

                                 NASH (CONT’D) 
                        You want a cup of tea? They’ve 
                        given me a secretary, she’ll get 
                        it for you.

                                 BRANT
                        No thanks.

                                 NASH
                              (a pause)
                        Sergeant Cross, worked out of 
                        Stockwell.

                        The killer’s got a name now, “The 
                        Blitz.” He used a hammer on 
                        Cross, then torched his flat. 
                        Despite the fire the corona was 
                        able to do a full autopsy: says 
                        Cross wasn’t so much bludgeoned 
                        as beaten to a pulp. 

           Nash stops to gauge Brant’s face for a reaction, can’t 
           detect a dial tone.

                                 NASH (CONT’D)
                        The killer has his own column in 
                        The Tabloid. 

                                 BRANT
                        How does that work?

                                 NASH
                        He calls some hack named Harold 
                        Dunlop, gives him the details.

                                 BRANT
                        Dunlop you say?

                                 NASH
                        Yeah, you know him?

                                 BRANT
                        I do. 

           A beat. Brant is giving Nash’s croissant a look of longing.

                                 NASH
                        How’d it go in Nunhead?

                                 BRANT
                        Nunhead? What’s in Nunhead?

                                 NASH
                        For Christ’s sake, Brant, you 
                        were going to check up on a lead, 
                        remember? This was three days 
                        ago.

           Brant begins to stand.

                                 BRANT
                        I’ll go now.

                                 NASH
                        I’m coming with you.

           Nash swipes his jacket.

                                 BRANT
                        Don’t want to waste that.
           Brant swipes the chocolate croissant.

           INT. STATION -- CONTINUOUS

           A group of PC’s, including McDonald, are giggling at 
           something pinned to a notice board. At the sight of Brant 
           and Nash the group SCATTERS. 

           NOTICE BOARD

           Side by side, two colour photographs of Brant and Nash 
           leaving Nash’s apartment building, insinuating a tryst. 

           A caption over the top of the photos reads: “Hands-on 
           Policing.” Below the photos a second caption: “Renfrow 
           Road, home to Porter Nash.”

           Spearheaded by McDonald, the PC’s have regrouped on the 
           opposite end of the corridor. Smiles abound.

           Brant unfazed, taps Nash’s photo.

                                 BRANT
                        Good one of you. 

           Now he starts on the croissant.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Mmmm...this is delicious, must 
                        have been fresh in.

           EXT. POLICE STATION -- CONTINUOUS

           Outside the station a cluster of JOURNALISTS and 
           PHOTOGRAPHERS rush forward in the pissing rain, including 
           Harold Dunlop. Brant and Nash keep their heads down.

                                 DUNLOP
                        Detective Nash -- I’m Harold 
                        Dunlop from The Tabloid...

           Before Dunlop can get out another word Brant steps in and 
           WALLOPS the journalist in the GUT. Dunlop groans and folds 
           over -- the other JOURNALISTS catching his fall --

           Nash says to Brant as they walk away:

                                 NASH
                        What was that all about?

                                 BRANT
                        Didn’t I say already? I know him. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. THE SUPER’S OFFICE -- DAY

           Roberts is standing before Superintendant Brown. The Super 
           drinking tea and drinking it loud. Can tea be chewed? The 
           Super is giving it a good try. 

                                 ROBERTS
                        You replaced me.

                                 THE SUPER
                        What?

                                 ROBERTS
                        Porter Nash is heading up the 
                        inquiry.

                                 THE SUPER
                        You’re on compassionate leave. 

                                 ROBERTS
                        I’m back.

           The Super looks at Roberts intently. What he sees is a 
           tired old man, wicked razor burn, dressed in a shabby suit, 
           a good decade past his prime. 

           Time for The Speech.

                                 ROBERTS 
                        You lost your wife?

                                 THE SUPER
                        Well....no, I --
                              (a pause)
                        How do you feel about early 
                        retirement?

                                 ROBERTS
                        We’d miss you, sir.

           Roberts gives a bleak smile. 

                                 ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        You know who else would miss you? 
                        Petra, that two hundred pound 
                        hooker you see every Wednesday. 
                        Your secretary thinks you’re 
                        playing squash. Well...you are, 
                        in a way. 

           A pause. The Super almost looks impressed.
                                 ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        I don’t need a fanfare. I don’t 
                        even need my old office back. I 
                        want to work, simple as that.  

                                 THE SUPER
                        So what are you waiting for? Fuck 
                        off, Roberts. Go solve crimes.

           INT. FALLS’ FLAT -- DAY

           Falls in a brown velvet tracksuit that makes her seem 
           blacker. She checks her reflection in the hallway mirror, 
           swipes keys from a bowl, heads out...

           EXT. FALLS’ FLAT -- CONTINUOUS

           Almost walks straight into Metal standing on the doorstep. 

           He’s out of the Hitler Youth gear. Looks more insecure, 
           more like a boy. Hoody, pair of jeans, Adidas trainers, the 
           obligatory MP3 player.

                                 FALLS
                        What are you doing? I told you to 
                        wait till you heard from me.

                                 METAL
                        Right, I didn’t hear from you.

                                 FALLS
                        I’m sorting it now -- trying to --
                              (then)
                        Go home.

           Falls slams the door, strides past him. 

           INT. BUS -- DAY

           Falls on the top deck of the 37, watching a sheet of rain 
           LASH the side of the bus.

           INT. ROMERO’S CAFE -- LATER

           Fluorescent lights bathe this pitiful joint in suicidal 
           yellow. The windows are fogged with grease. There are 
           cockfighting dens with better hygiene. 

           Falls enters cautiously. All the tables are empty but one. 
           A MAN is sitting alone reading a paper. She heads over. 
                                 FALLS
                        DI Stokes?

           DI CRAIG STOKES looks up. My my. Falls was counting on 
           being nervous, she wasn’t counting on a hunk.

                                 STOKES
                        You must be Falls?

           His dazzling smile cuts through the grime, the grease, 
           through Falls.

           She’s not answering. Deer in Headlights and all that.

                                 STOKES (CONT’D)
                        Falls -- hello, you in there?

                                 FALLS 
                        Sorry, sir, with the killings, 
                        we’re all a bit out of it.

           She sits down. Stokes closes the paper, pushes it away. 
           Headline roars at us: “COP KILLER CLAIMS THIRD VICTIM.”

                                 STOKES
                        What will you have? 

                                 FALLS
                        Tea. Just tea, sir.

                                 STOKES
                        Forget the “sir” stuff -- Craig 
                        will do.

           Stokes calls out to the counter.

                                 STOKES (CONT’D)
                        Tea and toast for two.

           And the Staff hop to it. Falls checks out Stokes’ tweed 
           jacket, his hands, his muscular neck...

           Stokes checks out Falls checking him out. Then:

                                 STOKES (CONT’D)
                        You can smoke if you like.

                                 FALLS
                        I don’t smoke.

                                 STOKES
                        Too bad, if you did it could only 
                        help in here, kill off some of 
                        the bacteria.

           She laughs. They both do. A good vibe.

           Stokes reaches into his pocket, flips open a notebook. 
                                 STOKES (CONT’D)
                        Okay, we’ve got two of the men 
                        involved in the assault of Mr. 
                        Aziz.

                                 FALLS
                              (quickly)
                        Assault? He’s not..?

                                 STOKES
                        Dead? Incredibly, no. Those skins 
                        did a real number on him. The two 
                        we grabbed are singing like The 
                        Proclaimers, gave up the third 
                        without a second thought. Just a 
                        case of running him in.
                              (reading)
                        Let me see...I can’t read my own 
                        writing -- John Wales, known as 
                        “Metal.” This the person you 
                        wanted to discuss? 

                                 FALLS
                        Yes.

                                 STOKES
                        What is he, a snitch?

           Falls nods vigorously -- a lie -- and then the truth, or 
           something like the truth: 

                                 FALLS
                        And I look out for him, try to. 

                                 STOKES
                        He’s a skinhead.

                                 FALLS
                        He’s a boy. Underneath it all. 
                        He’s a scared boy.

           Falls bites her lip, realizes this sounds lame.

           WAITRESS come over, sticks in front of them: two mugs of 
           tea, one stack of toast drenched and dripping in butter.

                                 FALLS (CONT’D)
                        Is there any way you can cut him 
                        loose?

           Stokes closes his notebook, starts on the toast.

                                 STOKES
                              (a shrug)
                        Anything can be buried.

                                 FALLS
                        Will you? 
                                 STOKES
                        I don’t know, will I? What’s it 
                        worth?

                                 FALLS
                        A lot.

                                 STOKES
                        Meet me for a drink tonight.

           Falls wasn’t expecting that. 

           A moment.

                                 FALLS
                        That’s all?

                                 STOKES
                        Come on Falls, you’ve been 
                        around, you know it’s never 
                        “that’s all.”

           He gives her the full heat of his smile. 

           Like she really needs to think about it. Pretends she does, 
           milks the pause. Finally:

                                 FALLS
                        Okay.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RYE LANE -- DAY

           We are tossed into the colourful mayhem of a Peckham fruit 
           and vegetable stand. Chopped yams stacked like logs; 
           vibrant reds, yellows and greens of fresh chilies; mix of 
           customers jockeying for position. All of this against 
           thumping REGGAE MUSIC from a car window --

           Radnor Bowen swishes by. We pick out the ugly shell suit 
           first, then Radnor inside it. He’s Brant’s snitch, the one 
           from the Irish pub. 

           We tail Radnor as he negotiates a crush of pedestrians and 
           ducks into Peckham Fitness.

                                 GYM ASSISTANT (V.O.)
                        Barry Weiss is his name. Lives in 
                        Nunhead.

           INT. PECKHAM FITNESS/RECEPTION 

           Radnor stands across a desk from a lippy GYM ASSISTANT, 
           late twenties, a SPIKE of white hair. Gym Assistant is 
           copying down info from a computer. 
                                 GYM ASSISTANT (CONT’D)
                        Total headcase, was glad to see 
                        the back of him.  
                              (then)
                        I told all this to the detective 
                        who came by the other day. Uh, 
                        Detective Brant. Colleague of 
                        yours?

                                 RADNOR
                        Something like that.

           The address is handed over, Radnor folds it, tucks it away. 
           The Gym Assistant is eyeing the ex car thief’s beer gut.

                                 GYM ASSISTANT 
                        So...you ever considered joining 
                        a gym? 

                                 RADNOR
                        Fuck off, Tintin.

           Radnor leaves.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRY WEISS’ FLAT -- DAY

           Weiss asleep in bed. Suddenly there is a HAMMERING at the 
           front door --

                                 NASH’S VOICE
                        Open up!

           Weiss groans. Entombed in a hangover. 

                                 NASH’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Police, open up!

           Weiss’ head flies up from the bed. That got his attention. 

           WEISS

           He crawls out of bed arse first, giving us a flash of his 
           monstrous NAKED BODY. Brad Pitt he ain’t. Spotty back, 
           spotty buttocks. 

           He steps into a pair of tracksuit bottoms, pulls on a T-
           shirt. A deep breath, trying to keep his cool.

           THE DOOR

           Brant and Nash stand outside in a cluttered hallway. Brant 
           pressed against a rusty bicycle hooked to the wall. 
           Weiss opens the door, peers out.

                                 NASH
                        Mr. Weiss? Barry Weiss?

                                 WEISS
                        That’s me.

                                 NASH
                        Might we step in?

           They lift their BADGES. Weiss recognizes Brant from the 
           Moon Under the Water, tries not to register the fact.

                                 WEISS
                        Got a warrant?

           Brant hates Weiss pretty much IMMEDIATELY. This is rare. 
           Usually takes him ten seconds to hate most people. 

                                 BRANT 
                        It’s in the post.

           Brant gives Weiss a SHOVE that could shift Nelson’s Column. 
           Weiss crashes into a kitchen counter -- unsettles some 
           dirty plates and bowls --  Brant and Nash head inside.

           WEISS’ FLAT -- CONTINUOUS

           Nash and Weiss stand in the filthy kitchen as Brant 
           searches the flat.  

                                 WEISS 
                        Uh, can I get you two anything? 
                        Cuppa tea? Mug of coco?

           Nash shakes his head.

           BRANT

           Crunching on empty beer cans as he makes a quick sweep of 
           the bedroom. He dips under the bed, opens the wardrobe, 
           digs in a few drawers --

           The bathroom next. Opens the cabinet over the sink. 
           Condoms. Batch of dispensable razors. Tube of KY Jelly, 
           industrial strength. Brant wishes he hadn’t seen that.

           THE KITCHEN

           Nash is looking around. His eyes arrive on an Iron Maiden 
           poster pinned to the fridge.
                                 WEISS 
                        That’s from the Somewhere in Time 
                        tour. You a fan of The Maiden?

                                 NASH
                        Uh, no.

           Brant returns, shakes his head at Nash.

                                 BRANT
                        Nothing.

                                 WEISS 
                        What were you looking for, 
                        perhaps I could help?

           Weiss feeling cocky now. 

                                 NASH
                        What do you do, Mr. Weiss?

                                 WEISS
                        I’m between jobs.

                                 NASH
                        You like to beat people up?

                                 BRANT
                              (explaining)
                        At Peckham Fitness, you clobbered 
                        a bloke pretty good.

                                 WEISS 
                        Oh that. Bloody fruit came onto 
                        me in the sauna. I gave him a 
                        clip. 

           He catches a look between Brant and Nash.

                                 WEISS (CONT’D)
                        Not that I’ve got anything 
                        against homosexuals.

                                 NASH
                        And policemen? How do you feel 
                        about policemen, Mr. Weiss?

                                 WEISS
                        Thank God, I say, thank God for 
                        the men in blue.

           Now it’s Brant’s turn to recognize Weiss. But where from?

                                 BRANT
                        Do I know you?

                                 WEISS
                        If we met, I’m sure I’d remember.
                                 NASH
                        Come on, let’s go.

           They begin to leave. At the door Brant whips around, grabs 
           Weiss by the throat, right in his face.

                                 BRANT
                        You’re dirty, Barry. Of what I 
                        don’t know, but I’ll be keeping 
                        an eye on you, mark my words.

           Weiss manages a grin. 

                                 WEISS
                        The VIP treatment, is it? I’m 
                        flattered. 

           Brant and Weiss facing off. This is the personality clash 
           of the century. And it can only end one way....  

                                 NASH 
                        Brant, we’re going. 

           Brant releases Weiss, follows Nash out. 

           HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Brant and Nash pause at the top of a narrow staircase.

                                 NASH
                        What do you think?

                                 BRANT
                        He’s a bastard.

                                 NASH
                        I know he’s a bastard, but is he 
                        the bastard? 

           Brant can’t say for sure. Nash is looking past him. 

           A moment.

                                 BRANT 
                        You’re thinking: if he is the 
                        bastard, in the past three days 
                        he butchered Sergeant Cross. If 
                        I’d gone to check him out 
                        earlier...

                                 NASH
                        That’s pure speculation.

                                 BRANT
                        Not for Cross it isn’t.

           Brant is first down the stairs.
           EXT. WEISS’ BUILDING 

           Nash strides to his Rover parked out front. Brant waiting 
           in the passenger seat.

           INT. COSTA COFFEE -- SAME

           Radnor Bowen sits in a coffee house across the street 
           watching Brant and Nash drive off. He stays put.

           INT. WEISS’ FLAT

           Weiss tears through his flat dropping items into a holdall: 
           clothes, condoms, chapstick, the essentials.

           No trace of the attitude he was giving Brant and Nash. 
           Weiss in full panic mode now.

           Moves to the front door with the holdall, says to his pad:

                                 WEISS
                        Sianara.

           And exits.

           EXT. WEISS’ BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

           Weiss emerges at pace, hurries along the pavement with his 
           head down. 

           CAMERA SWINGS RIGHT, picks up Radnor Bowen leaving the 
           coffee house, shadowing Weiss. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. POLICE STATION -- OFFICE -- DAY

           Roberts sits at a table in a side office going through the 
           current cases. The Chief Inspector looks fresh, crisp, 
           energized. Begins working on a case. “Pensioners being 
           robbed in their homes...” Unfolds a large map of SOUTHWARK. 

           Just then a PC arrives at his elbow. It’s McDonald, aglow 
           with his usual smugness.

                                 MCDONALD
                        That’s a dead end case, sir. I 
                        did the door-to-door myself.

           Roberts gives McDonald a quick side glance.
                                 ROBERTS
                        These marks indicate the 
                        buildings where the pensioners 
                        live. Now...see how they almost 
                        circle this building here?

                                 MCDONALD
                        I do see that, sir, but --

                                 ROBERTS
                        Shut it. Any guess as to what the 
                        building is?

                                 MCDONALD
                        Not offhand, sir.

           Roberts lifts his head from the map, regards the wanky 
           Scot. 

                                 ROBERTS
                        McDonald, ever wonder why you’re 
                        still a constable?
                              (a beat)
                        You’re a lazy git, that’s why. 
                        You do the minimum and then sneak 
                        off home to catch Holby City. 
                        I’ve met traffic wardens with 
                        more balls. That building is the 
                        main post office and what happens 
                        at the main post office, do you 
                        reckon?

           McDonald thinks, thinks harder, then tentatively:

                                 MCDONALD
                        Pensions?

                                 ROBERTS
                        Pensions, outstanding. So what 
                        you do is go there on the next 
                        payout day, watch for a white 
                        male in his twenties loitering 
                        about -- and then you get back to 
                        me. 
                              (then)
                        I thought you didn’t smoke?

           McDonald has fired up a cigarette. He shrugs.

                                 ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        Weights: doesn’t Detective Brant 
                        smoke those?

                                 MCDONALD
                        Does he?
                                 ROBERTS
                        Okay, let’s see if we can solve 
                        another.

           Roberts selects a new file. McDonald near-choking, picks a 
           fleck of tobacco off his tongue.

                                                                CUT TO:

           QUICK CUTS: LONDON STREETS

           Radnor Bowen following Barry Weiss. Weiss switching 
           directions several times, Radnor keeping up --

           Weiss on the top deck of a bus -- Radnor DOWNSTAIRS reading 
           The News of the World --

           Weiss switches busses abruptly, Radnor running, catches 
           Weiss’ new bus at the very last second with an arm lunge at 
           the closing doors, boards out of breath --

           EXT. WATERLOO STATION

           Finally we’re outside Waterloo Station. Before Weiss mounts 
           the steps out front he swings around, trying to pick out a 
           possible tail -- 

           Radnor dives behind a black cab, nick of time -- Weiss 
           didn’t see him --  

           Weiss starts up the steps, the holdall at his side.

           INT. WATERLOO STATION -- LOCKERS

           Weiss faces his locker, routinely looks left and right, 
           removes a couple of items from inside, tucks them away. 
           Next he SHOVES the holdall into the locker, it won’t quite 
           fit, has to put some muscle into it.

           ON RADNOR

           From a distance he watches Weiss shut the locker and walk 
           off into the crowd. 

           Radnor on the move. Threads his way to Weiss’ locker, takes 
           out a piece of paper and scribbles down the locker number. 

           INT. BLACK LION PUB -- LATER

           Weiss drinking a room temp Stella and looking over the 
           ADDRESS BOOK he stole from Cross’ flat. Names and addresses 
           of COPS. For Weiss this is better than girl-on-girl porn.
           He flips to the B’s, finds Detective Sergeant Thomas Brant. 
           A PO BOX in Camberwell. That’s no good.

           Flips on through to the F’s. Arrives at a new name: 
           ELIZABETH FALLS. An address in Balham, Rossiter Road.

           Over this we hear Mary J. Blige’s A Family Affair and

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FALLS’ HOUSE -- NIGHT

           A radio tuned to a Brixton station. Falls sings along with 
           the song, sipping Jack Daniels on the rocks, getting ready 
           for her big date. 

           She’s dressed cautiously. Doesn’t want to give the right 
           impression. Leans into the mirror, applies lipstick. 

           EXT. CLAPHAM HIGH STREET -- NIGHT -- LATER

           Falls exits Clapham North tube station, heads across the 
           street. Wearing a black denim jacket, collar turned up. 

                                 FALLS (V.O.)
                        How can you hate Leonard Cohen?

           EXT. ROYAL OAK/VERANDAH

           Falls and Stokes on the back verandah of a rowdy pub. It’s 
           quieter out here, but chilly, even with the heat lamps. 

           Stokes has dressed up. Dark navy suit, white shirt and tie. 
           He drinks a pint. Falls has gone for a Bacardi and Coke.

                                 FALLS (CONT’D)
                        The Future is a classic album.

                                 STOKES
                        He’s just...he’s so bleak.

                                 FALLS
                        Alright, Simon Cowell, who do you 
                        listen to then?

                                 STOKES
                        The Police.
                              (a beat)
                        Really. The Police.

                                 FALLS
                        Every Breath You Take is the 
                        stalker’s anthem, you do know 
                        that, right?
                                 STOKES
                              (playing sinister)
                        “I’ll be watching you...”

                                 FALLS
                        Exactly!

           They both laugh. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WATERLOO STATION -- LOCKERS -- NIGHT

           Radnor Bowen has returned to locker 68. He produces a Slim 
           Jim, a thin piece of metal resembling a composer’s baton. 
           This bad boy is a memento from his days stealing cars. 

           Radnor uses his right shoulder as a block to passers-by. 
           Doing his thing with the Slim Jim. Within seconds the lock 
           CLICKS -- and Radnor swings the door open...

           He can’t believe his eyes. The Glock, the police helmet, 
           Sergeant Cross’ WARRANT CARD... 

           Jackpot, plain and simple.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROYAL OAK/VERANDAH

           Falls and Stokes are on their next round of drinks. Stokes 
           smoking a Silk Cut, talking.

                                 STOKES
                        We’re in the back seat between 
                        these two hard-core cowboy types, 
                        passing the bottle along; Tone 
                        turns to me, whispers in my ear, 
                        “I don’t know how to tell you 
                        this, but I think I left my money 
                        belt back at the hotel.” I just 
                        lost it, had tequila coming out 
                        of my nose. 

           Stokes laughs at the memory. Thumps his cigarette out. 
           Falls watching him intently.

                                 STOKES (CONT’D)
                        You’ve gone quiet.

                                 FALLS
                        I like listening to you.

                                 STOKES
                        So we might do it again?
                                 FALLS
                        I’d say so.

           A moment. Their eyes locked. 

           INT. STOKES’ CAR -- NIGHT -- LATER

           Stokes has given Falls a ride home. They’ve just turned 
           onto her street. 

                                 FALLS 
                        Right here -- number 16.

           He stops in front of her house, keeps the engine running. 

           A pause. They’re both staring ahead.

                                 STOKES
                        I had a really nice time --

           He leans towards her. Falls closes her eyes in anticipation 
           of a kiss...but all Stokes does is open the door for her. 

                                 STOKES (CONT’D)
                        I’ll call you.

           He sits back. Falls gobsmacked. And gutted. 

                                 FALLS 
                        When?

                                 STOKES
                        When what?

                                 FALLS
                        When will you call me? Tomorrow, 
                        next week? How about the summer, 
                        we’ll do a picnic?

           She’s turned on him big time. Woman scorned and all that.

                                 FALLS (CONT’D)
                        I’m too old for this shit. Bloke 
                        says “I’ll call you,” and the 
                        woman waits. And hopes. A slave 
                        to her mobile. He thinks, “I’ll 
                        either call her tomorrow or 
                        Sunday, doesn’t matter.” Well 
                        here’s a hint, alright? It does 
                        matter, matters a lot. 

                                 STOKES
                        Tomorrow, I’ll call you tomorrow.

                                 FALLS
                        Fuck off.
           She flies out the car, slams the door behind her. 

           Stokes watches her through the windscreen, figures he’s 
           blown it, drives off.

           ON FALLS

           Rummaging in her purse for keys, shakes her head, knows she 
           overreacted. Mutters under her breath, “Dumb dumb 
           dumb...shit.” 

           Suddenly she is GRABBED from behind -- SPUN AROUND and 
           SLAMMED against the front door -- the wind knocked out of 
           her --

           What the fuck?

           ANOTHER ANGLE -- THE FRONT DOOR

           Barry Weiss has one hand wrapped around Falls’ throat -- in 
           his other hand, THE HAMMER -- he lifts it high, preparing 
           to take Falls out with one almighty BASH --

           For a moment all we can see are the whites of her eyes.

           Someone is SCREAMING. It’s not Falls. It’s not Weiss.

           A FIGURE comes HURTLING out of the dark and CRASHES into 
           WEISS, tackles him to the ground -- 

           Shaved head. Adidas trainers. It’s Metal.

           He leaps on Weiss and PUMMELS him with his skinny arms -- 

           Weiss flips Metal over like an Action Man, swings the 
           hammer -- three successive blows that DEMOLISH the kid’s 
           skull. Then he scrambles to his feet and HIGHTAILS it -- 

           Falls is screaming now and screaming loud. She can’t take 
           her eyes off Metal. A reddish goo oozing from the kid’s 
           head. It’s like his brains have jumped ship.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FALLS’ HOUSE -- NIGHT -- LATER

           The street has been blocked off. It’s a crime scene. Tape, 
           police cars, blur of pulsing sirens.

           Brant pulls up in his Rover, marches up to the front door 
           where a YOUNG POLICEMAN is standing guard. He tips his hat 
           at Brant. Brant ignores him, observes the FORENSICS TEAM 
           doing their thing. Heads inside. 
           INT. FALLS’ HOUSE 

           Brant and Nash are in the sitting room. 

                                 NASH
                        The doctor just gave her a 
                        sedative. She’ll be out for a 
                        while.

           Brant by the mantel piece looking at a row of photos. Falls 
           aged 6; Falls’ father, a month before the heart attack; 
           Falls on holiday in Barbados; framed pic of Tupac Shakur.

                                 BRANT
                        The skinhead’s dead?

                                 NASH
                        As Diana. 

                                 BRANT
                        She get a look at the attacker?

                                 NASH
                        All she could say for sure is 
                        that he’s white.

                                 BRANT 
                        Anything else?

                                 NASH
                        Said he’s big.

                                 BRANT
                        Big and white. So he’s not the 
                        black kid from Different Strokes. 
                        Narrows it down.

           Brant moves on from the mantel and arrives at the bottle of 
           Jack Daniels, pours a shot into a glass.

                                 NASH 
                        Should you be taking her booze?

                                 BRANT
                        Like she’ll notice. Want one?

           Nash knows he shouldn’t, nods anyway. Brant pours again, 
           hands Nash a glass. 

           A pause. The two men drinking. 

                                 NASH
                        What’s the deal here? I mean, a 
                        black woman, a black policewoman, 
                        and what...a skinhead guardian 
                        angel?
                                 BRANT 
                        Welcome to the liberal south-
                        east. And you thought we were 
                        just a bunch of rednecks.

           Just then DI Stokes strides in through the door, his face 
           in tatters, near-shouts:

                                 STOKES
                        Is she all right?

           Nash looks at Stokes, at Brant, back at Stokes.

                                 NASH
                        Who the fuck are you?

           Stokes flashes his badge.

                                 STOKES 
                        DI Stokes. I heard someone got 
                        killed.

                                 BRANT
                        It’s not Falls. Our cop killer 
                        took a run at her and some 
                        skinhead jumped in, got his 
                        ticket punched.

           Stokes registers this for a moment, eyes twitching, then:

                                 STOKES
                        John something or other, 
                        nicknamed Metal, runner with the 
                        British National Party.
                              (explains)
                        I knew of him through another 
                        case.

           Nash is looking at Stokes, puts two and two together.

                                 NASH
                        Were you with Falls this evening?

                                 STOKES
                        Yes, we uh -- we went for a 
                        drink. I dropped her off.

                                 BRANT
                        You mean you dropped her in it. 
                        Didn’t it occur to you to walk 
                        her to the door? 

           Stokes’ look says it all. 

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Boy, what a gent.  

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. TABLOID OFFICE -- MORNING

           The floor around Dunlop’s desk BUZZING with activity. 
           Journalists running around, talking on phones. 

           Dunlop is typing on a laptop, smoking a cigarette, fielding 
           queries. His Sudoku days are long gone. 

           The phone rings, Dunlop snaps it up.

                                 DUNLOP
                        Yes?

                                 CALLER’S VOICE
                        Harold Dunlop?

                                 DUNLOP
                        Yes?

                                 CALLER’S VOICE
                        The Harold Dunlop? The crime 
                        reporter?

                                 DUNLOP
                        Yes yes, who’s this?

           INT. PHONE BOX -- INTERCUT

           The caller. It’s Radnor Bowen.

                                 RADNOR
                        Mr. Dunlop, how would you like to 
                        nail The Blitz?

                                 DUNLOP
                        I’d like that very much.

                                 RADNOR
                        Woah, is that it? I know the name 
                        of the cop killer, Mr. Dunlop, 
                        you’re going to have to work a 
                        bit harder than that. 

           Dunlop puts his hand over the phone, SHOUTS for the office 
           around him to be quiet. Back into the phone:

                                 DUNLOP 
                        It would be an honour to bring 
                        the maniac to justice. 

                                 RADNOR
                        Yeah? Well, you have a little 
                        think about how much you’d be 
                        willing to pay for such an 
                        honour.
                              (a pause)

                                 RADNOR (CONT'D)
                        Come now, Mr. Dunlop, you didn’t 
                        think this was a citizen doing 
                        his bit?  

                                 DUNLOP
                        How much do you want?

           Radnor’s eyes dancing. His favorite question. 

                                 RADNOR
                        Twenty thousand in cash. For that 
                        you get the name of The Blitz 
                        and...extras.

                                 DUNLOP 
                        Extras? What are extras?

                                 RADNOR
                        You’ll know when I get my twenty 
                        grand.

                                 DUNLOP
                        I can’t just get that kind of 
                        money -- it will take time --

                                 RADNOR
                        You’ve got twenty four hours.

           Radnor hangs up. 

           The office has gone silent. All eyes on Dunlop.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FALLS’ HOUSE -- DAY

           Brant parks in front of Falls’ house. It’s two days after 
           the attack and the street is back to normal.

           He notices DI Stokes parked across the street watching 
           Falls’ house, walks over. Stokes rolls down the window.

                                 BRANT
                        What’s this, a stakeout?

                                 STOKES
                        I’m keeping an eye on who calls.

           Stokes unshaven and bleary eyed. He could use a shower and 
           an Extra Strong Mint. 

                                 BRANT
                        She know you’re here?

                                 STOKES
                        Yeah, but she won’t talk to me.
                                 BRANT
                        Give her some time, she’s had a 
                        close call.

                                 STOKES
                        I fucked up.

                                 BRANT
                        Yeah, no question, you fucked up. 
                        But we’ve all been there. Falls 
                        included. 
                              (then)
                        She’ll come around.

           Brant sets off toward the house.

           FALLS’ FRONT DOOR

           Brant has buzzed the doorbell. Falls answers. She wears a 
           spotless white sweat shirt, blue jeans, and is barefoot. If 
           she’s had better days you wouldn’t know it.

                                 FALLS
                        Come in.

           Brant brushes past her. Falls glances at Stokes in his car, 
           grimaces, closes the door.

           INT. FALLS’ SITTING ROOM

           Falls sets a tray of tea and biscuits on the coffee table. 
           Brant on the sofa. As she pours the tea she can sense him 
           watching her.

                                 FALLS 
                        What?

                                 BRANT
                        Just thinking how well you look.

                                 FALLS
                        What did you expect? Tears? 
                        Hysteria? Nah, I’m through with 
                        that grieving shit. 

           She’s behind some kind of armour, what psychiatrists call a 
           “protective mechanism.” Comes from years of practice.

           She hands Brant his tea. 

                                 BRANT
                        I know you’re not feeling it 
                        right now, but you’re lucky. If 
                        it weren’t for the skinhead you’d 
                        be another statistic. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRANT (CONT'D)
                        Is he the kid you told me about? 
                        The one in trouble?

           She nods, settling back with her tea, staring ahead.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Well...you win the award for 
                        unlikely friendship of the year.  
                        Did you think  -- what -- you 
                        could rehabilitate him?

           Yeah, that’s exactly what Falls thought, but she’s too 
           proud to admit it to Brant, or too ashamed.

                                 FALLS
                        I knew the kid since he was 
                        twelve. He’d come over to watch 
                        TV. I’d order a pizza. 
                              (a beat)
                        When I came out of rehab the 
                        second time -- for coke --  he 
                        looked after me. Made me soup, 
                        made me tea. He tried cooking a 
                        lasagne once, fucked up, put 
                        mashed potato on top instead of 
                        cheese, the look on his face -- 

           Falls softening a little from the memory, flicker of a 
           smile -- this lets in a little vulnerability --

                                 FALLS (CONT’D)
                        Why hit him so many times? Why 
                        destroy him like that? It’s 
                        just...it’s unnecessary. 

                                 BRANT
                        Not to this psycho it ain’t. 

           Suddenly Falls is back behind the armour.

                                 FALLS 
                        I’m going to the funeral 
                        tomorrow, don’t try and talk me 
                        out of it. 

                                  BRANT
                        Fine. But you might give Stokes a 
                        break.

                                 FALLS
                              (a beat)
                        Fuck him.

                                 BRANT
                        Did he help you out when you went 
                        to him?

           She nods.
                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Then cut the crap and get off 
                        your high horse. If you’re going 
                        to the skinhead’s funeral you 
                        should probably take Stokes with 
                        you. In fact, I fuckin’ insist. 

                                 FALLS
                        I’ll think about it.

           A pause. Brant says this next bit more gently, trying to 
           get through to Falls. 

                                 BRANT
                        The hard-ass act, it don’t work. 
                        Not for you.

                                 FALLS
                        It’s keeping me going, Brant. 
                        Isn’t that the point?

           He takes a deep breath.

                                 BRANT
                        I have no idea what the point is 
                        or if there ever was one. I do 
                        know you can’t hack it alone.

           A moment. 

           Falls looks at him, absorbing his words.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Harold Dunlop at his desk, phone pinned against his

                                 DUNLOP 
                        Yeah, had to pull a few strings, 
                        but -- I’ve got it, yeah. 

                                 RADNOR
                        There’s a pub in Waterloo 
                        Station. The Wellesley.

                                  DUNLOP 
                        I know it.
           Dunlop writes down “Wellesley,” underlines it.

                                 RADNOR 
                        Wait in there. Eleven o’clock 
                        sharp. Have a copy of today’s 
                        Tabloid with you.  
                              (a beat)
                        Oh, and Mr. Dunlop?

                                 DUNLOP
                        Yeah?

                                 RADNOR
                        If I suspect a tail, cops, 
                        anything -- then I’m outta there 
                        like Flo-Jo. That clear?

                                 DUNLOP
                        Absolutely. 

           Radnor hangs up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CLAPHAM COMMON -- DAY

           CLOSE ON a GOLD LAB sniffing the remains of a lamb souvlaki 
           in a take-out box. The dog moves on...to a HAMMER with a 
           rubber handle -- sniffs the hammer head, LICKS it...

           PULL BACK to reveal Barry Weiss lying on a park bench. This 
           has been his home for the last two nights. Surrounding him: 
           an array of empty beer cans, crisp packets, take out boxes. 

           The gold lab has taken off towards its OWNER. Weiss wakes 
           up, swipes the HAMMER from the ground, hides it away. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FALLS’ HOUSE -- DAY

           Stokes is parked outside Falls’ house with the engine 
           running. Falls emerges in black FUNERAL ATTIRE, walks to 
           the car, dips in.

           INT. STOKES’ CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Falls in a black coat buttoned to the throat. Stokes looks 
           at her, attempts some eye contact, not happening.

                                 FALLS
                        I need to stop at a flower shop.

                                 STOKES
                        Not a problem.
           He pulls away. A long pause. Falls staring ahead.

                                  STOKES (CONT’D)
                        You want me to turn on the radio?

                                 FALLS
                        Take a wild guess.

           That means no. Stokes had a little speech worked out, 
           doesn’t seems appropriate now, he opts for silence. 

           EXT. CEMETERY ENTRANCE -- LATER

           They pull up at imposing cemetery gates.

           INT. CAR

           Falls has a big bouquet in her arms, an explosion of bright 
           colours, the floral equivalent of a firework.

                                 STOKES
                        Maybe we should do this next bit 
                        on foot?

           For an answer Falls gets out. Stokes cuts the engine, 
           follows.

           THE CEMETERY

           Falls and Stokes crunching along a gravel pathway. Falls is 
           making a point to walk a little ahead of her chaperone.

           A PRIEST’S VOICE floats over the graves...

                                 PRIEST’S VOICE
                        “Thou hast bow’d the dying head, 
                        Thou the blood of life hast 
                        shed...”

           The Book of Common Prayer. About fifty yards away a group 
           of MOURNERS are gathered around a tomb stone. 

           SPLASH of SUN through the trees, hint of BIRDSONG -- it’s 
           almost idyllic...except for the heavy presence of 
           SKINHEADS. Members of the British National Party; looks 
           like a West Ham game circa 1980. 

           The Priest reads on as Falls and Stokes quietly link up 
           with the congregation. A shabby couple, Metal’s PARENTS, 
           stand at the front. Falls clutches the bouquet, stares at 
           the gravestone. “John Wales, 1992-2007.”

           Falls getting all kinds of nasty looks from the skins. The 
           air bristling with aggression and grief.
           THE GRAVE -- LATER

           The service is over. The coffin is being lowered into the 
           grave with ropes.

           Falls places her flowers carefully by the gravestone. She 
           turns to Metal’s MOTHER, about the same age as Falls but 
           older looking, a once attractive face scrunched and lined 
           from years of hatred and ignorance.  

           Falls wants to say something to her, doesn’t know what it 
           is.

                                 FALLS
                        Your son -- he was...

           Metal’s FATHER steps in to shield his wife, finishes Falls’ 
           sentence for her:

                                 FATHER
                        Not friends with the likes of 
                        you.

           They walk away.

           PATHWAY

           Falls and Stokes heading back to the car. 

           Footsteps on the gravel...they turn around and see TWO 
           SKINHEADS marching towards them, BNP armbands, one holding 
           Falls’ bouquet. 

                                 FIRST SKINHEAD
                        We don’t take handouts from wogs.

           He flings the bouquet at her. 

                                 SECOND SKINHEAD
                        You got our comrade killed, you 
                        black cunt.

           And he spits. 

           They give the Hitler salute, take off.

           Falls stares at a glob of SPITTLE on the sleeve of her 
           coat. She wipes it away. 

           Stokes bends to retrieve the flowers.

                                 FALLS
                        Leave ‘em, they’re contaminated.

           Falls turns, continues walking. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. WATERLOO STATION -- DAY

           Harold Dunlop crosses Waterloo, walks to the far side of 
           the station where The Wellesley is nestled below ground.

           INT. THE WELLESLEY -- CONTINUOUS

           An even mix of businessmen and tourists. Black and white 
           photos on the walls document Waterloo Station through 
           history. In the back there is a lounge composed of leather 
           couches and armchairs. 

           Harold Dunlop enters and parks himself on one of the 
           couches, removes a Tabloid, places it on the table. 

           Radnor Bowen steps away from the bar. We didn’t notice him 
           until now. He approaches Dunlop. 

                                 RADNOR
                        Mr. Dunlop?

           Dunlop looks up, checks out the Kandinsky shell suit.

                                 DUNLOP 
                        Yeah.

                                 RADNOR 
                        You got something for me?

                                 DUNLOP 
                        After I get my information.

                                 RADNOR
                        It’s a visual, let’s go.

           THE LOCKERS

           Dunlop and Radnor arrive at Locker 68. Radnor looks left 
           and right, begins to position Dunlop as a block.

                                 RADNOR 
                        Stand there.

                                 DUNLOP
                        What? Why?

           Radnor produces the Slim Jim....

                                 DUNLOP (CONT’D)
                        Jesus!

           And goes to work.
           A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY

           Barry Weiss is approaching at pace -- WOAH! -- stops in his 
           tracks at the sight of Radnor and Dunlop at his locker. 

           Quickly Weiss retreats behind a pillar. Recognizes Radnor, 
           but where from? It takes him a sec. Yeah yeah, of course: 
           Brant’s snitch from the Moon Under the Water. 

           Radnor OPENS the locker, starts going through it. Weiss 
           watching from behind the pillar, visibly STEAMED.

           THE LOCKER

           Radnor has removed the holdall and is showing Dunlop the 
           Glock, the police helmet, Sergeant Cross’ warrant card. 
           Dunlop wide-eyed.

                                 RADNOR
                        These are the extras I was 
                        talking about. Trophies, I 
                        believe, is the term.

           The journalist is already composing headlines. 

                                 DUNLOP
                        And you know who this locker 
                        belongs to?

                                 RADNOR
                        Ah, I believe some further 
                        negotiation is required. 

           Radnor shuts the locker.

           WEISS

           He watches Radnor and Dunlop weaving back across the 
           station towards the pub. Follows.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FALLS’ HOUSE -- DAY

           Falls getting ready for work: 

           Polishing her black leather shoes, tying her checkered tie 
           in a double knot, securing her pork pie hat, zipping up her 
           tunic, adjusting her radio.

           This is a morning ritual, as much part of the job as making 
           an arrest or drinking tea. Falls moves with speed and 
           efficiency, a machine.
           INT. POLICE STATION -- LATER

           Falls marches down the main hallway at the station, getting 
           all kinds of looks from her fellow coppers. 

                                 THE SUPER (V.O.)
                        How are you, Falls?

           INT. THE SUPER’S OFFICE -- SAME

           Now she stands before the Super’s desk. The Super chewing 
           tea, not happy to see Falls, but all things considered he 
           can’t be too hard on her.

                                 FALLS
                        Doing well, sir. Fit for duty.

                                 THE SUPER
                        Perhaps you missed the phone 
                        call. I gave you the month off 
                        with pay. I reckon you’re still 
                        in shock.

                                 FALLS
                        I reckon you’re right -- seeing 
                        the state of this zoo after a few 
                        days out, it’s enough to shock 
                        anyone.

           This was intended to be a dig of sorts. Judging by the 
           Super’s expression it worked.

                                 FALLS (CONT’D)
                        Let’s face it, sir, you need all 
                        the help you can get. 

           The Super sits forward, reappraising her. 

                                 THE SUPER
                        Alright, Falls. You want aggro? 
                        I’ll give you aggro. I’m 
                        assigning you to Brixton. 

           If this bothers Falls it doesn’t show. She even cracks a 
           slight smile. Bring it on.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE WELLESLEY -- DAY

           Radnor and Dunlop are at a table talking over the deal. 
           Radnor has a pint.

           Barry Weiss is hidden behind a Pub Quiz arcade machine, 
           watching Radnor and Dunlop. Weiss in a quandary, not sure 
           what to do, hopes it’ll come to him.
           Radnor receives a FAT ENVELOPE from Dunlop, goes to the 
           toilet. 

           Weiss sees his chance, goes after him.

           TOILET 

           Radnor standing before the mirror counting a bundle of 
           fifty pound notes. Licks his lips. He’s rich.

           Weiss storms in with the momentum of a TSUNAMI -- gathers 
           Radnor up under one of his massive arms and RAMS him into 
           the toilet stall -- 

           Radnor sees that it’s Weiss, shrieks:    

                                 RADNOR
                        I haven’t told him your name yet!

           Weiss lowers Radnor onto his knees before the toilet bowl --

                                 WEISS
                        Relax, I’m not going to hurt you. 
                        I only do police, remember?

           A mad flash of hope in Radnor’s eyes -- 

                                 WEISS (CONT’D)
                        How’d you get on to me?

                                 RADNOR
                        I got your address from the gym 
                        where you battered some poof. 
                        Then I just followed you.

                                 WEISS
                        Very impressive.
                              (then)
                        You’re going to have to help me 
                        here, it’s a tight squeeze.

           Weiss JAMS Radnor’s head down into the bowl. Radnor 
           thrashing and bucking. Weiss straddles Radnor, rides him 
           like the Electric Horseman, going:

                                 WEISS (CONT’D)
                        Yeeehaa!

           Loving it. But the ride is quickly over. Radnor’s stopped 
           moving.

           Weiss hauls the dead snitch out of the bog, props him 
           against the cubicle wall. Radnor dripping wet. He’s got 
           shit in his eyes, literally. 
           Weiss heads out of the stall and picks up the envelope from 
           the ground where Radnor dropped it. Thumbs through the wad 
           of fifties. That’ll do nicely.

           Stuffs the money into his jeans, exits.

           DUNLOP

           Weiss walks right past Dunlop on his way out, close enough 
           to pat the journalist’s head. Dunlop writing a Text, 
           doesn’t notice Weiss.

           THE LOCKER

           Weiss frantically clears out his locker, manages to get all 
           the trophies into the holdall. Slams the locker, takes off.

           EXT. WATERLOO

           Weiss trots down the steps outside the station, tosses the 
           holdall into a passing DUSTCART. 

           He’s about to hop on a bus, but then...fuck that, remembers 
           he’s loaded, doubles back and aims for the TAXI STAND.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE WELLESLEY -- DAY -- LATER

           The pub is closed and swarming with cops. Forensics are 
           busy in the toilet. 

           A RATTLED Harold Dunlop sits at a table with a glass of 
           brandy before him. Brant and Nash take his statement.

                                 DUNLOP
                        He went to the toilet. When he 
                        hadn’t returned after, I don’t 
                        know, ten minutes, I got 
                        concerned...thought maybe he fell 
                        in.

                                 BRANT
                        He did.

           Right on cue RADNOR’S BODY is wheeled out of the toilet. If 
           Dunlop were a religious man he might be crossing himself 
           about now. He goes for a gulp of brandy instead.

                                 NASH
                        And then?
                                 DUNLOP
                        And then I went to see if he was 
                        alright -- found him -- you 
                        know...

                                 BRANT
                        You didn’t exactly come rushing 
                        out though, did you, Mr. Dunlop?
                        Our man behind the bar says you 
                        were in that toilet with him for 
                        a good five minutes. In fact, he 
                        wondered if the two of you 
                        weren’t George Michael fans.

           Dunlop outraged.

                                 DUNLOP
                        Hey -- hey, I was looking for the 
                        money, alright?

                                 NASH
                        Money?

                                 DUNLOP
                        The Paper’s money. We were going 
                        to pay the man for an exclusive. 

           Nash shakes his head with disgust.

                                 NASH
                        May I remind you that people are 
                        being killed, Mr. Dunlop. Human 
                        beings with children, families...

           Dunlop just rolls his eyes: like he gives a toss.

                                 BRANT
                        You find the money?

                                 DUNLOP
                              (shakes his head)
                        The envelope was gone.
                              (then remembers 
                               something)
                        The locker! Shit, go and check -- 
                        you’re not going to believe 
                        what’s in there.

                                 NASH
                        Why don’t you tell us?

           Dunlop recalls Radnor’s words.

                                 DUNLOP
                        It’s a visual.

           Brant and Nash have had their fill of this dickhead. They 
           both stand.  
                                 DUNLOP (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, will I be getting 
                        police protection?

           For an answer Brant TOSSES the BRANDY in Dunlop’s face and 
           gives the journalist a SOBERING SMACK. 

                                 BRANT
                        We’ll be all over you.

           Dunlop has crumpled like a woodlouse. Clutching his stung 
           cheek he shouts to the assembled PC’s:

                                 DUNLOP
                        Did you see that? 

           Sure they saw it. They loved it, too. 

           Moving away, Brant whispers to Nash:

                                 BRANT
                        The wrong man got drowned.

           LOCKERS

           Brant and Nash standing before Locker 68. Station EMPLOYEE 
           opens it for them. Empty, no big surprise.

                                 BRANT 
                        Clever boy.

                                 NASH
                        He likes fucking with us. The 
                        locker was rented under the name 
                        “B. Litz.”
                              (after a beat, explains)
                        B.Litz -- Blitz.

                                 BRANT
                        Yeah yeah, I got it.

                                 NASH
                        What now?

           Brant thinks for a moment. His eyes drift towards a CCTV 
           CAMERA overhead.

                                 NASH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        We need the tapes for the last 
                        month.
           INT. RAILTRACK OFFICE

           Deep in the station’s catacombs. The room packed with 
           MONITORS. Waterloo covered from every imaginable angle. 
           Looks like the lair of a serious peeping tom.

           Sitting at the main monitor, a Pakistani, FOWZI. 

                                 BRANT 
                        Murder enquiry, be quick about 
                        it.

           Fowzi looking sheepish, slumps his shoulders.

                                 FOWZI
                        There are no tapes.

                                 NASH
                        What do you mean?

                                 FOWZI
                        The cameras haven’t been loaded 
                        for six weeks.

                                 NASH
                              (incensed)
                        Why?

                                 FOWZI
                        Cutbacks.

                                 NASH
                        I don’t believe it...

                                 FOWZI
                        The public don’t know, I mean, 
                        the cameras are still a 
                        deterrent. It’s psychological.

                                 BRANT
                              (correcting)
                        It’s a disgrace. 

           OUTSIDE THE WELLESLEY 

           Packed with REPORTERS. Harold Dunlop is giving an interview 
           to a CAMERA CREW. Brant and Nash have stopped to watch.

                                 NASH
                        He seems to be over his shock.

                                 BRANT
                        The barman said the man leaving 
                        the toilet was over six feet, 
                        athletic, shaved head. Ring any 
                        bells?
                                 NASH
                        Barry Weiss? It’s a reach.

                                 BRANT
                        What else have we got?

           Nothing. Nash nods. 

                                 NASH
                        Let’s go.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BRIXTON ROAD -- DAY

           London’s answer to Harlem. A pigeon-grey metropolis with a 
           heavy black population. 

           Falls patrolling the main high-street on foot. The presence 
           of a black policewoman in this neighborhood, an attractive 
           black policewoman, met with derision, scorn, disgust. The 
           very reason Superintendant Brown assigned her here.

           Falls getting heckled by a group of young BLACK KIDS, 
           baseball caps, baggy jeans at half-mast.

                                 BLACK KID
                        Yo sister, where your handcuffs 
                        at?

           Then BOOM -- a PEDESTRIAN rams into Falls’ shoulder, spins 
           her almost completely around. The pack of black kids ERUPT 
           with a symphony of CACKLES.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A DOOR

           CLOSE ON one of Brant’s hefty shoes KICKING IN Barry Weiss’ 
           front door -- the door FLIES OPEN, almost removed from its 
           hinges --

           INT. WEISS’ FLAT -- DAY

           Brant and Nash go through Weiss’ flat like a tornado. 

           Brant has just checked the bathroom, joins Nash in the 
           bedroom.

                                 BRANT
                        Definitely did a bunk. Find 
                        anything?
                                 NASH
                        Nothing incriminating. Tell you 
                        what, he’s smarter than he looks.

           Brant opens a random drawer, finds a stack of 8x10 photos. 
           A bare-chested Barry Weiss posing for the camera, 
           professionally done in a studio. 

                                 BRANT
                        Fancies himself: check these out.

           Nash views the photos.

                                 NASH
                        Grab them.

           THE HALLWAY

           Brant and Nash march out of Weiss’ flat, pause at the top 
           of the narrow staircase. 

                                 NASH
                        Let’s go public with Weiss.

                                 BRANT
                        It’s your call.

                                 NASH
                        Least we’ll find the fuck.

           Nash is first down.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STOCKWELL/THE PLOUGH AND STARS -- NIGHT

           Stockwell, where the pitbulls travel in twos. 

           The Plough and the Stars, a dingy pub, is shutting for the 
           night. There’s the usual exodus to the nearest kebab shop. 

           A pie-eyed Barry Weiss emerges onto the street, pivots left 
           and right, sees a BLACK CAB driving by, flails both arms --

                                 WEISS
                        Hey, taxi! 

           The cab slows down, Weiss staggering after it --

           INT. CAB -- CONTINUOUS

           Weiss tunnels in, barks to the BALD CAB DRIVER:

                                 WEISS
                        Take me to Bayswater.
                                 BALD CAB DRIVER
                        Going to cost you, mate.

                                 WEISS
                        Oi, Bronski Beat, do I look like 
                        the kind of cunt who thinks 
                        Bayswater is around the corner? 

           Cab Driver just shakes his head -- what a wanker, what a 
           job -- pulls away. 

           BAYSWATER

           We’re across the Thames in a swankier part of London, a 
           stone’s throw from Hyde Park and trendy Notting Hill. 

           Weiss spots a hotel from the taxi window, neon sign, “Long 
           Term Stays Welcome,” yells to the driver:

                                 WEISS 
                        Right here!

           The taxi breaks.

           INT. HOTEL/RECEPTION

           Weiss paying a HOTEL MANAGER for two weeks in advance. The 
           Hotel Manager counting out fifty pound notes.

           INT. WEISS’ HOTEL ROOM

           Weiss’ room is street level. Out the window we see people 
           passing by.

           Big Brother on the TV. Weiss is sprawled on the bed, one of 
           his massive hands plunged down his Y-fronts, chugging vodka 
           from the bottle, thinking: this is the business.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BRIXTON MARKET -- DAY 

           Falls in a doorway at the back end of the market, searching 
           through the pockets of a young black MARKET VENDOR, crate 
           of vinal records wedged between his ankles.  

           In the Vendor’s jacket pocket Falls finds a bag of COKE. 

                                 FALLS
                        Just selling records, yeah?

           The Vendor in full panic mode. 
                                 VENDOR
                        Look, lady, this is high-grade 
                        charlie, I lose that, I’ll get a 
                        cap in the head. 

                                 FALLS
                        That’s the least of your worries.

           Suddenly The Vender BOLTS, weaving his way through the 
           market like a greyhound. There’s no way Falls can catch 
           him, considers radioing for a car. 

           Pockets the bag of coke, then, half out of boredom, half 
           curiosity, digs through the vinal records. Smokey Robinson, 
           Al Green, good shit. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TRANSIT CAFE -- DAY

           Troop of cab drivers wolfing down burgers and portions of 
           toad-in-the-hole. PICK OUT the BALD CAB DRIVER from last 
           night who drove Barry Weiss to Bayswater --

           Over by the till the news is on a TV. A photo of Barry 
           Weiss fills the screen, one of the bare-chested shots Brant 
           swiped from Weiss’ flat.  

                                 NEWSCASTER’S VOICE
                        Police are looking for a 
                        Caucasian male in his mid 
                        thirties...

           Bald Cab Driver springs from his chair, pointing at the TV.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        I know him!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BAYSWATER HOTEL -- DAY -- LATER

           A unit of ARMED POLICE crowd the lobby. An officer named 
           JENKINS in charge. 

           Brant and Nash stride in. Nash knows Jenkins from his 
           Kensington days, shake his hand. 

                                 JENKINS
                        Long time no see. How they 
                        treating you in the sticks?

                                 NASH
                        Like royalty. This is Detective 
                        Brant. Brant, this is Jenkins.
                                 JENKINS
                              (to Brant)
                        How do?

                                 BRANT
                        Where’s our boy?

                                 JENKINS 
                        Room 28. We have a pass key and 
                        are ready to roll.

           They begin to move down the hallway.

                                 JENKINS (CONT’D)
                        According to the manager he 
                        hasn’t stirred all day. Checked 
                        in last night completely 
                        hammered.
                              (a beat)
                        Ahm, that was a joke.

           Not a good one. 

           They approach Weiss’ door, the whole unit moving as one. 
           Brant to Nash’s right, whispers to the group:

                                 BRANT
                        Let’s take him down fast, gents, 
                        make sure he stays there.

           Nash steps closer to the door, listens, inserts the key, 
           opens the door slowly --

           INT. WEISS’ HOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Shaft of hallway light penetrates the dark room. Nash snaps 
           the light on.

           Tangled sheets on the bed -- but no sign of Barry Weiss. 

           CAMERA swings over to the WINDOW: curtains gently swaying 
           in the breeze. Brant rushes over, rips the curtains aside --

           BRANT’S POV

           Barry Weiss: running for his life toward HYDE PARK. 

           ANOTHER ANGLE -- BRANT

           Without hesitating Brant hops out the window, shouts:

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        He’s on the move!

           And takes off after Weiss. 
           LONDON STREET/BAYSWATER -- CONTINUOUS

           A frantic CHASE SEQUENCE through the BLAZING afternoon 
           SUNSHINE. 

           Within seconds Brant is right on Weiss’ ass. Weiss flinging 
           pedestrians aside like blow up dolls -- Brant gaining on 
           him --

           A hundred yards back, Nash and the Armed Police, in hot 
           pursuit --

           Weiss recklessly crosses busy Bayswater Road and heads into 
           Hyde Park -- Brant right behind him, almost gets hit by a 
           Smart Car -- gives the BIG IRISH FINGER to the driver  --

           HYDE PARK

           Weiss running across the grass -- stomps through picnics --
           steps on a sunbather’s head -- kicks a pug --  

           Brant stomping through those same picnics -- steps on that 
           same sunbather’s head -- avoids the pug, but runs into a 
           GORGEOUS GIRL in a swimsuit -- an accident...well, maybe. 

           He finally catches up with Weiss, taking him to the GROUND 
           with a graceless but nevertheless effective LEAP --  
           somewhere between a rugby tackle and a powerbomb...  

           BOWLS CLUB

           Brant and Weiss tumble through a bush and into a LAWN BOWLS 
           CLUB. Clutch of OLD ENGLISH GENTS standing down the other 
           end of the lane, mid-game, pop-eyed -- 

           Brant and Weiss are rolling around amongst the bowls -- 
           Brant manages to plant his knee on Weiss’ chest, pinning 
           him -- lifts one of the bowls and SMASHES it in Weiss’ 
           face, blood flowing from his nose -- Brant hits him a 
           second time and Weiss is down for good.

           Brant DRAGS the UNCONSCIOUS WEISS out of the club, says to 
           the English Gents in passing: 

                                 BRANT
                        Nothing to see here. 

           Just then Nash and a couple of Armed Police rock up -- 
           chests heaving, red-faced, exhausted -- 

           Looks like they missed all the fun.

           INT. WEISS’ HOTEL ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

           Armed Police are tearing the room apart.
           A flushed Brant is standing by the bureau, a cold flannel 
           around his neck. He calls Nash over.

                                 BRANT
                        Look it.

           He shows Nash what he’s found: a mountain of FIFTY POUND 
           NOTES.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        If we can link this to Dunlop’s 
                        payment, we’re on our way.

           Nash nods.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FALLS’ HOUSE -- EVENING

           Falls comes home from the long day. The Brixton beat has 
           zapped her strength, dented her pride. The moment she shuts 
           the front door her tough exterior begins to melt right off. 

           She sinks into an armchair, lets out a long sigh of bone-
           weariness. Feels something in her pocket: digs out the bag 
           of coke. Oops...forgot to hand it in.  

           She holds the coke in the palm of her hand, staring at it, 
           curious. Finally returns it to her pocket.

           Falls goes for the bottle of Jack Daniels on the shelf, one 
           hit left, enough to fuel her to the off-license.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM -- EVENING

           Barry Weiss sitting in the interview room. A GUARD stands 
           at the door. Weiss with a first-class SHINER and a badly 
           swollen nose, he looks like Liza Minnelli sans make-up.  

           Brant and Nash enter, occupy seats across from Weiss.

                                 NASH
                        We’re going to tape this, okay, 
                        Barry?

                                 WEISS
                        I want a lawyer and a sandwich.
                              (a beat)
                        And I need to know who wins Big 
                        Brother.

           Weiss grins at Brant. Brant just stares back, stone-faced, 
           he ain’t playing.
                                 SIMONS (V.O.)
                        You have 48 hours...

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM -- LATER

           Weiss has been given a sandwich and a lawyer. Lawyer’s name 
           is SIMONS. Typical weasel. Wire-rimmed glasses, suit and 
           tie. He addresses Brant and Nash across the table.

                                 SIMONS (CONT’D)
                        After that you either charge my 
                        client or release him.

           Brant and Nash hate this guy with a passion.

                                 SIMONS (CONT’D)
                        And he’d like a different 
                        sandwich. He says the bread is 
                        stale.

           INT. SIDE OFFICE -- EVEN LATER

           Brant, Nash, and Roberts around a table strewn with files 
           and papers. It’s been a long night.

                                 NASH 
                        We can’t prove conclusively that 
                        Dunlop’s money is what we found 
                        in Weiss’ hotel room. In 
                        conjunction with harder evidence 
                        we might have been able to make 
                        it look bad, not on its own.

                                 ROBERTS
                        What else?

                                 BRANT
                        I got hold of the Big Issue bloke 
                        who saw the WPC capped at the 
                        Oval. He would have given us all 
                        we needed but he says he can’t 
                        make a positive ID. I reckon he’s 
                        too scared. Same goes for the 
                        barman at The Wellesley. 

                                 NASH
                        Barry Weiss covers his tracks -- 
                        he’s also lucky. 

                                 ROBERTS
                        You didn’t find anything else at 
                        the hotel? How could you not find 
                        anything else at the hotel?

                                 NASH 
                        The unit stripped it down, but...
                                 BRANT
                        But nothing, but nothing!

           Brant’s frustration mounting and mounting fast. 

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        The only thing we’ve been able to 
                        establish from the hotel room is 
                        that Weiss likes binge drinking 
                        and wanking. 

           All of this pointing in one direction. Roberts spells it 
           out.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Well...you’d better come up with 
                        something else, and fast, or 
                        Barry Weiss is going to skip out 
                        of here like Shirley Temple.

           Brant jumps from his chair, FURIOUS, punt kicks the wall. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BRIXTON STREET -- DAY

           Falls back on the Brixton beat. We find her outside a 
           supermarket having an altercation with a YOUNG MOTHER, 
           heavily pregnant with a pram and a brood of unruly kids, 
           the oldest maybe six years old. 

           Falls goes through the Young Mother’s pram, uncovering a 
           HOARD of STOLEN FOOD -- Young Mother KICKS Falls in the 
           shin -- Falls exclaims in pain -- Young Mother pushes off, 
           kids in tow --

           Falls rubs her sore shin -- across the street in a shop 
           window she SEES a WALL of TELEVISIONS all showing BARRY 
           WEISS’ PHOTO. 

           EXT. ANOTHER BRIXTON STREET -- LATER

           DI Stokes is waiting at a red light in his Rover. Suddenly 
           Falls passes right by, walking at pace, ten feet away but 
           seemingly on another planet. Stokes can’t believe it.

           He rolls down the window, about to call after Falls, at the 
           last second decides to leave her be. She’s heading for a 
           department store...

           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE -- CONTINUOUS

           A STORE DETECTIVE stands inside the door. Tan uniform, tan 
           teeth. Nods at Falls as she enters, she ignores him.
           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE TOILET

           Falls flies in and locks the door. Quickly she removes the 
           bag of COKE from her pocket. Using her nail file she CARVES 
           out THREE LINES onto the counter, rolls a five pound note. 
           Yeah, she’s done this before. 

           Dips down, SNORTS up a line. Oh yeah. If this ain’t Nirvana 
           it’s mightily close. She moves in for a second line...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE MOON UNDER THE WATER -- DAY

           Nash alone at a table. Brant walks over from the bar 
           carrying two heavy tumblers half filled with a transparent 
           liquid, sits. Nash inspects his glass.

                                 NASH
                        What is it?

                                 BRANT 
                        Poteen, Irish moonshine. 

                                 NASH
                        Isn’t this stuff illegal?

                                 BRANT
                        I fucking hope so.

                                 NASH
                        You drink this poison and you 
                        wonder why you get black outs?

                                 BRANT
                        I drink this poison because I get 
                        black outs.

           Brant holds up his glass.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Slàinte.

                                 NASH
                        Okay.

           They drink. The two men in deep thought. 

                                 BRANT 
                        Say we can’t prove anything. Say 
                        Barry Weiss walks.

                                 NASH
                        Where you going with this?
                                 BRANT
                        You told me once before about 
                        some pedophile, couldn’t get the 
                        bastard through the regular 
                        channels so you took him out 
                        yourself.

                                 NASH
                              (surprised)
                        I thought you were asleep when I 
                        told you that?

           Brant shrugs, waiting for Nash to answer his question.

                                 NASH (CONT’D)
                        I’m not sure we should continue 
                        this line of talk, I don’t like 
                        where it’s going. 

           Nash’s mobile rings. He puts it to his ear.

                                 NASH (CONT’D)
                        Yeah?
                              (then to Brant)
                        Roberts wants to see us.

           INT. SIDE OFFICE -- DAY -- LATER

           Brant and Nash are sitting before Roberts.

                                 ROBERTS
                        We’re going to pull the old con 
                        on Weiss.

           Brant and Nash share a “here we go” look.

                                 ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        The old tricks are usually the 
                        best ones. None of your fancy 
                        West London stuff needed here. 

           A knock on the door, PC McDonald enters. He wears old 
           jeans, a torn sweatshirt, scuffed trainers. The Scot 
           appears to be in some kind of costume.

                                 ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        McDonald, good, take a pew.

           McDonald pulls up a chair beside Nash.

                                 ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        We put a ringer in the cell with 
                        Barry Weiss.

                                 NASH
                        A ringer?
                                 ROBERTS
                        A policeman. Weiss will spill his 
                        guts. 

                                 BRANT 
                              (looking at McDonald 
                               with disgust)
                        And I take it you’ve someone in 
                        mind to play this ringer?

                                 ROBERTS
                        McDonald here has bravely 
                        volunteered for the part. 
                              (to McDonald)
                        You know what you have to do?

                                 MCDONALD
                        Yes sir, I have the gist.

                                 ROBERTS 
                        You want him to confess, but 
                        don’t be pushy, remember, or 
                        he’ll smell a rat. Let him come 
                        to you. He’s a nutter, he’ll want 
                        to boast. Any questions?

           McDonald shakes his head, beaming with optimism. This is 
           his chance to show Roberts his mettle.

                                 MCDONALD
                        I won’t let you down, sir.

                                 ROBERTS
                        See that you don’t.

           Brant and Nash just stare into space: this has disaster 
           written all over it.

           INT. CELL -- AFTERNOON

           SLAM of a bolt and a cell door opens. McDonald enters, 
           surveys the cell, a bunk bed, a toilet, about it. Behind 
           him the cell door CLANGS shut.

           No turning back now. McDonald takes a deep breath, nervous.

           INT. CELL -- LATER

           McDonald has taken the top bunk. He’s lying down facing the 
           wall.

           Sound of VOICES outside the cell. SLAM of a bolt. Barry 
           Weiss steps in, the door CLANGS shut.

           For a moment...all McDonald can hear is the sound of Weiss’ 
           breathing. Then Weiss thumps the top bunk with his fist. 
                                 WEISS
                        Oi, you.

           McDonald rolls over, looks at him.

                                 MCDONALD
                        What the fuck you want?

                                 WEISS
                        “Please allow me to introduce 
                        myself...”

           McDonald just stares.

                                 WEISS (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you get it? Opening line of 
                        Symphony for the Devil?

                                 MCDONALD
                        You woke me up.

                                 WEISS
                        Sorry about that, I’ve had a 
                        rough day. You got a name?

                                 MCDONALD
                        Pete.

                                 WEISS
                        Hello Pete. What you in for?

                                 MCDONALD
                        GBH.

           Weiss’ eyes light up.

                                 WEISS
                        Oh yeah? Who’d you batter?

                                 MCDONALD
                        Tosser in a pub.

                                 WEISS
                        That it?

                                 MCDONALD
                        And I robbed a Carphone 
                        Warehouse. I robbed two Carphone 
                        Warehouses...and a bank, a 
                        Natwest.  

           McDonald is lousy at this, and our killer is seeing through 
           him like Plexiglas. 

           Weiss nods slowly, dips onto the lower bunk.

                                 WEISS
                        Well...night night.
                                 MCDONALD 
                        What about you?

                                 WEISS
                        Me?

                                 MCDONALD
                        Yeah, what are you in for?

                                 WEISS
                        I took a dump in a public 
                        swimming pool. A priest reported 
                        me.

           McDonald isn’t sure how to react to that. A long pause. 

           McDonald desperately trying to cook up a fresh angle, Weiss 
           beats him to it.

                                 WEISS (CONT’D)
                        Hey Pete? You awake?

                                 MCDONALD
                        Yeah.

                                 WEISS
                        I’ve got a question for you. 
                        Well, it’s really more of a 
                        supposition than a question... 
                        you follow?
                              (a beat)
                        Okay, here it is: a first class 
                        psycho, a cop killer, right, is 
                        put in a cell with...a cop. His 
                        speciality, if you will, cops 
                        being who he kills.

           A moment.

                                 MCDONALD
                        I don’t understand. Is there 
                        something you want to tell me? 

           Suddenly Weiss rolls out of the lower bunk, lifts himself 
           up so he’s staring right in McDonald’s face.

                                 WEISS
                        You’re asking the wrong question, 
                        Pete...if that really is your 
                        name. The question you should be 
                        asking is this: how good is this 
                        cop going to sleep tonight?

           There’s maybe half a yard between their faces. McDonald 
           holding Weiss’ gaze, but terrified, heartbeat doing jig 
           time.
           Suddenly Weiss THRUSTS his head, pretending to go on the 
           attack -- McDonald reacts like he’s been cut with a whip, 
           FLIES against the wall, his body crumpled, COWERING.

           Weiss LAUGHS, returns to the lower bunk. 

           ON MCDONALD, staring into the dark and listening to Weiss’ 
           mocking laughter. Yeah, he’s blown it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAFF TOILET -- MORNING

           Falls SNORTS up a line of COKE from a sink, rises to meet 
           her reflection in the mirror, a look of defiance. 

           BRIXTON STREET

           Falls bouncing along the street, high as a satellite.

                                 BRANT (V.O.)
                        Christ, you look a mess.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- MORNING

           Brant, Nash and McDonald around the table. McDonald clearly 
           didn’t get a wink of sleep, circles under his eyes, looking 
           frazzled and pale.

                                 MCDONALD
                        He’s the one, he did the 
                        killings. 

                                 NASH
                        Weiss confessed?

                                 MCDONALD
                        No, but it’s definitely him...he 
                        made it clear.

           Brant leans in closer, right in McDonald’s face.

                                 BRANT
                        He sussed you, didn’t he? 

           McDonald looks away.

                                 MCDONALD
                        Yeah, he sussed me.

                                 NASH
                        For fuck’s sake...
           Nash slams the table. Brant isn’t surprised, just folds his 
           arms, boiling. 

                                 BRANT
                        What you do, flash him your 
                        warrant card?

                                 MCDONALD
                              (a beat)
                        It’s the sick fucks like Barry 
                        Weiss who are running the show, 
                        not us. What are we doing? What 
                        are we actually doing? We’d be 
                        better off breaking the law 
                        rather than enforcing it, least 
                        we’d get something accomplished. 

           Spending the night in Weiss’ cell has clearly changed 
           McDonald; his energy is more grounded, more urgent. He’s 
           just preaching to the choir, however.

                                 NASH
                        You’d better go see the Super. I 
                        don’t think he’ll be pleased, you 
                        being his star pupil.

           McDonald hears that loud and clear. He plods to the door 
           and heads out. 

           A pause. Nash is shaking his head. 

                                 NASH (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to have to release 
                        Weiss. We have no choice.

           This is exactly what Brant didn’t want to hear. He 
           straightens with RAGE, looks at the door -- 

                                 BRANT
                        How much longer we got?

                                 NASH
                        About nine hours -- his lawyer’s 
                        on the countdown already --

           Brant storms out --

                                 NASH (CONT’D)
                        Brant!

           Nash goes after him. 

           INTERVIEW ROOM -- WEISS

           A composed Barry Weiss seated at the table awaiting the 
           next round of interviews. 
           Brant STREAMS in and SEIZES Weiss, lifts him out of his 
           chair  -- off his feet even -- SLAMS Weiss against the  
           wall --

                                 BRANT
                        We know you murdered those cops, 
                        you piece of shit! Now fuckin’ 
                        confess!

           Weiss ain’t dumb: he’s gone into pansy mode.  

                                 WEISS
                        He’s going to kill me! Help!

                                 BRANT
                        Confess! 

           Brant is strangling Weiss -- Weiss wiggles his wretched 
           tongue, gasping for air -- meanwhile Nash and the attending 
           GUARD are trying to break it up -- more PC’s pour into the 
           room from the corridor-- in the end if takes six of them to 
           prize Brant away --

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Get off me! Get the fuck off me!

           Brant gives some innocent PC a WALLOP in the jaw. He 
           doesn’t know what he’s doing. Finally just walks out. 

           EXT. POLICE STATION -- LATER 

           Nash is out on the steps in front of the station smoking a 
           Super King. He glances over and sees McDonald walk out.

           The young Scot visibly shell-shocked. He takes out his 
           Weights, a tremor in his hand, can hardly light up. 

           Nash comes over with a lighter poised, fires up McDonald’s 
           cigarette. 

                                 NASH
                        How’d it go with The Super?

                                 MCDONALD
                              (monotone)
                        I’m suspended for a week... 
                        without pay.

                                 NASH
                        Don’t take it too hard.

           McDonald exhales, his eyes focussed on something far away.

                                 MCDONALD
                        Someone should off him.
                                 NASH
                        Who? The Super?

                                 MCDONALD
                        That bastard in the cells, Barry 
                        Weiss. If he walks, someone 
                        should do him.

           Nash looks at McDonald carefully, moves closer, almost 
           whispering:

                                 NASH
                        Now now, take it easy there, 
                        McDonald. You don’t want people 
                        to hear that kind of talk.

           McDonald takes off down the steps.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BRIXTON ROAD -- DAY

           Falls searches a BLACK GUY’s Mitsubishi, uncovers a packet 
           of COKE in the glove compartment, pockets it. 

                                 FALLS
                        I’m going to let you off with a 
                        caution, alright? 

           Black Guy observes her inflamed nostrils, knows a user when 
           he sees one.

                                 BLACK GUY
                        Getting yourself a little habit 
                        are we, officer?

           Falls smacks Mungo across the head. She walks away FAST, 
           aiming for the nearest toilet. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE UP -- CELL DOOR

           SLAM of a bolt. Barry Weiss strolls out of his cell, a 
           broad grin, sings:

                                 WEISS
                        “Free at last, free at last...”

           INT. POLICE STATION -- AFTERNOON

           Weiss stands at a desk waiting for his possessions. Beside 
           him, Simons, his lawyer, looking a little uneasy. 
                                 WEISS 
                        Are the press waiting?

                                 SIMONS
                        I’m afraid so. It’s quite a 
                        crowd. We can depart out the back 
                        if you’d prefer?

           Weiss looks at Simons like this is the most ludicrous thing 
           anyone’s ever said.

                                 WEISS
                        Fuck no.

           OFFICER hands over a carrier bag filled with Weiss’ few 
           bits and pieces: tooth brush, copy of the porn mag Fist, 
           chap stick, and finally the envelope full of CASH. 

           Weiss swipes the bag, says to the officer:

                                 WEISS (CONT’D)
                        Hope it’s all there.

           CORRIDOR

           A MOB of COPS line both sides of the corridor, a gallery of 
           GRIM FACES, their HATRED palpable. Simons shepherds Weiss 
           along. Our killer staring into the faces of the cops like a 
           proud parent, touched. 

           Down by the exit Weiss comes face to face with Brant. Big 
           grin on Brant’s face. Now he’s playing. 

                                 WEISS
                        What are you smiling at, 
                        cocksucker? You fucked up.

           Brant gives Weiss a wink, like he knows something Weiss 
           doesn’t. For a second Weiss looks genuinely worried, only 
           for a second.

           Simons manoeuvres Weiss outside into a BLAST of artificial 
           light -- CLICKING CAMERAS -- DIN of VOICES --

           EXT. POLICE STATION -- CONTINUOUS

           A BATTERY of REPORTERS, PHOTOGRAPHERS and CAMERA CREWS. 
           Michael Jackson would be pleased with this kind of turnout. 

           Weiss and Simons descend the steps and pause at the edge of 
           the crowd. We see a familiar face, HAROLD DUNLOP, he’s 
           managed to muscle his way to the front, shouts:

                                 DUNLOP
                        Barry, Harold Dunlop from The 
                        Tabloid. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DUNLOP (CONT'D)
                        We’d like to give you an 
                        exclusive deal, put you up in a 
                        hotel, the works.

           Weiss looks at Simons. The weary lawyer merely shrugs.

                                 DUNLOP (CONT’D)
                        We have a car waiting.

                                 WEISS
                        Lead the way.

           Dunlop gives a signal and a massive BODY GUARD appears, 
           bald head, resembles a gigantic baby. The Body Guard carves 
           a route through the melee to a parked Mercedes, engine 
           running --

           Press move in, a TORRENT of questions, among them we hear:

                                 REPORTER 1
                        Give us a quote, Barry!

                                 REPORTER 2 
                        Barry, did you kill those 
                        policemen?

           Weiss standing at the open door of the car -- twirls to 
           face the crowd, opens his mouth like he’s going to begin a 
           long speech -- then at the last second breaks into that 
           trademark HORROR SHOW SMILE, says: 

                                 WEISS
                        No comment.

           And bends into the Mercedes. The car pulls away and the 
           crowd pushes in fast.

           STATION ENTRANCE

           Brant and Nash watch the Mercedes snake into the fading 
           afternoon. The killer has walked. Enough said.

                                 NASH
                        Want to get a drink?

                                 BRANT
                        Lots of ‘em. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BAR -- NIGHT

           An after hours bar with battered iron advertisements on the 
           walls, tin roof, a style of interior design known as 
           “shantytown-chic.” Sun Ra on the sound system.
           Stokes is having rum and cokes with his Brixton snitch, a 
           handsome Rasta named LEICESTER. 

                                 LEICESTER
                        I don’t mean to bum you out, bro, 
                        but there is some major shit 
                        going down. 

                                 STOKES
                        I’m listening.

                                 LEICESTER 
                        A cop is taking down dealers. 

                                 STOKES
                        What?

                                 LEICETER
                        Yeah, ripping off the product, 
                        man. Some of these dealers, 
                        they’re like serious folk. You 
                        fuck with them, they get 
                        biblical, even with a cop -- 
                        especially a woman. 

                                 STOKES
                        Wait wait wait, back up a sec. A 
                        female cop is ripping off drug 
                        dealers?

                                 LEICESTER
                        That’s it, bro, she’s a sister 
                        too. 

           Stokes begins to connect the dots, alarm bells ringing in 
           his head.

                                 STOKES
                        This cop have a name? 

                                 LEICESTER 
                        Yeah, Falls. 

           INT. STOKES’ CAR 

           Stokes is speeding through London streets, frantically 
           talking into his mobile --

                                 STOKES
                        Brant? It’s Stokes. Listen, I’m 
                        going to need your help -- it’s 
                        Falls...
           EXT. FALLS’ HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Stokes is standing by his Rover smoking a cigarette. 
           Brant’s car skids into the street, he drives up, basically 
           parks on the lawn, flies out with momentum --

                                 BRANT
                        How long you been here?

                                 STOKES
                        Not long. She’s inside --

           Brant makes a beeline for the front door, Stokes in tow. 
           Brant pounds on the door with his fist -- 

                                 BRANT
                        Falls! It’s Brant! 

                                 STOKES
                        I knocked before, she didn’t 
                        answer.

                                 BRANT
                        Falls, I’ll bust the door down! --

           The door opens about a quarter of the way, Al Green’s Let’s 
           Stay Together trickling out. Falls staring, clearly cooked. 

                                 FALLS
                        Go away.

           She tries to close the door but Brant BLOCKS it with his 
           FOOT, BARGES IN, knocking Falls to the floor, heads into 
           the living room... 

           INT. FALLS’ SITTING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           On the coffee table, half a bottle of Jack Daniels and a 
           bag of COKE. Falls has been snorting lines off an old copy 
           of The Big Issue, The Police on the cover. 

           Standing over the table, a BILLY RAY CYRUS look-a-like in 
           tight Y-fronts, a ghastly mullet, sagging man boobs.

                                 BILLY RAY CYRUS
                        Who crashed the party?

                                 BRANT
                        You did.

           Brant SEIZES Billy Ray’s balls with one hand, his mullet 
           with the other -- maneuvers the tosser down the hall and 
           LAUNCHES him over the doorstep.

           Brant returns to the living room, Falls beside him, raging:
                                 FALLS 
                        Who the fuck do you think you 
                        are?

           Brant shoves the bag of coke in her face.

                                 BRANT
                        The cop who can bust your arse 
                        for possession, that’s who the 
                        fuck I am!
                              (then)
                        Jesus Christ, look at you!

           It’s been a 36 hour binge and Falls is twitching like a 
           squirrel, about as pale as a black woman can get.

           Stokes standing behind Falls. She shrugs, momentarily self-
           conscious, mainly defiant. 

                                 FALLS
                        Just had a couple of lines, so 
                        what? 

           Brant turns the bag upside down and shakes it, the coke 
           SCATTERING like Sweet’n Low.

           Falls LOSES IT, attacks Brant -- it’s a CHAOTIC struggle, 
           Falls tries to scratch Brant’s eyes out, climbs on his 
           back, pounds him with her fists -- Brant attempts to slow 
           her down, backs her into a wall at speed -- Falls SHRIEKS -- 

           Meanwhile Stokes is trying to remove Falls. The two men are 
           unable to contain this little coked-up engine. Brant yells 
           to Stokes:

                                 BRANT
                        Get her in the toilet!

           They manage to haul her across the room to the TOILET, 
           Falls FIGHTING and CURSING the whole way, got quite a mouth 
           on her -- 

           TOILET

           All three of them tumble in --

                                 BRANT 
                        Shower!

           Stokes sticks the SHOWER on and Brant swings Falls in and 
           PINS her beneath the NOZZLE -- 

           Falls struggling mightily, tries to battle her way out, 
           Brant keeps her there -- Falls DRENCHED and SCREAMING -- 
           INT. FALLS’ SITTING ROOM -- LATER

           Falls sits quietly on the sofa, wrapped in a dressing gown. 
           Brant at the window. He comes forward, hands Falls a couple 
           of pills.

                                 FALLS 
                        What are these?

                                 BRANT
                        Tranqs...help bring you down.

                                 FALLS
                        The shower did that.

                                 BRANT
                        These’ll bring you down further.

           Falls is through fighting, does what she’s told, takes the 
           pills with a gulp of water. 

           Stokes comes in with a couple of mugs of tea. Brant returns 
           to the window, picks up a glass of Jack Daniels, sips, 
           looking out on the very small and very neglected back 
           garden. 

                                 FALLS
                        So...what’s going on with the 
                        Blitz? They charge him yet?

           Brant and Stokes share a quick look. 

                                 STOKES 
                        Uh, not exactly.

                                 FALLS
                        What does that mean?

                                 STOKES
                        Barry Weiss was released due to 
                        lack of evidence. He’s holed up 
                        in some posh London hotel with 
                        The Tabloid picking up the tab. 
                        Any day now, I suppose, we’ll be 
                        treated to his exclusive story.

           Brant keeps his attention out the window. He can’t talk 
           about Weiss without breaking shit -- considering it’s not 
           his home he decides it’s best to keep quiet.

                                 STOKES (CONT’D)
                        Everyone’s certain Weiss is the 
                        killer. In fact....been lots of
                        loose talk about someone maybe 
                        doing the job themselves, 
                        shooting the fuck.
           A moment. Falls staring ahead. The tranquilizers have taken 
           effect. Or maybe she’s deep in thought.

                                 STOKES (CONT’D)
                        Falls?

                                 FALLS
                        I’m listening. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE UP -- MICRO CASSETTE RECORDER

           The wheels on a tiny cassette tape turning slowly...

                                 DUNLOP (O.S)
                        During those two days that you 
                        were held by the police...

           INT. HOTEL BAR -- DAY

           Barry Weiss is being interviewed by Harold Dunlop in the 
           bar of a plush hotel. 

           The swelling in Weiss’ nose has gone down and the black-eye 
           is on the out...all things considered our killer looks as 
           good as new.

                                 DUNLOP (CONT’D)
                        Can you talk a little bit about 
                        how you were treated?

                                 WEISS
                        It’s not easy for me. Suffice is 
                        to say, I was brutalized. 

                                 DUNLOP
                        To be clear, Barry: you were 
                        physically harmed?

                                 WEISS
                        Yes, they beat me continuously. 
                        Especially this one particular 
                        detective. Brant is his name.

           Weiss plucks champagne from an ice bucket, wiggles the 
           bottle over his glass, just the dregs left, shouts:

                                 WEISS (CONT’D)
                        Ivan! Another bottle of Cristal. 
                        Chop chop.

           IVAN, Weiss’ big baby bodyguard, rises from an adjacent 
           table and waddles over to the bar. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MCDONALD’S FLAT -- DAY

           PC McDonald sitting on his sofa drinking scotch, been doing 
           this for a while apparently, looks well tanked. 

           McDonald lives in a one-bedroom basic unit on the edge of 
           Kennington. Cobra movie poster on the wall in a frame. 
           Oprah on the TV, it’s a special on incest.

           McDonald seems to be staring straight through the TV, 
           somewhere between livid and lost.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. POLICE STATION/CANTEEN -- DAY

           Porter Nash sitting at a table, in front of him: an uneaten 
           bacon sandwich, copy of today’s Tabloid. 

           On the FRONT PAGE, “Exclusive Interview with Barry Weiss by 
           Harold Dunlop.” Massive photo of Weiss, arms folded, 
           looking at the camera, an expression both coy and pensive.

           Nash pushes the newspaper away, ATTACKS his bacon sandwich. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FALLS’ HOUSE -- DAY

           Falls sitting in bed. A couple of days rest has restored 
           her. Stokes enters with a plate of toast and a letter.

                                 STOKES
                        I found this under the door.

           He hands her the letter, Falls’ name scrolled on the 
           envelope. She tears it open, reads something on a sheet of 
           paper --

                                 STOKES (CONT’D)
                        Anything?

                                 FALLS
                        Nah, junk mail.

           Falls folds the sheet of paper in half, slides it under a 
           magazine on the bedside table.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MCDONALD’S FLAT -- DAY

           McDonald is rummaging through a tool box -- finds what he’s 
           looking for -- a HAMMER, spanking new, still got the price 
           tag on it. 
           McDonald moves to a full length mirror, clutching the 
           hammer, gives himself a long look, possessed...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE WHITE HART -- EVENING

           It’s Tuesday night and this Trafalgar Square pub is jammed 
           with the cap-and-cravat crowd. We find Brant at the bar 
           sinking a pint. Slams down his empty glass, threads his way 
           out.

           INT. HOTEL BAR -- SAME

           The hotel bar where Weiss and Dunlop’s interview took 
           place. A TANKED Barry Weiss is ensconced at the bar 
           drinking Cristal and talking the BARMAN’S ear off --

                                 WEISS
                        I get fifty grand for the first 
                        article, twenty five for the next 
                        two --

           Ivan, Weiss’ body guard, is sitting a couple of stools 
           over. He gets up to take a piss. Weiss prattling on --

                                 WEISS (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna try and get on 
                        Celebrity Big Brother, why the 
                        fuck not...

           TOILET

           Ivan comes out of a toilet cubicle, finds himself face to 
           face with Brant.

                                 BRANT 
                        Hey Tiny Tears, you’re flying 
                        low.

           Even Ivan ain’t dumb enough to fall for that one. 

                                 IVAN
                        Who the fuck are you? 

           Ivan might have an Eastern European name but his accent is 
           more Bromley than Bucharest. He advances towards Brant 
           wearing his fists out in front of him -- takes a swing --

           Brant dances out of the way of the punch and takes a GOAL 
           KICK between the bodyguard’s chunky legs. 

           Down goes Ivan in a writhing heap. Brant stomps on him.
           INT. BAR -- LATER

           Barry Weiss has passed out on the bar. The place closed 
           some time ago, tables are cleared, most of the lights off. 

           The Barman gives Weiss a nudge, it’s like waking the dead, 
           he left this to the very end for a reason.

                                 BARMAN
                        Mr. Weiss, we’re closed.

           Weiss stirs, groans loud, out of it.

                                 BARMAN (CONT’D)
                        I have to ask you to leave.

           HOTEL CORRIDOR

           Weiss emerges from a lift and swerves down a hallway, 
           crashes up against a table with a floral arrangement. 

           Overshoots his door, heads back, pulling out his key. Room 
           578. Even in his drunken state he notices that the lock’s 
           been tampered with, says to the dark room:

                                 WEISS
                        Ivan?

           And tumbles in.

           INT. WEISS’ HOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Weiss inside the door fumbling along the wall for the light 
           switch. Suddenly there is a CRUNCH and Weiss SHRIEKS and 
           COLLAPSES -- someone SNAPS ON THE LIGHT --

           Weiss on all fours. Most of his front teeth have been taken 
           out. His ruined mouth spewing black blood. He looks up, 
           recognizes his ASSAILANT, manages to gasp:

                                 WEISS (CONT’D)
                        You! 

           He SCREAMS -- a SHADOW closing over him...

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE HORIZON/LONDON

           The sun coming up on the South Bank. Another day. Stunning 
           mix of colours. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CANTEEN -- DAY

           Falls is sitting at Brant’s usual window table. Brant rocks 
           up with a Sid Vicious, two Club Milks.

                                 BRANT
                        Mind if I take a seat?

           He sits before she can answer. A pause. Falls has a hunch 
           this isn’t a social call.

           Brant swipes a newspaper off a chair. Barry Weiss’ murder 
           was three days ago but the papers are still full of it.  

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Good riddance to bad rubbish. 

           Falls keeps quiet. Brant flicks on, passes a photo of 
           Weiss’ body being wheeled out of the Hilton under a shroud.

           Brant pushes the paper away. Spots McDonald entering the 
           canteen with Roberts. 

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Nash thinks McDonald might have 
                        done it, says he was acting 
                        mighty strange. Personally I 
                        don’t think the kid has the 
                        bottle. McDonald hasn’t that rage 
                        yet, needs a few more years at 
                        least.
                              (a beat)
                        You on the other hand...

           Falls looks at him.

                                 FALLS
                        What?

           Brant just shrugs.

                                 FALLS (CONT’D)
                        You think I did it?

                                 BRANT
                        Did you?

                                 FALLS
                        No.

           Brant nods, sticks an entire Club Milk in his mouth, 
           swallows it near-whole.

                                 FALLS (CONT’D)
                        But I have my suspicious about 
                        you.
                                 BRANT
                        Yeah? You and half the Met. But 
                        I’m off the hook, got myself a 
                        gold plated alibi.

                                 FALLS
                        Let me guess, Nash.

                                 BRANT
                        No, not Nash. My alibi’s an 
                        entire pub full of hooray 
                        henries. At the time of the 
                        murder, a bunch of us were 
                        involved in a lock-in around the 
                        corner from Weiss’ hotel. 

           Falls looks at Brant carefully, beginning to understand. He 
           leans in closer.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        That’s right, I got rid of the 
                        bodyguard, made it easy for you.  
                              (then)
                        You get my note?

           QUICK CUT/FLASHBACK:

           Falls sitting in bed reading the letter Stokes handed to 
           her. We now see what was written on the piece of paper:

           “THE BLITZ, HILTON, ROOM 578.”

           CANTEEN -- PRESENT

           Falls is holding Brant’s gaze, not giving anything away. 

                                 FALLS
                        I don’t know what you mean.

                                 BRANT 
                        Sure you don’t. What is this, 
                        just some friendly banter between 
                        colleagues, no big deal.

           Brant’s energy slackens for a sec, even gives her the wolf 
           smile, then he leans back in.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        We all wanted a crack at Weiss -- 
                        shit, I was well up for it -- but 
                        he killed your skinhead friend 
                        right in front of you, figured 
                        you should get first dibs, only 
                        fair.  
                              (a beat)
                        According to the report...
           Through the next part of Brant’s speech we see a SEQUENCE 
           of VERY FAST CUTS:  

           WEISS’ HOTEL ROOM/FLASHBACK

           Falls standing before Barry Weiss, wearing black leather 
           gloves, New York Yankees baseball cap...and clutching a 
           HAMMER.

                                 BRANT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Old Barry’s head was 
                        demolished... 

           Falls pounces on Weiss -- 

                                 BRANT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The attack was up close and very 
                        personal.

           Falls DESTROYS Weiss’ SKULL with a series of BLOWS --

                                 BRANT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He was hit something like ten 
                        times --     

           Weiss’ eyeballs are the only thing left intact -- it’s as 
           if he’s staring at Falls from the afterlife, impressed...

           CANTEEN -- PRESENT

           Back with Brant and Falls.

                                 BRANT (CONT’D)
                        Was it necessary?

                                 FALLS
                        I’d say so.

                                 BRANT
                        Feel better now? 

                                 FALLS
                        Much.

           She’s not giving away anything more.  

                                 BRANT
                        Way I see it, that’s two things 
                        you owe me now. A thank you 
                        wouldn’t go amiss.  

           Down in the carpark Stokes has just pulled up in his Rover. 

                                 FALLS
                        My ride’s here.
           Falls stands.

                                 FALLS (CONT’D)
                        Next time, tea’s on me, alright? 

           And she takes off. 

           EXT. CARPARK

           Stokes steps out of his car, leans against the door, lights 
           a Silk Cut. 

           CANTEEN 

           Brant sees Falls emerge from the station. She walks up to 
           Stokes, kisses him on the cheek, moves around to the 
           passenger side door. 

           Brant didn’t notice, but Nash has been standing behind him 
           for the last few seconds, watching over his shoulder. 

                                 NASH
                        Think they’ll make it?

                                 BRANT
                        Fucked if I know.

           Nash observes Brant’s tea.

                                 NASH
                        Don’t you want a real drink?

                                 BRANT
                        With all my soul, I was afraid to 
                        start.

                                 NASH
                        Why don’t you start now. I’m 
                        buying.

                                 BRANT
                        Let’s go.

           Nash leads the way.

           We remain at the window for a moment watching Stokes’ car 
           pull into traffic. A clear day in South East London, not a 
           cloud in the sky.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. PARK -- DAY

           Brant standing in a small residential park smoking a 
           Weight. At his feet...Thelma and Louise, two pitbulls, 
           their MUZZLES removed.

           A HOUSE

           Harold Dunlop emerges from his semi-detached town house, 
           brief case at his side, wearing a crisp Paul Smith suit. 

                                 BRANT
                              (to the pits)
                        There he is...there’s brekie. 

           And the pits lick their wretched chops, growling...

           Dunlop is looking for a taxi -- sees Brant -- sees the 
           pitbulls  -- sees his future. The SMUG look on the 
           journalist’s face SHATTERING...

           Dunlop considers diving back into his house, but Brant is 
           already heading in that direction -- Dunlop has no choice
