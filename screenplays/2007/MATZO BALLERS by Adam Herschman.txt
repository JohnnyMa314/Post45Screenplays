           EXT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER - DAY

           SUPER: Highland Park, Chicago, January 1990. 

           Snow falls on parking lot cars. Sounds of a BASKETBALL 
           BOUNCING, SWEAT DRIPPING and HEARTS BEATING echoes. 

           CLOSE-UP of announcement board: ”6th Grade Championship - 
           Talmud Torah vs. Beth El“. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           MR. KAPLAN, late 30s, sweats through his ”TALMUD TORAH 
           BASKETBALL“ hat and giant spectacles.

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                        Listen up! You’re one basket away from 
                        being the best sixth grade Jewish 
                        basketball team in Highland Park. 

           Talmud torah teammates, YOUNG ABE KAPLAN, YOUNG JAY 
           GOODMAN, YOUNG ALAN SEGAL and YOUNG LARRY FELDMAN, 
           realize the seriousness of the moment. The scoreboard 
           reads Beth El 28, Talmud Torah 27, with 14 seconds left.

                                 MR. KAPLAN (CONT’D)
                        And with all your Bar-Mitzvah’s fast 
                        approaching, if you win this, you’ll get 
                        more poon then Gene Simmons at a Kiss 
                        concert. Now, let’s run ”Play 1“. It’s 
                        been our bread and butter all year.

                                 YOUNG ABE KAPLAN
                        It’s our only play, dad.

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                        Shut up son. Just inbound the ball to 
                        Alan or Larry. Then look for Jay on the 
                        wing for the winning shot. Got it?

                                 YOUNG MOSES EPSTEIN
                        What should I do Mr. Kaplan?

           YOUNG MOSES EPSTEIN, a gutsy kid with a Jew-fro, is the 
           smallest kid on the team.
                                 MR. KAPLAN
                                (annoyed)
                        Okay, Moses, you’re the most important 
                        player on this one because you’re the 
                        decoy. Keep your man away from the play.

                                 YOUNG MOSES EPSTEIN
                        Yeah, but coach I’ve been open all game. 
                        I’m clutch city. I’ll make it. 

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                        Jesus Christ Epstein! You haven’t scored 
                        in a game all year.

                                 YOUNG ALAN SEGAL
                        Or practice.

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                        Or practice. Just stay far away. Go to 
                        Cleveland if you have to. Now, here we 
                        go! Let’s make history.

           BARRY EPSTEIN, one of the few spectators, gives his son a 
           thumbs up as the teams take the floor. He has a PHOTO PIN 
           of his son on his jacket.

           The Ref blows his WHISTLE. Abe struggles to inbound the 
           ball, as the Beth El team presses Talmud Torah. Left 
           unguarded, Moses runs down the court.

                                 YOUNG MOSES EPSTEIN
                        Abe! Abe! I’m open!

           Abe looks at his father, and decides to go against his 
           wishes. He throws a baseball pass to Moses.

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                        Oh crap.

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        C’mon Moses...

           Moses catches it and dribbles down the court.

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                        Pass it! 

           Moses looks at his coach and keeps dribbling.

                                 MR. KAPLAN (CONT’D)
                        Pass the damn ball, Epstein!!!
                                 YOUNG ABE KAPLAN
                        I’m open!

                                 YOUNG JAY GOODMAN
                        Pass it!

                                 MOSES
                                (to himself)
                        This is going in.

           With the clock winding down, Moses shoots but YOUNG ISAAC 
           RUBINOWITZ of Beth El blocks his shot at the buzzer. 

           FREEZE FRAME of Isaac blocking Moses. 

                                 MR. KAPLAN (V.O.)
                        Moses! Moses!

                                                               FADE OUT:

           INT. KAPLAN’S DELI - PRESENT DAY

           REVEAL black and white framed PHOTO of Isaac blocking 
           Moses. The caption underneath photo reads, ISAAC ”JEWISH 
           JORDAN“ RUBINOWITZ.

                                 MR. KAPLAN (O.S.)
                        Moses...

           MOSES EPSTEIN, now 25, still short and sporting a Jew-
           Fro, vigorously tries to rip the photo off the wall.

                                 MR. KAPLAN (CONT’D)
                        Let go! It’s bolted.

           Mr. Kaplan, now in his 50s, balder and heavier, but 
           wearing the same glasses he wore in 1990, hands a woman a 
           grocery bag of food.

                                 MR. KAPLAN (CONT’D)
                        Would you like anything else Mrs. Kline?

           She looks in the deli freezer.

                                 MRS. DINNERSTEIN
                                (quietly)
                        Yeah, I want some tongue.

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                                (quietly)
                        Not here baby...seven o’clock, Motel Six.
                                 MOSES
                        Isn’t time you take this photo down?

           Rubinowitz’s photo hangs on the ”Kaplan Deli Wall-of-
           Fame“ (in lights), dedicated to other Jewish sports 
           legends like Sandy Koufax, Dolph Schayes, Shawn Green...

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                        No! Isaac Rubinowitz is the greatest 
                        player to ever come out of Highland Park. 
                        He’s a living legend! And we would’ve 
                        beat him, if you passed the damn ball.

                                 MOSES 
                        Yeah, yeah. Can I just get a corn beef 
                        sandwich please. Sliced thin, on rye. 
                        Pickles. And thousand island.

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                        Would you like me to throw in a jump shot 
                        with that or cole slaw?

                                 MOSES
                        Cole slaw’s fine. Is Abe working today?

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                        Yeah, it’s his punishment for passing you 
                        the ball. I don’t know why you two still 
                        play. Your punishing yourselves. You’ll 
                        never win the JCC Championship--

           The deli door opens and three tough looking Jews enter 
           wearing cheesy, black satin jackets that say ”DREIDELS“.

                                 MR. KAPLAN (CONT’D)
                        ...as long as the these guys are playing. 
                        Abe, Moses owes ten dollars.

           ABE KAPLAN, now 25, semi-nerdy, limps over to Moses. 

                                 MR. KAPLAN (CONT’D)
                        Gentlemen, what can I get ya?

           Mr. Kaplan helps the Dreidels. Moses pays Abe.

                                 MOSES
                        God damn Dreidels.

                                 ABE
                        Cool jackets. So are you going to 
                        services this week?
                                 MOSES 
                        For what?

                                 ABE

                        Rosh Hashanah? 

                                 ABE
                        The Jewish New Year. Moses, how could you 
                        not know when Rosh Hashanah is?

                                 MOSES
                        More importantly how come you’re limping?

                                 ABE 
                        I slipped on a pile of gefilte fish.

                        Smear some BenGay on it. We need you

                                 ABE
                        I’ll be ready.

           The Dreidels talk it up with Mr. Kaplan.

                                 MOSES 
                        Why does your dad like those assholes?

                        Well, well, well, if it isn’t Moses

           bad toupee, whispers to Rosenberg.

                                 ROSENBERG (CONT’D)
                        No. That’s not what I mean. I listen to

           Abe nods to Moses, “like yeah, we’re down“.

                                 MOSES
                        Yeah, I’m down.

                                 SEGAL
                        Good!

           ...the ball flies over the basket.

           SUPER: ”Alan Segal - 5’7’’ shooting guard“
           Kaplan wearing protective gear, knee-braces, elbow pads, 
           mouth-guard and goggles, jumps for a rebound but turns 
           his ankle. He holds his ankle in pain--

                                 ABE
                        Awwwww!

           Finally, LARRY FELDMAN, now 27, sloppy, overweight, 
           sporting Rex-Spex athletic goggles and a goatee, takes a 
           variety of hook shots and trick shots.

                        Dammit Feldman! Can’t you work on 
                        rebounding and defense for once?

                                 FELDMAN
                        Hell, no! Rebounding and defense don’t 
                        get you laid. The ladies want someone who 
                        can score.

           WHISTLE blows. MONTAGE ends.

                                 MOSES
                        Hold your balls. 

           Everyone stops shooting and holds their basketballs. 
           Moses has a whistle around his neck.

                                 MOSES  (CONT’D)
                        We have a lot to practice before the 
                        first game of the season. I’m installing 
                        a new offense. It’s top-secret.

                                 JAY

                        No. The pentagon. Now, let’s get to work.
                        Larry, what on earth are you doing?

                                 FELDMAN
                        Holding my balls, coach.

           Segal laughs.

                        Good one Feldman. You’re so literal.

                                 FELDMAN
                        Don’t hate the player, hate the game.

           Segal and Feldman hi-five.

           INT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER HALLWAY - 26 MINUTES LATER

           A ball rolls down the hallway. Moses, sweating profusely, 
           chases after it.

                                 SARAH (O.C.)
                        Moses Epstein?

           SARAH HOFFMAN, a beautiful, dark-haired girl, picks up 
           the ball. Moses is shocked to see her.

                                 MOSES
                        Sarah? Sarah Hoffman? What are you doing 
                        here? I thought you lived in Seattle.

                                 SARAH
                        Not anymore. I just moved back last week. 
                        I got this cool job running the JCC after 
                        school programs.

                                 MOSES 
                        That’s so cool you work here, because I 
                        play with my balls here.

           Sarah looks at him funny.

                                 MOSES (CONT’D)
                        I mean I play ball here. Basketball. I’m 
                        a good dribbler.

           Moses can’t help but be in awe of her.

                                 SARAH
                        I hear the JCC’s pretty competitive. So 
                        what have you been up to?

                                 MOSES 
                        I’m in the music business now.

                                 SARAH
                        Really?
                                 MOSES
                        Yeah, I got my own company. We’re growing 
                        pretty fast. Bought a camel. Some gum.

                                 SARAH 
                        You look the same. Jew-Fro and all.

                                 MOSES
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        I mean you haven’t changed. I still 
                        remember studying for that chemistry test 
                        with you. You’re mom made us cookies. You 
                        ate all of them.

                                 MOSES
                        Sorry. I didn’t have lunch that day.

                                 SARAH
                        I thought you were going to ask me to 
                        prom that night.

                                 MOSES
                        You did?

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah. I thought that it was so cool you 
                        lived in your parents basement.

                                 MOSES
                                (laughs, then)
                        Listen, since you work here maybe you can 
                        come to our first game Wednesday night.

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah, maybe. Good to see you Moses.

           She hands him the ball. He dribbles down the hall.

                                 MOSES
                                (smiles)
                        See you later. Wednesday, maybe.

           Moses tries to impress her with his vertical by jumping 
           to hit the ”EXIT“ sign...which he hits too hard and 
           breaks! The sign hangs by a few wires...SPARKS fly!

           INT. EPSTEIN’S KITCHEN - DAY

           BARRY EPSTEIN, 53, curly hair, glasses, dorky, hovers 
           over a plate of lox.
                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        Is lox considered sushi?

           SHEILA EPSTEIN, 51, overprotective Jewish mother with 
           braces, gets brunch ready.

                                 SHEILA EPSTEIN
                        Don’t know. Brunch is ready. Where’s Mo? 

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        Home. I’ll call him, see if he’s coming.

           Barry walks by the phone. Opens a door, yells downstairs.

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN (CONT’D)
                        Dinner!

           INT. EPSTEIN’S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           In the dark, silence of his parents basement, Moses 
           watches grainy, video of last year’s championship game. 
           He still lives in his parents basement.

                                 MOSES
                        Coming!

           INT. EPSTEIN’S DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Moses walks in, grabs some lox, and starts eating.

                                 SHEILA EPSTEIN
                        Barry I got a call from Dr. Goldfarb’s 
                        office. They said he’s moving to Florida. 

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        Good. He overcharged me $46 for bifocals.

                                 SHEILA EPSTEIN
                        I have to find you a new optometrist. 
                        Moses, what about going back to school 
                        and becoming an optometrist?

                                 MOSES
                        Mom, I’m not going to be a doctor. I have 
                        my own business. 

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        Moses, guess who I bumped into today.

                                 MOSES
                        Who?
                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        Isaac Rubinowitz.

           Moses stops eating.

                                 SHEILA EPSTEIN
                        The Jewish Jordan?

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        Yeah. He remembered who I was. Can you 
                        believe that. Kid’s got a firm handshake.

                                 SHEILA EPSTEIN
                        What a mensch. I hear he’s a very 
                        successful stockbroker in New York.

                                 MOSES
                        He’s a thief. I heard he was the reason 
                        Frito Lay went bankrupt. 

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        Frito Lay isn’t bankrupt.

                                 MOSES
                        Not yet. Did he say why he was here?

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN 
                        I didn’t have a chance to ask him. My 
                        back went out. Damn that Murray Fisher! I 
                        should have never let him talk me into 
                        going to that bull-riding camp.

                                 SHEILA EPSTEIN
                        He’s probably in town for the Jewish 
                        Holidays. Which by the way Moses, you are 
                        going to services this year.

           Moses shakes his head.

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        Didn’t Isaac used to date your friend, 
                        what’s her name? Sarah something.

                                 SHEILA EPSTEIN
                        Sarah Hoffman! Isaac took her to prom 
                        after your son chickened out. Poor Moses 
                        was so depressed after that. Remember 
                        that Barry?

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        No. Pass the cream cheese.
                                 MOSES
                        Speaking of Sarah, I saw her today. 

                                 SHEILA EPSTEIN
                        Really?

                                 MOSES
                        Yeah. She moved back to town and she’s 
                        working at the JCC.

                                 SHEILA EPSTEIN
                        You know if you had a good job like 
                        Isaac, you could take her on a date to 
                        one of those fancy downtown restaurants.

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN 
                        Sheila, leave the boy alone! 

                                 SHEILA EPSTEIN
                        Barry don’t start. It’s time he grows up! 
                        He has no future.

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        Honey, what are you talking about? He’s 
                        got a great job!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. RAMADA BALLROOM - NIGHT

           Fog fills the dancefloor as an audience looks on with 
           anticipation. ”Sammy’s Bar-Mitzvah“ banner hangs above.

                                 MOSES (O.S.)
                        He’s Captainnnn! Bar-Mitzz-vahhh! He’s 
                        Captainnnn! Bar-Mitzz-vahhh!

           The crowd joins in the chant, ”He’s Captain Bar-Mitzvah“.

           Moses walks through the fog, super-hero like in zebra 
           tights and a cape. ”It takes two“ kicks in. Moses busts 
           into a crazy dancing routine. The crowd goes nuts. 

           He ends the routine in the splits, ripping his tights, 
           then winces, and rolls over holding his crotch in pain.

           EXT. TEMPLE SHALOM SYNAGOGUE - NIGHT

           CLOSE-UP of marquis – ”Celebrate Rosh Hashanah at Temple 
           Shalom. Happy New Year.“
           INT. TEMPLE SHALOM SYNAGOGUE - CONTINUOUS

           RABBI SINGER, balding, glasses, leads the sermon.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        ...which brings me to my favorite part of 
                        Rosh Hashanah. The blowing of the shofar. 

                                 SHEILA EPSTEIN
                        I could listen to Rabbi Singer talk 
                        forever. He’s so genuine and insightful.

           Moses is not focused on the Rabbi. Instead, Moses gazes 
           across the pews at the beautiful Sarah Hoffman who sits 
           with her family. She gives him a smile.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        And here to blow the shofar tonight, a 
                        graduate of Harvard Business school, who 
                        decided to give up Wall Street in order 
                        to move back and run Greenberg, Greenberg 
                        and Greenstein. The greatest basketball 
                        player in Highland Park history. 

           Moses eyes widen.

                                 RABBI SINGER (CONT’D)
                        Temple Shalom please welcome home, Isaac 
                        Rubinowitz.

           ISAAC RUBINOWITZ AKA ”The JEWISH JORDAN“ walks out from 
           behind the beama holding a shofar. He’s tall, good 
           looking, wears a yamulke.

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                                (amazed)
                        It’s the Jewish Jordan.

           He winks at a pretty girl.

                                 GIRL
                        I love you!

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                        Welcome back!

           The temple is elated with his return except for...

                                 ABE
                        No way.
                                 MOSES
                        No fucking way.

           The Jewish Jordan raises the shofar toward the sky. He 
           bends his knees and blows it perfectly.

           EXT. TEMPLE SHALOM PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Moses listens to his parents talk to another couple.

                                 SHEILA EPSTEIN
                        I didn’t know he could blow the shofar.

                                 MOSES
                        I’ll be right back.

           Moses walks around the corner to get away from the buzz. 

                                 MOSES (CONT’D)
                        He can blow a shofar, so what? I used to 
                        play ”Hot Cross Buns” on the recorder.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Moses Epstein, right?

                                 MOSES
                        Yeah.

           Moses looks up and sees the Jewish Jordan. He takes a 
           drag from his cigarette and blows it in Moses’s face.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN

                        know the ones with the black eye makeup.

           LOU RUTMAN, 59, white hair, groggy voice, passes by.

                                 RUTMAN
                        Welcome back Isaac!

           Jewish Jordan hides his cigarette.
                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Thanks, Mr Rutman. Good to be home.

                        You too. Take care.

           Rutman leaves. Jewish Jordan takes a puff.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN 
                        What a fag. So Rosenberg told me you’ve 
                        never won the JCC.

                        as a yamulke.

           He waves to JACKIE RUTMAN, Lou Rutman’s hot daughter.

                                 MOSES
                        That’s Lou Rutman’s daughter.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        I know. If she’s as freaky as her mom, 
                        it’s all good. Three-some! 

           REVEAL Mrs. Rutman, a MILF, also waving to the Jewish 
           Jordan. He takes another drag, then sticks out his tongue 
           and motions ”eating out“. Moses sees his crude side.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        It may be Rosh Hashanah out here, but 
                        it’s Tu B’Shevat in my pants. So you 
                        think you’re gonna win it this year?

                                 MOSES
                        That’s right.
                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Well, I don’t think so. I joined the 
                        Dreidels. Late.

           He flicks his cigarette at Moses’ feet and walks over to 
           an elderly lady struggling to walk.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Hi Mrs. Werner. May I help a pretty, 
                        young lady like you cross the street?

           Moses watches them cross the street. Jewish Jordan looks 
           back at winks at Moses.

                                 MOSES
                        This is war.

           INT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

           The Dreidels, wearing pro-style warm-ups, run into the 
           gym to Technotronic’s ”Pump up the Jam“. The Jewish 
           Jordan runs in last to the roar of the crowd. 

                                 FELDMAN
                        He’s bad-ass.

                                 SEGAL
                        So are those jackets.

                                 ABE
                        That’s what I said. We need jackets.

                                 MOSES
                        Shut up!

           REVEAL name on jersey of Moses’ team - The MATZO-BALLERS!

           They watch in awe as the Dreidels run the backboard-
           drill. Jewish Jordan catches the last ball and scores.

           The Dreidels even have their own mascot: a Dreidel.

           The DOCTOR, JCC League Commissioner, and total stoner, 
           taps Moses on the shoulder. He wears blue scrubs and a 
           hat that says ”The Commish“.

                                 DOCTOR 
                        Epstein, there’s rumors guys are doping.

                                 MOSES

                                 DOCTOR
                        Yeah, man.

           CLOSE-UP of Dreidel Gabe Rosenberg  hitting himself in 
           the face. Rosenberg smiles at them. He has a mouth-guard 
           with ”R.I.P.“ written on it in black marker.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        I’m not taking any chances of foul play. 
                        Fred’s administering random drug tests.

           FRED, the nerdy JCC score-keeper, combs his hair. Doctor 
           and Fred sit together at the scoretable during JCC games.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        So tell your team. And stay away from the 
                        juice. And I’m not talking about 
                        Manishevitz grape.

           HORN sounds. Teams meet at center court with hard looks 
           and taunts. Moses notices Sarah in the crowd and waves.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Who’s that?

                                 MOSES
                        Sarah.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Don’t know her.

                                 MOSES
                        Don’t know her? You took her to prom. 
                        It’s Sarah Hoffman.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        That’s Sarah Hoffman? She’s hotter than I 
                        remember. Probably because I only 
                        remember the top of her head, if you know 
                        what I mean.

           Devastated, Moses is paralyzed by the thought. Dreidels 
           win the tip-off and the Jewish Jordan scores.

           With the Jewish Jordan’s brilliant play and Rosenberg’s 
           physical presence, the Dreidels win in a blowout 57-14.

           After the game, Steckman and Rosenberg approach Moses.

                                 ROSENBERG
                        Moses, you almost had a double-double.
                                 STECKMAN 
                        Fouls and turnovers!

           Moses goes after Steckman, but he’s held back by Feldman.

                                 FELDMAN
                        It’s not worth it, man. Save it for the 
                        playoffs.

                        Hey, my grandpa can coach us.

                                 ABE
                        Dick Cooperman?

                                 SEGAL
                        He’s a JCC legend.

                                 FELDMAN
                        He’s gay, Segal. Really, really, gay.
                                 SEGAL
                        He got lonely after Bubby died.

                                 ABE
                        Forget it. Moses is our coach. What 
                        should we do, coach?

                                 MOSES
                        He said she went down on him.

                                 ABE
                        Who?

                                 MOSES
                        The Jewish Jordan.

                                 SEGAL
                        The Jewish Jordan went down on him?

                                 FELDMAN
                        Yeah, like your grandpa.

                                 MOSES
                        No, the Jewish Jordan said Sarah 
                        performed orally for him. How could she  
                        stoop so low.

                                 ABE
                        Guess there’s only one thing you can do.

                                 MOSES
                        What’s that?

                                 ABE
                        Win the whole fucking thing.

           The team nods in agreement.

           EXT. FOSTER PARK (SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO) - DAY

           A chain link fence encompasses a concrete basketball 
           court with chain nets. A game ends on a made basket. 
           Moses and his crew walk through the chain link door.

                                 MOSES 
                        The only way to get better is to practice 
                        against better competition. We got next!

           The game stops abruptly, all the playground ballers stare 
           in disbelief at the only white guys around.
                                 MOSES (CONT’D)
                        Sup dawg? 

           EXT. GHETTO PLAYGROUND - MOMENTS LATER

           Moses and his teammates wait to play next to BERNARD and 
           BOOTSY. They’re both tall and muscular, tatooed ballers.

                                 MOSES
                        So where you from?

                                 BERNARD
                        The projects.

           GUNSHOT goes off in the distance, Moses jumps.

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Yo, White Chocolate...you’re up.

           Moses looks at five, tall, in shape, African Americans 
           who are waiting to play them.

                                 MOSES
                                (to his teammates)
                        Their legs gotta be tired. They’ve been 
                        balling all day. We can beat these guys.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           GAME - MOMENTS LATER

           ”Apache“ by the Sugar Hill Gang starts this MONTAGE. On 
           the first play, the other team scores on an alley-oop 
           dunk. Eight more blocks and dunks by this team follow in 
           rapid succession. They lead 9-0.

           Finally Moses gets the ball...but the guy guarding him, 
           JULIUS RICHARDSON, steals it.

                                 MOSES 
                        Shit!

           Julius, 6-foot-3, toothpick skinny, corn-rows, mack daddy 
           cool, takes it the length of the floor, cocks the ball 
           behind his head, and slams it through the hoop!

                                 MOSES (CONT’D)
                        Sweet Jesus.

           Julius smiles showcasing his gold teeth.
                                 MOSES (CONT’D)
                        We gotta score here or we get skunked.

           They pass it around. Moses shoots, but this time it’s 
           blocked by Julius knocking Moses down. Bootsy grabs the 
           ball and dunks it for the final score 11-0. 

                                 BOOTSY
                        Game.

           But Julius can’t take his eyes off the Star of David 
           hanging around Moses’s neck.

                                 JAY
                        I’m outta here.

                                 SEGAL
                        Me too.

           Jay, Segal, Abe and Feldman walk off the court.

           Moses lays on the ground looking at the sky when Julius 
           approaches.

                                 JULIUS 
                        Yo, I couldn’t help but notice your 
                        Jewish Star. 

                                 MOSES
                        Here! Take it!

           Moses starts to take off his necklace.

                                 JULIUS
                        What? No, I don’t want it. I just...my 
                        name’s Julius.

           Julius helps Moses up.

                                 MOSES
                        Like Julius Erving?

                                 JULIUS
                        Yeah. 

                                 MOSES
                        Holy shit! My name’s Moses. Moses 
                        Epstein. Like Moses Malone, Dr. J’s 
                        teammate on the ‘83 Championship team. 

                                 JULIUS
                        Do you know a Rachel Birnbaum by chance?
                                 MOSES

                        That’s my girlfriend, dawg.

                                 MOSES
                        And one heck of a personality.

                                 JULIUS
                        I want to propose to her. But she won’t 
                        marry anyone who ain’t Jewish.

                                 MOSES
                        Uh-huh. Listen, I gotta catch up with my 
                        friends, but it was nice to meet you.

           Moses walks away.

                                 JULIUS
                        Wait! What I’m trying to say is I want to 
                        convert to Judaism but I don’t know any 
                        Jews besides Rachel. And I wanted to 
                        surprise her. Can you help me?

                                 MOSES
                        Me?

                                 JULIUS
                        I believe in fate. And seeing your Jewish 
                        Star is like a sign telling me do it. 
                        C’mon dawg haven’t you ever been in love?

           Moses thinks about Sarah.

                                 JULIUS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll do anything. 

                                 MOSES

           Julius struts in wearing Sean John and diamond studs.

                                 MOSES
                        Gentleman, I’d like you to meet our new 
                        teammate Julius Richardson.

           The team’s speechless. Julius looks at Abe’s jersey.

                                 JULIUS
                        Matzo-Ballers, huh?

                        Never won the big one, huh?

                                 MOSES
                        Not yet.

                                 JULIUS
                        Now you will.

           Julius dribbles between his legs, behind his back...

                                 ABE
                        Is he any good?

           He knocks down shot after shot. The team is in awe.

                        Can you dunk it?

           Julius takes off...

                                 SEGAL
                        He’s got handles, but is he Jewish?

           Julius throws down a windmill slam dunk!

                                 MOSES
                        He’ll be Jewish by playoffs.

           Moses walks out of the dressing room wearing silver 
           tights with yellow lightning bolts and a matching top.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Those look nice.

                        Thanks, my other pair ripped. But I’m 
                        looking for something with a bigger 
                        lightening bolt. I got a gig coming up.

           Sarah walks in, but Moses doesn’t see her.

                                 SALESMAN
                        I’ll check.

                                 MOSES
                        And I’m gonna need double stitching in 
                        the rear. And crotch!

           Sarah hears this and notices Moses, tights and all.

                                 SARAH
                        Nice outfit. What’s the occasion?

                        Oh, like you really came to see me.

                                 SARAH

                        A couple of the guys in the locker room 
                        said the Jewish Jordan has a third leg. 
                        What have you heard?

                                 SARAH

                        About why they call him baby’s arm.
                                 SARAH
                        Huh?

                                 MOSES 
                        Just curious, do you know if he wears

                        What’s wrong with you, Moses?

           Moses adjusts his crotch.

                                 MOSES
                        Nothing. I just thought I should tell you 
                        I know for a fact that he hates puppies, 
                        ice cream and kids. I love kids--

                                 SARAH
                        You like kids? I’m directing a play about

           Moses and Julius.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        Hello, I’m Rabbi Singer.

                                 JULIUS
                        Julius Richardson. Nice to meet you.

           They shake hands.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        You know, Moses was the worst Hebrew 
                        school student in Temple Shalom history. 
                        He lipsynched his entire Bar Mitzvah.

                                 MOSES
                        I was nervous.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        Now, what can I help you with?

           Rabbi Singer sips coffee from his ”Temple Shalom“ mug.

                                 JULIUS
                        I want to convert to Judaism. And Moses 
                        said this is the place to do it.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        Now, that’s a serious commitment. Why is 
                        that important to you?

                                 JULIUS
                        I’m in love.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        Love. That’s a good reason. But being 
                        Jewish is more than about being in love.

                                 MOSES
                                (sarcastic)
                        It’s about guilt, fatty foods, and a 
                        terrible athletic gene pool.
                                 RABBI SINGER
                        He’s kidding. Why don’t you stop by the 
                        Intro to Judaism class Thursday and we’ll 
                        go from there.

                                 JULIUS
                        Great.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        I’m the teacher, and just to let you know 
                        we do have a growing population of 
                        African Americans at Temple Shalom.

                                 JULIUS
                        Is that right?

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        The Rothstein’s adopted an orphan earlier 
                        this year. That’s his drawing.

           Finger painting of an African American kid surrounded by 
           Jewish stars and dreidels. Julius reads the message...

                                 JULIUS
                        ”Shabbat Shalom from Jerome.“ 

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        So Moses, I heard you had a tough game 
                        against the Dreidels.

                                 MOSES
                        Yeah. But we’ll be ready tomorrow for the 
                        Kosher Kings.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        I’ll see you there. It’s Jewish Jordan 
                        bobblehead night.

                                 MOSES
                        Huh?

           EXT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER - DAY

           The announcement board reads ”Jewish Jordan Night: First 
           25 Fans receive a Jewish Jordan bobblehead. 

           INT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           Fans play with their bobbleheads.
                                 SEGAL
                        I don’t get the bobblehead craze.

                                 FELDMAN
                        It’s big business.

           REVEAL Feldman’s bag of bobbleheads.

                                 SEGAL
                        What the--

                                 FELDMAN
                        Saul Fishman’s paying me thirty bucks a 
                        pop. He’s got buyers in Tampa.

           SAUL FISHMAN, a sleazy guy who shows up randomly at 
           games, takes a swig from a silver flask.

                                 JAY
                        The Jewish Jordan’s not even playing, and 
                        he has his own bobblehead night. What 
                        kind of morons run this league?

           Moses talks privately to the Doctor and Fred.

                                 DOCTOR
                        So, he’ll like be Jewish by playoffs?

                                 MOSES
                        Yeah.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Then I don’t like see any problem, man. 
                        Once he converts, he can play.

                                 MOSES
                        Great. Thanks. 

           Moses leaves. Personal checks are spread everywhere.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Hey man, did Feldman pay?

                                 FRED
                        Yep.

                                 DOCTOR
                        What about Segal? He’s not marked off.

                                 FRED
                        He paid cash.
                                 DOCTOR
                        Oh, right. What did I do with his money?

                                 FRED
                        Nudey-bar. Two for one dance night.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Don’t worry, man. I’ll like get it back.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           GAME - MATZO-BALLERS VS. KOSHER KINGS

           The Kings take a big lead as Segal heaves a 25-footer.

                                 SEGAL
                        Good!

           The ball hits Rabbi Singer in the face.

                                 MOSES
                        Dammit Segal! Stop taking thirty-footers. 
                        Run the offense.

           Moses looks up at the scoreboard Kings lead 14-2.

           ARNIE RIFKIN, Kings player, guards Feldman.

                                 RIFKIN
                        Hey Feldman, I heard you’re running the 
                        pentagon this season?

                                 FELDMAN
                        Yeah, so what?

                                 RIFKIN
                        The Pentagon is for fags.

                                 FELDMAN
                        So is your mom! 

                                 RIFKIN
                        What?

                                 FELDMAN
                        Try and stop this move Rifkin! Learned it 
                        at B.J. Armstrong’s basketball camp.

           Feldman tries to execute a 360-crossover, but it gets 
           stolen by the Kosher Kings and they score again.
                                 MOSES
                        Dammit Feldman! Stop dribbling! Defend 
                        and rebound. You’re our damn center.

           Finally Jay scores and gets fouled. As he sizes up his 
           foul shot, everyone starts talking.

                                 ABE
                        Nice shoes, Rifkin. Those BK’s?

           Rifkin looks at his British Knights basketball shoes. 

                                 RIFKIN
                        Yeah, got’em on sale at Famous. Hey 
                        Moses, is it true you’re working Charlie 
                        Goldstein's Bar Mitzvah.

                                 MOSES
                        Yeah, who told you that?

                                 RIFKIN
                        Dr. Goldfarb.

                                 MOSES
                        How would he know? He moved to Florida.

           Abe takes a puff from his inhaler.

                                 ABE
                        Hey, isn’t Dr. Goldfarb the guy who 
                        overcharged your dad $46 for bifocals?

                                 MOSES
                        Yep.

           Jay stops dribbling and joins the conversation.

                                 JAY
                        What’s the going rate for bifocals these 
                        days? My brother needs a pair.

           Lou Rutman jumps in. He wears a leg brace and sunglasses.

                                 RUTMAN
                        I paid $189 for mine.

                                 SEGAL
                        You gotta a good guy?

                                 RUTMAN
                        The best. Dr. Sid Levin outta Evanston.
           RAY THE REF, late 40s, balding, noticeable lazy eye, 
           wears two hearing aids, talks with a lisp and slight 
           stutter, blows his WHISTLE.

                                 RAY THE REF
                        Kingsss ball!

                                 MOSES
                        What the hell Ray?

                                 RAY THE REF
                        Your teammate took too long to shoot. 
                        There’s a ten second time limit, bub.

                                 MOSES
                        Bullshit!

           Moses kicks the basketball it into the stands.

                                 RAY THE REF
                        Technical FFF-oul. Number SSS-ix.

           FLASH CUTS of the Matzo-Ballers missing more shots and  
           making no look passes that go out of bounds.

           Segal gets another open shot...from half court.

                                 SEGAL 
                        Good.

           The ball lands caught between the rim and backboard. 
           Everyone surrounds the hoop, looking up 10-feet high.

                                 JAY
                        I got it.

           Jay jumps but doesn’t come close.

                                 RUTMAN
                        Step back. I’ll get it.

           Rutman jumps...getting one-inch of air.

                                 ABE
                        Step aside Lou.

                                 FELDMAN
                        Kaplan can get it. He’s got mad ups.

           Abe Kaplan takes a running start, jumps and falls to the 
           ground in pain.
                                 KAPLAN
                        Owww! 

           Kaplan rolls on the ground in pain.

                                 JAY
                        Great. Grant Hill’s hurt again.

                                 FELDMAN
                        I think I heard something pop.

                                 MOSES
                        I hope it’s not his ACL.

                                 SEGAL
                        Feldman, throw your shoe at it.

           Feldman throws his sneaker at the ball. It gets stuck on 
           top of the backboard. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Concepcion! The ball’s stuck! Concepcion!

                                 CONCEPCION (O.S.)
                        Chinga tu madre.

           CONCEPCION, JCC janitor, Latino, 30s, shaved head, struts 
           over as ”Cisco Kid“ by War plays. He knocks the ball 
           loose with a mop, but can’t reach the shoe.

                                 SEGAL
                        Thanks, Concepcion.

           The game continues with Feldman’s shoe on the backboard.

                                 JAY
                        This is going to be a long season.

           CLOSE-UP of SCOREBOARD Kings 55, Matzo-Ballers 23.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           AFTER THE GAME - LATER

           Moses packs up his gear, dejected from the loss.

                                 FELDMAN
                        See ya at Ed’s.
                                 MOSES
                        Save me a seat.
                                (to himself)
                        We suck.

           The Doctor casually hands Rifkin a bag of weed in 
           exchange for cash. Then he walks over to Moses.

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        Hey Moses.

                                 MOSES
                        Yeah.

           Fred and the Doctor walk up to Moses.

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        He can play.

                                 MOSES
                        Who?

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        Your friend. Next game.

                                 MOSES
                        Really? I thought you have to be Jewish 
                        to play in this league?

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        I forgot to tell you about this recent 
                        rule change. It’s like not published yet. 
                        But if he’s enrolled in conversion 
                        classes, he can play. 

                                 MOSES
                        Cool!

                                 THE DOCTOR
                        I’ll just need his dues plus operating 
                        costs and penalties for late addition. 
                        It’s going to be a little more than 
                        usual, comprende amigo?

                                 MOSES
                        Sure. How much?

                        Okay...but who is a Jew? What makes a

                                 JULIUS
                        A Jew is one who is born to a Jewish 
                        mother or one who converts to Judaism. 

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        Nice work Julius. But what does that 
                        mean? Well, one of the responsibilities 
                        of becoming a Jew is the idea of making 
                        the world a better place. Tikkun Olam.

           Rabbi Singer writes ”Tikkun Olam“ on the chalkboard.

                        Nice game, man. But like no more dunking.

                        No worries. It’s just very dangerous. And 
                        we don’t have insurance. 

           Feldman tries to dunk the ball, but falls on his ass.

           Moses and Julius check out the enormous crowd.

                                 MOSES
                        Welcome to the Jewish Super Bowl.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN (O.S.)
                        So this is the Dreidel Stopper, huh?

           The Jewish Jordan approaches them with Sarah.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        How you doing? I’m Isaac.

                                 JULIUS
                        Julius.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        This is Sarah.
                                 SARAH
                        Nice to meet you.

           Moses can’t believe Sarah’s with the Jewish Jordan.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        What are you doing here Epstein? It’s Yom 
                        Kippur. Shouldn’t you be recruiting more 
                        players. There’s a Denny’s across the 
                        street. Just kidding, good Yontif.

                                 SARAH
                                (embarrassed)
                        Good to see you Moses.

                                 MOSES
                        You too.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Oh and Julius, please say hi to Rachel 
                        for me. I hear you two are dating. I 
                        haven’t seen her since high school. Those 
                        leg braces were hot. Give her my best. 

           They walk inside leaving Moses and Julius pissed.

           INT. TEMPLE SHALOM SYNAGOGUE - MOMENTS LATER

           The CANTOR sings ”Alvinu Malkanu“. Moses sits by his 
           parents and Julius. Two aisles behind him, Feldman 
           listens to the game through an earpiece.

                                 MOSES
                                (whispering)
                        What’s the score?

                                 FELDMAN

                                 MOSES
                        Shit.

                                 SHEILA EPSTEIN
                        Shh. Are you enjoying the service Julius?

                                 JULIUS
                        Yeah, Rabbi Singer’s flossin’.
                                 RABBI SINGER 
                        ...this is a time to ask God for 
                        forgiveness. But it’s also a time to 
                        reflect on the past. 

           Moses looks at Jewish Jordan and Sarah.

                                 MOSES
                        I can’t believe she’s with him.

           Sitting next to the Jewish Jordan is Rosenberg and 
           Steckman. Rosenberg gives Moses the finger.

                                 JULIUS
                        Who’s that?

                                 MOSES
                        Gabe Rosenberg. He’s a professional 
                        dumbass. With a Ph.D in dickhead.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        As many of you know I lost my father, 
                        Rabbi Al Singer, two years ago. 

           Tears begin to well-up in Rabbi Singer’s eyes.

                                 RABBI SINGER (CONT’D)
                        It’s tough for me to talk about my father 
                        because I miss him so much. He was a 
                        decorated U.S. Soldier, a friend of the 
                        community and a great father.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        I learned many lessons from him.  As most 
                        of you know, he was in and out of 
                        hospitals for the last seven years of his 
                        life. But the last lesson he taught me 
                        came minutes before he passed away. We 
                        were all  gathered around his bed. He 
                        opened up his eyes, looked right at me 
                        and said--

                                 ROSENBERG (O.S.)
                        Let’s go Dreidels! Let’s go!

           Rabbi Singer stops talking.
                                 MOSES
                                (whispering to Feldman)
                        It’s Rosenberg. We gotta represent.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                                (very emotional)
                        ...then he passed away.

           Rabbi Singer starts crying. He gets it back together.

                                 RABBI SINGER (CONT’D)
                        I never told anyone this, but I became a 
                        rabbi because of him. My father taught me 
                        everything I know. He taught me about 
                        life. He taught me about death. He taught 
                        me to forgive. And he taught me--

           Segal, Goodman and Abe Kaplan turn around and smile.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        Without my father around, I had many 
                        challenges to face, but the biggest was--

                        I knew it! Julius smokes crack.

                                 JULIUS
                        Feldman, the rock is the basketball.

                        No, we need you off the bench. You’re our

                        That never plays.

                                 MOSES
                        We need Julius to shoot as much as 
                        possible if we’re gonna beat the Persian 
                        Pimp Daddy’s and get into the playoffs.

           The Pimp Daddy’s, all on cell phones, wear Dolce &

           Moses stands by Julius at midcourt right before tip-off.

           Matzo-Ballers make a run behind Julius’s hot shooting, 
           but the team starts to get frustrated.

                        Pass it! I’m open.

           Julius keeps shooting...and scoring...

           Scoreboard: Matzo Ballers: 48, Pimp Daddy’s: 23

                        Don’t worry about it Rosey. Lou had it

           The paramedics carry Lou out.

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - SOUTH SIDE - NIGHT

           Moses sits next to Julius at a wild house party. Once 
           again, Moses is the only white person.

                                 MOSES
                        I think we should trade Abe. He’s a 
                        problem in the locker room. We could get 
                        Lou Rutman and a second round pick. 

           Moses takes a sip from his 40oz. Olde English.

                                 JULIUS
                        You can’t trade him, dawg.

                                 MOSES
                        You’re right. Then someone else has to 
                        learn all the plays. Besides Lou’s on the 
                        DL. Whatever, we can still beat the 
                        Jewish Jordan with him.

                                 JULIUS 
                        Why do you care so much? He’s just a 
                        punk, man.

                                 MOSES
                        I have my reasons. He’s got it all. A 
                        jumpshot, a post up game and he’s dating 
                        Sarah. Since I’ve known him, I’ve never 
                        beat him at anything. Love, basketball--

                                 JULIUS 
                        Man, you’re so focused on him, you don’t 
                        even realize how great you’ve got it. 

                                 MOSES
                        How great do I have it?

                                 JULIUS
                        You were born into the ”Chosen people“.

                                 MOSES
                        ”Chosen“ for what? To be vertically 
                        challenged with high blood pressure? What 
                        are you talking about ”Chosen?“ 
                                 JULIUS
                        ”Chosen“ doesn’t mean you’re better than 
                        anyone else, Moses. ”Chosen“ means you 
                        have a responsibility to make this world 
                        a better place. I got to cut off my dick 
                        to be like you. I don’t think you 
                        appreciate that.

                                 MOSES 
                        God? Where was God for me in 6th grade? 
                        Or in twelfth grade when I shit my pants 
                        at Debbie Kline’s birthday party? Where 
                        was he then? God doesn’t care about me.

                                 JULIUS
                        That’s where you’re wrong Moses.

                        What do you care? You’re only converting 
                        so you can marry Rachel?

                                 JULIUS 
                        Maybe, at first, yeah. But I’ve learned a 
                        lot man. Do you even know anything about   
                        the person you were named after?

                                 MOSES
                        Yeah, Moses Malone. He averaged 24 points 
                        and 17 rebounds during the 1979 season.

                                 JULIUS
                        No, not that Moses. The Moses who freed 
                        the Israelites out of slavery from the 
                        Egyptians. His belief in God was so 
                        strong he made the Red Sea part in order 
                        to lead his people to freedom.

                                 MOSES
                        So?

                                 JULIUS
                        So, we’re not so different. You’re people 
                        were slaves. My people were slaves. 

                                 MOSES
                        When were your people slaves?

                                 JULIUS
                        Rabbi Singer said God is always watching. 
                        In good times and bad. God’s there.

                                 MOSES

                        Dude, you’re going to let this whole 
                        conversion thing get in the way of JCC 
                        basketball. 

                                 JULIUS
                        C’mon, this is really important to me.

                                 MOSES
                        Well at least we’re far enough ahead in 
                        the standings to make the playoffs.

                                 JULIUS
                        We’re in?

                                 MOSES
                        Yeah, the Menorahs lost last night. So 
                        we’re automatically in.

                        How is class going, Julius?

                                 JULIUS
                        Great. Mr. Epstein. Learning a lot.

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        Then would you do the honors and light 
                        the candles and say the brucha.

           Julius stands up.

                        I work for Rachel’s dad in sales. That’s 
                        actually how we met. At work.

                        We sell a lot of kitchen appliances.

                        Can you get me a deal on a waffle maker? 
                        I’m in the market.

                                 JULIUS
                        I’ll hook you up.

           Grandma takes a sip of red wine. She’s a little tipsy.

                        Since you’re converting...are you 
                        circumcised?

           Barry takes a deep breath.

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        No. Never made it. Got a flat outside 
                        South Bend. But we were there in spirit.

                        I’m on the wall of fame. Just moved back 
                        to town. Excuse me for a moment. Abe!

           Jewish Jordan spots Abe working.

                                 ABE
                        Yeah.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Just wanted to let you know that I was 
                        talking to some guys on the Pimp Daddy’s, 
                        and it sounds like Moses has been talking 
                        shit about you.

                                 ABE
                        What?

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        He’s told everyone that Julius and him 
                        can win the championship without you. 

                                 ABE
                        Moses?

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Yeah. Plus there’s a rumor you’re on the 
                        trading block.

                                 ABE 
                        No way. They need me.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Guess not. The only reason you’re winning 
                        is because of Julius.

           Jewish Jordan writes his name and number down.

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                        Here’s your order. On the house.

           Abe hands the Jewish Jordan his order, begrudgingly.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Gotta go. Sarah’s waiting for me at Torah 
                        study group. She wants me. Did you know I 
                        banged her older sister in the Temple 
                        Coat Room? Keep that one on the DL.

           He gives Julie his number.

                        He’s smooth, isn’t he?

                                 ABE
                        Dad, he’s an asshole and you know it.

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                        Son, when you’re a winner, you can be an 
                        asshole.

                        The office just gave this to me.

                        You sure you want to go one on five, bub?

           DREW SHAPIRO, Torahs player, brushes by Moses.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Yeah, Epstein. Don’t be a shmuck! You 
                        already made the playoffs.

                                  MOSES
                        Go to hell Shapiro. Toss the ball, Ray.

           Ray throws it up, and Moses loses the jump ball. The 
           Torahs score.

                        Travelling. Torahs ball.

           Ray confers with the Doctor and Fred. Ray then motions to

                                 RAY THE REF
                                (to Moses)
                        He can’t shoot, pass or dribble. But he 
                        can inbound the ball.

           Concepcion throws a soccer-style, two hand overhead toss   
           toward Moses. But the Torahs steal it and score.

           Sarah quietly walks in the gym and sits in the stands. 
           It’s a total rout!

                        Call the foul, Ray! They’re all over me! 

           Moses complains to the Ref, dives for loose balls, but 
           can’t seem to get going. Down 18-2, Shapiro pushes Moses 
           down going after a rebound.

                                 DOCTOR

                        No!

           He gets up, but he’s knocked down by DREW SHAPIRO.

                        Your mom’s a whore, Shapiro.

                                 SHAPIRO
                        Alleged! Alleged! You have no proof!

           Shapiro kicks Moses back down and walks away laughing.

                        Shapiro-o-o-!!!

           Moses tackles him. Sarah can’t believe it.

                        leglock, it’s lights out.

           Moses puts Shapiro in the figure-four leglock. The fans 
           stand up and start cheering for the smaller Moses.

                                 SHAPIRO

                        Stop! Get him off me.

           Shapiro’s teammates grab hold of Moses, and beat the crap 
           out of Moses. Even though Moses tries to fight back.

           Shapiro holds his jersey to his bloody lip.

           Ray the Ref blows his WHISTLE as the Doctor and Fred 
           break up the fight and pull Moses away.

           Moses, still in uniform, walks in with a swollen lip, 
           holding a bag of ice to his bruised face.

                                 ABE
                        Jesus, what happened to your face?

                        What happened to your balls!

           Moses holds up the, ”We quit,“ letter.

                        A letter?

                        Why did you quit?

                        Because you went Bobby Knight on us! You  
                        told Julius to never pass the ball! You 
                        dropped us like we’re not. We’re all sick

                        And you believed him? You’ve been my best 
                        friend since forever. Do you think I 
                        would trade you?

                        I don’t know. But you benched me in favor 
                        of your new best friend.
                                 MOSES
                        So your jealous?

                                 ABE
                        No. It’s just obvious you care more about 
                        winning then you do about me, Julius, or 
                        any of your friends.

           This hits Moses right in the gut.

                        Let me ask you something. Who was there 
                        when you fell off your bike and knocked 
                        your teeth out?

                                 MOSES
                        That was Feldman. 

                                 ABE
                        Who took the heat and got detention when 
                        you called Mrs. Cohen a Lesbo?

                        those drunk Puerto Ricans, Irishmen. That 
                        was me.

           Moses doesn’t know what to say.

                        I know you’re big goal in life is to beat 
                        the Jewish Jordan. I want to beat him as 
                        much as you do, but is it really worth 
                        losing your friends?

           Moses still can’t speak.

                        You’ll feel much better when you stop

                        he was in here.

                        No gracias Concepcion, I don’t smoke 
                        during the season. You hungry?

           Concepcion nods. Moses gives him half of his sandwich. 
           Moses looks on the wall at Concepcion’s time card.

           Buster Poindexter’s song ”Hot, Hot, Hot“ plays as the

                        Let him be.

           They go back upstairs. Moses pokes his head out - he’s 
           wearing athletic goggles and a snow hat. He has beard 
           like stubble, bloodshot eyes, just an overall mess.

           He pulls out a meat grinder hoagie and takes a bite when 
           on t.v., Moses sees the Jewish Jordan doing a cheesy 
           commercial for Highland Ford. His jaw drops.

                        Now back to ”Jake and the Fatman.“

           Moses gets out of bed, only wearing his tighty-whiteys. 

           Basketball Jones, I got a Basketball Jones...

           Moses stretches as ”Basketball Jones“ by Cheech and Chong 
           plays. He has a look of determination in his eyes.
                                 MR. KAPLAN (V.O.)
                        Isaac Rubinowitz is the greatest player 
                        to ever come out of Highland Park. He’s a 
                        living legend! And we would’ve beat him, 
                        if you passed the damn ball.

           After touching his toes, he picks up a basketball and 
           starts dribbling in place...

                                 SARAH (V.O.)
                        I thought you were going to ask me to 
                        prom that night.

           I’ll go one-on-one against the world...Moses dribbles 
           around his basement as the song builds.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN (V.O.)
                        That’s Sarah Hoffman? She’s hotter than I 
                        remember. Probably because I only 
                        remember the top of her head.

           In SLO-MO, he dribbles out of control, knocking over 
           lamps, furniture and of course his Matzo-Ball soup. 

                                 ABE (V.O.)
                        It’s just obvious you care more about 
                        winning then you do about me, Julius, or 
                        any of your friends.

           Moses dives for a loose ball across the floor...crashing 
           into the wall. He’s hit rock bottom.

           ”Basketball Jones“ fades out.

           Moses has a full beard, and looks like he didn’t sleep. 

                                 MOSES
                        Let’s go! Let’s play ball!
                                 DOCTOR
                        Mo, I can’t let you go one on five again. 

                                 MOSES
                        Why not?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Because you like got into a fight last 
                        game. This is a peaceful league, hombre. 
                        You have to forfeit.

                                 MOSES
                        But the winner goes to the Championship. 
                        C’mon Doc, let me play. I can beat’em.

                                 DOCTOR 
                        Sorry, Moses. There’s always next year.

           Moses looks at the JCC Trophy in the case.

                                 MOSES
                        Yeah...I understand.

           Defeated, Moses walks to the bench. Sits down and puts 
           his head in his hands.

                                 ABE (O.S.)
                        Sorry we’re late. 

           Moses looks up in shock to see Abe, Julius, Feldman, Jay 
           and Segal standing in uniform. Ready to play.

                                 MOSES
                        What are you doing here?

                                 JULIUS
                        We’re here to slay the Kings.

           Moses can’t believe it.

                                 MOSES
                        I’ve been a total shmuck lately.

                                 ABE
                                (smiles)
                        Yeah, but you’re not a shmuck all the 
                        time. And with us that goes a long way. 
                        Besides we want a shot at that 
                        championship. So who’s starting?

           Moses looks at everyone on the team.
                                 MOSES
                        You. 

                                 ABE
                        Me?

                                 MOSES
                        Yeah, Abe you’re starting. All of you. 
                        I’m starting this one on the bench. 

           They can’t believe Moses benched himself.

                                 JAY
                        Anything else coach?

           Moses notices that Feldman has needles in his neck.

                                 MOSES
                        Feldman, why do you have acupuncture 
                        needles in your neck?

                                 FELDMAN
                        Keeps me loose.

                                 SEGAL
                        That’s what I’m talking about.

           Segal and Feldman hi-five.

                                 ABE
                        Let’s wipe some Kosher King ass!

           Moses smiles.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           GAME - MATZO-BALLERS VS. KOSHER KINGS

           HIGHLIGHTS of the Matzo-Ballers playing like well-oiled 
           machine...Julius is passing and everyone is scoring.

                                 SEGAL
                        Kosher Kings? More like Kosher Queens!

                                 FELDMAN
                        Yeah, baby!

           Moses cheers for his teammates. And spends most of the 
           game on the bench. At halftime they lead 38-11.
                                 JULIUS
                                (to the team)
                        I gotta go.

                                 MOSES
                        What?

                                 JULIUS
                        I got my Bet Din tonight. 

                                 MOSES
                        Your what?

                                 JULIUS
                        Bet Din. The first step of my conversion. 
                        I have to face a religious court that 
                        will ask me questions about Judaism and 
                        what I’ve learned.

                                 MOSES
                        Well, get out of here then. Good luck. 

                                 MATZO-BALLERS
                        Good luck.

                                 JULIUS
                        You guys can hold the lead, right?

                                 FELDMAN
                        Hells yeah! I’m on fire. 

                                 JULIUS
                        Then ”Feed the Fire Feldman“.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SECOND HALF - MATZO-BALLERS VS. KOSHER KINGS

           PLAYOFF / CONVERSION MONTAGE BEGINS:

           With needles in his neck, Feldman can’t miss. He makes 
           hook shot after hook shot after hook shot. Debbie leads 
           the crowd in cheers of ”Feed the Fire Feldman“.

                                 FELDMAN
                        Feed the fire!

           Moses passes to Feldman. He swishes a 3-point hook shot.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. RABBINICAL  ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Julius tells his story to 3 RABBIS including Rabbi Singer 
           at the Bet Din (Jewish court).

                                 JULIUS
                        ...my goal as a Jew is simply ”Tikkun 
                        Olam“. Lately I’ve been thinking one way 
                        I could make this world a better place is 
                        if I donated my time. So a few days ago, 
                        I interviewed with the Boys and Girls 
                        Club in my neighborhood, and they said I 
                        could help them out once a week. 

           Rabbi Singer listens.

                                 JULIUS (CONT’D)
                        I also want to start a family. My 
                        girlfriend, Rachel is the love of my life 
                        and I’m going to ask her to marry me.

           Rabbi Singer smiles.

                                 JULIUS (CONT’D)
                        And I want to continue with my Jewish 
                        studies. So not only will I get married, 
                        but I want to have a Bar-Mitzvah too. So, 
                        I’ll be seeing you guys a lot, I guess...

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Moses, Jay, Segal, Abe and Feldman hold a sign up that 
           says: ”Cut it out! Mazel Tov on your circumcision!“

           A nurse wheels Julius out to large cheers from everyone.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Moses and Abe watch as the Dreidels rout the Persian Pimp 
           Daddy’s in the other playoff game. The Jewish Jordan 
           points at Moses.

           INT. INDOOR POOL - DAY

           Lit candles surround the Mikveh (ritual pool) as soothing 
           guitar music plays.

                                 JULIUS
                        Baruch atah Adonai Eloheinu melekh

                        v'tzivanu al ha-tvilah.

           Julius, naked, dunks himself in the water.

           As Julius gets out of the Mikveh, the three Rabbis can’t 
           help but stare at his package.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        Oh.

                                 RABBI 1

                        And that’s after circumcision.

           END OF PLAYOFF / CONVERSION MONTAGE.

           INT. JULIUS’ APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Julius sits with an ice pack on his crotch. His friends 
           are over watching ”Fiddler on the Roof“ on T.V.

                        What about tomorrow night?

                                 JULIUS
                        Can’t tomorrow either. We’re in the 
                        championship.

           Julius has an ice pack on his crotch.

                                (concerned)
                        So....how does it feel?

           Bernard grabs his jock. Julius looks down at his.

                                 JULIUS
                        Like driving an Escalade, after you’ve 
                        been in a Navigator your whole life.

                                 BERNARD
                        No shit?

                                 JULIUS
                        Yeah.

                                 BOOTSY
                        Have you taken your new Escalade out or a 
                        test drive yet?

                                 JULIUS
                        Not yet. But they did a beautiful job.

                                 BOOTSY
                        You mind if I catch a looksie?

                                 JULIUS
                        Not at all.

           Julius shows Bootsy the job. Bootsy nods in approval.

                                 BOOTSY
                        Shit. I always wanted an Escalade.

                                 BERNARD
                        Escalade’s are tight, but I’d hate to 
                        give up my Navvy. Ladies love my ride.

                                 BOOTSY
                        J-Dawg, you sure you’re gonna be ready to

                                 JULIUS
                        Doc gave me something to ease the pain. 
           EXT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

           It’s snowing like crazy. People dressed in winter 
           jackets, hats, and moon-boots walk in the JCC doors.

           The sign says ”JCC Basketball Championship 7:30 p.m. -

                        Thanks. They call it the ”Sammy“. It’s 
                        the exact replica of the one Sammy Davis 
                        Jr. used to have. Who’s the Matzo-Ball?

                        Oh yeah, when I told him we needed a 
                        mascot, he spent all night making the 
                        costume. He was an arts and craft 
                        counselor at Camp Herzl.

                                 MOSES
                        Good work Feldman. Alright, like last 
                        game, let’s move the ball around to the 
                        open shooter. Look for the best shot.

                                 ABE
                        I don’t know Moses. I think Julius should 
                        shoot as much as possible.

                                 MOSES
                                (surprised)
                        What?

                                 JAY
                        I agree. Julius is our best player. We 
                        can win if we get him the ball.

                                 MOSES
                        I don’t understand. 

                                 ABE
                        Don’t you want to win?

                                 MOSES
                        Yeah.
                                 ABE
                        Well, so do we. The Dreidels are a 
                        different beast. You know that. For us to 
                        win, Julius has to take over.

           Segal and Feldman nod in agreement.

                                 JULIUS
                        No! I can’t do this on my own. Moses is 
                        right. If there’s one thing I’ve learned 
                        since I’ve known you guys, it’s that we 
                        need to stick together...as a team. We 
                        play team ball, or we don’t play at all.

           The Matzo-Ballers look at each other.

                                 ABE
                        My bad. You’re right.

                                 FELDMAN
                        ”We play team ball or we don’t play at 
                        all“. I like that.

                                 JULIUS
                        Look for the open man and pass the rock.

                                 MOSES
                        Let’s do it! Matzo-Ballers on three.

           In the middle of their cheer, Rosenberg screams...

                                 ROSENBERG (V.O.)
                        Bullshit! This is bullshit!

           Just then, Rosenberg starts to throw a temper-tantrum in 
           front of the Doctor.

           He throws his water bottle, headband, and a chair. The 
           chair travels in SLOW-MOTION at the Matzo-Ballers huddle.

                                 MOSES
                        Feldman watch out!

                        No-o-o-o-o-o!

           WAP! The chair hits Feldman knocking him down. SLOW-MO 
           ends. The Doctor walks over.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Sorry about that.

                                 DOCTOR
                        I had to suspend Rosenberg.

                        No, steroids. He was on the juice. We got 
                        the tests an hour ago.

                                 DOCTOR
                        We don’t test for drugs. Only roids. I 
                        deal weed to half the damn league, man. 
                        That would hurt business. I just came

                        In this league you are.

           The Jewish Jordan dribbles left and scores with a left 
           handed scoop shot over Julius. Dreidels lead 6-0.

           Feldman inbounds the ball to Julius.

                                 JULIUS 
                        Gimme the ball. It’s time to take the 
                        Jewish Jordan to shul, dawg.

           Julius takes over. He goes on a scoring barrage. He 
           scores basket after basket. Rosenberg cheers his team on, 
           from the bench.

                                 ROSENBERG
                        Stop him! Somebody stop him!

           For the first time the Jewish Jordan is helpless. Julius  
           steals the ball from him and scores. Then, he blocks the 
           Jewish Jordan and scores. Julius can’t be stopped.

                        Julius Richardson recently converted to

                        the best students he ever had. And 
                        there’s a steal by Richardson!

           In SLOW-MOTION, Julius steals the ball from the Jewish 
           Jordan. He runs down the court...

           to the ground.

                        He started it.

           The crowd is silent, as Feldman and Segal help Julius 
           walk off the court. Moses has a bloody nose.

                        It does not look good for the Matzo-
                        Ballers as they help their star Julius 
                        Richardson off the court with 1:36 left 
                        in the first half.

           Without Julius, the Dreidels score a few times and the 
           Jewish Jordan makes a three pointer at the halftime 
           buzzer. The Dreidels run into the locker room with the 
           momentum even though they’re losing 22-15.

                        the half as the Dreidels trail 22-15. As

                        How is it?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Not good. I think it’s a sprain, but we 
                        won’t know until he takes an x-ray. He’s 
                        done for tonight, sorry Moses.

                        How’s he doing?

                                 MOSES
                        They think he has a sprained ankle. He 
                        can’t play. You know, for a second out 
                        there, I thought we had a chance to win.

                                 SARAH
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MOSES
                        We’ve never beat the Dreidels. You see, I 
                        missed this shot in sixth grade and ever 
                        since then the Jewish Jordan’s had my 
                        number. I’ll never beat him. Looks like 
                        you’re dating a winner.

                        There’s nothing going on between us. He 
                        just kissed me to piss you off. 
                                 MOSES
                        Yeah right.

                                 SARAH
                        I’m serious. He’s an asshole. If you 
                        didn’t run away like a little baby, you 
                        would have seen the part where I kneed 
                        him in the balls.

                                 MOSES
                        Oh, really. When you were down there did 
                        it remind you of old times?

                                 SARAH
                        Moses! I’ve never touched any part of 
                        Isaac’s body other than the other night 
                        when he kissed me.

                        Yeah.

                                 MOSES
                        Because he said you--

                                 SARAH
                        Yeah.

                                 MOSES
                        Because he said you did.

                                 SARAH
                        And he also said you were a quitter. But 
                        I didn’t believe that until now.

           He just looks at her.

                        No way. I’m not a fan of international

                        there’s five us still standing. Let’s box 
                        out and rebound! You’re the best friends 
                        I could ever ask for.  Matzo-Ballers on

                                 MATZO-BALLERS
                        One, two, three, Matzo-Ballers!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BASKETBALL COURT - MOMENTS LATER 

           RUN-DMC’s ”Peter Piper“ begins the second half basketball 
           MONTAGE of highlights. 
           The Matzo-Ballers match the Dreidels basket for basket.

           Segal pulls up from 30-feet...

                                 SEGAL
                        Good.

           He scores. 

                                 ABE
                        Holy shit. He made one.

                                 MOSES
                        Nice shot, Oven Mits!

           Abe dives after lose balls. Feldman rebounds like a 
           maniac. Jay matches the Jewish Jordan shot for shot.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        What’s going on?

                                 STECKMAN
                        I don’t know.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Get me the ball.

           The Jewish Jordan takes over. Scoring at will.

                                 RABBI CHAIM BERMAN (V.O.)
                        A clinic. A basketball clinic. The Jewish 
                        Jordan is a one man wrecking crew.

           But Moses starts to find his scoring touch as well, 
           including one where he splits the defense and lays it in.

                                 RABBI CHAIM BERMAN (V.O.) 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        Go down Moses! The Dreidels defense 
                        parted like the Red Sea for this Matzo-
                        Baller. Somebody woke up Epstein as he 
                        has just exploded for six straight 
                        points. He’s had a rough year 
                        offensively, but he did lead the league 
                        in technical fouls. And when he gets that 
                        ten-foot set shot going, he’s money.

           The Jewish Jordan makes a no-look pass to Steckman who 
           scores. Jay comes back down and makes 3-pointer. Then Abe 
           makes a steal and bounce pass to Feldman for a layup.

                                 JAY
                        Nice pass baby!
                                 ABE
                        Chai-five!

           Abe and Jay hi-five.

                                 RABBI CHAIM BERMAN (V.O.)
                        Nothing gets a team more fired up than a 
                        good bounce pass. Even without their 
                        star, the Matzo-Ballers have come out 
                        this half playing fundamental, team 
                        basketball and they have kept it close. 

           Jewish Jordan comes back and scores. But then, Segal hits 
           a three, and Jay blocks a shot that leads to a basket.

                                 RABBI CHAIM BERMAN 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        Just when you thought it was over, the 
                        Matzo-Ballers cut the lead to two. The 
                        Dreidels can’t afford any more mistakes.

           The Dreidels inbound the ball but...

                                 RABBI CHAIM BERMAN 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        Now, there’s a steal by Epstein! 
                        Underneath to Kaplan! He lays it in! What 
                        a play! The Matzo-Ballers have tied it. 
                        Oh, my, this place is going crazy!

                                 MOSES
                        We have to foul!

                                 ABE
                        Foul!

           The Dreidels inbound the ball this time, but Steckman is 
           immediately fouled.

                                 MOSES
                        Good job.

           Jewish Jordan can’t believe it. He looks at the 
           scoreboard. It’s tied 53-53 with 9 seconds left.

                                 RABBI CHAIM BERMAN (V.O.)
                        The foul may stop the clock, but the 
                        Matzo-Ballers fouled the one guy you 
                        don’t want to foul, Dennis Steckman. 

           Steckman steps to the free throw line.

                        He’s a coach’s son. And as we all know, a 
                        coach’s son makes his free throws. Dennis 
                        played two years for his dad, Skip, at 
                        Lake Forest Elementary.

                        Knock’em down.

           Swish! He makes the first one. Dreidels lead 54-53.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Good shot.

                                 SEGAL
                        Damn.

                                 RABBI CHAIM BERMAN
                        First one is good. One more on the way.

           Cohen misses the free throw. Jay grabs the rebound.

                                 JAY  
                        Timeout!

                                 STECKMAN
                        Dammit!

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Shit.

                                 RABBI CHAIM BERMAN
                        Well, it’s all come down to this. Down 
                        one point with seven seconds left, the 
                        Matzo-Ballers have one shot to dethrone 
                        the most dominating team in JCC history.

                                                                 CUT TO:

                        Stay man-to-man and crash the boards 
                        after the shot. Make sure you know who 
                        you’re guarding.
                                 STECKMAN
                        I got Moses.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Don’t worry about him. He can’t handle 
                        the pressure.

           MATZO-BALLERS BENCH - CONTINUOUS

           The Matzo-Ballers huddle breaks, players take the court.

                                 ABE
                        Are you sure you want this?

           Moses nods with purpose.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BASKETBALL COURT - SECONDS LATER

           The players take the court. The gym is buzzing.

                                 RABBI CHAIM BERMAN (V.O.)
                        Here we go...

           Rabbi Chaim Berman’s voice gets drowned out, as the only 
           sounds come from the BALL bouncing and the player’s 
           SNEAKERS...as the final play happens in SLOW MOTION...

           Segal passes to Moses at the top of the key. The clock 
           ticks down 7, 6, 5...Moses dribbles to his left and beats 
           Steckman...he has a clear path to the hoop. The Jewish 
           Jordan leaves his man to guard Moses.

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Get him!

           Moses rises from the spot he missed from in 6th grade...

                                 SARAH
                        C’mon Moses...

           The Jewish Jordan jumps to block it, but misses. The ball 
           sails toward the hoop...hits off the backboard, THUD! 
           Bounces on the rim, CLANG! And goes in, SWISH!

           BUZZER SOUNDS! Matzo-Ballers win 55-54! 
                                 RABBI CHAIM BERMAN(V.O.)
                        Matzo-Ballers win! Oh my God, the Matzo-
                        Ballers win! Moses Epstein has shocked 
                        Highland Park, Peoria, Winnetka, the 
                        northern part of downtown and Boca Raton.

           The Matzo-Ballers tackle Moses in excitement.

           It’s pandemonium at the JCC as the crowd rushes on the 
           floor to congratulate the Matzo-Ballers.

           Debbie jumps into Feldman’s arms and they make out.

           The Rubinger Twins start making out with Segal.

           Jay’s wife Betsy kisses him, then starts yelling at him.

                                 MR. KAPLAN
                        Nice game, son. You played with a lot of 
                        heart out there. I’m very proud of you.

                                 ABE
                        Thanks dad.

           They hug. It’s a nice father, son moment. 

           The Doctor, Fred, Dick Cooperman, Juan Esteban and 
           Concepcion stand in circle and light up a fat joint.

           Lou Rutman and the other JCC players heckle the Dreidels 
           as they walk off the court.

                                 RUTMAN
                        Eat shit Dreidels!

                                 ARNIE RIFKIN
                        You suck!

           Segal and Feldman congratulate Julius, when all of a 
           sudden a hot girl runs over and kisses Julius.

                                 SEGAL
                        Who’s that?

                                 JULIUS
                        This is my girlfriend.

                                 FELDMAN
                        That’s Rachel Birnbaum?

                                 SEGAL
                        I guess she out grew the leg braces.
           RACHEL BIRNBAUM is the Jewish version of Carmen Electra. 
           Segal and Feldman can’t believe it.

           Meanwhile the Matzo-Ball mascot continues to beat up the 
           Dreidel mascot with help from Charlie Goldstein.

           Moses also gets mobbed.

                                 RABBI SINGER
                        What a game! Congratulations!

                        Thanks Moses! You made me a lot of money!

           As Moses gets congratulated, he looks for Sarah.

                        Great game son. I knew you could do it.

                        I’m so proud of you, honey. Are you 
                        hungry? You look hungry?

           Matzo-Ballers cut down the net like in the Final Four.

                        Moses, Saul Fishman. You were the tops 
                        babe. I knew it was going in when you 
                        released it.

           Moses continues to look for Sarah.

                        Goldfarb and I have started a bobblehead 
                        company and we want to make a limited 
                        edition one of you. What do you say?

                                 BARRY EPSTEIN
                        Hey Saul, tell that son of a bitch 
                        Goldfarb to go blow himself. He 
                        overcharged me for bifocals.

           Moses keeps looking through the masses when...
                                 JEWISH JORDAN (O.C.)
                        Hey, Moses.

           The Jewish Jordan, Rosenberg and Steckman walk over.

                                 MOSES
                        Yeah.

                        Good game. We should’ve won. But you guys 
                        played pretty well.

                                 MOSES

                        injured our boy.

           Bernard and Bootsy step in between them.

                                 BERNARD
                        Do you know what happens to people in our

                                 JEWISH JORDAN
                        Um...

           Bootsy grabs the Jewish Jordan by the shirt. Rosenberg 
           and Steckman run away!

           The Doctor and Fred hand the Matzo-Ballers the trophy.

                        What draft?

                        When does that league start? 
           In a moment of pure clarity, all by himself, Moses looks 
           up towards God, and gives a Sammy Sosa-like two pumps to 
           his chest...making peace.

                                 SARAH (O.S.)
                        Nice shot, Epstein.

           Moses turns around and sees that Sarah was watching him.

                        Thanks. For the record, I called ”bank“.

                                 SARAH
                        Shut up and kiss me.

           They kiss as the celebration continues around them.

           INT. KAPLAN’S DELI - DAY

           Mr. Kaplan takes down Isaac Rubinowitz’s photo from the 
           Wall of Fame and puts up another in its place.

           Lou Rutman stands next to WANG, a 7-foot Asian-American. 

                                 RUTMAN
                        That’s the competition, Wang.

           Lou Rutman points to the new photo. Wang nods. He’s 
           wearing a Jewish star necklace. 

           ZOOM IN to a CLOSE-UP of the new photo reveals it’s the 
           Matzo-Ballers team photo with JCC trophy in hand.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.
