                                                               FADE IN:

           Over OPENING CREDITS, a montage of WRESTLING-MAGAZINE PHOTOS. 
           Action shots of RANDY “THE RAM” ROBINSON from his ‘80s WWF 
           heyday. Bodyslamming opponents. Taking a boot to the face. 
           Headbutting a folding chair held by a fan in the front row. 
           Raising his arms in glorious, exhausted triumph.

           The sounds of a SCREAMING, CHEERING CROWD overwhelm us. Over 
           the images, we hear RINGSIDE ANNOUNCERS booming commentary:

           ——”Oh, my! A devastating piledriver from the Ram!”

           ——”I’ve never seen a guy get fired into a buckle that hard!”

           ——”Ram taking it to Mr. Magnificent outside the ring!”

           ——”He’s getting up! I don’t know how he can keep going!”

           The last five or six photos in the montage are from a match 
           against a keffiyeh-wearing heel named THE AYATOLLAH before 
           70,000 screaming fans in the Hoosier Dome...

           ——”Ohh!! Powerbomb!”

           ——”Ram absorbing tremendous punishment from The Ayatollah!”

           ——”Randy ‘The Ram’ Robinson is giving absolutely everything 
           he’s got... This is the very definition of heart!”

           ——”Just listen to this crowd! The entire Hoosier Dome, 70,000 
           people, are on their feet!”

           ——”Ram climbing to the top rope... The crowd going absolutely 
           wild... They know what’s coming...”

           A PHOTO of Randy standing on the top rope, his bent arms 
           pressed against the sides of his head like RAM’S HORNS.

           ——”Uh-oh... The horns are out... Here it comes...”

           We FREEZE on a final image of Randy FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE 
           CANVAS, horns out, poised to crash down on The Ayatollah.

           ——”Ram Jam!! Lights out!”

           Over this, the sound of the crowd GOING CRAZY.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           Present day. Post-match. Randy, pushing 50 but still sporting 
           the same long dyed-blond mane, sits on a bench in the boys 
           locker room of a high school in Wilmington, Delaware.
           He pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights. Lime-green 
           ram’s horns run up the sides. They’re the same kind of tights 
           as in the ‘80s pics——and may well be the actual same pair.

           Naked except for a jockstrap, Randy takes a breath. Achy, 
           sweaty, saggy, exhausted. A battered warrior. Scars all over 
           his body. Despite the rough shape he’s in, it’s clear he’s 
           just given it his all in the ring. He swigs down a few 
           Vicodins with a beer.

           SCOTT BRUMBERG, the event’s promoter, a heavyset, goateed man 
           in a Mets jersey with BRUMBERG - 44 on the back, approaches. 

                                 BRUMBERG
                        Great show, Ram. You turned it out.
                             (a little sad)
                        As always.

           He hands Randy a modest wad of cash. Randy looks at it.

                                 BRUMBERG (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about that, man... I was sure 
                        the gate would be bigger.

           Randy shrugs with a resigned grunt.

           EXT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, changed into his street clothes, limps out of the 
           school, each step labored and painful. Waiting near the 
           entrance are TWO FANS——both men in their 30s.

                                 FAN #1
                        Hey, Ram. Think you could...?

           Fan #1 holds out a SHARPIE and an old WRESTLING PROGRAM from 
           the ‘80s. On the cover is a shot of Randy wrestling CORPORAL 
           PUNISHMENT, a heel in a drill instructor get-up.

           Randy takes the program, happy to oblige. The fan looks at 
           him admiringly as he signs.

                                 FAN #1 (CONT’D)
                        I was there.

           Randy smiles. He hands back the program. FAN #2 hands him a 
           MINI-POSTER. The faded, mid-’80s poster features Randy, 
           biceps bulging, crushing a head of broccoli between his 
           fists. Across the top, it says “EAT YOUR VEGETABLES, PUNK!”

                                 FAN #2
                             (as Randy signs)
                        My first match ever was you versus 
                        Davey Diamond at the Spectrum. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FAN #2 (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        My dad took me... I was eight.

           The fan gets a little emotional at the memory. Randy hands 
           back the poster. He looks at Randy, a part of his boyhood.

                                 FAN #2 (CONT’D)
                             (nostalgic, vaguely sad)
                        You were awesome.

           A melancholy fills the air. The two fans, muttering thanks, 
           drift off into the Delaware night.

           Randy is left standing alone, still holding Fan #1’s pen.

           EXT. EAST WILMINGTON H.S. - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy limps through the parking lot. He comes to a beat-up 
           old CONVERSION VAN.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is driving. On the van’s dashboard is an old ACTION 
           FIGURE OF HIMSELF from his WWF days. Same purple tights.

           Randy pulls into the PARKING LOT of a DAYS INN. He parks.

           EXT. DAYS INN - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Randy gets out of the van. He goes around to the back and 
           climbs in, shutting the doors behind him.

           INT. BACK OF VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy painfully, laboriously eases himself down onto a 
           scrunched-up mattress on the floor. He lets out an exhausted 
           breath. This is where Randy sleeps.

           The wall is decorated with a MINI-SHRINE Randy has built to 
           himself. Old magazine and newspaper clippings, mini-posters, 
           etc. A few changes of clothes lie in a heap in the corner.

           INT. BACK OF VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, lying on the mattress in his underwear, can’t fall 
           asleep. He hurts too much. He grabs a bottle of Vicodin and 
           pops a few, washing them down with a beer.
           INT. BACK OF VAN - LATER

           Randy is finally asleep.

           INT. VAN - NEXT MORNING

           Randy is peering out the window of the van. 

           RANDY’S POV: A HOUSEKEEPER walks out of a room. She leaves 
           the door open.

           EXT. DAY’S INN - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy slips into the room. He heads for the BATHROOM, where 
           he turns on the shower.

           INT. DAY’S INN - BREAKFAST AREA - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, nice and clean, is helping himself to the motel’s 
           complimentary CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST. He loads up a plate with 
           mini-cereal boxes, stale danishes, coffee, etc.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is driving north on I-95. Off in the distance to the 
           side, the Philadelphia skyline is visible. GUNS ‘N’ ROSES’ 
           “ROCKET QUEEN” blasts on the van’s stereo. 

           The song fades out. He pops “Appetite For Destruction” out of 
           the tape deck and tosses it on the passenger seat. On it is a 
           messy pile of cassettes. Skid Row. Mötley Crüe. AC/DC, Ozzy. 
           He grabs a Cinderella tape and pops it in.

           EXT. PASSAIC VFW HALL - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, driving along Route 21, pulls the van into the parking 
           lot of a VFW hall. He parks. In front is an EVENTS BOARD:

           3/12 — PANCAKE FUNDRAISER BRKFST - NOON

           3/12 — BINGO - 8 PM

           3/13 — NJWF WRESTLING - 3 PM

           Randy checks his watch. It’s just past 1 PM. His eye drifts 
           to something across the street...

           CHEETAH’S, a strip club. A sign in front touts the club’s 
           FREE LUNCH BUFFET 11-4.
           INT. CHEETAH’S - SHORT TIME LATER

           MUSIC: BIRDMAN & LIL WAYNE - “STUNTIN’ LIKE MY DADDY”

           A half-full, not very glamorous strip club. Over at the 
           buffet, Randy grabs a plate and some silverware. He loads up 
           on low-grade buffalo wings, egg rolls, mac-and-cheese, etc. 

           He takes a seat at a table facing the stage. Onstage, a 
           STRIPPER of no more than 22 works the pole, grinding lewdly 
           to “Stuntin’”, a Dirty South/crunk hip-hop song. Randy has a 
           bored, faraway look on his face. He finds the stripper, like 
           the song, crude and soulless. 

           The song ends. The girl slips back on her dress and exits.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Give it up, people, for Tangelique!

           Randy looks up at the plexiglass-enclosed D.J. BOOTH 
           overlooking the stage. In it sits D.J. FREDDIE TEE, a black 
           guy in a tight, ribbed T-shirt and mirrored shades.

                                 D.J. FREDDIE TEE
                        And now, for your viewing 
                        pleasure...

           A new song comes on: MOTLEY CRUE - “GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS”

                                 D.J. FREDDIE TEE (CONT’D)
                        ...please welcome to the Cheetah’s 
                        stage...

           Randy perks up at the song. This is more his speed.

                                 D.J. FREDDIE TEE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        ...the lovely Cassidy!

           CASSIDY (38), a sexy, aging rocker chick with TATTOOS 
           (skulls, Chinese symbols, barbed-wire roses), emerges through 
           a CURTAINED DOORWAY and heads toward the stage.

           Randy immediately takes notice. She’s right up his alley. 

           A MAN nearby heads to the buffet for seconds.

           Randy’s eyes are glued to Cassidy as she works the pole. Her 
           moves are mechanical and perfunctory, but Randy doesn’t seem 
           to notice. This is a real woman.

           As Cassidy dances, she makes brief eye contact with Randy. 
           She gives him a strip-club-meaningless smile. He smiles back. 

           Randy reaches into his pocket and pulls out a few crumpled 
           bills. A five and two ones. He stares at the money, trying to 
           decide. He puts the ones back in his pocket. 
           Randy “irons” the five against his leg with his palm, 
           neatening it up for presentation. Crisply folding it 
           lengthwise, he strides up to the stage and slips it into 
           Cassidy’s garter, subtly making sure she sees it’s a five.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Thanks, hon.

           Randy gives her a magnanimous “You got it” wink and returns 
           to his seat. He takes a big, satisfied bite of his egg roll.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PASSAIC VFW HALL - CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER

           A makeshift locker room/staging area. Half an hour to 
           showtime. Randy and 20 or so other WRESTLERS are gathered 
           before MIKE MIGLIORE (30s), a tracksuit-clad promoter.

                                 MIGLIORE
                        All right, listen up, only saying 
                        it once: Nick Storm, you’re up 
                        first against D-Day. Second, Tommy 
                        Anvil and Funkmaster Garry B. 
                        Slick. Third, Frankie Cirillo and 
                        Rob Dynamo versus J.T. Hammer and 
                        The Ultimate Freak. Fourth, Teddy 
                        Brewski and Lex Lethal. Fifth, Greg 
                        Woodson and The Patriot. After 
                        that, intermission. Six, Samoan 
                        Savages versus the Disco Brothers. 
                        Seven, the Irish Warrior and Vyper. 
                        Eighth, “Sandman” Steve Sambuca 
                        versus Hollywood. Last, for the 
                        strap, Kid Loco versus Randy “The 
                        Ram” Robinson. Got it? Good.

           INT. CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits alone a table toward the back. He takes a roll of 
           athletic tape out of his duffel bag and starts WRAPPING HIS 
           HANDS AND ANKLES. He does it in a slow, methodical manner. It 
           feels almost ritualistic.

           INT. CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is going over things with his opponent, KID LOCO (30). 
           Wiry and muscular, Kid Loco is wearing shiny vinyl pants 
           adorned with the Puerto Rican flag.
                                 RANDY
                        Whatever spot you wanna call there. 
                        Invert atomic drop, double reverse 
                        hiptoss... It’s your lead. As long 
                        as you give me that tap when you’re 
                        ready to post.

           Kid Loco nods, deferential to the legend.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Then it turns. You go to town.

           Randy looks Kid Loco in the eye.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t hold nothing back. Give me 
                        everything you got.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. THE RING - SHORT TIME LATER

           An ANNOUNCER stands in the middle of a rickety ring. Behind 
           him, a banner hangs reading NEW JERSEY WRESTLING FEDERATION.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Aaand now, please welcome to the 
                        ring...

           MUSIC: AC/DC - “IF YOU WANT BLOOD (YOU GOT IT)”

           The song’s hard-charging riff begins. The BLUE-COLLAR CROWD 
           of about 60 rises from their chairs and look toward a CURTAIN 
           in anticipation. 

           A man kneeling in front of the curtain pulls the top off a 
           plastic cooler, releasing DRY ICE into the air.

           BEHIND THE CURTAIN:

           Randy inhales deeply, breathing in a final moment of calm.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        From Hackensack, New Jersey, 
                        weighing in at 232 pounds... The 
                        former WWF superstar and wrestling 
                        legend... The one, the only... 
                             (beat)
                        Randy “The Ram” Robinnnnsonnnnn!

           Randy steps through the curtain into the...
           INT. MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Randy emerges, full of fire and energy and showmanship.

           He does a lap around the outside of the ring. His right hand 
           is raised high in the air, index finger and pinky curled into 
           a set of RAM’S HORNS. People in the crowd do the same.

           Fans rush toward Randy, reaching out for HIGH FIVES. He 
           obliges each and every one.

           Numerous fans hold out METAL FOLDING CHAIRS in front of him. 
           (Just like in the opening wrestling-magazine montage.) He 
           ”rams” each of the chairs with his forehead.

                                 AC/DC
                        If you want blood... You got it!

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. THE RING - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kid Loco lies on top of Randy. Sweat drips from Randy’s every 
           pore. Kid Loco clenches tight around Randy’s arms, holding 
           him to the canvas while they catch their breath.

           The REFEREE drops to the canvas and checks that Randy’s 
           shoulders aren’t to the mat.

           Kid Loco lifts Randy up. They’re both on their knees, chest-
           to-chest. Randy pretends like he’s all groggy and out of it. 
           Kid Loco steps to his feet, lifting Randy with him.

           Kid Loco tightens around Randy’s arms, arches his back, 
           presses out his chest and... WHAM!! He and Randy fly with a 
           LATERAL DROP. Randy’s head hits the canvas hard as he slams 
           down on his back. As Randy writhes on the mat, Kid Loco HEADS 
           FOR THE TURNBUCKLE.

           RANDY’S POV: Kid Loco is untying the turnbuckle’s padded 
           cover.

           Randy, clutching his back, discretely reaches into the 
           waistband of his tights and pulls out a RAZOR BLADE. Hiding 
           the blade between two fingers in his cupped palm, he clutches 
           his woozy head. He runs the blade along his hairline, pre-
           cutting his head. No one sees it happen.

           Kid Loco heads back to Randy. He picks up him by the hair and 
           drags him to the turnbuckle, throwing him HEAD-FIRST into the 
           exposed metal post beneath. BLOOD STREAMS DOWN Randy’s 
           forehead. The crowd is electrified.

           Kid Loco slams Randy’s head into the metal post again. Again. 
           Again. Randy slumps over the corner ropes. 
           Kid Loco cockily struts around the ring.

                                 KID LOCO
                             (pointing at Randy)
                        Look at this loser! How pathetic!

           The taunting stirs something in Randy. A look comes over his 
           face, like he’s Bruce Banner about to turn into the Hulk.

           Kid Loco saunters back over to Randy. He grabs his head for 
           another post smash but HE CAN’T. Randy’s neck and arm muscles 
           are bulging. His neck veins pop like he’s suddenly super-
           charged. A look of terror comes over Kid Loco.

           Randy reaches over his shoulder and grabs Kid Loco by the 
           hair. He pulls him in close.

                                 RANDY
                             (under breath)
                        Let’s go home.

           Randy juts his hips back and bends over, gaining the leverage 
           he needs for a throw. Kid Loco shakes his head, begging “no”. 

           Randy straightens his legs, raises his lower back, and yanks 
           down on Kid Loco’s head. Kid Loco’s feet fly off the canvas 
           as his head gets BURIED INTO THE MAT. He gets stuck UPSIDE 
           DOWN with his feet over the ropes.

           Randy, holding onto the top rope with both hands, thrusts his 
           knee into Kid Loco’s stomach. He does it again. Again. 

           Kid Loco somehow manages to untangle himself from the ropes. 
           He scurries away, running for his life. But the relentless 
           Randy hunts him down.

           Randy hits Kid Loco with everything he’s got. Dropkicks. 
           Elbows. Bodyslams. He pours it on, unstoppable.

           Randy drags Kid Loco into the middle of the ring. He looks 
           out on the crowd.

           RANDY’S POV: A trio of fans are chanting.

                                 TRIO
                        Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...

           Randy cups his hand to his ear. The chant quickly spreads.

                                 WHOLE CROWD (O.S.)
                        RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...

           Randy “mulls” things over. He looks at his laid-out foe. He 
           looks toward a corner, pondering a Ram Jam.
           Randy, heading for the corner, climbs to the top rope. He 
           looks around at the crowd like he’s still a little undecided.

           RANDY’S POV: The fans are wild with anticipation.

           Randy bends his arms, pressing them against the side of his 
           head like ram’s horns. Just like in the photo in the opening 
           montage.

           He LEAPS. 

           The leap is not especially high or graceful. He crashes down 
           onto Kid Loco horns-first. Kid Loco’s whole body convulses.

           The fans lose it. That’s what they wanted. The Ram Jam. The 
           money shot.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

           Randy, on a post-match high, sits in a chair as a GUY seals 
           up his forehead razorblade gash with KRAZY GLUE. 

           A FELLOW WRESTLER walks past.

                                 WRESTLER
                        Ram, man, you popped that crowd.

                                 RANDY
                        You weren’t so bad yourself, T. 

           The wrestler, smiling appreciatively, keeps on walking.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                             (shouting after him)
                        You doin’ Parsippany next weekend?

           Randy clearly is.

           INT. HALLWAY - SHORT TIME LATER

           Duffel bag in hand, Randy limps down the hallway to the exit.

                                 MIGLIORE (O.S.)
                        Yo, Ram.

           Randy turns and sees Migliore, the event’s promoter.

                                 MIGLIORE (CONT’D)
                        Got a sec?

           Randy’s all ears. Migliore looks at him with an excited grin.
                                 MIGLIORE (CONT’D)
                        Do you realize what’s coming up?
                             (beat)
                        May 6th...

           Randy racks his brains. No idea.

                                 MIGLIORE (CONT’D)
                        20th anniversary of you and 
                        Ayatollah at the Hoosier Dome.

                                 RANDY
                             (amazed, not realizing)
                        Holy shit...

                                 MIGLIORE
                        I know... Time fuckin’ flies.
                             (beat)
                        I’m doing a Fanfest thing down in 
                        Florida that weekend, I wanna 
                        headline it with you two. Big 20th 
                        anniversary rematch. Q&A, banquet, 
                        the works...

                                 RANDY
                             (excited by the prospect)
                        Yeah?

                                 MIGLIORE
                        How sick would that be?

                                 RANDY
                        I don’t see Bob getting back in 
                        there.

                                 MIGLIORE
                        He’s in.

                                 RANDY
                        Yeah? You talked to him?

                                 MIGLIORE
                        Called him first. I figured you’d 
                        be down.

                                 RANDY
                             (wry smile)
                        You figured right, my friend.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARADISE OAKS TRAILER PARK - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           A trailer park somewhere in North Jersey. Randy’s van pulls 
           through the entrance gate.
           EXT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy parks in front of his TRAILER. He gets out and heads 
           over. To his surprise, the door is PADLOCKED. He gives the 
           lock a hard shake. He tugs at the door. No dice.

           EXT. RANDY’S TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy is trying to push open a window on the side of the 
           trailer. No dice.

           EXT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy unlocks the van’s back door and climbs in.

           INT. BACK OF VAN - NEXT MORNING

           Randy, in his clothes from the night before, is still asleep. 
           Next to the mattress are SIX CRUMPLED $20s and a cheap, 
           plastic NJWF TITLE BELT.

           He’s stirred awake by the sound of kids YELLING and BANGING 
           on the outside of van. He slowly sits upright, massaging his 
           pain-wracked knees. Every inch of him feels like shit. 

           The banging continues.

                                 KID’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ram!

           Randy looks toward the front of the van. He sees TWO 10-YEAR-
           OLD KIDS, boosted by TWO OTHER KIDS, peering through the 
           windshield at him.

           EXT. PARADISE OAKS TRAILER PARK - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is playfully tussling with five or six kids. He picks 
           one of them up and “bodyslams” him.

                                 RANDY
                             (announcer voice)
                        Oh, my... Look out!

           He picks up another kid and fake-drops him on his head.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Suplex!

           He slams another kid.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Tombstone piledriver!
           The kids are squealing with delight. They love Randy. Randy 
           sees a car drive up and park by the MANAGER’S OFFICE.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Catch you guys later.

           The kids groan in disappointment as Randy heads off.

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy stands helplessly before Len, the trailer park’s stone-
           faced MANAGER.

                                 RANDY
                        Come on, Len.

                                 LEN THE MANAGER
                        You’ll get in when I get my rent.

                                 RANDY
                        You know I’m good for it.

                                 LEN THE MANAGER
                        If you were good for it, there 
                        wouldn’t be a lock on your door.

           Randy can’t argue with this logic.

                                 RANDY
                        I need to get in there. All my 
                        shit’s in there.

                                 LEN THE MANAGER
                        Don’t worry, it’s safe. Nobody’s 
                        gonna break in and steal your 
                        priceless valuables.

           An exasperated sigh from Randy. He’s not winning this one.

                                 RANDY
                        Could I at least park in back?

           Len looks at Randy’s pitiful, helpless expression. A wave of 
           mercy comes over him.

                                 LEN THE MANAGER
                        Gimme twenty bucks.

           INT. OGDEN’S GYM - NOON

           A dank, no-frills bodybuilding gym. Peeling paint. Bad 
           lighting. No treadmills or elliptical machines, just raw 
           iron. Randy is BENCHPRESSING. He grunts loudly as he squeezes 
           out one more rep, his SPOTTER urging him on.
                                 SPOTTER
                        C’mon, push it out. You got this.

           INT. OGDEN’S GYM - LOCKER AREA - SHORT TIME LATER

           Workout over, Randy is in the locker room. He casually hands 
           a FELLOW GYMGOER some cash in exchange for a small PAPER BAG.

           INT. TOILET STALL - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, underwear pulled down, plunges a needle into his ass 
           cheek.

           EXT. SUNSATIONS TANNING SALON - LATER

           A strip-mall tanning salon. Randy enters.

           INT. SUNSATIONS TANNING SALON - CONTINUOUS

           ANGLE ON a tanning pod. INSIDE THE POD, Randy is lying naked, 
           baking under the intense UV lights.

           INT. LAUNDROMAT - LATER

           Randy dumps a big armful of clothes into a laundromat washing 
           machine.

           INT. LAUNDROMAT - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy moves his wet laundry from a washer to a dryer. He 
           pours in some coins and hits start.

           Nearby, a cute little RED-HAIRED GIRL (5) is running around a 
           folding table, amusing herself while her mom does laundry. 
           She giggles with glee as she breathlessly circles the table.

           Randy makes eye contact with her as she passes. He smiles at 
           her. She gives him a sweet, shy smile back. Her smile makes 
           him happy.

           Randy settles in to a chair in front of the dryer. He watches 
           the clothes as they tumble. Among the various jeans and socks 
           and T-shirts is his purple wrestling tights. He gazes at the 
           tights as they randomly, helplessly, symbolically tumble 
           about. A vague sadness comes over him.
           INT. BACK OF VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           ANGLE ON a pile of freshly folded jeans and T-shirts on the 
           van floor.

           Randy lies on the mattress. In his hands is an OLD, WORN-OUT 
           PHOTO (we can’t seen the image). He gazes sadly at it.

           He flips the photo over. On the back are a bunch of scribbled 
           PHONE NUMBERS. They’re all crossed-out but the last one. The 
           numbers get progressively less faded from top to bottom, as 
           if they’ve been written down over the course of years.

           EXT. LAUNDROMAT - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy stands at a phone booth. He dials the not-crossed-out 
           number from the back of the photo. The phone rings.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                             (faintly through phone)
                        Hello?

           Randy is frozen. He can’t bring himself to speak.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Randy hangs up.

           INT. CHEETAH’S - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A melancholy Randy sits at a table near the stage with a 
           whiskey. The place is way more lively and crowded than the 
           previous afternoon. A stripper leaves the stage to applause.

           Up in the D.J. booth, Freddie Tee leans into the mike.

                                 D.J. FREDDIE TEE 
                        And now, for your viewing 
                        pleasure...

           Randy looks toward the curtained doorway in anticipation.

                                 D.J. FREDDIE TEE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        ...please welcome to the Cheetah’s 
                        stage, the lovely...
                             (beat)
                        ...Mercedes!

           Randy winces in disappointment as a hot young ASIAN CHICK 
           emerges through the curtain to some thumping R&B SONG.

           He takes a restless swig of his drink, looking around.
           INT. CHEETAH’S - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is walking the perimeter of the club, sneaking discrete 
           peeks into the various private SIDE ROOMS. He passes the 
           curtained-off CHAMPAGNE ROOM. From inside, he hears:

                                 DUDE #1 (O.S.)
                        We said the other one.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Trust me, babe. You’re gonna be 
                        happy.

           Randy slows to listen.

                                 DUDE #2 (O.S.)
                        We wanted the blonde chick.

                                 DUDE #1 (O.S.)
                        With the belly chain.

           Randy peeks through a break in the curtain. He sees Cassidy, 
           in a white spandex dress, with a pack of six fratboy-ish 
           BACHELOR-PARTY DUDES (20s). The BACHELOR is in a chair.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I’m sorry, but she’s on break.

                                 DUDE #1
                        Well, I’m sorry, but we don’t want 
                        you.

                                 BACHELOR
                        How old are you, anyway?

           The bachelor snickers.

                                 BACHELOR (CONT’D)
                        You’re, like, my mom’s age.

           Stifled laughter from the others.

           RANDY:

           His anger builds as he watches these assholes disrespect 
           Cassidy.

           INT. CHAMPAGNE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Cassidy, trying hard to salvage the gig, seductively 
           straddles the bachelor.
                                 CASSIDY
                        There’s nothing like experience...
                             (leaning into his ear)
                        I’ve done things your little 
                        fiancee’s never dreamed of.

                                 BACHELOR
                        Yeah, like graduate in 1982.

           This cracks his friends up. 

           Randy, furious, BURSTS THROUGH THE CURTAIN. Everyone is taken 
           aback by the appearance of this hulking stranger——including 
           Cassidy.

                                 RANDY
                        Apologize to this lady. 

                                 BACHELOR
                        Who the hell are you?

           Randy stands menacingly over the bachelor.

                                 RANDY
                        You speak to her with respect.

           The bachelor scuttles backwards in his chair, scared. Cassidy 
           wedges herself between Randy and the guy.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I got this. It’s okay.

                                 RANDY
                        No, it is not okay. This is 
                        definitely not okay.

                                 DUDE #4
                        Let’s go someplace else.

           The guys all head for the exit.

                                 DUDE #2 (O.S.)
                        I told you we shoulda hit the city. 

                                 DUDE #3 
                        Fuckin’ Jersey titty bars...

           Just like that, they’re GONE. Randy looks at Cassidy, 
           expecting a hearty thank you for his heroism. He instead gets 
           a pissed-off SHOVE.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Thanks a lot, asshole. 

           Randy is totally taken aback.
                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        That was $300 dollars just walked 
                        out.

                                 RANDY
                        I’m sorry. I was just trying to 
                        help.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Did I ask for help? Did I need 
                        help?

                                 RANDY
                        C’mon...
                             (charming grin)
                        Ain’t it the thought that counts?

                                 CASSIDY
                        No, it’s the $300.

                                 RANDY
                        Look, let me make it up to you. 

                                 CASSIDY
                        You’re gonna give me $300?

                                 RANDY
                        No, I’m gonna buy you a drink.

                                 CASSIDY
                             (laughing)
                        Gee, that’s original.

           Randy winces at his lame effort.

                                 RANDY
                        Lemme try again...

           He looks into her eyes, hand over his heart.

                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                             (deliberately, charmingly 
                              cheesy)
                        Do you have a Band-Aid? ‘Cuz I just 
                        scraped my knee falling for you.

           Cassidy rolls her eyes.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        No? Do you have a map, then? ‘Cuz I 
                        keep getting lost in your eyes.

           Another eye roll.
                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Huh. No map, either... Are you from 
                        Tennessee? ‘Cuz you’re the only ten 
                        I see.

           This one gets a groan.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Are you a light switch? ‘Cuz 
                        looking at you——

                                 CASSIDY
                        Thank you. That’s plenty.

                                 RANDY
                        I can go on.

           A tiny, amused smile crosses her face.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I have no doubt.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. T.J. POOLE’S - LATER

           A local watering hole. Randy and Cassidy sit at the bar 
           drinking beers.

                                 RANDY
                        So how long you been a dancer?

                                 CASSIDY
                        Eighteen years.

           Randy is taken aback. But impressed.

                                 RANDY
                        Wow... long time.

           An ambivalent “It is what it is” shrug from Cassidy. 

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        That’s gotta feel amazing.

                                 CASSIDY
                        What does?

                                 RANDY
                        Being up there on stage, rocking a 
                        crowd with just your body...

           Cassidy chuckles, amused by the interpretation.
                                 CASSIDY
                        That’s one way to look at it.

                                 RANDY
                        You don’t like it? Even a little?

                                 CASSIDY
                        I’m so fuckin’ over it.

                                 RANDY
                        So how come you still do it?

                                 CASSIDY
                        Let’s see: Gas, electric, rent, 
                        food...

                                 RANDY
                        There’s other ways to make money.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Stripper money?

                                 RANDY
                        To hell with money. 

           Cassidy chuckles at his naïve idealism.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        If you could do anything in the 
                        world, what would it be?

           She thinks about the question for a moment and shrugs.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        There must be something.

           She suppresses an embarrassed chuckle.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 CASSIDY
                        Nothing. I’m just laughing.
                             (changing subject)
                        What about you? What do you do?

                                 RANDY
                        Me?

           Randy loves being asked this.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                             (coy smile)
                        I guess you could say I’m in the 
                        sports-entertainment industry.
                                 CASSIDY
                        “Sports entertainment”?

                                 RANDY
                        I’m a professional wrestler.

                                 CASSIDY
                             (surprised, impressed)
                        Like as in Hulk Hogan wrestling?

           Randy nods coolly.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        Really? That’s wild.
                             (beat)
                        Have you ever, like, been on TV?

                                 RANDY
                        Lots of times.

                                 CASSIDY
                        So you’re big.

                                 RANDY
                        If you consider having your own 
                        doll big.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Your own doll?

                                 RANDY
                        Posters, trading cards... They 
                        merch the shit out of ya.

           Cassidy is impressed.

                                 CASSIDY
                        So, like, somebody who’s into 
                        wrestling would know who you are.

                                 RANDY
                             (like he’s understating)
                        That’d be a pretty safe bet.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Wow, cool... Kick-ass.

                                 RANDY
                        Hey, I try.
                             (explaining joke)
                        To kick ass.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I got it. That was good.
                                 RANDY
                        Thanks. I thought so.

           They share a small smile. There may be some chemistry here.

                                 CASSIDY
                             (glancing at her watch)
                        I should get going.

                                 RANDY
                        Aw, c’mon. It’s early.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I really gotta.

           Randy sees she means it. He sighs in disappointment.

           EXT. T.J. POOLE’S - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and Cassidy are in out the parking lot by her car, a 
           black, beat-up old ‘94 Camaro Z28.

                                 CASSIDY
                        That was fun.

                                 RANDY
                        Yeah, me too.

           Randy cringes at his mild conversational screw-up. They look 
           at each other. A tentative moment.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe we could do it again 
                        sometime.

           She nods vaguely, a little hard to read.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Could I get your number?

                                 CASSIDY
                        You know where to find me.

           Randy shrugs okay, not sure if he’s getting the blow-off.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I could see you do your 
                        thing.

                                 RANDY
                        Wrestle?

                                 CASSIDY
                        If anything’s coming up. 
                        Meadowlands, the Garden...
           Randy hems and haws. She thinks he’s still big-time.

                                 RANDY
                        There might be some... I also 
                        sometimes do, like, local places.

                                 CASSIDY
                             (not quite following)
                        Oh, okay...

                                 RANDY
                        I’ll let you know.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Right on... Cool.

           A brief lull in the conversation. Cassidy looks at him.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        By the way. My real name’s Pam. 
                             (beat)
                        Pam Casidio.

           Randy smiles. He shakes her hand.

                                 RANDY
                        Pleased to meet you, Pam Casidio.

           (Note: For remainder of script, Cassidy is PAM.)

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VAN - AFTERNOON

           It’s Friday. Randy is driving west on I-80. On the passenger 
           seat is his duffel bag.

           INT. MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - EVENING

           A makeshift locker room/staging area. Randy and 15 OTHER 
           WRESTLERS are huddled around a LINEUP CARD taped to a wall. 

           Randy scans the list for his name. The final match, at the 
           bottom, is RANDY THE RAM VS. THA GRIMM REEFER. He is puzzled.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        All right, listen up.

           The wrestlers turn and look toward the door. Standing there 
           is FRANK, the event’s promoter.

                                 FRANK
                        This is a family event. No blood, 
                        no cursing, no cheap heat. Got it?
           The wrestlers mutter and nod yes. Frank, nodding “good”, 
           exits the room. Randy follows after him.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Randy catches up to Frank as he heads down the hall.

                                 RANDY
                        Yo, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        What’s up, Ram?

                                 RANDY
                        Who’s this Grim Reefer?

                                 FRANK
                        He’s good... He’s pretty new.

           Randy smells something fishy here.

                                 RANDY
                        How come I never heard of him?

           Frank shrugs vaguely.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you find him?

           A sheepish pause from Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        Through my sister.

                                 RANDY
                        Your sister?

                                 FRANK
                        It’s her son.

           Randy is totally taken aback. Offended even.

                                 RANDY
                        Frank, that’s the money match.

                                 FRANK
                        He’s a quick study. Show him the 
                        ropes, he’ll catch on.

                                 RANDY
                        You’re headlining me with your 
                        nephew? What kinda rank-amateur 
                        shit is that?
                                 FRANK
                             (pulling rank)
                        Would you like to get paid?

           Randy falls deferentially silent.

           INT. MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is suiting up for the match, steaming inside.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. GYMNASIUM - THE RING - LATER

           CLOSE-UP on Randy in the ring, mid-match, wearing a 
           frustrated, pissed-off expression.

           THA GRIMM REEFER (21), a doughy, zit-faced punk in homemade 
           tights covered with skulls and marijuana leaves, is holding 
           Randy by the hair.

           RANDY’S POV: The fans are restless and bored. A few BOOS are 
           heard.

           Tha Grimm Reefer throws an unconvincing punch that clearly 
           doesn’t connect with Randy’s face. Randy does his best to 
           sell the punch, but it’s not easy. Tha Grimm Reefer throws 
           another bad punch. Randy falls to his knees.

                                 THA GRIMM REEFER
                        That’s what I’m talkin’ bout!

                                 FAN (O.S.)
                        You suck!

                                 THA GRIMM REEFER
                             (in direction of shout)
                        No, you suck!

           Tha Grimm Reefer charges toward the ropes. He bounces off, 
           hurtling toward Randy. He attempts a flying dropkick to his 
           face, but his boot winds up awkwardly glancing off Randy’s 
           shoulder. It’s ugly. Randy has no choice but to hit the mat.

           RANDY’S POV: Standing against a back wall is Frank. He looks 
           pained.

           Tha Grim Reefer stands tauntingly over Randy.

                                 THA GRIMM REEFER (CONT’D)
                        Prepare to be...
                             (mimics hit off a joint)
                        ...smoked.
           Tha Grim Reefer heads toward a corner. He climbs up, his legs 
           wobbly as he tries to keep his balance on the ropes. He 
           finally gets to the top. He spreads his arms dramatically, 
           bending slightly at the knees, poised for take off. He 
           thrusts his body upwards and... 

           ...WIPES OUT, his feet slipping off the ropes as he tries to 
           take flight. He crashes to the mat face-first.

           The crowd roars with laughter. A chant instantly begins.

                                 FANS
                        You fucked up!... You fucked up!... 
                        You fucked up!...

           Randy is mortified to be part of this amateurish spectacle. 
           The derisive chant burns in his ears.

           Determined to salvage the match, Randy drags Tha Grimm Reefer 
           to the middle of the ring and lifts him to his feet. He 
           bounces off the ropes and goes airborne with a VERTICAL 
           SPLASH, leaping stomach-first across Tha Grimm Reefer’s chest 
           and slamming him.

           Randy pops right up and follows this with a SUPLEX, lifting 
           Tha Grimm Reefer high up over his head and falling backwards 
           with him, slamming Tha Grimm Reefer’s back into the mat. 

           RANDY’S POV: The sequence wins back the crowd a little. Some 
           cheers.

           Randy pops up again, hellbent on giving the fans their 
           money’s worth. He picks up Tha Grimm Reefer and flips him 
           upside down, his head between his thighs.

                                 THA GRIMM REEFER
                        What are you doing?

           Randy drops him with a PILEDRIVER.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ARMORY - MEN’S ROOM - LATER

           An enraged Randy is yelling at Frank in the bathroom.

                                 RANDY
                        Never again, Frank! 

           Randy punches a stall door. It nearly comes off the hinges.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        That kid was greener than goose 
                        shit!
           Frank just takes it. He knows Randy is right.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        He had no business being in the 
                        ring with me. None.

                                 FRANK
                             (genuinely remorseful)
                        I’m sorry, Ram.

           Frank reaches into his pocket. He peels off some bills. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Hope this maybe helps...

           Frank puts the money in Randy’s palm. Randy looks at it. He 
           DEFIANTLY THROWS IT on the floor.

           Frank shrugs. There’s nothing more he can do. He walks out.

           Randy stands there alone, looking at the bills scattered all 
           over the floor. He bends over and starts picking them up.

           EXT. ARMORY - HALLWAY - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy limps down a hallway toward the armory exit. He hears 
           SOMEONE CLAPPING.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Whooo!

           Randy looks up and is surprised to see Pam by the exit doors. 
           He had no idea she was there.

                                 RANDY
                        What are you doing here?

                                 PAM
                             (walking toward him)
                        Nice job.

                                 RANDY
                        How’d you...?

                                 PAM
                        Pam has her ways.
                             (coming clean)
                        I had my friend check you out on 
                        her computer. This came up.

                                 RANDY
                        I can’t believe you actually saw 
                        that piece of crap.
                                 PAM
                        What are you talking about? It was 
                        great.

                                 RANDY
                        It was shit.

                                 PAM
                        All that running and jumping? That 
                        flip thing?

                                 RANDY
                        Trust me. It was shit.

                                 PAM
                        Whatever... I was impressed.

           Randy looks at her. He’s happy to see her.

                                 RANDY
                        Thanks for coming.

                                 PAM
                             (casual, no big deal)
                        It was a 15-minute drive. Straight 
                        shot on 80.

           A tentative pause. A “Now what?” hangs in the air.

                                 RANDY
                        You hungry?

           EXT. THE SADDLE BROOK INN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy chivalrously holds the door open for Pam at the Saddle 
           Brook Inn, a fancy restaurant in a rustic barn. The sort of 
           place parents take their kids after college graduation. 

                                 PAM
                        Sure this is where you wanna go?

           INT. THE SADDLE BROOK INN - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy and Pam wait by the maître d’ stand. The MAITRE D’ 
           returns, taken aback by the blue-collar duo standing there.

                                 MAITRE D’
                        Good evening.

                                 RANDY
                             (trying to be proper)
                        Um, yes, hello. We would like a 
                        table for two.
           As much as he’d love to, the maître d’ can think of no good 
           reason to refuse them.

           INT. THE SADDLE BROOK INN - LATER

           Just seated, Randy and Pam are looking around, taking in 
           their classy surroundings.

                                 PAM
                        This is all right...

                                 RANDY
                        It’s great. I’m here all the time.

           Pam smiles wryly, not buying it. The WAITER comes over.

                                 WAITER
                        Good evening, my name’s Eric, and 
                        I’ll be your server. Can I start 
                        you off with something to drink?

           Randy gestures for the lady to go first.

                                 PAM
                        Jameson, neat.

           Randy is impressed with the choice. He thinks for a moment.

                                 RANDY
                        I’ll do the same.

           INT. THE SADDLE BROOK INN - LATER

           Randy is in the middle of a great old wrestling story. Pam is 
           cracking up, loving it.

                                 RANDY
                        We got a show in Tucson in two 
                        hours, and the only one sober 
                        enough to drive the bus is the 
                        fuckin’ midget.
                             (beat)
                        Which is fine by us, except he 
                        can’t even reach the pedal.

                                 PAM
                             (amazed, riveted)
                        What’d you do?

                                 RANDY
                        Me, quick thinker that I am, I grab 
                        Billy Bob Banjo’s 2x4 and tie it to 
                        the midget’s leg with The Pharaoh’s 
                        whip.
                                 PAM
                        No.

                                 RANDY
                        Swear to God.

                                 PAM
                        You’re like fuckin’ MacGyver!

                                 RANDY
                        The Leprechaun-vict drives us a 
                        hundred miles through the desert 
                        with a 2x4 strapped to his leg, 
                        gets us to the arena with five 
                        minutes to spare.

           Pam, dabbing a tear of laughter from her eye, applauds.

                                 PAM
                        That is classic.

                                 RANDY
                        Stick around. I got a million.

           She looks at him with a flirty smile.

                                 PAM
                        I might have to.

           Their entrees arrive. They’ve both ordered the pork 
           tenderloin. They both look at their plates nodding, pleased 
           and impressed.

           Randy stares at one of his side dishes, an odd, fancy-looking 
           puff-type thing. He pokes it with his fork.

                                 RANDY
                        What’s this?

           Pam stares at the item, equally puzzled.

                                 PAM
                        I think potato.

           She takes a bite, analyzing as she chews.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Or maybe, like, turnip?

           They both take another bite, determined to solve the mystery.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        I have no friggin’ idea!

           She laughs. Randy does, too. It’s a little bonding moment.
           INT. PITCHER’S PUB - LATER

           A local dive bar, much more their speed. Pam and Randy are 
           sitting at a table. A BARMAID comes over.

                                 BARMAID
                        What can I getcha?

                                 PAM
                        Jameson, neat.

                                 RANDY
                        Jack on the rocks.

           The woman heads off. Randy turns to Pam, pleased.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        You’re a Jameson woman.

                                 PAM
                        When it comes to whiskey, I’m 
                        monogamous.

           Randy nods in approval. This is his kind of woman. 

           A song comes on the jukebox: POISON’S “NOTHIN BUT A GOOD 
           TIME.” Randy smiles.

                                 RANDY
                        Shit, yeah.

           Pam nods along. Randy looks over toward the bar’s DANCEFLOOR. 
           He stands up, extending a hand to Pam.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Care to dance?

           She gets up and takes his hand. He chivalrously leads her out 
           to the dancefloor like it’s the ballroom at the Plaza.

           They start joyously rocking out to the hair-metal classic.

                                 PAM
                        They don’t make ‘em like they used 
                        to.

                                 RANDY
                        Eighties, man. Best shit ever. 
                        Ozzy... Gunners...

                                 PAM
                        Def Lep... The Crüe...

                                 RANDY
                        Then that Cobain pussy had to come 
                        around and ruin it all.
                                 PAM
                        Like there’s something wrong with 
                        having a good time. Mopey asshole.

                                 RANDY
                             (mocking Cobain)
                        “Ooh, look at me! I wear flannel! 
                        I’m all depressed!”

                                 PAM
                        “I’m from Seattle! I like rain!”

           They share a laugh. Randy shakes his head.

                                 RANDY
                        Nineties fuckin’ sucked.

                                 PAM
                        No shit...

           We get the sense they mean more than just the music.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE of Randy and Pam ROCKING OUT on the dancefloor to 
           ‘80s METAL CLASSICS, singing along with the choruses:

                        shy, baby!

           They look at each other, pointing as they sing.

                                 RANDY AND PAM (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, you! Shook me all night long!

           Randy pulls her in tight, leaning into her ear.
                                 RANDY
                             (deliberately cheesy, 
                              running joke)
                        Excuse me, I’m new in town. Could 
                        you give me directions to your 
                        apartment?

           Pam laughs.

           EXT. PAM’S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER

           A run-down, suburb-wannabe neighborhood. Vinyl siding. Ratty 
           American flags. Toys strewn across lawns. Randy and Pam make 
           out as she drunkenly, fumblingly unlocks her door.

           INT. PAM’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and Pam are fucking like animals on her bed.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and Pam lie together in a post-coital daze. She takes 
           in his heavily scarred body, amazed.

                                 PAM
                        Look at all these... I thought 
                        wrestling was fake.

                                 RANDY
                        Can’t fake a chair whackin’ your 
                        face. Can’t fake falling through a 
                        folding table from 20 feet up.

           Pam’s eyes fix on an ARM SCAR. She lightly traces its raised 
           ridge with her fingertip.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        What’s this one?

                                 RANDY
                        1986. Denver Coliseum. Billy Bob 
                        Banjo hit me with his two-by-four. 
                        Loose nail tore the bicep open.

                                 PAM
                        Ow. Fuck.

           She traces a COLLARBONE SCAR.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        And this?
                                 RANDY
                        1988. Orlando Arena. Mr. 
                        Magnificent tossed me out of the 
                        ring. Landed on my shoulder, 
                        clavicle snapped in half.

           Pam winces.

                                 PAM
                        The pain doesn’t bother you? 
                        Doesn’t it hurt?

           A knowing smile crosses Randy’s lips.

                                 RANDY
                        Not while they’re going crazy for 
                        you...

           He goes off someplace blissful in his head.

                                 RANDY
                        Best feeling in the world.

           Pam gazes at his scarred body in soulful silence.

                                 PAM 
                        “He was pierced for our 
                        transgressions, He was crushed for 
                        our iniquities. The punishment that 
                        brought us peace was upon Him, and 
                        by His wounds we were healed.”

                                 RANDY
                             (intrigued)
                        What’s that?

                                 PAM
                        It’s from “Passion of the Christ”.

           Randy nods his head, pondering the quote. He likes it.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        You never seen it?
                             (he shakes his head no)
                        Dude, it’s amazing. So inspiring. 
                        They throw everything at Him. 
                        Whips, arrows, rocks... but He just 
                        never gives up. It’s, like, such a 
                        great lesson for life.

                                 RANDY
                        Huh. I’ll have to check it out...

           Pam brushes her palm over his torso, taking in three decades 
           of battle scars.
                                 PAM
                        The sacrificial Ram...

           Randy chuckles, amused by this. He gets out of bed, naked 
           except for socks.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the bathroom?

                                 PAM
                        By the kitchen.

           He notices, amongst the clothes strewn on the floor, a USED 
           CONDOM. He casually picks it up and exits the room.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Condom in hand, Randy heads toward the bathroom. He opens a 
           door. It’s a broom closet. He’s about to try another one when 
           he hears the FRONT DOOR UNLOCKING.

           The door opens. In walks a boy of about 12 in baggy jeans. 
           The boy is freaked to see a huge, naked man standing there.

           Randy reflexively covers his crotch with his hands. The cum-
           filled condom dangles between his legs like a flaccid latex 
           penis. He and the kid stare at each other, totally frozen.

                                 RANDY
                        Hey...
                             (beat)
                        What’s up?

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy is hurriedly putting on his pants.

                                 ANTHONY (O.S.)
                             (audible through wall)
                        What the hell, mom?

                                 PAM (O.S.)
                        You weren’t supposed to be here!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Pam is in the living room with Anthony.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Yeah, well, I came home.
                             (edgy)
                        I live here.
                                 PAM
                        You said you were sleeping over at 
                        Matt’s. If I had any idea...

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy hurriedly puts on his shoes as the fight continues.

                                 ANTHONY (O.S.)
                        So who is he?

                                 PAM (O.S.)
                        A guy.

           Shoes on, Randy grabs his coat.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Randy heads down the hallway from the bedroom. 

                                 ANTHONY (O.S.)
                        Where’d you meet him... 
                             (disgusted sneer)
                        Work?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Randy slows at the entrance to the living room. 

                                 PAM
                        Monkey, c’mon...

           Pam and Anthony look up at Randy. The PHONE RINGS. Pam, 
           grateful for the interruption, picks up.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Anthony eyes Randy with barely concealed contempt. Randy 
           smiles back weakly.

                                 PAM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Oh, hi, Matt’s mom.

           Anthony, hearing this, shifts his attention from Randy to the 
           phone conversation. 

           ANGLE ON Pam, listening with surprised dismay.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        He did what? Oh, my God...
                             (listening)
                        Is the cat okay?
           Pam glares at her son with extreme displeasure.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        No, he did not mention that.

           Anthony dodges her eye contact. 

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry, Mrs. Langan. He and I 
                        will definitely be having a little 
                        talk about that.

           Randy, wanting no part of this scene, gives Pam an awkward, 
           hurried goodbye wave as he makes a beeline for the exit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PAM’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy climbs into his van. Pam emerges from the house in an 
           open coat with no shoes. She jogs across the lawn, to Randy.

                                 PAM 
                        I’m really sorry.

                                 RANDY
                        Hey, it’s cool, no worries...

                                 PAM
                        I should’ve told you I——

                                 RANDY
                        It’s fine. Go deal with your stuff.

           Pam nods, needing to go. She takes a pen and scrap of paper 
           from her pocket and scribbles down her number for him.

                                 PAM
                        Call me sometime.

           Randy looks at the scrap, nodding vaguely.

                                 RANDY
                        Sure.

           Pam gives him a brief, awkward goodbye kiss.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is driving, digesting what just happened. He shakes it 
           off with a chuckle. That ends that.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. OGDEN’S GYM - DAY

           Randy, dripping sweat, is kneeling over a bench doing 
           dumbbell rows. He grunts loudly as he pulls the heavy free 
           weight to his chest.

           EXT. OGDEN’S GYM - LATER

           Randy exits the gym. En route to the parking lot, he passes a 
           pay phone. He slows. He takes out Pam’s number. 

           Randy looks at the scrap of paper. He crumples it up and 
           flings it in the nearby trash. 

           Randy starts to walk off, but then he stops. He fishes the 
           number out of the trash. Sticking it back in his pocket, he 
           heads off toward his van.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VAN - DAY

           Randy is driving along the Belt Parkway in Brooklyn. He’s 
           flipping radio stations. He comes across WHITESNAKE’S “HERE I 
           GO AGAIN”, just starting. 

                                 WHITESNAKE
                        I don’t know where I'm going/ But I 
                        sure know where I've been/ Hanging 
                        on the promises in the songs of 
                        yesterday/ And I made up my mind/ I 
                        ain't wasting no more time/ But 
                        here I go again...

           Randy nods along soulfully, really connecting with the words.

                                 WHITESNAKE (CONT’D)
                        Though I keep searching for an 
                        answer/ Never seem to find what I’m 
                        looking for/ Oh Lord I pray you 
                        give me strength to carry on...

           Randy passionately sings along as it builds to the chorus.

                                 RANDY AND WHITESNAKE
                        ‘Cause I know what it means/ To 
                        walk along the lonely street of 
                        dreams
                             (chorus)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RANDY AND WHITESNAKE (CONT'D)
                        Here I go again on my own!/ Going 
                        down the only road I've ever known/ 
                        Like a drifter I was born to walk 
                        alone/ And I've made up my mind/ I 
                        ain't wasting no more time/ But 
                        here I go again...

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SHORT TIME LATER

           The van pulls up to a two-family house in working-class OZONE 
           PARK, QUEENS. A very large man steps out. He looks familiar: 
           It’s Lex Lethal (we saw him earlier at the Passaic VFW Hall 
           show). Lex climbs into the van. They exchange a hand clasp.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        Thanks a lot, man.

                                 RANDY
                        No prob. You’re right on the way.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           The van heads down the Southern State Parkway on Long Island.

                                 RANDY
                        So how big’s this place?

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        Nice. Two, two-fifty...
                             (beat)
                        You’ve been there. That’s where 
                        they did the Nicky Whipsaw memorial 
                        benefit.

                                 RANDY
                        That place? Right on.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        Should get a good gate. Bill says 
                        he’s gotten like 20 calls the last 
                        two days alone.

           A knowing, sardonic chuckle from Randy.

                                 RANDY
                        God bless hardcore.

           INT. DOLLAR TREE - SHORT TIME LATER

           A strip-mall 99-CENT STORE. Randy and Lex browse an aisle. 
           Randy is holding a TIN CAKE PAN. He bangs it against his 
           forehead. It makes a LOUD CLANG.
                                 RANDY
                        What do you think?

           Lex takes the pan, testing it against his own head.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        The cookie trays were better.

           Randy, thinking, nods in agreement. Lex puts the pan back.

           INT. ANOTHER AISLE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Lex spots something promising on a shelf.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        Yeah...

           He grabs a pack of STEEL-WOOL PADS. Randy nods in approval. 

           Lex tosses the steel-wool pads into the SHOPPING BASKET Randy 
           is holding. It’s full of all sorts of “supplies”: cookie 
           trays, lightbulbs, thumbtacks, cheese graters, wire hangers, 
           cutlery sets, pizza cutters, etc. They head off.

                                 RANDY
                        Let’s see if they got extension 
                        cords.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NORTH BABYLON COMMUNITY CENTER - GYM - LATER

           MUSIC: AC/DC - “IF YOU WANT BLOOD (YOU GOT IT)

           Randy stands BEHIND A CURTAIN as his song plays. He sneaks a 
           peek at the scene on the other side.

           RANDY’S POV: A ROWDY CROWD of about 150 fills a COMMUNITY-
           CENTER GYM. The vibe of the crowd is rougher, more 
           bloodthirsty than at previous events. Fewer women and 
           children. Almost an underground, “Fight Club”-type feel.

           A banner on the wall reads ECHW - EAST COAST HARDCORE 
           WRESTLING. Pressed against the outside of the ring are a 
           FOLDING TABLE and a 12-FOOT METAL LADDER.

           In the middle of the ring, an ANNOUNCER stands alone with a 
           microphone. 

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Aaaand now... 

           Randy closes the curtain. He shuts his eyes, listening.
                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Please welcome... From Hackensack, 
                        New Jersey... Weighing in at 235 
                        pounds... A true legend and 
                        superstar... Randy “The Ram” 
                        Robinnnnsonnnnn!

           Randy explodes through the curtain.

           THE GYM:

           Randy enters to wild cheers.

                                 AC/DC
                        If you want blood, You got it!/ 
                        If you want blood, You got it!

           He does a lap around the perimeter of the ring, doing his 
           ritual head-butting of chairs.

                                 AC/DC (CONT’D)
                        Blood on the streets, Blood on the 
                        rocks/ Blood in the gutter, Every 
                        last drop/ If you want blood, you 
                        got it!!

           Randy climbs into the ring. He does a few neck rolls and knee 
           bends, loosening up. The song dies down. 

           A NEW SONG rises to take its place... CELTIC FROST - “DOMAIN 
           OF DECAY”. Ugly, plodding hardcore death metal.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        And his opponent...

           The boos begin to rain down.

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        From Kinston, North Carolina, 
                        weighing in at 325 pounds... 
                        Hellbilly Cannibaaaal!

           Through the curtain, HELLBILLY CANNIBAL emerges. A huge, 
           overalls-wearing, mangy, wild-eyed masochist. Crumbs cling to 
           his scraggly beard. He’s dragging a heavy CANVAS SACK.

           A booing TEENAGER in the crowd holds up a sign reading 
           HELLBILLY CANNIBAL SUCKS A FAT DICK.

           Hellbilly Cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a 
           folding chair. He heads to the center of the ring, where 
           Randy awaits. They sit down on chairs, facing each other. 
           Under Hellbilly Cannibal’s chair is his canvas sack. Under 
           Randy’s is his Dollar Tree plastic bag.
           Hellbilly Cannibal punches Randy. Randy punches Hellbilly 
           Cannibal. They take turns punching, each punch escalating a 
           little. It’s like a violent version of the game “slaps”.

           After a stretch of this, Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his 
           sack and pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He SPRAYS it in 
           Randy’s face. Randy falls off his chair. He staggers around 
           the ring clutching his face, howling in agony.

           His foe temporarily blinded, Hellbilly Cannibal smashes Randy 
           over the head with his chair. Randy falls to his knees. 
           Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his sack and pulls out a 
           FLUORESCENT LIGHT TUBE. Wielding it like a bat, he SMACKS 
           RANDY in the side of the face. The tube explodes with a pop.

           Hellbilly Cannibal picks up Randy by the hair and drapes him 
           over the ropes. He grabs a fork from his sack and, leaning 
           against Randy’s back, starts REPEATEDLY STABBING HIM in the 
           same spot on his forehead. He really works the fork in. 
           Twirls it. Grinds it. BLOOD starts to pour from the spot.

           RANDY’S POV: The fans push forward, excited to get a look.

           Hellbilly Cannibal drags Randy back to the center of the 
           ring. He reaches into his sack and pulls out a BOX OF SALT. 
           He pours liberal amounts of the salt onto Randy’s forehead 
           wound, grinding it in with his hand.

           Grabbing a folding chair, Hellbilly Cannibal charges toward 
           Randy. He takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie 
           board. Just as he’s about to crash down on Randy, Randy ROLLS 
           OUT OF THE WAY. Hellbilly Cannibal’s spine gets a violent 
           jolt as the chair hits the mat.

           Randy reaches into his Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a COOKIE 
           TRAY. He smacks Hellbilly Cannibal across the face with it. 
           The tray makes a fantastically loud METALLIC CLANG. He hits 
           him a bunch more times.

           Randy is starting to get winded. His heartbeat speeds up.

           He picks up Hellbilly Cannibal and throws him toward the 
           ropes. Hellbilly Cannibal bounces off the ropes and ducks 
           Randy’s awaiting forearm. He bounces off the opposite ropes 
           and crashes into Randy knee-first.

           Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy by the hair and smashes his 
           face into the corner post. He scoops him up and flips him 
           over the top rope, out of the ring. Randy lands hard on the 
           concrete floor.

           Hellbilly Cannibal hops out of the ring with the folding 
           chair. He whales Randy in the face with it. Randy stumbles 
           backwards toward the metal barricade between the ring and the 
           fans. Hellbilly Cannibal kicks him in the chest. Randy flips 
           over the barricade into the crowd. 
           The crowd, suddenly finding itself in the midst of these two 
           brawling giants, scatters in an exhilarated panic.

           Hellbilly Cannibal throws Randy into a row of empty chairs. 
           Randy goes sprawling. Chairs fly in every direction. 

           Randy’s heart is beating LOUD and FAST.

           Hellbilly Cannibal grabs a metal GARBAGE CAN from the SNACK-
           BAR AREA. He shakes out the contents over Randy, showering 
           him in trash. Hellbilly Cannibal sticks Randy’s head into the 
           can and falls on it, ass-first.

           Hellbilly Cannibal grabs the ladder resting along the base of 
           the ring. He pounds the garbage can with it, making an UNHOLY 
           RACKET. Hellbilly Cannibal jerks Randy out of the can and 
           drags him back to the ring by his hair, carrying the ladder 
           in his other hand.

           Plopping Randy down on the mat, Hellbilly Cannibal sets up 
           the ladder in the middle of the ring. He heads back out and 
           grabs the folding table, setting it up by the ladder. He then 
           reaches into Randy’s Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a BOX OF 
           THUMBTACKS. He scatters the tacks all over the table. 

           Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy and drags him up the ladder. 
           They stand at the top, perched high above the table. Just as 
           Hellbilly Cannibal is about to push off, Randy unexpectedly 
           hits him with a vicious head-butt. Hellbilly Cannibal is 
           stunned. Randy head-butts him again. He PUSHES OFF, reversing 
           their positions in mid-air. Hellbilly Cannibal CRASHES 
           THROUGH THE TABLE with Randy on top of him.

           Hellbilly Cannibal rolls around the mat in a daze, his back 
           bloodied and covered with tacks. He staggers to his feet. 
           Randy promptly levels him with a dropkick.

           Randy’s heartbeat is DEAFENING. All other sounds drop out.

           Randy pulls Hellbilly Cannibal off the mat. As he gears up 
           for another dropkick, his KNEES BUCKLE. A strange, scared 
           look comes over his face. He DROPS TO HIS KNEES, one hand on 
           the mat for support.

           Randy grabs his arm. He massages it. He FLOPS OVER, clutching 
           his chest. He lies on his back gasping for breath, sucking 
           desperately at the air.

           RANDY’S POV: The fans are unaware that anything is wrong. 
           They think it’s part of the act.

           Hellbilly Cannibal sees a look of FEAR in Randy’s eyes. He 
           knows this is real. He looks out at the crowd.

                                 HELLBILLY CANNIBAL
                        Is there a doctor?
           Only a few people look around. Most of the fans still think 
           this is a gag.

           Among those who sense it’s real is JERRY DIFUSCO, the event’s 
           promoter. He climbs into the ring. He kneels over Randy.

                                 DIFUSCO
                        Randy. You okay?

           Randy is just gasping. DiFusco looks at Hellbilly Cannibal.

                                 DIFUSCO (CONT’D)
                        Call 911.

           Lex Lethal and some of the other wrestlers climb into the 
           ring. They huddle around Randy.

                                 DIFUSCO (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get him up.

           With no small effort, they lift Randy. They carry him toward 
           the ropes and pause, unsure how best to get him through.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        Put him down.

           They lower him to the mat. Lethal hops out of the ring and 
           grabs Randy’s ankles. Several of the other guys, following 
           his lead, hop out of the ring, supporting Randy’s underside 
           as they carefully, clumsily pull him out.

           By now, the crowd realizes this is real. The push forward as 
           DiFusco and the wrestlers carry Randy toward the exit.

                                 DIFUSCO
                        Get back, get back, get back.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           They carry Randy down a long hallway, trailed by curious and 
           concerned fans. Lex is closest to Randy’s head.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        You’re okay, buddy. Hang on.

           They reach a door and enter. The wrestler holding Randy’s 
           feet shuts it behind them, keeping the gawkers out.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM/STAGING AREA - CONTINUOUS

           The “locker room”. Randy, eyes rolling back in his head, is 
           carried over to a table, where he’s carefully laid out. Lex 
           Lethal squeezes his hand, trying to keep him conscious.
                                 LEX LETHAL
                        Stay right here, man. Stay with us. 
                        Help’s coming.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM/STAGING AREA - SHORT TIME LATER

           EMS WORKERS, helped by Lex Lethal and some of the other 
           wrestlers, lift Randy onto a GURNEY.

           RANDY’S POV: Randy watches through blurry, half-closed eyes 
           as he’s wheeled out of the room. He can see and feel somebody 
           squeezing his hand.

                                 LEX LETHAL (O.S.)
                        C’mon, buddy, you got this.

           We continue from RANDY’S POV as he is wheeled down a hallway, 
           past the throngs of fans who still haven’t left.

                                 EMS WORKER (O.S.)
                        Clear a path, folks!

           INT. BACK OF AMBULANCE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Lex Lethal rides in the back of the ambulance with Randy.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        You’re gonna be fine. Hang on.

           Randy goes completely unconscious.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - RANDY’S ROOM - NEXT DAY

           Randy lies unconscious in a hospital bed hooked up to all 
           sorts of monitors.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. RANDY’S ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Randy’s eyes slowly open.

           INT. RANDY’S ROOM - LATER

           Randy is watching “All My Children” on the wall-mounted TV.

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI (O.S.)
                        Mr. Ramzinski.
           Randy looks up toward the door, at DR. TARACHANDANI, a forty-
           ish, accentless Indian-American man. The doctor enters.

                                 RANDY 
                        Call me Randy.

           The doctor nods. In his hands is Randy’s folder. He opens it, 
           taking a look. It’s full of test results.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        So how we lookin’?

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        We did a balloon angioplasty to 
                        open the blockage. Then we put in a 
                        defibrillator to prevent any rhythm 
                        disturbance in the future.

                                 RANDY
                        Okay, cool... So I’m okay.

           From the look on the doctor’s face, it’s not that simple.

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        Your heart is very weak.

                                 RANDY
                        Says who?

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        Your echo, your cardiac cath, your 
                        EKG...
                             (beat)
                        The cath shows extensive 
                        atherosclerosis in all the vessels.

                                 RANDY
                        Fine, so how do we fix it?

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        You’re unfortunately not a 
                        candidate for bypass. The damage is 
                        too extensive.

                                 RANDY
                        So what then?

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        You’re gonna need to make some 
                        serious lifestyle changes. Cut some 
                        things out. 

                                 RANDY
                        Like...
                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        Fatty foods, cigarettes, alcohol, 
                        drugs... 
                             (beat)
                        The wrestling...

           Randy shoots him an edgy glare. He doesn’t like this.

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Ramzinski, a man your age——

                                 RANDY
                        Randy.

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        Randy... a man your age with your 
                        heart should not be flying around a 
                        wrestling ring.

                                 RANDY
                        I thought exercise is good.

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI 
                        Regular, moderate aerobic? Yes.

                                 RANDY
                        What are you saying?

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI 
                        That you need to stop wrestling.

           Randy’s nostrils flare in anger.

                                 RANDY
                        With all due respect, Dr...
                             (reading off name tag, 
                              mispronouncing)
                        ...Trachanani, I’d like a second 
                        opinion on that.

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        Of course. But I promise you, any 
                        doctor I showed your file would say 
                        the exact same thing.

                                 RANDY
                        Glad you think so.

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        Mr. Ramzinski, you almost died. The 
                        next time, you won’t be so——

                                 RANDY
                        I want a second opinion.
                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        Your heart is——

                                 RANDY
                        I want a second opinion.
                             (slamming fist)
                        I WANT A SECOND OPINION.

           INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - ADMISSIONS DESK - NEXT MORNING

           Randy is checking out of the hospital.

                                 ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN
                        This is your copy.

           The ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN hands him some paperwork. He folds 
           it up and tucks it in a jacket pocket. 

                                 NURSE
                        Oh, this was left for you.

           She hands him an ENVELOPE. Randy opens it. Inside is a note:

           YOU EARNED IT DUDE... YOUR A WARRIOR!!                      
           REST UP, FEEL BETTER.                                  
           ——JERRY DIFUSCO                                             
           PS... IF YOUR UP BY THE 23RD, I GOT SOMETHING IN YONKERS

           Randy reaches into the envelope and pulls out something else: 
           THREE $100 BILLS.

           He looks at the money, chuckling ironically. It’s his biggest 
           payday in years.

           EXT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy steps out of the hospital into the bright light of day. 
           He squints, his eyes adjusting. When they finally do, he just 
           stands there looking around, a lost animal.

           INT. TAXI - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits in the back of a cab, gazing blankly out the 
           window at the passing strip malls.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits in the van in the otherwise empty parking lot of 
           the North Babylon community center. 

           In his hands is the photo with the phone numbers on the back.
           INT. VAN - LATER

           Randy sits parked on a residential block in a working-class 
           neighborhood. He looks out the window, at a modest one-story 
           house across the street. A light is on in the living room. 
           The silhouette of a woman is visible inside.

           Randy is watching the silhouette. He looks like he’s thinking 
           about ringing the bell. He drives off.

           EXT. PARADISE OAKS TRAILER PARK - NEXT MORNING

           Randy pulls into the entrance of his old trailer park.

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy watches as Len the manager counts his cash.

           EXT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Len removes the padlock from Randy’s door.

                                 LEN THE MANAGER
                        Welcome home.

           INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - KITCHENETTE - SHORT TIME LATER

           A messy, sparsely decorated trailer. Randy sits at the table 
           in the kitchenette. On the table is a Walgreens pharmacy bag. 
           He opens the bag and takes out FOUR PRESCRIPTION PILL 
           BOTTLES. We catch a glimpse of the drug names on them: 
           PLAVIX. COREG. LIPITOR, LISINOPRIL.

           Randy gazes at the patient name on them. They all say 
           RAMZINSKI, ROBIN.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Randy flops down on the bed, exhausted.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Randy is taking a shower. On his chest is a SURGERY BANDAGE. 
           He soaps up, taking special care not to get the bandage wet.
           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, standing shirtless before a mirror, gingerly removes 
           the bandage. Underneath is a new TWO-INCH SCAR where the 
           defibrillator was inserted.

           Watching himself in the mirror, Randy does a JUMPING JACK. He 
           does another. Another. A few more.

           Randy feels himself getting a little winded. He feels woozy. 
           Faint. He sits down.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - LATER

           Randy lies on the bed. He is restless, bored. He gets up and 
           heads over to the TV.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           ANGLE ON an ancient NINTENDO GAME SYSTEM on the floor in 
           front of the TV. The game in the console is WRESTLEMANIA ‘88.

           Randy sits on the floor, eyes glued to the TV as he plays.

           ON TV:

           Cyber-Randy is wrestling The Ayatollah at the Hoosier Dome 
           before 70,000 fans. The graphics are late-’80s crude.

           Randy flies all over the ring, devastating his foe with a 
           series of acrobatic leaps and kicks and flips.

           RANDY:

           Randy wears a look of vague dissatisfaction as he plays the 
           game. What he’d hoped would be a cathartic, vicarious thrill 
           is just making him more aware of his real-life limitations.

           ON TV:

           Cyber-Randy drops The Ayatollah with a knee to the chest. He 
           heads to a corner and climbs to the top rope.

           He raises his arms, sticking his elbows out, pressing his 
           fists to the sides of his head to form a SET OF RAM’S HORNS. 
           (Just like in the opening photo montage.)

           Randy JUMPS. He flies high in the air, soaring over the mat 
           before crashing down on The Ayatollah, horns-first. He pins 
           The Ayatollah as the ref counts to three for the victory. The 
           cyber-crowd goes wild.
           RANDY:

           Randy flings the controller aside.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits leaning against a wall, SOBBING. Angry, bitter, 
           frightened tears roll down his cheeks.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PAM’S HOUSE - DUSK

           Randy stands on the front steps of Pam’s house. She opens the 
           door just slightly. She looks at him coldly.

                                 RANDY
                        Hey...

                                 PAM
                             (terse)
                        Hey.

                                 RANDY
                        I’m sorry I kinda been AWOL.

                                 PAM
                        Yeah, well. Shit happens.

           Pause. She stares at him.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Can I help you with something?

                                 RANDY
                        I wanted to see you again.

                                 PAM
                        Look, we had some fun. Why don’t we 
                        just leave it at that.

                                 RANDY
                        I’d like to hang out again.

                                 PAM
                        Why?

                                 RANDY
                        Why? I dunno... ‘Cause I do.

           Pam looks at Randy as he stares mournfully at a spot on the 
           ground.
                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I had a heart attack.

           He looks up at Pam, vulnerable and scared.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        They say I can’t wrestle no more.

           Pam’s expression softens a little. She opens the door just a 
           bit wider.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Randy sits awkwardly at the table, watching as Pam and 
           Anthony finish the frozen PEPPERONI PIZZA they were eating 
           when he showed up. He’s like an invisible observer.

                                 PAM
                        Did you tell Mr. Wexler?

                                 ANTHONY
                             (groaning)
                        Yess. I was like, “Matt was drawing 
                        in my book! I was just telling him 
                        to stop!” And he was like, “Well, 
                        Anthony, how come these disruptions 
                        always seem to involve you?”

                                 PAM
                        He’s kinda got a point there.

                                 ANTHONY
                        But I wasn’t doing anything!

           Pam notices Randy eyeing the two remaining pizza slices on 
           the serving plate.

                                 PAM
                        You can have one if you want.

                                 RANDY
                        I’m not allowed.
                             (beat)
                        They gave me this sheet.

           Pam nods. Oh. A brief, awkward pause. She returns to her 
           conversation with Anthony.

                                 PAM
                        I’m sure you weren’t. This time.

                                 ANTHONY
                        He totally hates me...
                             (brooding)
                        He’s such a dick.
                                 PAM
                        Look, he’s just looking for excuses 
                        to bust you. So don’t give him any.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I can’t be, like, perfect.

                                 PAM
                             (lovingly teasing)
                        Of course you can. You are.

           She gives him a playful “my little angel” hair scruff, which 
           he dodges. She chuckles. He scowls.

           Randy watches the intimate parent-child exchange with 
           discomfort——and envy.

           INT. KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

           ANGLE ON the two pizza slices, still on the serving plate. 
           Nobody’s at the table. Just the uncleared plates and glasses.

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                        Well, see ya ‘round, man...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Randy, flanked by Pam, is standing over Anthony, who sits on 
           the floor in front of the TV playing “Scarface” on his 
           PlayStation 2. Anthony, engrossed in the game, ignores Randy.

                                 RANDY
                             (fishing for a goodbye)
                        Take it easy...

           Still no response.

                                 CYBER-TONY MONTANA
                             (from screen)
                        Say goodnight to the bad guy!

           This is followed by loud MACHINE-GUN FIRE. Randy sighs.

           EXT. PAM’S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Pam walks Randy out to his van. He looks at her, tentative.

                                 RANDY
                        So...?

                                 PAM
                        So what?
           Randy makes a “you and me” gesture.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        We’ll see...

           Randy nods in acceptance. He leans in to kiss her goodbye, 
           not sure what he’s going to get. He gets a cheek.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - MIDNIGHT

           Randy lies awake in bed, unable to sleep.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TEMPLE BETH EL - LOBBY - DAY

           Randy walks through the lobby of a suburban synagogue with 
           Scott Brumberg, the promoter from the Wilmington show. He’s 
           wearing the same Mets jersey as the last time we saw him.

                                 BRUMBERG
                        So you’re all right?

                                 RANDY
                        Yeah, nah, I’m fine.

           Brumberg, nodding, leads him toward a set of double doors.

                                 BRUMBERG
                        Right this way.

           He opens the door for Randy. They enter...

           INT. TEMPLE BETH EL - SOCIAL HALL - CONTINUOUS

           A sports-card/comics show. GEEKY COLLECTOR DUDES browse a few 
           dozen VENDOR TABLES of baseball jerseys, “Spawn” figurines, 
           etc. Randy follows Brumberg as he cuts across the floor.

                                 BRUMBERG
                        So you’re still good for Utica?

                                 RANDY
                        Why wouldn’t I be?

                                 BRUMBERG
                        I don’t know, I heard it was kinda 
                        scary. A few people said they heard 
                        you might even have to——

                                 RANDY
                        I’m fine.
           Brumberg sees he’s hit a raw nerve here.

                                 BRUMBERG
                             (backing off)
                        Okay, okay. Just checking...

           INT. TEMPLE BETH EL - SOCIAL HALL - LATER

           Randy is sitting at an AUTOGRAPH TABLE. Next to him is 
           HIROSHIMA (47), a ragged, overweight Japanese guy in a 
           WHEELCHAIR. He and Randy sit staring off as people walk 
           past——no one is at the table.

                                 ANNOUNCEMENT (O.S.)
                        Your attention please... Just 
                        another reminder, Randy “The Ram” 
                        Robinson and Hiroshima are still 
                        available for autographs at Table 
                        11. Come on by and get a signed 
                        8x10 glossy or have your picture 
                        taken with a wrestling legend for 
                        just five dollars.

           Randy looks around... Not much reaction to the announcement. 
           He looks over his shoulder. Standing behind him is Brumberg, 
           holding a Polaroid camera. Brumberg shrugs sheepishly.

           Randy looks at the stack of 8x10 GLOSSIES in front of him. 
           It’s a high-flying, mid-air Ram Jam photo from the height of 
           his ’80s glory. The contrast between the shot and his current 
           surroundings depresses him.

           Randy looks over at Hiroshima’s 8x10, which seems to date 
           from roughly the same era. His photo, like Randy’s, shows him 
           flying high through the air. Hiroshima was a sculpted, 
           fearsome specimen back then.

           Randy looks over at the current-day Hiroshima, a sad sight in 
           his wheelchair. Attached to his calf is a URINARY LEG BAG. 

           Randy’s head fills with dark thoughts.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARADISE OAKS TRAILER PARK - TRASH AREA - LATER

           Randy is throwing out all of his wrestling stuff. His tights. 
           His boots. The 8x10s. Everything.

           EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy stands at a PAY PHONE, ringing phone cradled to his 
           ear. In his hands is his DAY PLANNER.
           ANGLE ON well-worn book, open to a page heavily marked up 
           with upcoming gigs.

                                 RANDY
                        Yo, Brumberg. Ram.

                        me out for Utica...
                             (momentous pause)
                        I’m retiring.

           EXT. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER

           Another call.

                             (beat)
                        Good. That’s good.

                        Listen...

           Another call.

           Mike Migliore, the promoter of the Passaic show and Fanfest, 
           is on his cellphone in a TEACHER’S LOUNGE. He’s in the button-
           down shirt and khakis of a high-school teacher.

                                 MIGLIORE
                        C’mon, Ram, you just had a little 
                        scare.

           Randy stands his ground.

                                 RANDY
                        It’s been a great ride, but it’s 
                        over. Time to move on...
           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - LATER

                        RANDY “THE RAM” ROBINSON VS. THE AYATOLLAH

           RANDY:

           Randy FLINGS THE FLIER AWAY. It just winds up floating back 
           down onto his chest. He leaves it there, closing his tired 
           eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - KITCHENETTE - MORNING

           Randy sits at the table eating a bowl of “Smart Start” 
           Healthy Heart cereal. In front of him is the paper, open to 
           the WANT ADS. He scans it closely.

           INT. SHOP RITE - CHECKOUT AREA - LATER

           A suburban supermarket. Randy is sitting on a ledge by the 
           gumball machines, filling out a clipboarded JOB APPLICATION.

           INT. SHOP RITE - MANAGER’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy hands his application to a MANAGER. The manager gives 
           it a quick once-over, making sure everything’s filled out.
                                 MANAGER
                        Okay, great... We’ll let you know.

           Randy nods. He feels good about himself.

           INT. SHOPPING MALL - CORRIDOR - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy walks down a mall corridor. He comes to a GAME STOP 
           store. He enters.

           INT. GAME STOP - CONTINUOUS

           He browses the game titles in the PlayStation 2 section.

           INT. PAM’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Anthony, holding a WRAPPED GIFT, looks up warily at Randy. 
           Pam stands behind her son, looking on.

                                 RANDY
                             (more excited than 
                              Anthony)
                        Open it.

           Anthony opens it. It’s a PlayStation 2 game called LEGENDS OF 
           WRESTLING. Anthony doesn’t explode with joy like Randy hoped.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Thanks.

                                 RANDY
                        It’s supposed to be awesome.

           Pam is touched by Randy’s gesture——certainly more than 
           Anthony. She gives her son an enthusiasm-prodding poke.

                                 PAM
                        How cool is that?

                                 RANDY
                             (wink-wink grin)
                        And I hear they got some incredible 
                        wrestlers.

                                 PAM
                        Are you in there?!

                                 RANDY
                             (shrugging, “clueless”)
                        I don’t know...
                             (to Anthony)
                        Only one way to find out...
           All eyes are on Anthony.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and Anthony are sitting on the living-room floor 
           playing the game.

           ON TV:

           Billy Bob Banjo is wrestling against the Ram. Billy Bob Banjo 
           scoops up the Ram and climbs to the top rope with him. He 
           drops him with a high-flying reverse BODYSLAM.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Randy, playing himself, winces at the slam.

                                 RANDY
                        Oof!

           Anthony’s eyes are locked intensely on the screen, determined 
           to inflict damage on his opponent. His demeanor contrasts 
           Randy’s loose, playful “Let’s just have fun” vibe.

           ON TV:

           Billy Bob Banjo kicks the Ram in the head with a flying 
           dropkick.

                                 ANTHONY (O.S.)
                        Boo-ya.

           Billy Bob Banjo falls on the Ram’s face with his elbow. He 
           kicks the Ram repeatedly as he lies helpless on the mat.

                                 ANTHONY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What a pussy.

           ANTHONY:

           Anthony smiles maliciously as Billy Bob Banjo pours it on.

                                 ANTHONY
                        You shouldn’ta picked that guy... 
                        He sucks.
           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Pam, spying on them from the kitchen, looks pained by her 
           son’s behavior.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Randy and Pam, both dressed, lie on the bed together. Randy 
           is staring up at the ceiling.

                                 PAM
                        I’m sorry about that.

                                 RANDY
                        Hey, it happens.

           Pam shakes her head, lost in troubled thoughts about Anthony.

                                 PAM
                        He can be tough with guys.

           Randy nods vaguely, not sure what to say.

                                 RANDY
                        Kids...

                                 PAM
                        He’s had some trust issues. 
                             (beat)
                        Ever since his asshole dad 
                        bolted...

           Randy grows visibly uncomfortable. Looking for a distraction, 
           his eyes wander over to a shelf above the bed.

           ANGLE ON shelf. On it, we see a bunch of books: INTRODUCTION 
           TO DEEP TISSUE MASSAGE; SECRETS OF SHIATSU; FUNDAMENTALS OF 
           THAI MASSAGE; HEALING HANDS; THE SWEDISH WAY.

                                 RANDY
                        Look at all those...

           Pam follows Randy’s eyes up to the shelf.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        You’re really into massage.

           Pam nods. Yup.

                                 PAM
                        I used to do it on the side. Out of 
                        the house.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAM (CONT'D)
                        I’d put flyers up around town, 
                        classifieds in the Record.

                                 RANDY
                        That’s awesome. Why’d you stop?

                                 PAM
                        I usually just got all these gross 
                        guys looking for a hand job.

           Randy shakes his head, disgusted at these pervs.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        To be a masseuse at a legit place, 
                        without the assholes, you gotta 
                        have a degree.

                                 RANDY
                        So get one.

                                 PAM
                        It’s, like, two years, 900 hours of 
                        classes.
                             (defeated “pfft” sound)
                        There’s no way...

                                 RANDY
                        There’s always a way.

           Pam is not buying it. Randy, unbowed, reaches around and rubs 
           a spot under his shoulder blade. He winces exaggeratedly, as 
           if suddenly in pain.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I got this nasty little knot...

           Pam rolls her eyes good-naturedly. She’s seen this move 
           before.

           INT. BEDROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, fully dressed, lies face-down on the bed as Pam, 
           straddling him, gives him a massage. He MOANS with pleasure.

                                 PAM
                        This is a deep-tissue technique.

           Pam skillfully works a spot under his shoulder blade with the 
           heel of her palm.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        It’s great for releasing toxins.

           More BLISSED-OUT MOANS from Randy.
                                 RANDY
                        Anytime you wanna practice, just 
                        let me know.

           Pam smiles. She clearly loves doing this. And is good at it. 

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I won’t even ask for a happy 
                        ending.

           Pam digs her thumb into Randy’s lower back, eliciting LOUDER 
           MOANS, almost orgasmic.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I think I just had one.

           Pam gives Randy a playful, scolding smack on the ass.

                                 PAM
                        Nasty.

           She glances over at the bedside clock radio. It’s 7:25 PM.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        I gotta get to work.

                                 RANDY
                        You are at work.

           Pam unstraddles Randy, abruptly ending the massage.

                                 PAM
                        Up.

                                 RANDY
                        C’mon...

                                 PAM
                        I’m serious.

           She heads for the closet. Sighing, he gets up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHOP RITE - EMPLOYEE ROOM - DAY

           WAYNE (late 30s), the buzz-cut DELI-DEPARTMENT MANAGER, 
           stands before a wall of MINI-LOCKERS, tapping one.

                                 WAYNE
                        This is you. All your personal 
                        effects, this is the place.

           Randy nods.
           INT. EMPLOYEE ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Wayne is standing before the store’s ELECTRONIC TIME CLOCK.

                                 RANDY
                        You get in, first thing you do is 
                        punch in your employee PIN number.

           Randy nods.

           INT. EMPLOYEE ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits on the bench in front of his locker. Above his 
           head, an instrumental Muzak version of BETTE MIDLER’S “WIND 
           BENEATH MY WINGS” pipes in on the store speakers. As he 
           reaches to open the locker, Wayne comes over.

                                 WAYNE
                             (handing him something)
                        Here ya go.

           Randy looks at the item in his hand, surprised and bothered.

           ANGLE ON item, a Shop Rite NAME TAG. The name on it is ROBIN.

                                 RANDY
                        I thought it was gonna say Randy.

                                 WAYNE
                             (shrugging)
                        Guess they got it off your W-4.

           Wayne walks off. Randy looks down unhappily at the tag.

           Time to suit up. Randy reaches into his locker and takes out 
           a DELI COAT. He slips it on, pinning the tag to the lapel. He 
           tucks his hair into a hairnet and pulls a Shop Rite baseball 
           cap over the hairnet. The whole thing feels like a strange, 
           alternate-universe version of his pre-match ritual.

           A new song comes on the store speakers: a gentle, elevator-
           music version of AC/DC’S “YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG”.

           Randy walks toward a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN leading to the deli 
           counter. He steps through. Showtime.

           INT. DELI COUNTER - SHORT TIME LATER

           About HALF A DOZEN CUSTOMERS hover in front of the glass case 
           waiting to be helped. Randy, manning the counter with another 
           deli guy, hands an OLD MAN a container of potato salad.

                                 RANDY
                        Can I help who’s next?
           A WOMAN gestures toward the turkey-breast area of the case.

                                 WOMAN
                        Hi, pound of the honey roast, half-
                        pound of the low-sodium.

                                 RANDY
                        Certainly, sir.

           Randy leans into the case and reaches for the honey roast 
           turkey breast. As he leans, some STRANDS OF HAIR slip out of 
           his hairnet. He tucks it back in and grabs the turkey. He 
           carries it over to the slicer.

           ANGLE ON Wayne, hovering nearby, observing the new hire.

           Randy puts the meat on the slicer. Wayne comes over.

                                 WAYNE
                             (shaking head, tsk-tsking)
                        Randy.

           Randy doesn’t know what he did wrong.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        You can’t touch your hair while 
                        handling the food.

           It takes Randy a moment to realize that he did this.

                                 RANDY
                        Oh. Shoot... Sorry.

                                 WAYNE
                        That’s okay. Go wash up.

           Randy heads over to the sink.

           INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER

           Randy is slicing swiss cheese. Wayne comes over.

                                 WAYNE
                        She said thin, right?

                                 RANDY
                        Yeah.

           Wayne points to the slicer setting. It’s on 4. He turns it to 
           2. Randy shakes his head in self-disappointment.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I knew that.
           The head shake knocks a strand of hair loose. Randy 
           reflexively tucks it back in. Wayne notices. But before the 
           words can even come out of his mouth, Randy holds up his 
           tainted hand and walks over to the nearby sink.

                                 WAYNE
                             (nodding, impressed)
                        Very good.

           Randy turns on the tap. He looks at Wayne, proud of himself.

                                 RANDY
                        I never make the same mistake three 
                        times.

           INT. VAN - THAT EVENING

           Randy, feeling good about himself, is driving south on the 
           Garden State Parkway with Pam.

                                 RANDY
                        It was great. Piece of cake.

           Pam smiles, happy for him.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Ever use a slicer? They’re cool as 
                        hell. “Bzz, bzz, bzz...” It’s like 
                        a copy machine for meat.

           Pam chuckles at the image.

           INT. MARTELL’S TIKI BAR - SHORT TIME LATER

           A boisterous tropical-themed bar-and-grill on the Jersey 
           shore. Patrons groove along as a cover band enthusiastically 
           bangs out “Brown-Eyed Girl”. 

           Over by the window, Randy and Pam sit at a table overlooking 
           the Point Pleasant boardwalk/beach. Randy grabs a bottle of 
           red wine off the table and pours each of them a nice, tall 
           glass.

                                 RANDY
                             (jokily admiring)
                        Red wine... good for the heart.

                                 PAM
                        Such a good patient you are.

                                 RANDY
                        Hey, just following my American 
                        Heart Association orders.
           Pam chuckles. Randy raises his glass. Pam raises hers.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        To new beginnings.

           They clink and drink. Pam looks at him coyly.

                                 PAM
                             (re: toast)
                        Work, right?

           He looks at her with a knowing smile.

                                 RANDY
                        Among other things...

           EXT. POINT PLEASANT BOARDWALK - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and Pam stroll the boardwalk after dinner. It’s a 
           charming little boardwalk, lined with skee-ball games, ice-
           cream parlors, T-shirt shops etc.

           It’s a bit chilly and not too crowded, still a little out of 
           season. Randy chivalrously takes off his coat and wraps it 
           around Pam.

           Randy slows at a “Ring-The-Bell” carnival game. The grand 
           prize is a giant, plush PINK PANTHER. He looks up at the bell 
           at the top. He takes the sledgehammer from the guy manning 
           the game. He raises it high above his head.

           INT. BACK OF VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           ANGLE ON the giant, plush PINK PANTHER, shaking.

                                 PAM (O.S.)
                        Oh, godddd...

           CAMERA PANS OVER to the mattress, where we find the cause of 
           the shaking: Randy and Pam are FUCKING, doggystyle.

                                 PAM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Fuuck.

           Conscious of his heart rate, Randy takes a hand off Pam’s hip 
           and presses it to his neck. He slows his thrusts just a bit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHOP RITE - DELI COUNTER - DAY

           ANGLE ON Take-A-Number sign. It says NOW SERVING: 19.
           Randy, in a loose, jokey mood, looks across the deli case to 
           a WOMAN (50s) waving a 19.

                                 RANDY
                        What can I get you?

                                 WOMAN
                        Quarter pound of lox, please.

                                 RANDY
                        Sure, which kind? We got Master lox 
                        and combination lox.

           The woman looks thrown by the punning.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I’m just messing around.
                             (grabbing lox from case)
                        How would you like that sliced?

           INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER

           ANGLE ON Take-A-Number sign. It says NOW SERVING: 46.

           A YOUNG WOMAN in workout clothes holds up a 46.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        I’m next.

                                 RANDY
                        What can I getcha, Next?

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                             (chuckling politely)
                        Pound of whitefish salad.

           Randy scoops whitefish salad into a plastic container, 
           carefully measuring it with his eye. He puts the container 
           onto the scale. It reads 1.02 LB.

                                 RANDY
                        Bam. I am good.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                             (playful back)
                        Very impressive.

           Randy slaps a price tag on the container.

                                 RANDY
                        Can I get you anything else, Next?
                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Nope, that’s it... 
                             (glancing at his tag)
                        ...Robin.

           The cute little exchange is unexpectedly derailed. He hands 
           her the container, slightly drained of spirit.

                                 RANDY
                        Have a nice day.

           The woman heads off. Randy, determined to bounce back, looks 
           up at the Take-A-Number sign. It says NOW SERVING: 47.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        G-47...

           An OLD LADY steps forward with the number.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Bingo!

           The old lady smiles big. She looks like the Bingo type.

                                 OLD LADY
                        What’s my prize?

                                 RANDY
                        Anything back here, gorgeous.

                                 OLD LADY
                        How about a pound of chopped liver 
                        and a half a pound of egg salad?

                                 RANDY
                        I think that can be arranged.

           Randy reaches into the case and grabs a scooper. As he does, 
           a strand of hair falls in his face. He reflexively swipes it. 
           He puts down the scooper, good-naturedly exasperated.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                             (to old lady)
                        Be right back.

           INT. EMPLOYEE ROOM - LATER

           Shift over, Randy takes off his coat, cap and hairnet. He 
           catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror. He goes over to 
           it. He gathers up his hair and hides it behind his head. 

           Randy gazes at his short-haired self.
           INT. PAM’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Randy sits on a chair in the middle of the living room. His 
           hair is washed, and he’s got a towel wrapped around his neck 
           and chest. Pam stands before him with a scissors. Anthony 
           hovers nearby, observing.

           Randy stares at his long blond locks in a hand mirror. He 
           takes a deep breath.

                                 RANDY
                        Okay. Let’s do it.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           ANGLE ON Pam’s excited face.

                                 PAM
                        You look so fuckin’ hot.

           Randy is taking in his new, SHORT-HAIRED SELF in the mirror. 
           It’s a jarring sight for him. It’s been decades.

                                 RANDY
                        You like it?

                                 PAM
                        It’s awesome.

           Randy looks at himself some more. He’s not quite sold.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        You look like when James Hetfield 
                        cut his hair.

           Randy chuckles, a little sourly.

                                 RANDY
                        That’s when Metallica started to 
                        suck.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANTHONY’S FRIEND’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Randy, with Pam, pulls the van up to the curb of a house. He 
           honks. Anthony appears from inside. He scampers toward the 
           van, climbing in back.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Could we please get McDonald’s?
           INT. MCDONALD’S - SHORT TIME LATER

           Pam, Randy, and Anthony are eating dinner at a booth. Sipping 
           his soda, Anthony makes a face.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Does this taste like diet?

           He passes the soda to Randy for an opinion. Randy, taking a 
           sip, looks unsure.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        They gave me diet.

                                 RANDY
                             (sliding out of booth)
                        I’ll switch it.

           Anthony nods appreciatively. Randy heads off to the counter.

           THE COUNTER:

           Randy gets in line. In front of him is a RED-HAIRED WOMAN 
           (early 20s). She takes her tray and turns around. Their eyes 
           meet. Randy recognizes her. He’s like a deer caught in the 
           headlights.

                                 RANDY
                        Hey...

           The woman calmly, coldly puts down her food and walks 
           straight out of the restaurant.

           THE BOOTH:

           Randy returns to the table.

                                 PAM
                        What was that?

           Randy didn’t know Pam saw.

                                 RANDY
                        Her?
                             (fumbling beat)
                        She’s the girlfriend of this guy, 
                        who got hurt wrestling me. 
                             (beat)
                        She thinks it’s my fault. It 
                        totally wasn’t.

           He sees Pam looking at him with suspicion.
                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        It’s true.

                                 PAM
                        I’m sure.

                                 RANDY
                        Why you saying it like that?

                                 PAM
                        Like what?

                                 RANDY
                        Like you don’t believe me.

                                 PAM
                        I believe you, I believe you...

           They look at each other with uneasy smiles.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, Pam, and Anthony are driving home. Pam stares off 
           distractedly, still thinking about the episode at McDonald’s.

                                 RANDY
                        No way, dude. Burger King.

                                 ANTHONY
                        BK fries taste like ass.

                                 RANDY
                        McDonald’s are like skinny friggin’ 
                        pencils.

                                 ANTHONY
                        It’s called crispy.

                                 RANDY
                        And they got no salt.

           Anthony snorts in vehement disagreement. Randy pulls up to 
           the curb in front of Pam’s house. Anthony opens the door.

                                 ANTHONY
                        BK sucks!

           Anthony dashes off toward the house, getting the last word. 
           Randy turns toward Pam. He smiles.

                                 RANDY
                        We got a good thing going here.
                             (beat)
                        I think we’ve been good for each 
                        other.
                                 PAM
                        So do I.

           Randy looks at her with vulnerability.

                                 RANDY
                        I never really ever tried this. 

                                 PAM
                        What?

                                 RANDY
                        Being involved. With people’s lives 
                        and stuff.

           Pam can feel Randy’s deep sincerity. His earnest struggling.

                                 PAM
                        You never wanted it?

           Randy shrugs vaguely. He looks off, his mood darkening.

                                 RANDY
                        I’ve done some things I regret.
                             (beat)
                        But I feel like I’m finally growing 
                        up. Getting my shit together.

           Pam, not feeling the need to pry details out of him, just 
           smiles.

                                 PAM
                        Good.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PAM’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Pam sits on the bed, watching Randy as he heads toward the 
           night table.

                                 PAM
                        Colder...

           Randy, adjusting his direction, heads toward the closet.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Warmer...

           He heads for the dresser.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Warmer...

           He opens a drawer. It’s full of Pam’s socks.
                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                             (he opens another drawer)
                        You’re burning up.
                             (another drawer)
                        You’re on fire!

           ANGLE ON Randy, looking into the drawer. Taking it in, 
           processing the meaning. He smiles a little, excited.

           ANGLE ON drawer. It’s EMPTY.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - DAY

           Randy stuffs a bunch of clothes into a plastic shopping bag.

           INT. PAM’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Randy carries his box of possessions into the living room. 
           Sticking out of the top is his Nintendo.

                                 RANDY
                        Now we got both.

           Anthony eyes the prehistoric game system with disdain.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, be nice to the old man.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Randy and Anthony sit on the floor playing WRESTLEMANIA ‘88 
           on the Nintendo. Other games scattered on the floor include 
           MIKE TYSON’S SUPER PUNCH-OUT, JUDGE DREDD, and NFL ‘90.

           ON TV:

           Mr. Magnificent climbs up the ropes. He crashes down on Randy 
           with a back-flip moonsault.

                                 ANTHONY (O.S.)
                        BAM!

           ANTHONY:

           He cackles with glee. His happy, edge-free demeanor is miles 
           from when they last played a wrestling videogame.

           ANGLE ON Pam, sitting behind them in the recliner doing a 
           Sudoku puzzle. She looks down at the boys playing nicely on 
           the floor. The picture makes her happy.
           ON TV:

           The ref is counting Randy out.

                                 CYBER-REF 
                        One... Two... Three!

           Ding-ding-ding! The match is over. 

           ANTHONY:

           Anthony stands up, arms raised. He taunts Randy with a cocky 
           little VICTORY DANCE. Randy scowls like he’s all upset.

                                 RANDY
                        Siddown!

           PAM:

           Pam smiles as she watches this.

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                        You got lucky, broski.

                                 ANTHONY (O.S.)
                        Yeah? Care for a rematch?

           ON TV:

           The screen says CHOOSE YOUR WRESTLER. Anthony scrolls through 
           the choices: Mr. Magnificent. Billy Bob Banjo. Romeo 
           Dynamite. The Ayatollah. C.C. Apollo. He comes to Randy.

           ANTHONY:

           He looks at the real Randy, a little nervous to ask.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Could I be you?

           Randy smiles, flattered.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Randy and Pam lie in bed together.

                                 PAM
                             (marveling)
                        You’re really good with him.
           Randy feels good. Proud.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never seen him like that with 
                        a guy.

                                 RANDY
                             (deflecting praise)
                        Ah, he’s a good kid.

                                 PAM
                        But you’re good. You’ve got a way.

           She snuggles in tightly to him.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        I think you missed your calling.

           Randy tenses up just slightly. He forces a chuckle.

           INT. BEDROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and Pam lie asleep spooning.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Randy smacks the alarm clock. It says 8:10 AM. He stretches, 
           gathering up the strength to climb out of bed.

           From the adjacent bathroom, he hears Pam LAUGH.

                                 PAM (O.S.)
                        Oh, my God.

                                 RANDY
                        What?

           Another small chortle from the next room.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        What?

           Pam enters the bedroom, toothbrush dangling from her mouth. 
           She’s hiding something in her closed fist. She looks at 
           Randy, who’s still in bed.

                                 PAM
                        C’mon, time to get up...
                             (amused grin)
                        Robin.
           She opens her fist, revealing one of Randy’s prescription 
           bottles.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Robin Ramzinski?

                                 RANDY
                        Gimme that.

                                 PAM
                        That’s your real name? You never 
                        told me!
                             (announcer-like)
                        “Ladies and gentlemen... Robin “The 
                        Ram” Ramzinski!”

           Randy scowls. He’s getting pissed.

                                 RANDY
                        It’s not funny.

                                 PAM
                        Come on... it is a little.
                             (chanting)
                        “Ro-bin! Ro-bin! Ro-bin!”

                                 RANDY
                             (snapping)
                        Cut the shit. It’s not funny.

           Pam is caught off guard by the flash of anger.

                                 PAM
                             (hands up, backing off)
                        Okay, okay. I’m sorry.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHOP RITE - DELI COUNTER - LATER

           Randy is scooping macaroni salad for an OLD LADY. Randy 
           weighs the container. The scale says 1.12 LB.

                                 OLD LADY
                        A little less.

           Randy scoops out a little and weighs it again. The scale 
           reads .94 LB.

                                 OLD LADY (CONT’D)
                        A little more.

           Randy, trying to contain his aggravation, puts a little more 
           in. The scale reads 1.05. The lady stares at the scale.
                                 OLD LADY (CONT’D)
                        Just a tiny bit less.

           INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER

           Randy stands at the deli counter. It’s slow at the moment, no 
           customers. A GUY (40s) comes over.

                                 RANDY
                        Can I help you?

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Hi, could I get a——

           The guy, looking at Randy, does a surprised DOUBLE-TAKE.

                                 CUSTOMER (CONT’D)
                        Are you...

           Randy glances at the T-shirt peeking out from the guy’s 
           unzipped coat. It’s an old SUMMERSLAM ‘98 tee.

                                 CUSTOMER (CONT’D)
                        Randy The Ram.

           Randy is deeply embarrassed to be spotted here by a fan.

                                 CUSTOMER (CONT’D)
                        What are you——

           He cuts himself off, not wanting to be disrespectful. Randy 
           shrugs sheepishly.

                                 RANDY
                        Ah, just... Y’know...

           Randy has no idea what to say. The fan feels awkward and 
           awful, realizing how he put Randy on the spot.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Nice to... I’m a big fan.

                                 RANDY
                        Thanks, cool...

           A painful pause. Both of them just want this to be over.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Could I get a half pound of 
                        Virginia ham and a half pound of 
                        the Jarlsberg lite?

           Randy, humiliated, reaches into the case and pulls out a ham. 
           He brings it over to the slicing machine and goes to work.
           ANGLE ON ham as Randy slices. There’s only a SMALL CHUNK 
           left. The chunk dwindles, getting smaller and smaller. The 
           meat separating Randy’s fingers from the blade grows thin.

           Randy watches as his thumb gets perilously close to the 
           blade. He stares at the blade, transfixed.

           He almost seems tempted.

                                 DELI COWORKER (O.S.)
                        Yo, Randy.

           The voice snaps Randy out of his trance. He turns and sees a 
           COWORKER holding the deli-department phone.

                                 DELI COWORKER (CONT’D)
                        For you.

           INT. DELI COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy is on the phone.

                                 RANDY
                        Hey, what’s up?

           INT. PAM’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Pam is on the phone, coat on, holding her keys. 

           (Intercut as necessary.)

                                 PAM
                        My fucking car won’t start.

                                 RANDY
                        Oh, shit.

                                 PAM
                        Jade said she can give me a lift to 
                        work but I have no way of getting 
                        home... Could you do me the hugest 
                        favor?

           INT. VAN - NIGHT

           Randy pulls into a spot in the Cheetah’s parking lot. He 
           looks at his watch. It’s 11:55 PM.
           INT. CHEETAH’S - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy enters the club. WARRANT’S “CHERRY PIE” is blasting 
           from the speakers. He looks up and is mildly surprised to see 
           Pam on stage.

           Pam, spotting Randy, flashes him a discrete “One sec... I’m 
           almost done” finger.

           Randy nods sure. He stands for a moment, then decides to take 
           a seat toward the back. He watches Pam dance before a LARGE, 
           CHEERING CROWD. Pam is putting more energy into her routine 
           tonight, really working the room, taking full advantage of 
           the more lucrative night-shift.

           Randy looks around the club, taking in VARIOUS PATRONS ogling 
           Pam...

           ——A man near the stage sucks on a rum and coke through a 
           little red stirrer, his eyes locked on Pam’s breasts.

           ——A man smiles at Pam as he slips a dollar into her garter.

           ——A man unconsciously licks his lips as Pam does a split.

           ——A pair of men watch mesmerized as Pam, twirling around the 
           pole, athletically FLIPS HERSELF UPSIDE DOWN, slowly SLIDING 
           DOWN THE POLE with her legs spread wide.

           Randy takes in the crowd, all these men cheering, getting off 
           on the show Pam is putting on with just her body. 

           His mood visibly darkens.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is driving Pam home. They’re each absorbed in their own 
           bad mood.

                                 PAM
                        I hope it’s not the fucking fuel 
                        injector again.
                             (shaking head)
                        He swore it was fixed.

           Pam looks at Randy, who’s gazing ahead in stormy silence. She 
           can see JEALOUSY all over his face.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 RANDY
                        Nothing.
                                 PAM
                        What?

                                 RANDY
                        Nothing.

                                 PAM
                        Since when do you get jealous?

                                 RANDY
                        I’m not jealous.

                                 PAM
                        Yeah, you are. Look at you.

           Randy slows at a red light. He is silent.

                                 RANDY
                        It’s hard seeing you up there. 

                                 PAM
                        Randy, it’s just a job.

                                 RANDY
                        All those eyes on you...

                                 PAM
                        It doesn’t mean anything.

           He shakes his head mournfully.

                                 RANDY
                        I’d kill to pop a crowd again.

           Pam, confused, needs a moment to process this. She looks at 
           him, surprised and slightly weirded out.

                                 PAM
                        You’re not jealous of them, you’re 
                        jealous of me.

           Pam finds this perversely amusing.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        You’d make a great stripper.
                             (beat)
                        You like wearing spandex, you’re 
                        used to men grabbing your thighs... 
                             (chuckle)
                        All you need’s a size 52 G-string, 
                        and you’re good to go.

           Randy fails to see the humor.

                                 RANDY
                        Don’t make fun of me.
                                 PAM
                        You’re so sensitive. What’s up with 
                        you today?

                                 RANDY
                        What’s up with me is you’re fucking 
                        making fun of me and I don’t 
                        appreciate it.

                                 PAM
                        I’m not making fun. I’m having fun.

           She looks at him.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Jesus. Chill...

           The light turns green. They drive in tense, edgy silence.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PAM’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - 2 AM

           Randy, unable to sleep, sits on the couch watching TV.

           ON TV:

           ESPN “Sportscenter” is on. They’re showing an NBA HIGHLIGHT 
           CLIP of a player going skyward and throwing down a ferocious 
           dunk. The crowd goes wild. The player shouts as he runs back 
           up court on a post-dunk testosterone high.

           RANDY:

           Randy’s eyes drift down to his stomach. He’s getting a gut. 
           He gives his belly fat a little slap. He clutches it. Kneads 
           the flesh between his fingers. 

           ON TV:

           Another clip, this one NHL. A REF is trying to wedge himself 
           between two brawling players as they try to punch each other.

           RANDY:

           Randy is watching the hockey clip. His wheels are turning.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. WESTVIEW PLAZA - NEXT DAY

           A strip mall. Randy parks the van. He gets out and heads 
           toward a store called NINTH INNING COLLECTIBLES.

           INT. NINTH INNING COLLECTIBLES - CONTINUOUS

           A sports-card/comic-book shop. Tacked to the wall by the 
           entrance are FLYERS for various events——card shows, autograph 
           signings, etc. Among them is the bright-orange FANFEST FLYER. 
           Randy pauses to look at it.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Shame...

           Randy looks toward the store’s counter. Sitting behind it is 
           promoter Scott Brumberg, holding a Subway chicken BLT sub.

                                 BRUMBERG
                             (heaving sigh of regret)
                        That woulda been awesome.

           Randy heads over to Brumberg and gives him a big, manly hug.

                                 RANDY
                        Whassup?

                                 BRUMBERG
                        Look at you with the hair, man. I 
                        hardly recognized you. What’d ya, 
                        get a job at a bank?

                                 RANDY
                             (chuckling good-naturedly)
                        Something like that.

           Randy gestures toward the Fanfest flyer.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Who’s main-eventing now?

                                 BRUMBERG
                        I heard Robbie Hart and Rick Fury, 
                        some lame shit like that.

           Brumberg looks at the flyer, chuckling.

                                 BRUMBERG (CONT’D)
                        Miggy’s too cheap to print up new 
                        ones. Probably wants people to 
                        think you’re still coming, Bait-’n’-
                        Switchin’ motherfucker.

           Randy chuckles, a little sadly. Brumberg takes a big bite of 
           his sub. Mayo drips onto the glass.
                                 BRUMBERG (CONT’D)
                        So how’s retirement treating ya?

                                 RANDY
                        Good, good...
                             (beat)
                        Actually, I was thinking...

                                 BRUMBERG
                             (amused smirk)
                        I figured. Here we go, let’s hear 
                        it...

                                 RANDY
                        Not that. I’m done. 
                             (beat)
                        I was just thinking, maybe it’d be 
                        fun to do, like, a reffing gig.

                                 BRUMBERG
                             (amused chuckle)
                        What was that, three weeks?

                                 RANDY
                        I’m not wrestling. This’d be...
                             (searching for the word)
                        ...an appearance.

                                 BRUMBERG
                        I think somebody misses the life.

                                 RANDY
                             (walking off)
                        Fuck off, forget it.

                                 BRUMBERG
                        Alright, alright, alright.

           Brumberg reaches under the desk and pulls out a ripped, beat-
           up old SPIRAL NOTEBOOK with event flyers sticking out. It’s 
           his all-purpose address book/organizer. He opens it.

                                 BRUMBERG (CONT’D)
                        Let’s see...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PAM’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Randy and Pam sit at the kitchen table.

                                 PAM
                             (troubled and concerned)
                        Oh, my God... How’d you hear?
                                 RANDY
                        This promoter I bumped into.

                                 PAM
                             (shaking head, deep 
                              concern)
                        Jesus... I hope he’s okay... 

           Randy nods soberly.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        When’s the surgery?

                                 RANDY
                        Saturday.
                             (beat)
                        I’m actually thinking of maybe 
                        swinging by the hospital. Wish him 
                        good luck. 

                                 PAM
                        Oh, you definitely should.

                                 RANDY
                        Maybe Friday night after work...

                                 PAM
                        Want me to come with you?

                                 RANDY
                        Oh, nah... that’s not necessary.

           INT. PAM’S HOUSE - FRIDAY NIGHT

           Randy stands at the door leaning into the house. He’s holding 
           a MYLAR BALLOON with “GET WELL!” and a teddy bear on it.

                                 RANDY
                        I’m going!

           INT. VAN - LATER

           Randy is driving. In the back seat is the balloon. 

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy parks the van in a lot and gets out. He leaves the 
           balloon behind. 

           RANDY’S POV: He is walking toward a building. A HIGH SCHOOL.
           INT. BRIDGEPORT NORTH HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LATER

           Randy is slipping into a REFEREE UNIFORM. He is approached by 
           BOOKER D (30s), a big black guy in FULL PIMP REGALIA. Though 
           not a pro like Randy, he’s upper-tier indie circuit.

                                 BOOKER D
                        How you doin’, man?

                                 RANDY
                             (hugging him hello)
                        Hey, wassup, long time.

                                 BOOKER D
                        I hear you’re our special celebrity 
                        ref.

                                 RANDY
                        I don’t know about celebrity.

           Booker D chuckles a little. He gets to the point.

                                 BOOKER D
                        So listen... Me and McPride were 
                        going over spots, and we had this 
                        dope idea how to work you in.

                                 RANDY
                        I really ain’t looking to mix it up 
                        tonight.

                                 BOOKER D
                        But this is hype. Check this out——

                                 RANDY
                        That’s okay. You guys do your 
                        thing. 

           Booker D is really caught off guard by his resistance.

                                 BOOKER D
                        We gotta do something. With you in 
                        the zebra stripes, the crowd’s 
                        gonna be expecting a ref bump in 
                        there somewhere.

                                 RANDY
                        I’m just reffing. That’s it.

           Booker D sees Randy really means it.
           INT. BRIDGEPORT NORTH H.S. - GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy stands in the middle of the ring in his ref outfit. 
           Next to him is an ANNOUNCER. On the wall hangs a banner that 
           says CAPW - CONNECTICUT ALL-PRO WRESTLING. 

           RANDY’S POV: Golden pimp cup in hand, Booker D struts toward 
           the ring to CURTIS MAYFIELD’S “SUPERFLY”. On his arm is his 
           “manager”, the bodacious FOXY D. The crowd BOOS lustily.

           Booker D climbs into the ring. He removes his fur-lined cape 
           and fedora and hands them to Foxy D. He’s wearing purple 
           briefs that say BOOKER D across the ass.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        And his opponent...

           The crowd looks toward the curtain as a new song comes on: 
           HOUSE OF PAIN’S “JUMP AROUND”.

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        Weighing in at 210 pounds, from 
                        Hartford, Connecticut... Shawn 
                        McPride!

           ANGLE ON Randy’s face as he watches McPride burst into the 
           gym to loud, appreciative cheers.

                                 CROWD (O.S.)
                        Shawn Mc-Pride! Shawn Mc-Pride!...

           Stocky sparkplug SHAWN MCPRIDE, another upper-tier indie guy, 
           climbs into the ring. He and Booker D circle each other. 
           Booker D punches McPride in the face. We’re underway.

           Booker D goes on the offensive, hitting McPride with a slew 
           of punches. McPride stands there absorbing the blows like 
           they have no effect at all. He throws Booker D a derisive, 
           defiant look that says “That all you got, chump?”

           Booker D winds up and hits McPride as hard as he can. Still 
           no effect. The crowd is eating it up.

           ANGLE ON Randy, standing off to the side, irrelevant to the 
           action.

           Booker D throws McPride into the ropes. He tries to 
           clothesline him on the bounce-back, but McPride ducks his 
           outstretched forearm. McPride bounces off the opposite ropes 
           and hits Booker D with a flying boot to the gut. 

           Randy is itching to get involved.

           McPride falls on top of Booker D for the pin. Randy smacks 
           the mat, counting.
                                 RANDY
                        One!... Two!...

           Booker D kicks out. McPride picks up Booker D He hits him 
           with a chest chop, sending him stumbling backwards into the 
           ropes. McPride hammers him with a forearm. Booker D flips 
           over the rope, crashing headfirst onto the floor outside the 
           ring. McPride hops out of the ring. Randy does, too.

           OUTSIDE THE RING:

           McPride lifts Booker D up and hits him with an ELBOW SMASH to 
           the face. Booker D stumbles backwards toward the bleachers. 
           McPride drags Booker D up to the top row. Fans scramble to 
           clear a path. McPride punches Booker D a few times, then 
           flips him over his shoulder, SLAMMING HIM hard onto his back. 
           Booker D tumbles down the bleachers.

           McPride, taking control of the match, throws Booker D back 
           into the ring. Booker D rolls to a stop in the center of the 
           mat. McPride drops a knee onto Booker D’s head. He falls on 
           top of him for the pin.

                                 RANDY
                        One!... Two!...

           As Randy counts, Booker D discretely pulls a can of MACE out 
           of his boot and SPRAYS MCPRIDE IN THE FACE. McPride howls in 
           agony. Booker D scurries off, escaping the pin.

           McPride, clutching his eyes, staggers to his feet and 
           stumbles toward Randy. He gets right in Randy’s face.

                                 MCPRIDE
                        Did you see that? He MACED me!

                                 RANDY
                        I didn’t see it.

                                 MCPRIDE
                        You didn’t see that?! You must be 
                        blinder than me!

           During this exchange, Randy sees Booker D sneaking up behind 
           McPride with a FOLDING CHAIR. Booker D raises the chair high, 
           taking aim at McBride’s head.

                                 MCPRIDE (CONT’D)
                             (oblivious to what’s 
                              behind him)
                        What kind of ref are you? 
                             (angrily shoving Randy)
                        You stink!
           Randy gives McPride a HARD SHOVE BACK... at the EXACT MOMENT 
           Booker D is bringing the chair down. The shove causes the 
           chair to miss McPride and instead hit Randy FLUSH IN THE 
           FACE. Randy goes flying backwards, tumbling under the ropes 
           and onto the hard floor outside the ring.

           Booker D, taking advantage of the ref-less ring, sprays 
           McPride again with the mace and starts beating him senseless. 

           Randy, who misses the second macing, staggers to his feet and 
           climbs back into the ring——just in time to see Booker D 
           pinning down McPride. Randy drops to his knees for a count.

                                 RANDY
                        One!... Two... THREE!

           Ding-ding-ding. The match is over. 

           Randy raises Booker D’s hand in victory. McPride is wild with 
           outrage over the gross miscarriage of wrestling justice. 

           RANDY’S POV: The pro-McPride crowd is outraged, hurling BOOS 
           and EXPLETIVES and PLASTIC CUPS at the ring.

           Randy grins to himself.

           INT. BOYS’ LOCKER ROOM - SHOWER AREA - POST-MATCH

           Randy, Booker D, and McPride are SHOWERING (along with a few 
           UNDERCARD WRESTLERS) in the open shower area. The three of 
           them talk as they lather up, on a post-match high.

                                 BOOKER D
                        Now that was a screwjob.

                                 MCPRIDE
                        Crowd was pissed.

           McPride gives Randy a “We’re not worthy” bow of respect.

                                 MCPRIDE (CONT’D)
                        The master...

           Booker D shakes his head at Randy, grinning a little.

                                 BOOKER D
                        Just reffing, my ass... I knew 
                        you’d get in there.

           Randy gives him a mischievous “Hey, what can I say?” shrug.

                                 MCPRIDE
                        Y’all feel like grabbing a drink?
           McPride and Booker D both look toward Randy. He’s the one 
           they’re interested in hanging with.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOLIDAY INN BRIDGEPORT - HOTEL BAR - LATER

           A hotel bar, lively and hopping with a Friday-night crowd. 
           Randy sits at the bar, holding court with Booker D and 
           McPride, the two younger guys listening to stories at his 
           knee. They’re all well on their way to drunk.

                                 RANDY
                        You never heard that one?

                         BOOKER D
                                                         MCPRIDE
           Tell it!
                                              Tell me.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        1990. War At The Shore III. I’m in 
                        the locker room, shaving. Suddenly, 
                        behind me, I see one of the stall 
                        doors open. I turn and there’s 
                        Chris Columbo, sitting there on the 
                        can, taking a dump. So he goes to 
                        me, “This is for Petrov”. I’m like, 
                        “What the fuck you talking about?” 
                        So he wipes his ass, then takes the 
                        shit covered toilet paper and rubs 
                        it in his armpit.

           McPride and Booker D squirm with grossed-out delight.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Five minutes later, Columbo’s in 
                        the ring with Petrov in a headlock. 
                        Petrov’s stuck there under CC’s arm 
                        lookin’ like he’s gonna puke!

           McPride and Booker D crack up at the story. Randy smiles 
           nostalgically.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Fuckin’ classic...

           Booker D spots something intriguing by the entrance: TWO 
           WOMEN——late 30s, frosted hair, tight denim miniskirts——have 
           just walked in. Booker D catches them stealing an admiring 
           glance in their direction.

                                 BOOKER D
                        Uh-oh... 
                             (mischievous grin)
                        Ring rats, twelve o’clock.
           Randy and McPride follow his eyes to the girls. They seem to 
           agree with Booker D’s assessment. 

           McPride pulls his cellphone out of his pocket.

                                 MCPRIDE
                        Gonna call the wife, let her know 
                        I’ll be running a little late.

           Booker D gives McPride a proud, “You da man” fist tap. 

           McPride heads off in the direction of the entrance. En route, 
           he passes the two ladies. He gives them a little “What’s up” 
           wink. They smile back. It’s on.

           Randy’s head fills with thoughts of Pam. He really should 
           call her. He really shouldn’t be here, doing what he may be 
           about to do.

           RANDY’S POV: McPride is on his cellphone in the hallway 
           between the bar and the hotel lobby. Next to him is a PAY 
           PHONE, just waiting to be used.

           Randy turns away from the pay phone. He takes a swig of his 
           drink, slapping the empty glass on the bar.

                                 RANDY
                             (to bartender)
                        Hit me baby, one more time.

           INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER

           MUSIC: BLACK CROWES - “HARD TO HANDLE”

           The wrestlers are dancing with the pair of women——MELISSA and 
           ALYSSA——on the bar’s little dancefloor. Melissa is sandwiched 
           between Booker D and McPride, grinding and shaking her ass 
           for them like a 19-year-old Spring Breaker.

           Alyssa is paired off with Randy, rubbing up against him as 
           she dances. She looks at him with a seductive smile.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Guess what?

                                 RANDY
                        What.

                                 ALYSSA
                             (coy smile)
                        I know who you are...

           Alyssa runs her hands up Randy’s torso. She runs her fingers 
           through his hair.
                                 ALYSSA (CONT’D)
                        My brother had your poster on his 
                        door.

           With this, she pulls him in for a KISS. They start MAKING 
           OUT. Sloppy, wet, lots of tongue. She pulls out and looks at 
           him expectantly, wanting a verdict.

                                 RANDY
                        Thank you. I enjoyed that.

           Alyssa looks into Randy’s eyes. She suggestively clacks her 
           tongue ring, running it along her teeth.

                                 ALYSSA
                        I have a room...

           Randy is frozen with indecision. He knows he shouldn’t.

           INT. HOLIDAY INN - ELEVATOR - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and Alyssa are in the elevator. He looks conflicted 
           about what he’s doing. The elevator slows at a floor. Alyssa 
           looks at him with a suggestive smile.

                                 ALYSSA
                        This is where we... get off.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Alyssa and Randy stumble drunkenly down the hall. They come 
           to her door. She takes out her room card.

                                 RANDY
                        Ah, shit.

                                 ALYSSA
                        What?

           He pats his jacket pockets.

                                 RANDY
                        I think I left something at the 
                        bar.

           She pulls him in for a make-out.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Don’t be long.
           INT. HOLIDAY INN - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy steps out of the elevator. He cuts through the lobby 
           and heads straight out the door.

           EXT. HOLIDAY INN - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Randy walks through the parking lot to his van. He opens the 
           rear door and climbs in, shutting the door behind him. A few 
           moments later, the door opens again. A STREAM OF URINE arcs 
           out from inside.

           INT. BACK OF VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy lies out cold on the mattress.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Pam, just waking, rubs the sleep from her eyes. She’s 
           surprised to see Randy’s not there.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Pam is looking around for Randy. He’s not in the house.

           INT. KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Pam fixes coffee, worried and upset about Randy’s absence. 

           Anthony emerges from his room. He heads to the fridge and 
           sleepily pours himself a glass of orange juice.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Where’s Randy?

           INT. BACK OF VAN - ALMOST NOON

           Randy wakes up. He looks around, not immediately sure where 
           he is. Bright midday light fills the van. He winces. Fuck.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is driving home.

           INT. FRONT ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Randy enters the house to find Anthony and Pam on the couch.
                                 RANDY
                             (sheepish)
                        Hey.

           Pam looks up at him, really angry.

           INT. ANTHONY’S ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Anthony lies on his bed, listening to the fight through the 
           wall.

                                 PAM (O.S.)
                        I had no idea what happened to you!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Pam and Randy are standing across the room from each other.

                                 RANDY
                             (defensive, eyes lowered)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 PAM
                        I’m supposed to know you went out 
                        drinking after and crashed on a 
                        friend’s couch?

                                 RANDY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 PAM
                        You don’t call, you don’t have a 
                        cellphone... 

                                 RANDY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 PAM
                        STOP FUCKING SAYING YOU’RE SORRY.

                                 RANDY
                        What do you want me to say?

                                 PAM
                        That you hear me. That you get it.

                                 RANDY
                        I hear you! I get it! 
                             (petulant)
                        Okay?

           Pam just glares at him in pissed-off silence.
           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Pam is asleep. Randy lies awake next to her, filled with self-
           loathing thoughts. He hits himself in the head.

                                 RANDY
                        Stupid asshole.

           As he broods, his eyes drift over to Pam’s shelf of massage 
           books, faintly visible in the darkness. An idea hits him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING

           Randy sits at the table counting a wad of cash. It looks to 
           be about $140. On the table, open to the “M”s, is the YELLOW 
           PAGES.

           INT. VAN - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Randy gets out of his van. He heads toward a big, nondescript 
           building. A sign over the entrance says BERGEN MASSAGE 
           ACADEMY.

           INT. BERGEN MASSAGE ACADEMY - CONTINUOUS

           Randy strides purposefully over to a reception desk. Sitting 
           there is a receptionist.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Hi, can I help you?

                                 RANDY
                        Yeah, hi... I wanna buy somebody 
                        some massage classes.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (a little thrown by his 
                              approach)
                        Okay... Do you have one of these?

           She slides him a Bergen Massage Academy INFORMATIONAL 
           BROCHURE. He picks it up.

           ANGLE ON cover collage of dynamic massage action. 

           He opens the brochure.

           ANGLE ON inside spread, dense with course listings and 
           descriptions. And, most significantly, TUITION INFO.

           Randy’s face goes south as he gazes at the numbers.
                                 RANDY
                        So these are the prices?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (nodding)
                        It’s a four-quarter, thousand-hour 
                        certification program. Tuition’s 
                        $3,650 per quarter, plus about $500 
                        for books, equipment, and lab fees.

                                 RANDY
                             (grasping at straws)
                        Do you have anything, like, a 
                        little smaller?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m sorry, that’s the program.

           Randy looks down at the brochure again.

                                 RANDY
                        Okay, thanks... 
                             (nodding to self)
                        I’ll have to think about it. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mm-hm. Certainly.

           Randy slinks off with the brochure, feeling stupid.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PAM’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - EVENING

           Pam enters the house, tired and cranky from a long day at the 
           club. Her face unexpectedly brightens.

           PAM’S POV: In front of her on the floor is a vase containing 
           a DOZEN ROSES.

           She picks up the vase. There’s a POST-IT NOTE attached...

           IM GONNA TRY AND DO BETTER. ——R

           She is touched.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - ANOTHER EVENING

           Pam, coat on, car keys in hand, is sifting through a bunch of 
           Swanson frozen dinners in the freezer. Randy stands behind 
           her, listening attentively.
                                 PAM
                        There’s the chicken one he likes.
                             (more sifting)
                        Or the ravioli.

           Randy nods. Got it.

           INT. FRONT ENTRYWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Pam and Randy stand by the front door. Anthony is sitting on 
           the living-room floor playing PlayStation.

                                 PAM
                        Make sure he works on that book 
                        report.

           Randy nods. Got it.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Anthony, parked in front of the TV, plays “Scarface”. Randy 
           sits on the couch behind him, looking bored.

                                 RANDY
                        How much more to the end of the 
                        level?

           Anthony is too engrossed in the game to respond.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Can’t you do something two-player?

           No response. Randy, sick of watching, leaves the room.

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Randy lies on the bed. In one hand is the Fanfest flyer. In 
           the other a bottle of RED WINE. He takes a big, edgy swig.

           The room thumps with HEAVY BASS. A 50 CENT SONG is blasting 
           through the wall. Randy scowls in annoyance.

                                 RANDY
                        Lower that!

           Randy waits for a response. None comes.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy enters the living room. Anthony is playing “Scarface”, 
           50 Cent playing loud.
                                 RANDY
                        Would you please turn down that P. 
                        Puff Diddly-Dang Dipshit crap?

                                 ANTHONY
                             (eyes glued to TV)
                        It’s not Diddy. It’s Fiddy.

           Randy waits for something more. Nothing. He heads back toward 
           the bedroom with a grunt.

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy takes a big swig of red wine, polishing off the bottle. 
           He pops a cassette into his boombox on the floor. The tape is 
           GUNS ‘N’ ROSES - USE YOUR ILLUSION II.

           Randy cranks up the volume and hits PLAY...

           GUNS ‘N’ ROSES - “GET IN THE RING”

           The song begins with the sound of a ROARING STADIUM CROWD. A 
           chant begins:

                                 CROWD (ON THE SONG)
                        Guns and Roses!... Guns and 
                        Roses!...

           Randy begins to prowl the floor like a wrestling ring before 
           a match. He waves his arms, exhorting the crowd on the song 
           like their cheers are for him.

                                 RANDY
                             (cupping hand to ear)
                        What’s that?

           Randy works the crowd: He points at a fan in the back row. 
           Flexes theatrically. Bangs his head on pretend chairs.

                                 ANTHONY (O.S.)
                        Lower that shit!

           Randy grabs the top rope and gives it a hard shake. Loosening 
           up with some neck rolls and trunk twists, Randy heads to the 
           center of the ring.

                                 RANDY
                             (imitating announcer)
                        Folks, we are ready to rumble...

           The song, which starts with a slow, bluesy guitar intro from 
           Slash, kicks in to its main part. FAST, RAGING HARD ROCK.

           Randy stares down his invisible opponent. The opponent SUCKER 
           PUNCHES him. Randy drops to the ground.
           Randy lies on the ground getting kicked and punched. He 
           knocks his opponent down with a leg sweep and pops up. 

           Randy hits his opponent with a flurry of backhand chops. 

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never seen such determination!

           Randy immobilizes him in some sort of headlock.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Sleeper claw!

           Randy flips his opponent upside down, his head between his 
           knees, and drops him headfirst onto the bed/mat.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Piledriver!
                             (mimics roaring crowd)
                        Just listen to this place!

           Randy scoops up his opponent again and slams him to the mat 
           on his back with another fancy move.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Powerbomb!

           The song, meanwhile, reaches its screaming CHORUS:

                                 AXL ROSE
                        Get in the ring! Get in the ring! 
                        Get in the ring! Get in the ring!

           Randy joins in, standing tall and pumping his fist.

                                 RANDY AND AXL
                        Get in the ring! Get in the ring! 
                        Get in the ring! Get in the——

           Randy unexpectedly FREEZES. He looks toward the bedroom door. 
           Standing there watching is Anthony.

                                 RANDY
                             (a little embarrassed)
                        Hey.

           He gazes awkwardly at Anthony, who just stares back.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        What’s up?

                                 ANTHONY
                             (cocky sneer)
                        I’ll get in the ring...

           Randy thinks it over.
                                 RANDY
                        Bring it, punk.

           Anthony excitedly enters the room.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Shoes.

           Anthony pulls off his shoes. They start circling each other.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                             (announcer-like)
                        Here we go... The match you’ve all 
                        been waiting for. Randy “The Ram” 
                        Robinson versus Anthony Montana.

           Anthony smiles. He likes the name. He lunges at Randy with a 
           forearm, clubbing him in the head. Randy goes down.

                                 ANTHONY
                             (announcer-like)
                        Oh! What a shot by Montana!

           Anthony picks Randy up, “slamming” him onto the bed.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        Montana with the Scarface Suplex!

           Randy squirms in mock pain. Anthony stands up on the bed 
           looking down at him tauntingly.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                             (thick accent)
                        I’m Anthony Montana! Ju fuck with 
                        me, ju fuckin’ with the best!

           Randy grabs Anthony’s ankle, yanking him off his feet. 

                                 RANDY
                        Look at this!

           Randy scoops him up and bodyslams him onto the bed.

                                 RANDY
                        Huge backbreaker!

           Though not nearly active as Anthony, Randy is definitely 
           getting carried away. He can feel his heartbeat speeding up. 
           He checks his pulse. Pausing a moment to collect himself, let 
           his heart slow a little, he resumes the match.

           Randy tries to crash down on Anthony with an elbow, but 
           Anthony rolls out of the way. Randy smashes into the bed face-
           first. He shudders, howling in faux-pain.
           Anthony straddles Randy’s back. He wraps his arm around his 
           neck in a chokehold.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Uh, oh... the Cocaine Clutch!

           Randy writhes like he’s suffocating.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah? Ju like that, maricón?

           Anthony lets go. Randy collapses to the bed. Anthony grabs 
           him and props him against the bed’s headboard, draping his 
           arms across the top like it’s the top rope.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        What’s Montana doing?

           Anthony heads to the other side of the room.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        Uh-oh...

           Randy’s head lolls to the side like he’s barely conscious.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        Here we go...

           Anthony CHARGES toward the bed. Just as he’s about to take 
           flight, he slips. He SMACKS HIS HEAD into the corner of the 
           dresser. He lies on the floor, clutching his head.

                                 RANDY
                        You okay, guy?

           Randy goes over to him, not too worried.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Lemme see.

           Anthony, squirming and grimacing, moves his hands. There’s a 
           BLOODY gash on his forehead.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Ooh. Good one.

           Randy gives him a proud pat on the back.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Congrats. You popped your cherry.

           To Randy, this is a real bonding moment.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, let’s get you patched up.
           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is driving Anthony, who presses a wad of toilet paper 
           against the wound. Anthony, frightened and traumatized, is on 
           the verge of tears.

                                 RANDY
                             (trying to calm)
                        You’re okay, big guy.
                             (beat)
                        You’re tough.

           Randy gives him a playful, winking smile.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        The girls at school are gonna be 
                        all over you. Chicks love scars.

           Anthony chuckles, calming down a little.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - WAITING AREA - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits in an ER waiting room looking up at the TV. Pam 
           bursts through a set of doors. Her coat is covering her 
           stripper dress.

                                 PAM
                             (frantic)
                        Where is he?

                                 RANDY
                        They’re just finishing stitching 
                        him up. He’ll be out in a minute.

                                 PAM
                        What happened?

                                 RANDY
                        He’s fine.

           His casual air pisses her off.

                                 PAM
                        What do you mean he’s fine? He’s in 
                        the fucking hospital.

                                 RANDY
                        I’ve had a million of these. It’s 
                        no big deal.

                                 PAM
                        No big deal? My son’s in the 
                        fucking emergency room and this is 
                        no big deal?
           Pam’s anger catches Randy by surprise. Just like after his 
           night out with the boys.

                                 RANDY
                        Take it easy. He just cut himself.

                                 PAM
                        How?

                                 RANDY
                        Nothing. We were just messing 
                        around, he hit his head. It’s fine.

                                 PAM
                             (really furious)
                        What the fuck, Randy?

           Pam smells something on his breath.

                                 PAM
                        Have you been drinking?

                                 RANDY
                        What? No.

                                 PAM
                        Are you drunk?

                                 RANDY
                        No.
                             (beat)
                        I didn’t even ask him to wrestle. 
                        He wanted to. It was his idea.

           This really sets Pam off.

                                 PAM
                        Randy, you’re the grown-up. You’re 
                        supposed to take care of him. It’s 
                        called being a responsible adult.

           Pam gazes at him, shaking her head in disgust.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        “It was his idea.”

           Randy doesn’t know what to say.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Grow the fuck up.

           The E.R. DOOR opens. Anthony, his head bandaged up, is led 
           out by a DOCTOR. Pam turns and sees him.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Monkey.
           Anthony runs into his mother’s arms. He starts to cry.

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - SHORT TIME LATER

           Pam leads Anthony toward the hospital exit, her arm around 
           him. His cheeks are streaked with tears.

           Randy trails a few feet behind, his tail between his legs.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is driving home from the hospital by himself.

           RANDY’S POV: Pam’s car is directly in front of his. Anthony 
           is with her.

           The light up ahead turns yellow. Pam makes it through. Randy 
           gets caught at the red. He watches Pam’s car disappear into 
           the distance.

           INT. VAN - DUSK

           Randy sits parked in front of Pam’s house, brooding over what 
           he did. He’s been out there for about half and hour.

           Pam comes out of the house and walks over to the van. She 
           taps on the window. He unlocks the passenger-side door. She 
           climbs in.

                                 PAM
                        Hey.

                                 RANDY
                        Hey...

           Pause.

                                 PAM
                        Look, I’m sorry I snapped. I got a 
                        little crazy. My kid was hurt.

           Randy nods understandingly.

                                 RANDY
                        You didn’t do anything wrong. It 
                        was me.

                                 PAM
                        It’s okay.
                                 RANDY
                        This is what I do. 
                             (shaking head darkly)
                        I hurt people.

                                 PAM
                        It was a freak one-time thing.

           Randy gazes off, filled with resignation and guilt. 

                                 RANDY
                        I don’t know how to do this stuff.

                                 PAM
                        What stuff?

                                 RANDY
                        All of it. Any of it.

           Pam isn’t really following.

                                 PAM
                        Look, just come in the house. 

                                 RANDY
                        Why?

                                 PAM
                        Because you live there.

           Randy lets out a tiny, knowing chuckle that unnerves Pam.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Just come in the house, okay?
                             (no response)
                        Okay?

           Randy takes out his wallet. He pulls an old photo out of it. 
           It’s the one with the crossed-out phone numbers on the back.

           He passes it to Pam. She gazes at it, a little unsure what 
           she’s looking at.

           ANGLE ON photo: It’s a mid-’80s shot of Randy and a RED-
           HAIRED 6-MONTH-OLD GIRL, taken backstage at some arena. Randy 
           is smiling and laughing, the baby perched on his steroid-
           pumped bicep.

                        The woman at McDonald’s.

           Pam looks up from the photo.

                                 PAM
                        Your daughter?
           Randy nods.

                                 RANDY
                        Stephanie.

           He looks away from Pam, guilty and ashamed.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        We don’t talk.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Randy sleeps cradled in Pam’s arms.

                                                                CUT TO:

           ANGLE ON Take-A-Number sign. It reads NOW SERVING: 54

           A crowd of AGGRAVATED CUSTOMERS wait at the deli counter. A 
           FAT GUY in a motorized cart clutching a 71 throws a fellow 
           customer a “Do you believe these morons?” eye roll.

           Behind the counter, Randy is putting a block of Havarti 
           cheese onto the slicer. He moves slowly. He seems distracted, 
           almost dazed.

           Wayne, standing nearby, notices Randy’s spacey, lackadaisical 
           air. He heads over.

                                 WAYNE
                        Where are you today?

                                 RANDY
                        Sorry.

                                 WAYNE
                             (two quick claps)
                        Let’s pick it up. Rush-hour 
                        traffic.

           Wayne walks off. Randy adjusts the machine’s setting and 
           begins to slice. He doesn’t seem to be moving much faster.

                    CUSTOMER #1 (O.S.)
                                                   CUSTOMER #2 (O.S.)
           While we’re young...
                                              Any year now...

           Randy, oblivious to the grousing, keeps right on slicing at 
           his unhurried pace. He gets in a nice, meditative groove. 
           Slice... slice... slice... 

           He WINCES, his body jerking backwards. He looks down at his 
           hand.
           ANGLE ON hand. He’s CUT HIS THUMB. Badly.

           Randy stares at the deep gash, watching as blood pulses out 
           in crimson surges. He smiles strangely at it.

           He raises the thumb to his face, tasting the blood with his 
           tongue. It tastes familiar and good. An old friend.

           A customer, seeing this, GASPS. A commotion spreads. 

           ANGLE ON Wayne, standing nearby, appalled.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Randy!

           Randy turns and sees Wayne rushing toward him. Wayne takes 
           Randy’s arm and tries to lead him into the back. 

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                             (conscious of customers 
                              watching)
                        Let’s get that patched up.

           Randy shoves him away, a little roughly. Wayne stumbles 
           backwards.

                                 WAYNE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Somebody call security!

           Randy turns toward the crowd of onlookers. He raises his 
           thumb to his face. He slowly, dramatically smears the BLOOD 
           ACROSS HIS MOUTH.

           The customers GASP. A few women shriek.

           Randy, pleased by the reaction this gets, drags the gash 
           across his cheek. He SMEARS A LINE OF IT under each eye like 
           WARPAINT. He strikes a wrestling pose.

                                 RANDY
                        Let’s get it onnn!

                                 WAYNE (O.S.)
                        Security!

           Randy turns toward Wayne, standing a safe distance away. He 
           ROARS at him. Wayne JUMPS BACK, frightened.

           Randy rumbles out of the deli area, LAUGHING.

           SUPERMARKET AISLE:

           Randy dashes down an aisle. He dodges a WOMAN PUSHING A 
           SHOPPING CART, purposely “over-dodging” her so he CRASHES 
           INTO THE SHELVES and sends stuff flying. 
           A little further down the aisle, he dodges ANOTHER SHOPPER, 
           again purposely and dramatically crashing into the shelves.

           FRONT REGISTER AREA:

           Randy charges past the cashiers and out of the supermarket.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits in the van in a shopping-plaza parking lot. He 
           gazes at himself in the rear-view mirror, dried blood caked 
           on his face. He likes how it looks.

           He looks at the action figure of himself on the dashboard. 

           INT. PAM’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy dials the phone. In his hands is his day planner.

                                 RANDY
                        Hey, what’s up, man? It’s Ram. 
                        Listen...

           INT. BEDROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is packing up his stuff.

           INT. FRONT ENTRYWAY - SHORT TIME LATER

           The door opens. Pam enters to find Randy sitting on the 
           living-room couch, a PACKED BAG in his lap.

                                 PAM
                        What’s up?

           Randy looks up at her with an air of sad finality.

                                 RANDY
                        I’m sorry.
                             (beat)
                        I can’t do this.

           Pam is totally taken aback. Randy looks around the room.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        This life... It’s not me.

                                 PAM
                        Are you breaking up with me?
                                 RANDY
                        It’s not you. It’s me.

           Pam snorts at the cliché.

                                 PAM
                        Fuck you.

           Randy is calm in the face of her rising anger.

                                 RANDY
                        I know who I am. I’m the Ram.

                                 PAM
                        Great, fine. Go be the fuckin’ Ram.

                                 RANDY
                        I really tried. I swear.

           Pam shakes her head scornfully, not buying it.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I’m no good here in the real world.

                                 PAM
                        Randy, you’re 49 years old. It’s 
                        time to move on.

                                 RANDY
                        It’s not that easy.

                                 PAM
                        Yeah, it is. You just do it.

                                 RANDY
                             (sarcastic chuckle)
                        Like you?

                                 PAM
                        What the fuck’s that mean?

                                 RANDY
                        How long you been trying to shake 
                        Cassidy, 18 years?
                             (beat)
                        And you don’t even like her.

           His words strike a nerve.

                                 PAM
                             (controlled fury)
                        That’s totally different.

                                 RANDY
                        I can’t be like that.
           Pam points to the front door.

                                 PAM
                        Get out. 

                                 RANDY
                        Split in half.

           She grabs the bag off his lap and flings it at the door.

                                 PAM
                        Get the fuck out!

                                 RANDY
                        I wanna be one person.

           She grabs him, trying to drag him toward the door.

                                 PAM
                        Great! Go be the Ram! Go die!

                                 RANDY
                        I’m dying right now! Suffocating! 
                        Rotting on the inside. Eventually, 
                        I’m gonna fill you up with that 
                        same rot. Happens every time.

           She lets go of him. Randy’s eyes well up with tears of self-
           loathing.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        My whole life, only place I ever 
                        hurt anybody was outside the ring. 
                        In there, I know how to not mess 
                        somebody up. Fuck ‘em up. But out 
                        here...
                             (beat)
                        I don’t know any of the moves.

           He shakes his head, gazing off with vast sadness and regret.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know the moves.

           Pam looks at him in silence. She knows he has to go back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ANTHONY’S ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy enters Anthony’s empty room. He puts something on the 
           bed and walks out.

           ANGLE ON bed. It’s the dashboard Randy The Ram action figure.
           INT. PAM’S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Pam watches through the window as Randy walks to his van. 

           EXT. PAM’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Randy, climbing into the van, takes one last look at the 
           house before driving off.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VAN - LATER

           Randy is parked across the street from the same one-story 
           house as earlier, the one with the silhouetted woman inside.

           EXT. HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy stands at the door of the house. Taking a moment to 
           steady himself, he knocks. 

           A woman comes to the door. It’s the red-haired woman from 
           McDonald’s. This is Randy’s daughter, STEPHANIE.

                                 RANDY
                        Hey.

           She looks at him coldly. Guarded.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What do you want?

                                 RANDY
                        I just wanted to say I’m sorry.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Oh-kaay...

                                 RANDY
                        I know I ain’t exactly been the 
                        world’s greatest father.

                                 STEPHANIE
                             (bitter chuckle)
                        Gee, really?

                                 RANDY
                        Being a father, I just wasn’t cut 
                        out for it.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        So you just walked out on your wife 
                        and one-year-old.
                                 RANDY
                        We all got our purposes in life.

           Stephanie’s eyes flash with anger.

                                 STEPHANIE
                             (imitating The Ram)
                        Understand something, broski: Randy 
                        The Ram was put here on this earth 
                        for two purposes... Kickin’ butt 
                        and takin’ names!

                                 RANDY
                        I was shit. A shit father. A shit 
                        husband.

           Stephanie doesn’t seem to disagree.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I wish I coulda been different. I 
                        tried. I tried to be Robin 
                        Ramzinski, but I just couldn’t. I’m 
                        not him. I’m Randy The Ram.

           He looks at her sorrowfully.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t change what happened. Or 
                        who I am. Only thing I can do is 
                        say I’m sorry.
                             (heartfelt)
                        I’m really sorry.

           She looks at him in stony silence.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        That all?

                                 RANDY
                        That’s all.

           Stephanie nods slowly.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Okay.

           She closes the door on him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VAN - DUSK

           Randy is driving south on I-95. A passing billboard for 
           RICHMOND SPA & POOL - VIRGINIA’S JACUZZI CHOICE! tells us 
           where he is.
           EXT. I-95 - SIDE OF THE ROAD - NIGHT

           The van is pulled over on the side of the interstate.

           INT. BACK OF VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Randy is catching a quick nap as 18-wheelers barrel past.

           INT. VAN - LATE NEXT MORNING

           Randy is driving along I-95. A sign reads JACKSONVILLE - THIS 
           EXIT. He exits. As he hugs the curve of the exit ramp, the 
           modest Jacksonville skyline appears before him.

           EXT. JACKSONVILLE AIRPORT RAMADA - NOON

           Randy pulls into the parking lot of the Airport Ramada. 

           INT. AIRPORT RAMADA - CHECK-IN AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           A check-in area manned by Migliore. Randy signs an injury-
           release form as Migliore searches a box of Fanfest T-shirts.

                                 MIGLIORE
                             (annoyed)
                        It’s all XL and smaller.

           Randy looks around. Dozens of fans mill about. Some steal 
           glances at him. He basks in the scene.

           INT. GREEN ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           A bunch of WRESTLERS, along with various MANAGERS, 
           GIRLFRIENDS/WIVES, PROMOTERS, and WRESTLING-WORLD INSIDERS 
           mill about. The wrestlers, mostly paunchy men in their 50s, 
           chat amiably with one another, catching up.

           Randy is over by the DRINKS TABLE, pouring himself a cup of 
           Pepsi. With him is Brumberg, who made the trip down.

           Across the room, Randy spots a huge, dark-skinned man of 
           indeterminate ethnicity. THE AYATOLLAH.

           Randy heads over. The Ayatollah is wearing tan khakis and a 
           polo shirt with a BOB ZAYID PONTIAC logo embroidered on the 
           right breast. From his appearance, we sense he’s made a more 
           successful transition to post-wrestling life than most of the 
           others in the room.

                                 RANDY
                        What’s up, Bob?
                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        Hey, Robin. What’s up, man?

           They shake, more cordial than chummy.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH (CONT’D)
                        Ready to do this? 

                                 RANDY
                        I believe so.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        Should be a hoot.
                             (chuckle)
                        Though the wife ain’t too happy. 
                        “You’re doing what?!” She thinks 
                        I’m going off the top rope or 
                        something.

           The Ayatollah chuckles again. Randy bristles at his flip, 
           casual attitude.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH (CONT’D)
                        So how ya doin’, man?

                                 RANDY
                        I’m all right.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        Good, good. Yeah, things are good 
                        with me, too. Business is rockin’. 
                        Just opened up a third dealership.

           Randy nods disinterestedly.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH (CONT’D)
                        That’s two in Columbus, one in 
                        Dayton.

                                 RANDY
                        Great...

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        If you’re ever in Ohio, drop on in. 
                        I’ll make you a nice deal on a G6.

           Randy forces a chuckle-smile. He does not like The Ayatollah.

           INT. STARLITE ROOM - 1:30 PM

           A Q&A session. Randy, The Ayatollah, and FIVE OTHER FORMER 
           WRESTLERS——Corporal Punishment, Billy Bob Banjo, etc.——sit in 
           folding chairs before about a hundred fans.
                                 EDDIE RUCKUS
                             (wrapping up an answer)
                        When Dynamite tried that ref-bump 
                        garbage again, I basically said, 
                        “That’s it, I’ve had it with this 
                        jobroni. It’s whoopin’ time!” 

           Fans nod, pleased with the answer. A PANEL MODERATOR, roaming 
           the crowd with a mike, heads over to a fan raising his hand.

                                 FAN
                        Um, yeah, this is for Ram. At 
                        Judgment Day II, when Furioso threw 
                        you off the top of the cage, did 
                        you know he cut the net?

                                 RANDY
                        I’ll tell ya this much, I sure as 
                        heck did when I hit that floor.

           The crowd laughs.

                                 FAN
                        Did you know your ribs were 
                        cracked?

                                 RANDY
                        Second I landed, bro. I could hear 
                        it. Probably could out in the 
                        parking lot.

           The audience chuckles. Randy nods, happily reminiscing.

                                 RANDY
                        That’s an all-time Daffy Duck bump 
                        right there.

           The moderator heads over to ANOTHER FAN raising his hand.

                                 FAN #2
                        Hey, hi, this question’s for 
                        Corporal Punish——

                                 RANDY
                        You take your lumps and bruises in 
                        this game. But you know what? You 
                        guys make it all worth it. There’s 
                        nothing I wouldn’t do if it gets 
                        your blood pumping and puts a smile 
                        on your face. ‘Cause it’s an honor 
                        you choose to come out and spend 
                        your hard-earned money to see me in 
                        that ring on a Saturday night. It’s 
                        an honor you cheer for me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                        So when you go to a show and see 
                        that name Randy “The Ram” Robinson 
                        printed on that card, you can be 
                        sure you’re gonna get everything I 
                        got. ‘Cause that love, it’s a two-
                        way street. Every time I take a 
                        bump and it gets you off, that gets 
                        me off. The yells, the cheers, 
                        that’s the only thing that makes me 
                        feel alive.

           The audience and moderator are moved. Randy’s getting a 
           little choked up.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        In 1982, the year I wrestled my 
                        first professional match, I was six-
                        foot-one. By 1993, I was five-foot-
                        eleven. Seven back surgeries in 11 
                        years knocked two full inches off 
                        my height. But let me tell you 
                        something, broskis. I may be down 
                        to five-eleven, but performing in 
                        front of you guys has always made 
                        me feel 10 feet tall. And that’s 
                        the way it’s always gonna be.

           Randy is done. The fans are silent for a moment, jarred by 
           the unexpected emotional outpouring. 

           An awkward smattering of applause.

           INT. ATLANTIC ROOM - 4 PM

           A somewhat bigger room, filled with circular tables for a 
           late-lunch banquet. At the tables are 100 OR SO FANS who paid 
           $30 to eat their choice of chicken, beef, or salmon in the 
           presence of their childhood heroes.

           At the head of the room, facing them, is a LONG DAIS. Randy 
           sits in the middle of the dais flanked by a half dozen of his 
           fellow wrestlers on each side. It looks like a strange, 
           steroid-enhanced version of “The Last Supper”.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PAM’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Pam is getting dressed, getting ready for work.

           As she puts on her shoes, she notices something in Randy’s 
           empty, partially-open dresser drawer. She heads over and 
           grabs it. It’s a brochure for the Bergen Massage Academy.
           Pam looks at it with puzzlement. How did this get here? Did 
           Randy pick this up for her? 

           She opens it, taking in all the photos and information. 
           Despite the high cost, it’s exciting and inspiring.

           She thinks of Randy. She’s touched.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AIRPORT RAMADA - HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - 5 PM

           Randy is in a hotel room, taking a pre-match bath. He is 
           peaceful, contemplative.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PAM’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Pam is driving to work, lost in her head.

           INT. CHEETAH’S - DRESSING AREA - SHORT TIME LATER

           Pam sits looking into the dressing-room mirror, absorbed in 
           her thoughts. A song comes on in the main room:

           MOTLEY CRÜE - “SAME OL’ SITUATION”

           She stands up. Showtime.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHEETAH’S - CONTINUOUS

           Pam is onstage, working the pole to the Mötley Crüe song. She 
           has a bored, faraway look in her eye.

                                 MOTLEY CRÜE
                        It's the same ol’, same ol’ 
                        situation/ It’s the same ol’, same 
                        ol’ ball and chain...

           As she dances, her eye roams the crowd. About 20 MEN are 
           there watching her. 

           She abruptly WALKS OFF mid-song. 

           She heads toward the dressing room, disappearing through the 
           curtain.
                                 D.J. FREDDIE TEE 
                             (trying to cover)
                        Cassidy, baby, where’s the fire?

           INT. DRESSING AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Pam opens her locker, grabs her stuff, throws on her coat, 
           and heads back out. It barely takes a minute.

           INT. CHEETAH’S - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Pam steps back through the curtain with her stuff. She cuts 
           across the empty stage and heads toward the front door. 
           Freddie Tee trails after her, confused and concerned.

                                 D.J. FREDDIE TEE
                        What’s up? What happened?

           She keeps right on walking.

                                 D.J. FREDDIE TEE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Pam!

           She steps through the front door...

           EXT. CHEETAH’S - CONTINUOUS

           Into the night.

                                 PAM
                        Pam.

           She smiles to herself as she walks off, never to return.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AIRPORT RAMADA - WRESTLERS’ ROOM - 7 PM

           The card is just underway. Randy sits on a bench taping up 
           his knees. Draped over the bench, we see a new pair of PURPLE 
           TIGHTS to replace the pair he threw out. There are no rams 
           horns running up the sides.

           He takes a deep breath, readying himself for what is to come.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, suited up, walks through the locker room, following 
           the sound of The Ayatollah’s voice.
                                 THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.)
                        Last few months have been crazy.

           Randy turns a corner to find The Ayatollah talking to Billy 
           Bob Banjo as they get suited up near each other.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH (CONT’D)
                             (lacing up his curly-toed 
                              Aladdin boots)
                        We’ve moved more Grand Prix’s this 
                        spring than all last year.

           Billy Bob Banjo, putting on his trademark overalls, nods 
           politely, not too interested. 

           The Ayatollah looks up and sees Randy waiting to talk to him.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH (CONT’D)
                        What’s up, Ram?

                                 RANDY
                        Just wanted to go over things.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                             (almost as if surprised)
                        The match?

                                 RANDY
                        We still need to hash it all out.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        Ah, we can wing it.

                                 RANDY
                        We gotta know the spots.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                             (nonchalant wave)
                        It’ll be fine.

           The Ayatollah sees Randy is not happy with this plan.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH (CONT’D)
                        How’s this: I’m the heel, you’re 
                        the face. Done.

           Randy stalks off, highly annoyed. The Ayatollah turns back to 
           Billy Bob Banjo.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, no, it’s rollin’. Honestly, 
                        12 months from now, I’d say Cincy’s 
                        not out of the question.
           INT. GREAT HALL - SHORT TIME LATER

           The announcer stands in the ring, mid-intro. Boos rain down 
           from the crowd of 300 as ARABIC MUSIC blasts on the speakers.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        From the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
                        weighing in at two-hundred ninety-
                        two pounds... The Tehran Terror, 
                        the Beast Of The Middle East...

                        The Ayaaa-tooo-laaaaaah!

           The Ayatollah bursts through the curtain carrying a big 
           IRANIAN FLAG. He WAVES IT TAUNTINGLY at the crowd. Enraged 
           fans give him the finger and hurl all sorts of racial slurs.

                                              Camelfucker!!

           The Ayatollah, basking in their anger, waves his arms, egging 
           them on. For all his locker-room nonchalance, he knows how to 
           work the crowd.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Randy sits on the bench, hunched over in quiet reflection. 
           His eyes are closed.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                             (through the wall)
                        And his opponent...

           A familiar AC/DC song begins. Randy opens his eyes. He rises.

           INT. GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Randy bursts through to HUGE CHEERS. Loving, appreciative, 
           thunderous, sustained applause.

           INT. COMMENTATORS’ TABLE - CONTINUOUS

           Seated at a ringside table are the match’S COMMENTATORS, a 
           pair of geeky wannabe Marv Alberts in their early 20s. A sign 
           taped to the table reads FWN - FLORIDA WRESTLING NETWORK. 
           Next to the table is a CAMCORDER on a tripod.

                                 COMMENTATOR #1
                        There he is, folks! Randy The Ram!

           Randy raises a set of ram’s horns high in the air. Fans do 
           the same in tribute.

                        As Sergeant Pepper once said, it 
                        was 20 years ago today...

           Randy takes a long lap around the ring, ramming chair after 
           chair, savoring each one. The fans love him. He loves them.

           Randy climbs into the ring, where The Ayatollah awaits. The 
           bell RINGS. The match has begun.

           The two men circle one another, feeling each other out. The 
           Ayatollah stops circling. He extends a hand to Randy. 

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                             (cartoonish Arab accent)
                        Good luck, my friend.

           Randy eyes the hand with wariness and suspicion.

                                 COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)
                        The Ayatollah extending a hand in 
                        good sportsmanship.

                                 COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.)
                        I wouldn’t trust him as far as I 
                        could throw him...

           Randy, “falling for it”, shakes his hand. The Ayatollah jerks 
           downward on Randy’s hand, sending his head hurtling into his 
           bent knee.

                                 COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)
                        A cheap trick by The Ayatollah!
                                 COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.)
                        What did I say!

           The Ayatollah grabs Randy and throws him into the ropes. 
           Randy bounces back toward The Ayatollah, who lazily puts up 
           an elbow for Randy to run into. Randy practically has to lead 
           his face to the elbow. Hitting the mat, Randy pops back up 
           and grabs The Ayatollah.

           The Ayatollah, out of shape and phoning it in, throws Randy 
           into the ropes again. This time, The Ayatollah has a raised 
           knee waiting for Randy. Randy runs into it, doing his best to 
           sell the shot.

                                 RANDY
                             (under breath)
                        You’re working pretty light here.

           Randy gets up and grabs Ayatollah’s arms. With a nifty move, 
           he flips The Ayatollah over his shoulder, slamming him hard 
           into the mat. Randy falls on top of him, grinding his face 
           into the canvas.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        Jesus. Relax.

           Randy flips The Ayatollah over onto his back, pinning his 
           shoulder blades. The ref swoops in for a count.

                                 REFEREE
                        One! Two!...

           The Ayatollah KICKS OUT. They both get up. The Ayatollah jogs 
           toward the ropes. He bounces off. Randy gets ready for 
           something good, but all he gets is a feeble CHEST SLAP. It’s 
           borderline girly. Randy grabs The Ayatollah and puts him in a 
           headlock.

                                 RANDY
                             (highly irritated)
                        Anytime you wanna join in...

           Randy scoops up The Ayatollah and drops him over his knee for 
           a BACKBREAKER. The Ayatollah grimaces in pain as he hits the 
           mat. Before The Ayatollah has a chance to get up, Randy 
           smashes him with a FLYING ELBOW DROP. 

           The Ayatollah gets up. He is pissed.

           Randy goes for a dropkick, but The Ayatollah catches his 
           ankles in midair. He jerks upward on Randy’s legs, sending 
           Randy crashing to the mat on the back of his head. The 
           Ayatollah falls on his throat with his knee. He grinds 
           Randy’s face into the canvas like Randy did to him.
                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        That better?

           Randy is a little staggered.

                                 RANDY
                        Yes.

           The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes. 
           Randy bounces back, flinging himself sideways at The 
           Ayatollah. The Ayatollah catches him in mid-air, cradling him 
           in his arms. The Ayatollah drops Randy onto his bent knee. 
           Randy falls to the canvas, clutching his side in pain. The 
           Ayatollah falls on top of him.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                             (under breath)
                        I forgot how much fun this is.

           The ref swoops in for a count.

                                 REFEREE
                        One!... Two!...

           Randy KICKS OUT. As Randy “recovers”, The Ayatollah jumps out 
           of the ring to grab a folding chair.

           The Ayatollah props up the chair in a corner. He picks Randy 
           off the mat and flings him at it. Randy vaults over it, 
           sailing over the ropes and out of the ring. He hits the 
           concrete floor and crashes against the metal barricade.

           The Ayatollah, hopping out of the ring, stands over Randy, 
           kicking him repeatedly. He grabs his Iranian flag, waving it 
           proudly, inflaming the crowd.

                                              Fat piece of shit!

           The Ayatollah looks down at Randy with pity.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        Look how pathetic! Godless infidel!

           Boos rain down on The Ayatollah. An 11-YEAR-OLD in the front 
           row gives him the finger.

                                 FAN
                        Go back to Osama, ya towelhead fag!

           The Ayatollah takes the butt end of the flag pole and JABS IT 
           into Randy’s side. Randy grimaces in pain. The Ayatollah 
           unties the flag from its pole and WRAPS IT around Randy’s 
           neck.

                        The Ram being choked.

           The Ayatollah jerks up on the flag, lifting Randy off the mat 
           by his neck. Randy thrashes around, struggling to breathe.

           The ref tries to break up the choke, but The Ayatollah 
           casually SHOVES HIM, sending him flying over the barricade.

                                 COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.)
                        Did you see that? He can’t do that!

                                 COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)
                        He just did.

           The Ayatollah releases Randy from the choke. Randy collapses 
           to the floor, sucking air. The Ayatollah picks up him by his 
           hair and throws him back into the ring.  

           THE RING:

           The Ayatollah grabs the folding chair from the corner. He 
           smashes Randy over the head with it. Randy’s forehead is 
           bleeding. The Ayatollah hits him again, taking aim at the 
           forehead cut. More blood. Randy crumples to the mat. 

           His heard is beating fast.

           The Ayatollah takes a few steps back. He charges toward the 
           laid-out Randy, kicking up his legs as he goes airborne. 

                                 COMMENTATOR #1
                        Atomic drop...

           Randy ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY. The Ayatollah slams hard into the 
           mat, tailbone-first.

                                 COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Oh, my.

           The Ayatollah squirms on the mat. Randy, lying next to him, 
           reaches for the folding chair, but The Ayatollah beats him to 
           it. Barely able to lift his head, he smashes Randy in the 
           face with it. Randy snatches the chair out of The Ayatollah’s 
           hands and does the same back right to him.

                                 COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        This is incredible!

                        They’re fighting on their backs!

           The crowd noise has reached a fever pitch. The Ayatollah 
           rolls on top of Randy, punching him as they convene.
                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        Wanna take it home?

                                 RANDY
                        It’s time.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        All you, man. Lead the way...

           Randy, giving him a small, appreciative nod, flips The 
           Ayatollah over. Randy rises to his feet. He picks up The 
           Ayatollah and promptly levels him with a dropkick.

                        And another!
                             (a third one)
                        And another!

           Randy’s heart is POUNDING out of his chest. Determined to 
           give the fans every last ounce he’s got, he picks up The 
           Ayatollah and BODYSLAMS him.

                                 COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Bodyslam!

           Randy stands over his laid-out opponent, seemingly pondering 
           his next move. A chant rises from the crowd:

                                 CROWD (O.S.)
                        Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...

           Randy falls on top of The Ayatollah, putting him in a rest-
           move headlock. The Ayatollah can hear how labored Randy’s 
           breathing has become.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        If you’re hurting, we don’t need 
                        the big finish.

           Randy considers it for a moment. But then he shoots The 
           Ayatollah a look that says “I won’t hear of it”.

                                 RANDY
                        Let’s do this.

           Randy gets up. He pulls The Ayatollah off the mat, locking up 
           with him chest-to-chest. He arches his back and thrusts his 
           hips. The Ayatollah’s feet fly off the canvas as his legs 
           whip into the air. His body does a complete flip as he slams 
           onto his back. Randy stays with him, his body contorting in a 
           tight BACK FLIP as he CRASHES DOWN on top of him.

                        Lateral drop!
           Randy’s HEART LURCHES. 

           He puts his hand to his chest. Something definitely just 
           happened.

           RANDY’S POV: The whole crowd is on its feet chanting.

                                 CROWD
                        RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...

           His heart LURCHES AGAIN.

           RANDY’S POV: The fans are in a frenzy. A guy in the front row 
           is shaking a a WE WANT BLOOD sign.

                                 CROWD (CONT’D)
                        RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...

           Randy, struggling for air, STAGGERS TOWARD THE CORNER. He 
           climbs to the top rope, standing high above the ring. His 
           heartbeat is unnatural and deafening.

           BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM...

           He raises his arms and sticks his elbows out, pressing his 
           fists to the sides of his head to form a set of RAM’S HORNS.

                        Uh-oh! The horns are out...

           The fans are on the edge of their seats, primed to see their 
           hero do his trademark finishing move.

           Randy takes a good long look around the room, lingering on 
           the fans’ faces, savoring their cheers.
