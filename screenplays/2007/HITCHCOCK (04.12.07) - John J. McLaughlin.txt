           EXT. WISCONSIN MARSH LAND - DUSK

           Clumps of grass smolder near a patch of pines.  We move 
           across some of the embers, and see dirt being shovelled on 
           top to extinguish them.  

                                 HENRY GEIN (O.S.)
                        We're just lucky it didn't reach 
                        the trees....

                                 EDDIE (O.S.)
                        Hey, we got the grass burned off, 
                        didn't we?

           We find HENRY and EDDIE GEIN shoveling out the flames.  Both 
           are in their forties.  The men, in flannel shirts, are 
           sweating and have been working hard for hours. 

                                 HENRY GEIN
                        It was a dumb idea, Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                        We could try and grow beans or 
                        something out here...you're the 
                        smart one, what do you think?  
                        Turnips, maybe?

                                 HENRY GEIN
                        Eddie, we've been over this...

           Henry walks over to another flare-up near the pines.  Eddie, 
           looking hurt, looks over at the ramshackle farmhouse, then at 
           his brother.  Henry shovels furiously and finally gets the 
           mini-blaze under control.  Eddie approaches cautiously, then 
           adds a few token shovels full of dirt.

                                 HENRY
                        That wind kicks up again, we'll be 
                        out here all night.

           They work side by side.  Henry won't look at his brother.

                                 HENRY
                        I hear there's gonna be an aircraft 
                        factory outside of Milwaukee... 
                        lotta jobs come June.

                                 EDDIE
                        You can't leave, Henry.  She needs 
                        both of us, she--
                                 HENRY
                        Can you stop being a momma's boy 
                        for one goddamn second... Look at 
                        yourself, Eddie!  She's got you 
                        twisted.  Can't you see that?!  

           Henry glares at Eddie and Eddie shrinks back.  Henry feels a 
           little guilty, but Eddie shovels some more dirt and Henry 
           goes back to shovelling.

                                 HENRY
                        I'm not trying to hurt you.  
                        Just...Jesus, you got to live your 
                        own life someday.  She can take 
                        care of her own goddamn self.  Even 
                        if you don't come with me now, one 
                        day you'll meet someone, or you'll--

           CLANG.  He is hit by the shovel in the back of the head and 
           goes down.  Eddie slowly steps forward into frame, putting 
           down the shovel.  The look on his face isn't anger-- it's 
           BLANK.  After nodding for several seconds, he walks away.  

           We PAN until we find ALFRED HITCHCOCK, in his trademark 
           Mariana custom-tailored suit.  It's as if he's been watching 
           the whole thing, standing in the smoldering field.  And now 
           he turns, looking into the camera.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Good evening.  Brother has been 
                        killing brother since Cain and 
                        Abel, yet I, for one, did not see 
                        that coming.  I was as blind-sided 
                        as poor Henry over there.  The 
                        authorities shared my naivet√©, and 
                        thus believed the young man's tale 
                        that Henry fell and hit his head on 
                        a stone, dying accidentally.

           He smiles slightly.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Of course, if they hadn't believed 
                        him, Eddie would never have had the 
                        opportunity to commit the heinous 
                        acts for which he became famous.... 
                        and we wouldn't have had this 
                        movie.  We'd have a movie more like 
                        one of these....

           TITLE SEQUENCE

           As the dynamic introduction ends, we

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S BEL-AIR HOME - BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

           QUICK CUTS:  a faucet is turned on in the bath.  A hand pours 
           a glass of CHATEAU CHEVEL BLANC '53.

           We see a gleaming bathroom.  Slowly panning past the open, 
           mirrored door, along the white tiles and glistening fixtures, 
           we could very well be in the Bates Motel bathroom.

           At the end of the pan we surprisingly find Hitchcock soaking 
           in the bathtub.  
           Sixty, corpulent, he has a glass of wine next to him and his 
           nudity is covered only by the copy of the LONDON TIMES he's 
           reading.  He is reserved to the point of being haughty, even 
           in this state.

           He takes a sip of wine and hears a bedroom bureau being 
           opened.  As a breeze blows through the window, the door 
           slowly opens with a suspenseful CREAK.  His eyes shift slowly 
           toward the door, and then his head turns, cocking to get a 
           view of the FULL-LENGTH MIRROR on the bathroom door.  

           IN THE MIRROR

           We catch fleeting glimpses of Hitchcock's wife ALMA, also 60, 
           razor-sharp, acerbic, and chic, standing across the bedroom, 
           at her dresser, back to us.  She has on a black half-slip and 
           is hooking on her white bra.

           She moves a little to open another drawer.  She takes out 
           NYLONS holding them up to look at them.

           HITCHCOCK 

           He is enthralled, and when Alma moves he has to shift a 
           little in the tub to maintain his view which makes the water 
           lap against the sides of the tub.  

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Alma stops when she hears the small splashes.  She is neither 
           upset nor amused, as she goes about her business, taking a 
           skirt from the drawer.

           The bedroom has TWIN BEDS.  We move around them and around 
           Alma until we can see Hitchcock staring at her in the mirror 
           from the tub.  She still isn't looking at him:

                                 ALMA
                             (playfully)
                        Muhammad had the eyes of peeping 
                        Toms gouged out with arrows.

           Hitch sinks further down int he tub and goes back to his 
           paper, pretending he's been reading it the whole time. 

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        There were no peeping Toms in 
                        Muhammad's time, he lived in a tent-
                        --noticeably lacking in windows and 
                        keyholes.

           Alma steps into her frock.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Did you see this article?  "The New 
                        Masters of Suspense".... Dassin... 
                        Hathaway...
                             (annoyed by the name)
                        Clouzet.

           She goes to the mirror and puts on LIPSTICK.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Why are they constantly hunting for 
                        a new master of suspense when they 
                        still have me?

           She unsuccessfully runs a brush through her red hair.

                                 ALMA
                        You came this close to snapping up 
                        Diabolique.  If you'd made that 
                        picture, it would have been more 
                        than atmosphere and a few jokes.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (thinking hard)
                        It had more than that.  It had 
                        a...simplicity.  No Cary Grant to 
                        pretty it up, no Kim Novak to dumb 
                        it down.  It was a clean, nasty 
                        little piece of work.

                        Hitch, I don't care what the 
                        critics said, Vertigo was a 
                        marvelous picture.

                        If anyone came in late and missed 
                        the setup, they'd have likely 
                        asked, "Why is that young blonde 
                        thing smooching her grandfather?"

           Alma caps the lipstick.  She puts down the TOILET SEAT 
           (Psycho was the first movie with a toilet in it).  She sits 
           on it, reaches down and pats his head like a child.

                        Don't be maudlin.  You know it 
                        aggravates the hell out of me.

                                 ALMA
                        Yes.  And you always have been.

                        Old and let's not forget corpulent.

           He waits for her to protest this, but she continues primping.

                             (drolly)
                        You always know precisely how to 
                        hurt me, don't you?
                             (beat)
                        Where are you going?

                                 ALMA
                        I'm seeing Whit for brunch later.  
                        Why don't you come?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        We just established that I'm 
                        corpulent.

                                 ALMA
                        You'll feel better when you find a 
                        project.  Has Peggy unearthed any 
                        decent books?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Sleeping pills with dust jackets.

           She turns, fully dressed, insecure about her appearance.
                                 ALMA
                        Well...how do I look today?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (looking at his paper)
                        Adequate.

           Alma shakes her head, smiles and walks out.

           Hitch goes to stand, but loses his balance.  He grabs onto 
           the SHOWER CURTAIN as he falls back, and wrenches the curtain 
           from the RINGS on the rod.

           THE ROD

           We see the curtain fly loose and the rings spin on the rod.

           HITCH 

           He looks up at the image of the shower curtain rings, 
           intrigued, making a mental note.  It's an image that will be 
           in the movie, "PSYCHO," at which the world will soon gasp.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S CAR - TRAVELLING - DAY

           Alma drives the GLEAMING BLACK 1955 LINCOLN.  Hitchcock, two 
           SEALYHAM TERRIERS on his lap, sits staring up at a huge 
           BILLBOARD they pass.  It is for "THE NUN'S STORY," starring 
           Audrey Hepburn-- she looks good and innocent.  It seems to 
           irk him.

           EXT. THE PARAMOUNT GATE - DAY

           The impressive icon looms large.  The FIRST GUARD redirects a 
           car away from the gate. 

           ANOTHER GUARD in the booth nods, and the First Guard looks up 
           to see the huge Lincoln.  The Guards snap-to as if for the 
           arrival of royalty and open the gate.  The car stops before 
           pulling through, and the guards get a glimpse of an 
           especially imperious looking Hitch.

                                 FIRST GUARD
                        Morning, sir.

           Hitchcock looks at him, waiting for more.

                                 FIRST GUARD
                             (to the dogs)
                        Sirs.

           Satisfied, Hitchcock looks ahead and Alma drives through.
           INT. HITCHCOCK'S CAR - TRAVELLING - DAY

           The vehicle is massive, but Alma parks it like a pro.  To one 
           side, ahead, Hitch sees a CREW following after a director as 
           he points things out on a stage.  In the other direction, 
           there is bustle and laughter of a shoot in front of a stage.

                                 ALMA
                        Somewhere there's a story just 
                        waiting for you.

           She hands Hitch a fancy English lunch pail.

                                 ALMA
                        This will be waiting for you, too.

           He snaps it open.  Inside are THREE ORANGES.  He is quietly 
           appalled.

           Alma puts a gentle hand on his girth and pats.  She looks at 
           him knowingly, asking the question with her expression-- "Do 
           you want to lose weight or just complain about it?"

           He sighs.  He opens the door and awkwardly pulls himself out 
           of the car.

           INT. HALLS OF PARAMOUNT - DAY

           Hitchcock walks past several offices and one editing suite-- 
           all of them are full of people bustling, hurrying, hard at 
           work on films.  Hitch pauses for a second-- everyone is too 
           busy to even notice him.

           He rounds a corner, looking left out.

           Hitchcock lumbers down the hall, passing framed glamour 
           photos of Paramount's greatest stars:  Audrey Hepburn, Gloria 
           Swanson, William Holden, and finally, a photo of Hitch.

           We stay on the photo as Hitchcock passes.  After a moment a 
           pudgy hand reaches in and moves the photo a tiny bit to 
           straighten it.  The hand disappears, then Hitch slips back 
           into frame, and purposefully makes Audrey Hepburn's photo a 
           tiny bit crooked.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - DAY

           A luxurious wood panelled office.  Hitch sits behind his 
           desk, staring out the window, receiving his morning SHAVE 
           from THE STUDIO BARBER.
           Hitch's longtime assistant, PEGGY ROBERTSON, a stern but 
           sharp-witted British woman, forty-three, always well-dressed, 
           sits across from him, going over potential properties.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        Fox is offering "The Diary of Anne 
                        Frank."

           He throws his head back, and it makes the Barber slip with 
           the razor.  There is a tiny nick that the Barber dabs, a 
           little upset.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        The audience would spend the entire 
                        picture waiting for Miss Frank to 
                        discover the corpse I'd hidden 
                        under the floorboards.

           Peggy goes to another folder.  Hitch shakes his head and the 
           Barber pulls back in time.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        MGM wants you for Ian Fleming's 
                        "Casino Royale," with Cary Grant as 
                        James Bond.  It's definitely in the 
                        style of your other pictures....

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I made that movie.  It's called 
                        "North by Northwest."  And "style" 
                        is just self-plagerism.

           When he reaches for an orange, it nearly makes the Studio 
           Barber slip with the razor-- there is another tiny dot of 
           blood the Barber dabs away nervously.  

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I need something fresh.  I'm 
                        treading water, Peggy.  Everyone's 
                        on to me.

           The Barber takes a deep breath and waits until Hitch starts 
           peeling the orange, then recommences the shave.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        That's your last orange and it's  
                        only ten-thirty.  What are you 
                        going to eat the rest of the day?

           He motions for the Barber to hold up the mirror.  The image 
           of his face overflows the small frame.  Repulsed, he stops 
           peeling and puts the orange back on his desk.  
           He leans back his head and makes a hand motion for the Barber 
           to CUT HIS THROAT.

           The PRE-LAP sound of contagious and hearty LAUGHTER.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Alma is in the middle of brunch with writer WHITFIELD COOK, 
           and they both seem tired out from laughing.  Whitfield is 
           very sophisticated and dashing like Olivier or Hitchcock 
           star, Cary Grant.  He and Alma make a handsome couple-- an 
           older COUPLE at another table is saying so right now-- 
           delighted that people can be so compatible.  He's physically 
           the opposite of Hitchcock, and his interaction with Alma is 
           much more light and airy.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        She wouldn't speak to me for the 
                        rest of the shoot, and I swear, I 
                        never went near him...

           She laughs.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        We had fun, didn't we?

                                 ALMA
                        We always had fun working together, 
                        Whit.  And Hitch loves having you 
                        around.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        What are you working on these days?

                                 ALMA
                        Hitch is going out of his mind 
                        looking for something-- you know 
                        how unbearable he is when he 
                        doesn't have something lined up.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        Almost as unbearable as when he's 
                        working on something.

                                 ALMA
                             (laughing)
                        Almost.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        Anyway, I wasn't asking about 
                        Hitch...what about you?  What are 
                        you working on?
                                 ALMA
                        I'm satisfied spending time in my 
                        garden.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        That's a lucky garden.

           She notices his eyes stray to a HANDSOME WAITER across the 
           room-- an indication for us that he's bisexual, something of 
           which Alma is well aware.  She clears her throat.

                                 ALMA
                        How's Elizabeth?  Remember?  Your 
                        "wife?"

           He suddenly breaks off looking at he waiter.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        She's happy since I promised her 
                        the dedication in my new novel.

                                 ALMA
                        You know how to make a woman happy.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        And a man now and then.

           She laughs at him.

           EXT. THE GEIN FARM - 1945 - DAY

           A SHOVEL breaks into the hard scrabble Wisconsin ground.  
           Pulling back, we see it is the mild-mannered Eddie, a year 
           after we saw him last.  He wears a flannel coat, plaid 
           flannel shirt, a hunting cap and two-days growth of beard.  
           Behind him, a white farmhouse, large and in need of paint. 

           There is nothing ominous until a shrill voice yells-- 
           harkening to PSYCHO when "Mother" yells for Norman.

                                 AUGUSTA GEIN (O.S.)
                        Eddie?...Eddie?!!

           Eddie jabs the shovel into the ground, and with no hesitation 
           or ill-feeling, hurries into the house.

                                 EDDIE
                        Coming, Ma...
           INT. EDDIE'S HOUSE - 1945 - CONTINUOUS

           Eddie goes inside.  It is lightly cluttered and dirty. 

                                 AUGUSTA GEIN (O.S.)
                        Eddie!  Who were you talking to?!

           He heads up the stairs.

                                 EDDIE
                        No one...

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           We see the bathroom door is open-- it is dark and grim.  
           Eddie walks through the door.  Eddie is very dutiful-- he 
           should not seem resentful as in Tony Perkins' portrayal.  He 
           wants to take care of his mother.

                                 AUGUSTA GEIN (O.S.)
                        Was it that woman we saw at 
                        Smith's?  The little harlot?

                                 EDDIE
                        I told you, ma, I wasn't with 
                        anyone.  You'll catch cold...

           He takes a towel off a rack and then leaves our view for a 
           moment.

                                 AUGUSTA GEIN (O.S.)
                        My legs hurt.

                                 EDDIE
                        Shhh...It's okay...I got you...

           Eddie comes out of the bathroom, carrying the old woman, 
           wrapped in towels.  We cannot see her face-- and it harkens 
           to the moment when Norman carries his mother to the fruit 
           cellar to hide her.  

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - DAY

           We pull back out of Hitchcock's eye-- he's reading about 
           Eddie Gein in the paper.  He takes a long drink of water.

           He goes through a stack of several older papers to find 
           something else.  He's distracted for a moment as he sees 
           people passing by his window.  He moves away from their sight 
           and peeks through the blinds-- it is nothing special, just a 
           friendly encounter between a MAN and a WOMAN.  He sips his 
           drink as the Man puts his hand tenderly on the woman's waist.
           Hitch sighs as the couple starts to walk away.

           When they are out of sight, he goes back to looking through 
           the stack of New York Times.

           OUTER OFFICE - LATER

           Peggy is reading through material, not finding anything when 
           a large SHADOW starts to creep over her desk.  She's not 
           alarmed, but looks slowly up to see Hitchcock towering over 
           her, his glass in his hand.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        Is that water you're drinking or do 
                        I need to call Alma?

           It's water.  He drains the glass playfully.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Anthony Boucher's column in the New 
                        York Times this past weekend called 
                        the book "Psycho" chillingly 
                        effective.

           She looks through a stack of papers next to her desk.

                             (looking it over)
                        It's based on the real life murders 
                        of a psychopath in rural Wisconsin, 
                        Ed Gein.  Thus the charming title.
                             (scanning further)
                        Contains sensationalized and 
                        graphic elements of brutal 
                        violence, voyeurism, 
                        transvestitism, and incest.

                        mother, spies on women, and kills 
                        them.  The studio says it's 
                        completely "unsuitable for film."

           Hitch stares at her, thinking.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        You're kidding.
           Hitchcock raises an eyebrow.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A fire flickers in the fireplace of the Bel-Air mansion.  The 
           mood is intimate...and eerie. Still wearing his suit and tie, 
           and gulping a glass of wine, Hitchcock devours the PSYCHO 
           NOVEL.  

           As soon as Alma enters at the other end of the room, Hitch, 
           without even looking up, slides the wine glass out of her 
           view on the table.  Alma, getting some books from a bookcase, 
           glances at Hitch.

                                 ALMA
                        And how was your day?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (tilting the book down)
                        I'm hungry.

                                 ALMA
                        If you're good, maybe you can have 
                        a grapefruit later.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        How was your meal with Mr. Cook?

                                 ALMA
                        Same old Whit.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Yes, but what I wanted to know 
                        was...what did you EAT with Mr. 
                        Cook.  In luscious detail.

           She ignores the question.

                                 ALMA
                        He gave me the galleys of his new 
                        book...maybe you could take a look 
                        at it later.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Is that why he took you to lunch?

                                 ALMA
                        Of course not!  You know him as 
                        well as I do; he isn't like that at 
                        all.
                             (beat)
                        Anyway, I looked it over this 
                        afternoon.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALMA (CONT'D)
                        I have some ideas on how you can 
                        adapt it.  It might be the one.

           He nods in deference to her taste and interest.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Leave it on the nightstand.

           He goes back to reading Psycho, and Alma sweeps out of the 
           room.

           He becomes quickly engaged with what he's reading.  We push 
           in on him as he pauses to imagine:

           INT. EDDIE'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM

           It is an immaculate but dark room and should be furnished 
           somewhat like the Psycho mom's room.  

           Eddie puts the woman on the bed and we follow him to the 
           dresser.  He picks up a slip, perhaps lingering too long 
           before putting it aside and getting a cotton nightgown.  Out 
           of focus, in the background, is the figure of Eddie's mother.

                                 AUGUSTA GEIN
                        I don't know what I'd do without 
                        you, son...

           Eddie turns and we stay on his face as he dresses her.

                                 EDDIE (CONT'D)
                        I don't know what I'd do without 
                        you either.

           As he pulls the nightgown down, taking care to smooth out the 
           wrinkles, he reveals her face to us for the first time.  
           Augusta is a hard, old woman; her face contorted by a stroke.

                                 AUGUSTA GEIN
                        Come into bed with me, Eddie.  
                        Don't leave me....

           He puts a small blanket over her.  She looks uneasy and in 
           pain.  Still wearing his jacket and coat, he takes off his 
           shoes and crawls up next to her in the bed.  He stares at her 
           face, but she's looking up at the ceiling, as if he isn't 
           even there.  He reaches out and takes her hand.

                                 AUGUSTA GEIN (CONT'D)
                        I'm afraid of being alone...

           He looks up at the ceiling, too.  After a few moments:
                                 EDDIE
                        Me, too...

           His eyelids heavy, he closes them.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Alma puts Whitfield's Galley on the night stand between the 
           twin beds and runs her fingers over his name.  She looks 
           confident that Hitch will enjoy it, too.

           She goes to the window to close the blind but stops-- the 
           house is cornered in such a way that she has a partial view 
           into the living room.

           She sees Hitch pacing around as he reads the Psycho book with 
           rapt interest.  She knows the look on his face.

           EXT. EDDIE GEIN'S HOUSE - 1945 - NIGHT

           A crow flies past the moon and into the tree in front of 
           Eddie's house.

           INT. EDDIE'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The moon passes the window, and light is thrown on Eddie's 
           face in bed.  He is still in his coat, but his hat has fallen 
           away from his head.  He opens his eyes and stretches a 
           little, getting his bearings.  He looks next to him suddenly:

           AUGUSTA GEIN

           Is in the position where we last saw her except her eyes are 
           bugged and her mouth is horrifically twisted open.  There is 
           a large wet stain beneath her where her bladder released.

           Eddie draws back slowly.  He is still holding her hand.  He 
           stares at her for a few moments, but she doesn't blink.

                                 EDDIE
                        Ma?....

           No movement.  Trembling he reaches out and puts his hand on 
           her cheek.  He closes his eyes tightly.

                                 EDDIE (CONT'D)
                             (feebly)
                        Don't be afraid, ma...I'm here with 
                        you... I'm here....
           INT. HITCHCOCK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hitchcock, in pajamas, sits up in his twin bed with a tiny 
           reading lamp over the Psycho book.  He's riveted, near the 
           end.  Alma is half asleep in the other bed when she sees an 
           impish smile comes to his lips and his eyes widen.  

                                 ALMA
                        What?

           He hands over the book with the page open, then adjusts his 
           blankets.  She grabs reading glasses and sits up.

                                 ALMA
                        "Mary started to scream, and then 
                        the curtains parted further and a 
                        hand appeared, holding a butcher's 
                        knife.  It was the knife that, a 
                        moment later, cut off her 
                        scream...and her head."

           She looks amused.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        A likeable heroine steals money, 
                        makes one wrong turn and is hacked 
                        to death, in a motel bathroom.  
                        Kill the film's biggest star right 
                        away.  It's never been done before.  
                        Nothing in the book has ever been 
                        done before.

                                 ALMA
                        It sounds like a horror movie, 
                        Hitch.

           She sees something that irritates her:  the corner of the 
           Whitfield Cook manuscript protrudes from the trash can 
           beneath the night stand.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        What if someone really good made a 
                        horror picture?  They make a 
                        fortune even when they're godawful.  

           She's irked about him chosing Psycho over Whit's galley, but 
           she can see the obsession in that far away look of his.

           INT. LEW WASSERMAN'S MCA OFFICE - DAY

           Hitchcock sits with LEW WASSERMAN, Hollywood deal-maker and 
           Hitch's agent.  Lew is thin, and wears thick glasses, a black 
           suit and a razor tie.
                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        "The Widow Loved Company" is 
                        available.  If Paramount passes, 
                        you can do it at Universal.

           Hitchcock stares at him blankly.  After a beat, he hands over 
           the book.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        "Psycho" is written by a man named 
                        Robert Bloch.  If you mention my 
                        name as being involved in the 
                        project, you'll drive the price up 
                        to a hundred thousand or more.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        It's crap; nobody in town wants 
                        anything to do with it. If there's 
                        a movie there, Hitch, it's for the 
                        drive-in crowd.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        You know who goes to drive-in 
                        pictures, Lew?  Young people.  All 
                        willing to pay to have the bejesus 
                        scared out of them.
                             (beat)
                        Some of them, more than once.

           Lew suddenly realizes the wisdom of his client's proposal.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I expect you can get it for twenty.  
                        But I want you to get it for ten.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        I'll get it for five.

           Lew picks up the phone.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK (PRE-LAP)
                        Audiences want something different.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. PARAMOUNT BOARD ROOM - DAY

                                 BARNEY BALABAN
                        I agree, but the truth is, Hitch, 
                        every time you want to do something 
                        "different"-- The Wrong Man, The 
                        Trouble with Harry, Vertigo -- 
                        someone loses money.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        So we should stop trying to give 
                        them something new?

           Paramount President BARNEY BALABAN is at the head of a large 
           table.  He has THREE EXECUTIVES next to him.  Hitchcock sits 
           further down the table with empty chairs on either side of 
           him.  There is a copy of the novel PSYCHO in front of 
           Balaban.  He is not pleased, but respectful.

                                 BARNEY BALABAN
                        I'm just asking for you to meet us 
                        halfway.  You'd be in post right 
                        now on "No Bail for the Judge" if 
                        you'd pulled out the rape scene.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Miss Hepburn pulled out because she 
                        was pregnant.  If Mr. Ferrer had 
                        pulled out before conception, there 
                        wouldn't have been an issue.

                                 BARNEY BALABAN
                        Can't you do something like "North 
                        by Northwest," but for us this time 
                        instead of on loanout to MGM?
                             (off his glacial stare)
                        Look, we don't want to alienate the 
                        audience.  They want to see someone 
                        like Kim Novak and she gets paid a 
                        lot of money.  That's why we keep 
                        her alive for the whole picture.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Do you know what that self-
                        enchanted little twit said to me?  
                        "Oh, Mr. Hitchcock, you're not 
                        shooting me from my best side."  I 
                        told her, "My dear, you're sitting 
                        on your best side."

           One of the Executives smiles, but Barney gives him a sharp 
           look.

                                 BARNEY BALABAN
                        Novak's a gorgeous, sexy girl.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Killing the heroine in the first 
                        half hour is exactly what's going 
                        to set us apart.
                                 BARNEY BALABAN
                        "The Widow Loved Company" is 
                        available.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (imperiously)
                        "Psycho."

           The Paramount executives seem uncomfortable.

                                 BARNEY BALABAN
                        Well, you obviously have a lot of 
                        passion for this project.  Let us 
                        talk internally and get back to 
                        you.

           Hitchcock waits, seething.  Balaban is calm and keeps a 
           pleasant front.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Are you telling me "no?"

                                 BARNEY BALABAN
                        Absolutely not.  I think you know 
                        me better than that, Hitch.  I 
                        would never say "no" to you.

           Balaban doesn't say ANYTHING.  There is a long silence.

           We hear a pre-lap of Hitchcock straining, struggling to 
           breathe.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The room is dark as Hitch enters, leaving the lights off.  
           His eyes drift to the immense walk-in refrigerator.  He goes 
           to it and opens the door.

           The LIGHT COMES ON INSIDE the fridge as well as in Hitch's 
           eyes as he is met by an immense display of delicacies.  His 
           hand trembles next to a stack of turkey drumsticks, lingers 
           next to an immense ham, then moves to a bowl of his wife's 
           fois gras.  

           But he catches sight of HIS REFLECTION in the chrome shelving 
           of the fridge and stops.  His image is distorted and looks 
           even more massive.  He backs out of the fridge, leaving the 
           door open, and with it, the light on.

           He moves to the center island, frustrated.  He grabs an 
           orange from a bowl and slaps it down on the counter.  With 
           pent up frustration he draws a LARGE KNIFE from the block and 
           whacks violently through the orange.
           INT. HITCHCOCK POOL - MORNING

           We open on a table: an empty glass, an empty wine bottle, and 
           about a dozen squeezed-out orange halves.  Moving over we see 
           Hitch, in a lounge chair, still in robe and slippers, asleep.  
           There is a book folded open on his chest-- Joris-Karl 
           Huysmans' decadent and influential 1884 novel:  "A REBOURS."

           Alma comes out on the deck, dressed to go out, and stops 
           short when she sees her sleeping husband. 

           She takes the book off his chest, closes it, and looks at the 
           cover.  She holds it out for a second then lets it drop-- it 
           makes a LOUD CLAP when it lands flat on the deck.

           Hitch's eyes spring open, darting around, disoriented for 
           only a moment.  He sees Alma staring at him.

                                 ALMA
                        It's almost time to go.

           He pulls himself up.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I must have fallen asleep reading.

           Alma tips an empty wine bottle toward him, remaining calm.

                                 ALMA
                        This has a lot of calories.

           He raises his chin high, walks into the house.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S CAR - TRAVELLING - MORNING

           Hitch is in his suit and Alma is driving.  He's hung over but 
           pretending he isn't.  She's annoyed, but pretending to be 
           content.

           She takes a short stop at a light-- a little shorter than she 
           has to.  Her husband's head is jostled forward.  

           She looks at him in mock apology.  He rubs his temple, 
           getting the message.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I think we should have a dinner 
                        party Sunday.

                                 ALMA
                        What's the occasion?
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I'm going to announce that I'm 
                        making Psycho.

           She is a little surprised.  He stares ahead, lost in thought.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - MORNING

           Peggy comes into the office carrying a load of scripts and 
           books.  She's just catching her breath when she hears quiet 
           talking and a strange, slow GRINDING SOUND from Hitch's 
           private office.

           She goes to the door which is ajar and pushes it open.  She's 
           taken aback by what she sees:

           A TOOL BAG is on Hitch's desk.  A very old STUDIO MAINTENANCE 
           MAN stands drilling a small hole into the panelling with a 
           MANUAL BRACE HAND DRILL.  Hitchcock, hands behind his back, 
           watches.

           There are several holes in the panelling.  When the 
           Maintenance Man pulls away the brace, Hitchcock puts his eye 
           to the hole.  After a moment, he leans back.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Try the one-sixteenth bit.

           As the Maintenance Man changes the bit, Hitchcock glances 
           back at the stunned Peggy; he is neither surprised nor 
           embarrassed by her presence.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Mr. Gallagher and I are conducting 
                        research.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        What's on the other side of that 
                        wall?

           Hitch looks through the hole.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Another eye, looking back.
                             (looking again)
                        It's brown....and it's 
                        exceptionally angry.

           EXT. HITCHCOCK GARDEN - DAY

           Alma, in a gardening outfit, ATTACKS the soil with a HAND 
           TILLER.  She keeps working as a car pulls into the drive, but 
           looks up when she hears the car door.
           She brightens when she sees Whitfield Cook, looking very 
           suave and casual next to his sporty car.  He has a small 
           paper bag in his hand.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                             (nodding to the tiller)
                        Remind me not to get on your bad 
                        side.

           Alma hastily brushes away dirt as she stands.  She primps and 
           inadvertently gets a small dried leaf in her hair.

                                 ALMA
                        Whit....this is a pleasant 
                        surprise.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        I'm actually on my way around the 
                        hill to my agent's and I saw you 
                        out here.  I'm glad I did.

           He reaches his hand toward her face-- but it's only to pull 
           the leaf from her hair.  He holds it up and she laughs.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        I brought you something.

           He pulls down the bag revealing a small tray of tiny purple 
           PANSIES.  She laughs and takes the tray.

                                 ALMA
                        Oh, they're marvelous.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        A girl was selling them on the side 
                        of the road...Pansies.

           She laughs, then gets on her knees to transplant them.

                                 ALMA
                        I showed Hitch your galley...

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        Oh, I told you not to....

                                 ALMA
                        I'm afraid he's picked his next 
                        project.  He's all fired up about 
                        an unseemly little book -- 
                        "Psycho."

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        "Psycho?"
                                 ALMA
                        He's announcing it Sunday at a 
                        dinner party, and you and Elizabeth 
                        are both coming this time.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        Wouldn't miss it, my dear.

           She finishes with the flowers, pleased.  He offers his hand 
           and gallantly helps her up.

                                 ALMA
                        I thought your book was excellent.  
                        I have some ideas about it...

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        Thanks, Alma, that means everything 
                        coming from you.
                             (checking his watch)
                        I don't want to be late-- I'm not 
                        his favorite client.

           He walks to his car.  He stops just before getting in.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        Oh-- by the way.  You might want to 
                        catch the afternoon movie.

           She's excited.

                                 ALMA
                        Which one is it?

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S STUDY - DAY(LATER)

           On television-- the 1950 Hitchcock classic "Stage Fright."

           The credits come up:  "Screenplay by Whitfield Cook, 
           Adaptation by Alma Reville."  She's thrilled at the sight of 
           her name with Whitfield's. 

           A moment and the title fades. "DIRECTED BY ALFRED HITCHCOCK" 
           overwhelms the small screen in the largest letters yet.

           It's bittersweet for Alma as she watches, eating her lunch on 
           a tray.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - DAY(LATER)

           Hitchcock is at his desk, doodling something that we can't 
           see.  Peggy enters, eyeing the spot where the holes were 
           drilled-- the print of the painting we'll see later in the 
           Bates Motel now hangs there.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Peggy, summon your minions....

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        My minions.  Sure.  And they 
                        are...?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Get them started buying copies of 
                        "Psycho."

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                             (puzzled)
                        Just how many do you need?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        All of them.  I want every copy, 
                        nationwide.  Have them scour every 
                        book shop, and library.... 
                        "Psycho's" my next picture, and I 
                        don't want anyone to find out the 
                        ending until they see it in the 
                        theater.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        Those oranges are affecting your 
                        brain...maybe you should try 
                        apples.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Don't let anyone know what I'm 
                        doing.  Especially Paramount.
                             (beat)
                        Oh, and I'm having a dinner party 
                        Sunday.  Wear something blue.

           Peggy waits for more, then leaves, a little shaken by the 
           scope of the assignment.  Hitchcock keeps doodling and we 
           move in on:  

           THE PIECE OF PAPER

           It is a rough storyboard for "Psycho."  The first panel is a 
           longshot of the "Psycho house" at night.  The next panel is 
           an interior of the house, where Norman walks to the foot of 
           the stairs, back to us, and looks up longingly toward his 
           mother's room.

                                                       MATCH CUT TO:
           INT. EDDIE GEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Eddie pines as he looks up the stairs.  Back still to us, 
           Eddie walks down the hall toward the light of the kitchen.

           We see him take a seat at the kitchen table.

           Eddie gets up and leaves our view for a moment.  He returns 
           with a SHOVEL, the same one that he used to kill his brother.  
           He walks out the back door with it.

           EXT. PLAINFIELD CEMETARY -- NIGHT

           A lantern burning, Eddie is attempting to dig up the grave of 
           his mother.  He's barely scratched the surface when he hits a 
           concrete slab.  Frustrated he pounds a few times in various 
           spots with the shovel, always hitting concrete.

           He looks around-- the grave of another middle-aged woman 
           catches his eye.  He looks around then goes to the other 
           grave-- he starts to dig and starts making easy headway.

           INT. EDDIE GEIN‚ÄôS BATHROOM -- NIGHT

           A woman's body is on the floor, wrapped in a death shroud, 
           covered in dirt.  He drags it to the empty tub, and pulls 
           away the shroud.  He lifts it to the edge and pushes it in. 

           He unrolls a piece of canvas revealing several KNIVES-- all 
           the blades are different shapes and lengths.  He looks in at 
           the body, chooses a knife, leans into the tub and cuts.  He 
           turns on the water, leans back and rolls up his sleeves.  He 
           picks another knife and starts cutting again. 

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. HITCHCOCK LIVING ROOM -- A SUNDAY AFTERNOON

           A Look Magazine headline which screams: ‚ÄúHOUSE OF HORRORS 
           STUNS NATION.‚Äù Stark black and white photographs show the 
           nightmarish decay of the Gein house and severed body parts. 
           REVEAL --

           Peggy and DOUGLAS ROBERTSON watching Hitch‚Äôs reaction as he 
           holds open a thick manila file and stares at the research. 

           TWO SERVERS, dressed all in blue, offer BLUE MARTINIS on blue 
           trays to delighted DINNER PARTY GUESTS.  TWO FEMALE SERVERS, 
           also blue, carry trays of assorted blue-dyed Hors D'Oeuvres. 

           There are a couple of GOSSIP COLUMNISTS, including a Hedda 
           Hopper type, taking little notes as they talk to the guests.
           The Guests mill around and a PIANO TRIO, all in blue, plays 
           ‚ÄúBlue Tango‚Äù as Hitch studies a picture of Gein‚Äôs 
           terrifyingly impassive face.

           Through a shuttered window to the kitchen, Hitchcock can see 
           Alma, hard at work preparing food in the kitchen.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Couldn‚Äôt he have looked more like 
                        William Holden and less like Elmer 
                        Fudd?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Hitch?  Why is the food blue?

           Hitchcock is distracted-- Whitfield Cook and wife ELIZABETH 
           have arrived and are greeting Alma in the kitchen.  Hitchcock 
           snags a Blue martini from a tray.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (to Peggy)
                        We‚Äôll talk about casting tomorrow. 
                        Also, I need research detailing a 
                        typical unmarried thirty-year-old 
                        secretary from Phoenix, Arizona. 

           As soon as Hitch sees Elizabeth leave the kitchen, Whitfield 
           and Alma get closer.  Whitfield innocently whispers something 
           in Alma's ear and Alma laughs.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (continuing)
                        Her monthly rent, what she wears, 
                        reads, what perfume she uses...

                                 DOUGLAS
                        ...how she deals with a demanding 
                        boss when she‚Äôs trying to relax on 
                        her weekends off...

           Peggy shoots Doug a look.  But Hitchcock is looking at the 
           kitchen.  Alma CLOSES THE SHUTTERS and blocks his view.  
           Hitch drifts away, toward the kitchen.   Douglas shrugs 
           questioningly.

                                 PEGGY
                        That‚Äôs just Hitch.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        That why the food's blue?  "It's 
                        just Hitch?"

           She jabs him in the ribs with her elbow.
           CROSSING THE ROOM

           Hitch has his eyes on the kitchen ahead, but is waylaid by 
           Lew who puts an arm around him and holds up his blue canape 
           for them both to look at.  It is a Hitchcock-picture standard 
           moment-- a character needing to get someplace being held by 
           someone who wants to chat.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Hitch, what the hell is wrong with 
                        this?  This is not supposed to be 
                        this color.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        The same food in the same colors 
                        gets tiresome.

           Hitch manages to extricate himself and heads for the kitchen.  
           Smiling and bowing slightly as he passes Elizabeth.

           INT.  HITCHCOCK KITCHEN -- (SIMULTANEOUS)

           Alma continues working at the stove as Whitfield leans 
           against the counter, staring at her with a slight smile.  
           Although the shutters are closed, the door is open.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        If we were writing this moment for 
                        a Hitchcock picture, what would two 
                        characters like us, married to 
                        other people, be saying right now?

                                 ALMA
                        Hitch would have us start with some 
                        off-handed patter about cooking, 
                        then move on to a dazzling exchange 
                        of double entendres. 

           Suddenly, over Whitfield's shoulder, she sees Hitch looming 
           in the doorway.

           Whitfield notes the tiny change in her eyes, a slight 
           tightening and he turns.  He is not at all surprised or upset 
           to see Hitch. 

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        Speak of the devil.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I'm often mistaken for him.

                                 ALMA
                        Hitch sometimes gets his mail.
           Whitfield offers his hand and Hitchcock shakes it.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        What's this "Psycho" project, 
                        Hitch?  When Alma told me about it, 
                        I ran all over town looking for the 
                        book, couldn't find a single copy.

           Hitch is pleased.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Come along, Whit.  I'm about to try 
                        out the plot on my unsuspecting 
                        guests.

           He pats Whitfield's back, ushering him out.  She goes back to 
           her intensely busy cooking.

           INT. HITCHCOCK LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Hitch holds court with a circle of guests including Whit, 
           Peggy and Doug, Lew and EDIE Wasserman, and the rapt Gossip 
           Columnists. In a nearby chair, a well-dressed DOWAGER.

           As Hitchcock spins his web, he pays special attention to the 
           reactions of his Sealyham terriers who are at his feet.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        ...and as the girl begins 
                        disrobing, we cut to a close-up of 
                        Norman Bates watching her through a 
                        hole he's drilled in the wall for 
                        just such an occasion. 

           Hitch grins as the dogs wag their tails.

                                 DOWAGER
                        If you ask me, this story sounds 
                        sordid and depraved.

           The guests are quietly disturbed at the outrageous conduct of 
           the Dowager, awaiting an outburst from Hitch who eyes the 
           woman with contempt.  

           With the same repugnance she has for the story, the Dowager 
           waves off some blue hors d'oeuvres from a Server.

                                 DOWAGER
                        Get those away.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        What happens next, Hitch?
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        The girl, now wearing a flimsy 
                        robe, decides to return the stolen 
                        money.

           Hitch notes that the dogs look bored. He pats their heads.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
                        Geoffrey and Stanley always tell me 
                        when the plot‚Äôs gone limp.  They 
                        want me to get the girl in the 
                        shower as soon as possible.

           Everyone laughs except the Dowager.

                                 DOWAGER
                        And just whom do you expect to see 
                        this display of carnality, Mr. 
                        Hitchcock?  The reprobates you 
                        might attract are hopefully all 
                        locked away in penitentiaries.  

           The guests are shocked.  The Piano Trio stops playing-- they 
           watch.  Lew rises to Hitch's defense, but Hitchcock hold up 
           his hand to stop him.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Not all people of taste are in 
                        prison, madam...
                             (to his friends)
                        Yet.

           The friends laugh, then stop as the Dowager mutters:

                                 DOWAGER
                        If you ask me, it's contemptuous 
                        and vulgar.

           Hitchcock looks down his nose at her.  The amused guests 
           await a witty comeback, but then:

                                 BUTLER
                        Dinner is served.

           The Dowager is the first to sweep off toward the dining room.  
           The Guests linger with Hitchcock, still in shock.  Only 
           Whitfield looks a little skeptical.  Lew is especially upset.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        Who is that dreadful woman?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I believe she came with Lew.
                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        What?!  No, no.  I know her from 
                        somewhere but...
                             (quietly)
                        If I didn't know she'd passed away, 
                        I'd have sworn she was your mother.

           Hitchcock raises an eyebrow and lumbers toward the dining 
           room.

           INT. GRAND HITCHCOCK DINING ROOM -- (LATER)

           Hitch sits at the head of the table on which stand 
           magnificent centerpieces of BRIGHT BLUE Hyssop flowers. The 
           Dowager and the Wassermans sit next to Hitch.  Lew eyes the 
           Dowager carefully.

           At the other end of the table: Alma, seated next to Whit, his 
           wife, and Peggy.  At a signal from Hitchcock, SERVERS in 
           perfect unison lift the dinner plates.

           On every plate, the Denver SOLE is BRIGHT BLUE! The 
           vegetables and potatoes are also BRIGHT BLUE! As a server 
           pours BLUE SAUCE over Hitch‚Äôs fish --  It is beautiful and 
           Hitch takes pride in the reactions.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        It's all blue!

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Totally original...

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        It's funny...this actually reminds 
                        me of something.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Since I‚Äôm about to embark on such a 
                        unique project, I thought I'd 
                        prepare food that could exist only 
                        in my imagination. 

           Whitfield Cook glances at Alma.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        Who knew he could cook?

           It's said with such charm, he gets a laugh from the table, 
           including Alma, and Hitch is forced to smile along.  

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        I got it.  "A Rebours."  That's the 
                        inspiration....
           People start to eat except the Dowager who is repulsed.

                                 DOWAGER
                        Well, if you ask me--

                                 DOUGLAS
                             (to Whitfield)
                        What's "A Rebours"?

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        A French novel from the 1800's.  
                        You know it, right Hitch?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        No.

           Alma looks at Hitch-- having seen him with the book not long 
           ago.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        This decadent nobleman, bored with 
                        everything, likes to shock people; 
                        has a party, except it's black.  
                        All the food is black.  Black 
                        bread, black olives, caviar...

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I missed that one.

           Douglas gets a laugh.  Whitfield eats.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        Blue is much more pleasant.

                                 DOWAGER
                        Well...If you ask me--

           But she's cut off by Whitfield at the other end of the table, 
           now clearly the center of attention, eclipsing both Hitch and 
           the Dowager.  Whit laughs, trying to swallow his food.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        Wait, wait.  I almost forgot the 
                        best part.  It's actually a funeral 
                        feast, but no one's dead!... He has 
                        it in honor of his own impotence.

           Laughter goes up around the table except for Alma who slowly 
           turns from Whit to look at Hitch at the other end of the 
           table.  Hitch stares back at her-- he isn't laughing either.
           Her expression softens for him-- not in pity, but 
           commiseration.  Everyone's having such a good time, no one 
           sees the moment pass between them.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I definitely missed that one.

           More laughter. 

                                 DOWAGER
                        If you ask me, your perverted taste 
                        in food is as tainted as your taste 
                        in subject matter for your--

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (bellowing)
                        I didn't ask you.  You'll eat what 
                        I serve, you miserable crone, or 
                        I'll break your wretched neck!

           His anger sends a shockwave through the gathering-- every 
           person at the table is suddenly quiet.  The Servers stop in 
           mid-motion.  The dogs watch in stillness-- one whimpers.

           The Dowager looks frightened.  Her eyes well with tears.

           Hitch, realizing he's completely lost it for a second, tries 
           to recover with a wry smile.  Alma comes to his rescue.

                                 ALMA
                        Okay, Hitch, it's time to let them 
                        in on your little prank.

           Hitch pauses then pats the Dowager's hand sheepishly.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Miss Chartwell is here at my 
                        behest.  I hired her through 
                        central casting.  

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        It was all a jest?

           Lew smacks the table.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Son of a bitch!  I knew I 
                        recognized you!  You‚Äôve been in 
                        pictures since the silents.

           The guests laugh, totally surprised.  Peggy, laughing, starts 
           to applaud and everyone else follows. 
           The Dowager stands and gives a very theatrical bow.  She 
           extends her arm, presenting Hitchcock, but he doesn't bow. 

                                 DOWAGER
                        You should do more acting, Mr. 
                        Hitchcock, than just walking 
                        through your films-- I genuinely 
                        thought you were angry!

           The company laughs.  Hitch smiles.  Alma shakes her head.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK‚ÄôS VOICE (V.O.)
                        They think I‚Äôve lost my touch.

           EXT. HITCHCOCK GROUNDS -- DUSK

           Hitch and Lew Wasserman smoke after-dinner cigars as they 
           walk toward the garden.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Who?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        The movie business.  My association 
                        with television has done me in.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                             (laughing)
                        You mean the deal I put together 
                        where Bristol-Meyers pays a hundred 
                        and twenty-nine grand per half hour 
                        episode, and gives complete 
                        ownership to you after the first 
                        run? The association that made you 
                        an incredibly wealthy man? That 
                        association?

           Hitch's curiosity is piqued by the totally out of place bunch 
           of PANSIES in the front of the garden.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I feel like I'm losing control of 
                        everything.....

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Look, Hitch, don‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôre 
                        getting this picture made.  It 
                        might kill both of us, but we're 
                        doing it.
           INT. PARAMOUNT BOARD ROOM -- DAY

           The tight-faced EXECUTIVES in drab suits watch Hitchcock and 
           Lew closely. Hitch‚Äôs silence is tight and angry.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Gentlemen, we‚Äôre about to propose a 
                        restructured deal that ought to 
                        make you very happy, and very rich.
                             (a dramatic beat)
                        Hitch waves his directing fee.

                                 BARNEY BALABAN
                        In exchange for...?

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Sixty percent of the profits from 
                        ‚ÄúPsycho.‚Äù Paramount distributes, we 
                        finance it independently.

                                 BARNEY BALABAN
                        Interesting. But tell us, what 
                        exactly is Paramount distributing? 
                        Is this picture still about a queer 
                        who kills people while wearing his 
                        mother‚Äôs dresses?

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                             (bristling)
                        What this picture is about is the 
                        reputation of Alfred Hitchcock. 
                        Name anyone with a bigger talent or 
                        a better track record.

                                 BARNEY BALABAN
                        No one respects the name Hitchcock 
                        more than Paramount. But even very 
                        smart, talented men sometimes back 
                        the wrong horse.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        With all due respect, Barney, I‚Äôll 
                        try not to gloat when those words 
                        come back to bite you in the ass.

           EXT. UNIVERSAL BACKLOT -- DAY (LATER)

           With a limo purring in the background, Lew leads Hitchcock 
           across the high, wooded hills behind the studio. Spread below 
           them are the barn-like soundstages and the village sets from 
           many a war and Frankenstein movie.
                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        That cocksucker Balaban.  You know 
                        what his family did before they 
                        built those movie palaces?  Ran a 
                        grocery store.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        My father ran a grocery store.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        That's what I'm saying.  He should 
                        have some goddamn empathy.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        If you brought me here thinking you 
                        could dispose of me by pushing me 
                        off the mountain, I assure you -- 
                        I‚Äôll scream all the way down.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        I brought you here to tell you what 
                        you're going to do.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (pause)
                        It's not "The Widow Loves Company?"

                                 LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
                        Within weeks, my agency is buying 
                        Universal. I structured the deal so 
                        that I‚Äôm going to run everything.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        By everything do you mean "Frances 
                        the Mule" and Ma and Pa Kettle? 

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        You don‚Äôt have to tell me that 
                        Universal has been strictly poverty 
                        row.  But that‚Äôs yesterday‚Äôs news. 
                        We‚Äôre going to make multi-picture 
                        deals with the biggest talent.

           Lew turns to his most valuable client.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
                        I want you at Universal, Hitch.

           Hitchcock looks intrigued.
                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        You're going to make ‚ÄúPsycho‚Äù here. 
                        We‚Äôve got the stages-- you‚Äôve 
                        already got your TV crew here. 
                        You'll hire my client James 
                        Cavanaugh as your screenwriter, 
                        you'll bring in ‚ÄúPsycho‚Äù at bare 
                        bones -- less than a million --  
                        we'll let Paramount sweat the 
                        promotion and advertising. Then, 
                        we'll tell them to fuck themselves 
                        as they hand over sixty percent.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I can make this movie for $800,000. 
                        But where do we scare up the money?

           Lew grins.

           EXT. HITCHCOCK POOL (LATER THAT AFTERNOON)

           A contemplative Hitchcock takes in some sun wearing his 
           business suit and tie. He watches as Alma, wearing a navy 
           swimsuit by Jansen, does her afternoon exercise in the pool. 

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Doing laps for the two of us, I 
                        hope, my dear?

           She gets out and towels off.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Is Whit coming by tonight?

                                 ALMA
                        He's writing.  By the way, I'm 
                        disappointed you didn't give his 
                        book a chance.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Is he?

                                 ALMA
                        He knows you.

           She puts down the towel and sits next to him.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Enjoy the pool now. We might not 
                        have it for that much longer.

           Alma looks at him, concerned.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
                        Paramount won‚Äôt make ‚ÄúPsycho.‚Äù
                             (a beat)
                        We‚Äôre going to have to finance the 
                        whole shebang ourselves.

           Silence. Then --

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        You look very serious, Miss 
                        Reville.  That worries me.

                                 ALMA
                        A maniac murders and mutilates at 
                        least two women.  Why do you need 
                        to glorify it on film?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        It's only a movie....I'm an artist; 
                        I have to challenge myself.

                                 ALMA
                        But why this?  Why do you have to 
                        make this one?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (erupting)
                        I have to make this one because 
                        they keep telling me I can't!

           Alma stares at him, seeing he's in pain.  Hitch is 
           embarrassed by his display of emotion.

           She is calm and unruffled.  She smiles slightly.

                                 ALMA
                        Do we have to sell the entire 
                        house, or just the pool?

           He looks at her, deeply gratified by her faith and devotion.

           INT. HITCHCOCK LIVING ROOM -- SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

           We PULL BACK from a title on a manuscript: ‚ÄúPsycho,‚Äù 
           Screenplay by JAMES CAVANAUGH, to find Hitch reading it, in a 
           chair by the fire. He puffs on a cigar.

           His expression changes very little as he closes the script, 
           then tosses it into the fire, frustrated. Cavanaugh‚Äôs byline 
           ignites and quickly turns to ash.
           EXT. PARAMOUNT GROUNDS - DAY

           Hitch walks to his office with Lew.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Cavanaugh was a bad choice, I had a 
                        bad feeling from the get-go, but I 
                        promise you, Joe Stefano is a 
                        perfect fit.  Never wrote a script, 
                        watched a "Playhouse 90," said, "I 
                        can do that," wrote it, sold it 
                        within two weeks.  He has the youth 
                        and vitality you need for this 
                        picture.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        If he's part of that humorless 
                        "Playhouse 90" crowd...I pass.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Do me a favor?  You pass?  Talk to 
                        Stefano before you pass.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - DAY

           Hitchcock checks his watch.  He glowers as he stares at the 
           clock and the empty chair across from his desk.

           In the outer office, brash screenwriter Joseph Stefano rushes 
           in.  He's in his 30's, Italian, with a street-fighting air 
           about him.   Peggy gets up to block his path.

                                 JOSEPH STEFANO
                        Joe Stefano...

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        You're late.

           He walks past her, into Hitchcock's office.  Peggy follows.

                                 JOSEPH STEFANO
                        Sorry about that, the session with 
                        my shrink ran over.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        You're seeing a psychiatrist?  I 
                        thought only directors did that.

                                 JOSEPH STEFANO
                        Oh yeah, several times a week.  
                        Nice to meet you, Mr. Hitchcock.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        What on earth do you talk about 
                        several times a week?

                                 JOSEPH STEFANO
                        Oh, sex, rage, my mother.  The 
                        usual.

           Hitch looks at Peggy, intrigued.  Stefano sits down in a 
           chair across from the great director.  A beat, then --

                                 JOSEPH STEFANO
                        So, "Psycho."  The book needs a 
                        helluva lot of work to be a 
                        Hitchcock picture.  I was hoping 
                        for Cary Grant, spies, sex, 
                        sophisticated dialogue.  I don't 
                        want to see a movie about a creepy 
                        old man, and I sure as hell don't 
                        want to write one.

           Hitchcock is amused and finds Stefano refreshing.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I agree.  Tony Perkins owes 
                        Paramount a picture and he's 
                        already agreed to do the movie 
                        without seeing the script.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. MARY HOGAN'S BAR - 1954 - EVENING

           Eddie runs into IRENE HILL, 40's, who is carrying a few 
           groceries.

                                 IRENE HILL
                        Eddie, I heard about your mother.  
                        I'm so sorry.  Whenever you want to 
                        come up for a home-cooked meal...

                                 EDDIE
                        Well...thanks, Mrs. Hill.

                                 IRENE HILL
                        Irene.

           She physically reminds him of his mother and he's titillated.  
           He smiles awkwardly, lowers his head and goes in the bar.
           INT. MARY HOGAN'S BAR - NIGHT(LATER)

           It is a grim, empty, small town bar.  Eddie, with a men's 
           pulp magazine, is trying to talk to large-framed, middle-aged 
           owner Mary Hogan. 

                                 EDDIE
                        I bet you didn't know when they 
                        bury someone in winter up here 
                        they, can't dig very deep cause the 
                        ground's frozen.

           THREE MANLY MEN, including middle-aged FRANK WORDEN, in 
           hunting clothes with rifles poke fun of Eddie amongst 
           themselves.  Eddie tries to ignore them.

                                 EDDIE
                        They pour concrete over the coffin 
                        so the dogs can't get to 'em.

                                 MARY HOGAN
                             (uncomfortable)
                        I didn't know that, Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                        Only the one's buried in winter.  
                        Like my mother.

                                 FRANK WORDEN
                        Got to work on that pick-up line, 
                        Romeo.  See you tomorrow, Mary...

           Eddie shrugs.  The men laugh on their way out at him.

                                 EDDIE
                        Hey...ah...Mary, I've been thinking 
                        of something.

                                 MARY HOGAN
                        Can't it wait?  I'm closing up.

                                 EDDIE
                        Maybe we could go ice skating 
                        sometime.

                                 MARY HOGAN
                             (surprised)
                        I can't skate.

                                 EDDIE
                        Neither can I...so I thought we 
                        could hold on to each other so we 
                        don't fall.
           Mary forces a laugh.

                                 EDDIE
                        I sent away for this pamphlet, "How 
                        to talk to Women."

           She is unsettled as he looks her in the eye and smiles.

                                 MARY HOGAN
                        You should get your money back.

                                 EDDIE
                        That's the kind of thing my mother 
                        would say...

                                 MARY HOGAN
                        Seriously...I need to be getting 
                        home or I'll--

           Eddie reaches in his pocket, takes out a small .22 handgun, 
           and shoots.  Mary falls in a heap next to the bar.

           Eddie, distraught, takes a deep breath and goes to her.  He 
           starts to drag the hulking Mary by the ankles toward the 
           door.  Eddie FREEZES as Tony Perkins enters, dressed in 
           clothes identical to Eddie's!

                                 TONY PERKINS
                        Sorry...this is awkward, but, I'm 
                        replacing you.  Mr. Hitchcock wants 
                        to go younger.

           Eddie is stunned.  As Perkins drags the murder victim out of 
           the bar by the ankles, we

                        Do you have a copy of the book?

           Peggy looks over to a storage closet.  There are thousands of 
           copies of the book stacked floor to ceiling, inside and out.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Hitch hovers expectantly as Alma goes over Stefano's pages.  
           Alma takes out a pencil and makes a note on a page-- one of 
           many.  Hitch winces and looks concerned. 

           She goes back to reading with great concentration.  She 
           smiles at something in the pages; this makes Hitchcock smile.  
           She raises an eyebrow; Hitch follows suit.

           She puts the pages down and nods slowly.

                                 ALMA
                        Hire him.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - DAY

           Joe is waiting, a little more nervously.  This time he stands 
           when Hitchcock enters.  Peggy, nearby, notices the new 
           humility to Joe's demeanor.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Madame Hitchcock has approved.  
                        Let's get to work.

           He walks him toward the typewriter, but Stefano stops.

                                 JOSEPH STEFANO
                        I wanted to tell you, I went to a 
                        screening of "Vertigo" last night.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Where?

                                 JOSEPH STEFANO
                        Here.  Peggy arranged it.

           Hitch exchanges a look with Peggy.  She's satisfied.

                                 JOSEPH STEFANO
                        I know it didn't do well, and the 
                        critics hated it...but I think it's 
                        a beautiful picture.  It's an honor 
                        to work with a true artist, Mr. 
                        Hitchcock.
           After a pause:

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        It's Hitch.

           stern woman with her hair tied back.  She sits with two 
           middle-aged MEN, in chairs in front of a long table.  
           Hitchcock is seated across from them, his script closed in 
           his lap.  He looks annoyed as pages are frantically turned.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I assure you, all of my murders are 
                        models of taste and discretion.

                        Of course, it's only "suggested."

                        Is there nudity in this scene, page 
                        forty?

           The members race to page forty.  Hitchcock sighs and turns to 
           the page in his script.  He glances at it.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        No.

                        and feels the water caress every 
                        inch of her body."

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        She's an American woman in the 
                        bath.  She can't possibly be nude.  
                        She's wearing a shower cap.

                                 JUNE
                        You need to cut this scene.
           He looks at her, seething.  She makes a note on the sheet.

                                 JUNE
                        Or, we'd accept a shot from outside 
                        the frosted glass of the bathroom 
                        window, Marion in silhouette above 
                        the shoulders, and the suggestive 
                        sound of the shower.

           Hitch stares at her in disbelief.  She returns to the script.

                        later found by the boyfriend, it's 
                        completely necessary.

                        No American movie has ever found it 
                        "necessary" to show a...toilet.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Why?

                                 JUNE
                        It isn't something people need to 
                        see.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        What if I have it take place in 
                        France and use a bidet?

           The Other Censor laughs, but stops with a glare from June.  
           She doesn't find Hitch funny and looks at him with contempt.

                                 JUNE
                        Do you find this process amusing?  
                        If you are denied a seal from this 
                        office, and we're certainly heading 
                        in that direction, your movie will 
                        not be released in this country.  I 
                        don't think you'll be laughing 
                        then, will you, Mr. Hitchcock?

           Hitch looks ready to burst into a tirade, and the other board 
           members are frightened that he will, but he holds his tongue.

           She glares at him for another moment, and he waits, tight-
           lipped.  She returns her attention to the script.
                                 JUNE

           EXT. HITCHCOCK GARDEN -- DAY

           Alma, in classic gardening attire, is on her knees 
           deadheading roses. Hitch, in blue serge shorts with his shirt 
           sleeves rolled up, pulls weeds from around his beloved 
           dahlias and tosses them in a basket. Their Sealyham terriers 
           frolic as Peggy, in sunglasses, lounges in a chair in the 
           sun, looking through a notebook.

                        is a wanton hussy.

                        That's what Hitch wants.

           He looks sharply at Alma, but she concentrates on her 
           gardening and he goes back to his weeding.

                        Janet Leigh?
           Hitch, intrigued, takes notice again of the small group of 
           pansies.  He mindlessly yanks them up by the roots and tosses 
           them in the basket with the other weeds.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Very colorful weeds...

           Alma looks at Hitch to see if he's done this on purpose but 
           he seems oblivious.  She glances at the torn flowers in the 
           basket.  She goes back to her roses.

                                 PEGGY
                        She is on the cover of every 
                        magazine these days...

                        And she has the best figure in 
                        town. 

           Alma SNIPS a faded American Beauty and tosses it into the 
           basket next to the mangled pansies.

           EXT. CHASEN‚ÄôS -- DAY

           Hitchcock leads JANET LEIGH in by the arm. Her knockout 
           figure is accentuated by a simple cashmere sweater and skirt. 
           Alma is two steps behind carrying a large portfolio.

           He gallantly opens the door for her, but enters ahead of 
           Alma. He reaches back, still holding the door open for her. 
           She gives him a droll look.

           INT. CHASEN‚ÄôS -- DAY (LATER)

           Hitch is doting on Janet, and Alma takes it in.  Hitchcock 
           whispers something ribald in Janet‚Äôs ear, she laughs.

                                 JANET LEIGH 
                        You know, I‚Äôve been so immersed in 
                        preparing to play Marion that I‚Äôd 
                        almost forgotten how to laugh.

                        How have you prepared?

           Janet hesitates, then gets a small DIARY out of her purse.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        I‚Äôve written a complete history for 
                        her... it seems silly, but it helps 
                        me.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Tell us one of her deepest secrets.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        She leads a double life.  For 
                        instance, when she works at the 
                        Lowery office, she wears Tweed 
                        perfume. But, whenever she and Sam 
                        are together, she becomes more 
                        sensual, almost reckless, and 
                        breaks out her one expensive bottle 
                        of perfume.

           He looks at her quizzically.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        "My Sin" by Lanvin.

           Impressed, Hitch slides closer to look at the diary, turning 
           his back on Alma and carelessly blocking her view.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        You‚Äôre a model of preparation. Now 
                        if only I could afford you...

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        I told my agent the money doesn‚Äôt 
                        matter. I‚Äôd do anything for the 
                        privilege of working for Alfred 
                        Hitchcock.

           Hitch leans back with satisfaction.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        But I have to be honest -- I do 
                        have some concerns about the shower 
                        sequence. 

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        You and the MPAA.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        It‚Äôs just...I‚Äôm a mother, and my 
                        breasts...well, they‚Äôre too large.

                                 ALMA
                        I don‚Äôt even think Hitch noticed.

           Alma abruptly UNZIPS the portfolio for Hitch.  He takes it 
           and shows Janet the shower sequence storyboards by Saul Bass.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK 
                        We will shoot quick bits of film 
                        from various angles to suggest the 
                        nudity and violence.

           Janet is bowled over by the boards.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        Such detail. It‚Äôs chilling even on 
                        paper.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        And having you in the shower will 
                        make it all the more -- how shall I 
                        say it? Tit-illating.

           Janet laughs at his schoolboy delivery. Alma rises with 
           dignity.

                                 ALMA
                        Pardon me...

           We follow Alma through the crowded restaurant as she heads to 
           the ladies‚Äô lounge. 

           INT. LADIES' ROOM

           Alma looks in the mirror.  Not pleased with her reflection, 
           she tries pulling back her cheeks.

           She sees another reflection in a mirror behind her and turns, 
           curious.

           FULL LENGTH MIRROR

           Alma is transformed into a Hitchcock blonde.  She's in a 
           beautiful Edith Head gown, her skin is velvet perfection, her 
           hair blonde and impeccable.  

           Alma stares at the technicolor creature she's become, and 
           laughs sardonically at her flight of fancy. 

                                 ALMA
                        Oh, come off it, old girl.

           GLORIA STEWART, 40's, Jimmy Stewart's wife, snaps Alma out of 
           her reverie, joining her at the sink, putting on lipstick.

                                 GLORIA STEWART
                        Alma, you look a little pale.
                                 ALMA
                        How does Jimmy like working with 
                        Preminger?

                                 GLORIA STEWART
                        I'm sure he'd rather be working 
                        with Hitch....but not on that God 
                        awful "Psycho."  Why are you 
                        letting him do something so vulgar?  
                        It's all anyone's talking about.  
                        You can't possibly approve.

           Alma bristles behind a tight smile.

                                 ALMA
                        Don't get yourself upset, Gloria.  
                        It's only a movie.

           Alma walks out on Gloria.  Gloria hesitates a moment, then 
           returns to applying her lipstick.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

           Alma, calm and cool, is chopping food deftly.  Hitchcock 
           enters, a drink in his hand.  Alma seems distant.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Coming upstairs?

                                 ALMA
                        Soon as I'm finished...

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Did you get a chance to look at 
                        Joe's new draft?

           His eyes drift to what she's preparing.

                                 ALMA
                        I marked it for revisions.  I wrote 
                        a few scenes to replace the one's I 
                        cut-- it's next to your bed.  It's 
                        getting there.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (stunned)
                        Is that your...fois gras?

                                 ALMA
                        I've really had a hankering.
           She tastes some off her index finger.  She gets a cracker and 
           spreads some on, eating it.  It's like eating in front of a 
           dog and she turns away.

                                 ALMA
                        If you hadn't eaten so much at 
                        Chasen's I might have given you a 
                        taste.

           He moves his hand toward the bowl, but she draws it away.  
           His face tightens.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (dryly)
                        All men are potential murderers.

                                 BERNICE WORDEN (V.O.)
                        Interested in buying a gun, Eddie?

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. WORDEN'S HARDWARE STORE - DAY

           From EDDIE'S POV: A shaky hand loads a .22 shell into a 
           rifle.  The price tag is dangling from it.

                                 EDDIE (O.S.)
                        Not really, Bernice.

           The rifle rises and Bernice Worden is looking down the 
           barrel, behind the counter of her small time hardware store.  
           Eddie fires, and Bernice collapses in a heap.

           INT. EDDIE GEIN'S HOUSE - DAY

           From the otherwise empty living room, we hear clunking, then 
           move over to catch a glimpse of Eddie, distraught, as he 
           drags Bernice Worden's body, feet-first up the stairs.  The 
           clunking is from her head on the steps, which is wrapped in 
           her dress.

           BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Eddie approaches the shower curtain, then throws it open 
           (like Bates does in the motel).  He pushes Bernice into the 
           tub.  He pulls the dress off her head and drops it on the 
           floor.  He turns on the water in the tub and leaves the room.

           After a moment Bernice's fingers CLUTCH suddenly to the end 
           of the tub!
           STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Eddie lumbers up the stairs with knives rolled in canvas.

           BATHROOM

           Eddie walks in and stops.  His jaw falls.  Bernice is gone!   
           The water mixes with her blood as it goes down the drain.

           UPSTAIRS LANDING

           It's quiet, then Eddie bursts out of the bathroom.  He stops 
           and slowly turns, looking for his missing victim.

                                 EDDIE GEIN
                        Bernice?  Bernice...I'm sorry....

           He sees a wet footprint at the top of the stairs.  He 
           agonizes before he takes out one of his knives, trying to see 
           where she might be hiding down in the living room.

           HIS FEET

           As he's about to take the first step, a hand thrusts out of 
           the shadows and grabs one of his ankles.

           EDDIE  

           He crashes about halfway down the stairs, lands face down in 
           an awkward position and is motionless.

           AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS

           Bernice Worden crawls out of her hiding place in the shadows, 
           and looks down the stairs at her motionless captor.

           She struggles to her feet.  She has a bullet wound at the 
           base of her skull-- but the bleeding has stopped, and it is 
           mostly covered by her hair.  She is in her bra and girdle.

           The only way out is past Eddie's motionless body on the 
           stairs.  She gathers her courage, then starts down.

           FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS

           Bernice makes it several steps past Eddie when he suddenly 
           springs up with the knife and leaps on her back!

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:
           INT. HITCHCOCK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hitchcock bolts upright in bed, disoriented, face covered in 
           sweat, breathing heavily.  Alma, in her bed, turns on the 
           light.

                                 ALMA
                        You okay?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Am I making a mistake?

                                 ALMA
                        Bad dream?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Answer me...

                                 ALMA
                        Hitch...

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Am I making a mistake?

           Alma doesn't say anything but doesn't look guilty about her 
           silence.  It greatly increases Hitchcock's anxiety.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        It's going to turn into Vertigo.

                                 ALMA
                        Let's hope so. 

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I read the reviews.  I heard what 
                        they said to my face.  I 
                        eavesdropped on what they whispered 
                        behind my back.  The worst--I see 
                        how they look at me.  

           He whips the blankets off the bed and throws his legs over 
           the side of the bed.  Alma is calm.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I can't pull it off...Not this 
                        time.  I don't know why I couldn't 
                        just stop when everyone told me to. 
                        I can't do this one.

           Alma gets out of her bed, gathers his blankets and puts them 
           back on his bed.  She sits next to him and pats the 
           perspiration from his head. 
                                 ALMA
                        Tomorrow's the first day of the 
                        shoot.  It's just nerves.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        The art department budget's spent; 
                        and costumes of course.... Between 
                        that, the second unit material we 
                        already shot, the salaries I'll 
                        have to pay out-- If I cancel, 
                        we'll be down less than a quarter 
                        of a million.

                                 ALMA
                        Hitchy...you're not fooling me.  
                        You have no intention of stopping. 

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Even with all the script work you 
                        did....I know you've never believed 
                        in the project.

           Alma stares at him, waiting for his eyes to meet hers.

                                 ALMA
                        You believe in it.  And I believe 
                        in you.

           He is comforted.  She takes his hand.  He gives it a squeeze 
           and nods his thanks to her.  She puts him back in bed and 
           covers him.  She goes back to her bed.  Hitchcock settles 
           back.

                                 ALMA
                        Once you get the first take under 
                        your belt you'll be fine.  And I'll 
                        be right there at your side...

           She turns off the light.  There is silence for a few moments.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        If it's all right, I don't want you 
                        to come tomorrow.

           Silence again.  Alma is stunned.  Hitch is in his bed, 
           looking tormented at the ceiling.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        For a few days, until we're up and 
                        running.  I need to tackle this on 
                        my own.

           He looks over.  He can't see her face in the dark.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        You understand?

           A few moments of silence.

                                 ALMA
                        Of course I do.  Whatever you want.

           Though she's unconvincing, Hitch is satisfied.  He takes a 
           deep breath and closes his eyes to go back to sleep.

           EXT. HITCHCOCK'S CAR - TRAVELLING - MORNING

           Alma drives Hitch to Universal.  The tension in the car is 
           hard to detect, but they both look ahead.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        What will you be doing today?

           She smiles slightly and it unnerves him a little.

           Alma pulls in through the gate and to a stop.  The car idles.

                                 ALMA
                        I'll call Peggy this afternoon to 
                        make sure you stuck to your diet.

           Hitch waits for more but Alma stares complacently ahead.  He 
           gets out of the car.  Alma turns the car around.

           She glances in the mirror and sees him still standing there, 
           watching the car until it's out of sight.

           EXT. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS - 1959

           Quick images of the "PSYCHO" set in lockdown.  Production 
           starts today and the whole studio is rabid with curiosity.  A 
           sign posted on a soundstage reads, "PRODUCTION 9401.  
           ABSOLUTELY NO VISITORS!"   It only makes passersby-- 
           TOURISTS, REPORTERS, AND WORKERS-- more curious.

           A man is being escorted out of the stage by a GUARD.

                                 MAN
                        Come on....What's the big secret?

                                 GUARD
                        Orders of Mr. Hitchcock.
           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           VERA MILES, head buried in the shooting script, in her frumpy 
           wardrobe, walks toward Hitchcock who is getting into his 
           director's chair.

                                 VERA MILES
                        "Thanks" for the wardrobe.  You 
                        really hate me, don't you?

           Hitchcock stares blankly ahead.

                                 VERA MILES
                        Why don't I have the last ten pages 
                        of the script?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        No one does.

                                 JOSEPH STEFANO
                        Except me.

           Vera looks up.  She's surprised to see Hitch surrounded by 
           his CREW which is filled with dozens of men dressed in suits 
           and black ties, just like the director.  Stefano stands 
           smugly on one side of Hitch, and Lew stands on the other.  
           There is an air of formality on the set. 

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        You're just in time for the oath, 
                        Vera.

                                 VERA MILES
                        The what?

           Hitch raises his right hand, and the crew follows his lead.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I give my solemn promise...

                                 CREW
                        I give my solemn promise...

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Not to divulge one word of the 
                        story...

                                 CREW
                        Not to divulge one word of the 
                        story.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        To friends, relatives, trade 
                        reporters or columnists.

                                 CREW
                        To friends, relatives, trade 
                        reporters and columnists.

           Hitchcock nods his approval, and the Crew hops to it.  
           Stefano eyes the dumbfounded Vera with suspicion, and edges 
           closer to Hitch.  

                                 JOSEPH STEFANO
                             (quietly)
                        She didn't take the oath.

           Annoyed, Vera turns and walks off.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Vera...?

                                 VERA MILES
                        I don't think so, Hitch.

           He smiles, enjoying her spirit.  He turns and watches the 
           crew working on his setup.  He looks a little paranoid-- 
           everywhere he looks, people seem to be taking their time.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        It doesn't take two of them to 
                        carry that light stand...

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        You okay, Hitch?  You're soaked.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        The oranges make me perspire.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        A little different watching them 
                        work when you're writing the 
                        checks.

           Lew sees the chair that says "Alma Reville" is empty.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        What's keeping Alma?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        She's not coming.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        You're kidding me.  Why?
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Nerves.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Alma?!

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S DEN - DAY

           Alma's finger turns the dial (meant to resemble the dial on a 
           phone) on an address file which sits atop Whitfield Cook's 
           manuscript.  It makes the lid of the file pop open to the 
           letter "C."   She unclips her earring and dials the phone.

           We can hear it RINGING THROUGH THE RECEIVER.  It rings and 
           rings and finally she hangs up.  She slowly shakes her head 
           and clips her earring back on.

           She closes the address book and puts it back.

           She walks over to her typewriter with a handful of PSYCHO 
           scene pages when the PHONE, looming large in the foreground, 
           starts to ring.

           Alma freezes.  She lets it ring-- when it seems like she 
           won't pick it up at all, she suddenly snatches it up, deftly 
           unclipping her earring.

                                 ALMA
                        Whit?

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Hitchcock stands next to the catering table, is holding the 
           phone, and he tries not to look surprised.

                                 ALMA (OVER PHONE)
                        Whit, is that you?

           Hitch slips his finger over the button of the phone and 
           quietly puts it back on the cradle.  His eyes drift to the 
           magnificent array of puff pastries as he stands thinking.

           Peggy walks over with a clipboard.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        They're ready, Hitch.

           She sees his grim expression.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        You okay?

           He raises his chin and walks imperiously past her.
           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - CAR SCENE - DAY(LATER)

           Hitchcock, unsettled by Alma's call, stares intently through 
           heavy lids.  We only see him, not what he's directing.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Maybe you should turn around and go 
                        home, pretend it never happened... 
                        but what's waiting there?  You 
                        can't go back.  It's too late.  
                        You've dug your own grave, haven't 
                        you, dear?...

           As he continues, we pull back and see:

           THE REARVIEW DRIVING SET

           Janet is in the driver seat of a partial car, which is rocked 
           by stage hands.  The camera and Hitchcock are right in front 
           of her.  Behind her, moving roads are projected and a half a 
           dozen people are there to make sure it's right.

           Electricians, off to the side, turn mounted headlights on a 
           board so the light drags across her worried face.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (continued)
                        Surely you'll lose the man you 
                        love....

           The REAR SCREEN projection film breaks and a frame burns.  
           Technicians yell and hustle around.  Hitch look frustrated.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Cut.

           EXT. HITCHCOCK GARDEN - DAY

           Alma works in the garden.  She hears a car approach and then 
           a horn.  She turns with a smile-- but it is only a TEENAGE 
           BOY in a car, hitting on TWO TEENAGE GIRLS on the sidewalk.

                                 TONY PERKINS (PRE-LAP)
                        I want to thank you for this 
                        opportunity, Mr. Hitchcock.

           INT. NORMAN‚ÄôS PARLOR SET -- DAY 

           Tony stands with Hitchcock.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        It's just Hitch, Tony.  Hold the 
                        cock.
           Tony is amused but disarmed.  But Janet approaches and 
           Hitchcock smoothly segues into an introduction. 

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK (PRE-LAP)
                        Tony, Janet. Janet, Tony.

           To Tony‚Äôs surprise, Janet gives him an introductory kiss.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        I love that Hit Parade song of 
                        your‚Äôs, Tony. ‚ÄúMoonlight Swim‚Äù? I 
                        sing it to my two daughters as a 
                        lullaby all the time.

                                 TONY PERKINS
                             (a little pained)
                        That‚Äôs so sweet of you. 

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Look at you two. America‚Äôs favorite 
                        boy and girl next door....

                                 TONY PERKINS
                        And we're about to move to a whole 
                        new neighborhood. 

           Hitch gently moves the two in front of a painting used to 
           cover the peephole in the scene, a picture of a woman being 
           raped by two men, SUSANNAH AND THE ELDERS, while others 
           watch. 

                                 TONY PERKINS
                        "Susannah and the Elders," isn't 
                        it?

           Hitch is a little annoyed that Tony knows the painting.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        You can know that, but your 
                        character cannot.

                                 TONY PERKINS
                             (to Janet)
                        The elders spy on Susannah bathing, 
                        then they gang rape her....It's a 
                        story from the bible.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        I must have missed that week of 
                        Sunday school.

                                 TONY PERKINS
                        Now, why am I watching her undress?
                                 JANET LEIGH
                             (playfully)
                        I feel like I should take offense 
                        at that.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        It‚Äôs really about watching your own 
                        mother.  Perhaps Norman secretly 
                        watched his mother preparing for 
                        her bath each night when he was a 
                        boy. I remember my childhood home 
                        had a small transom over the door 
                        to the bath one could access with a 
                        chair if one was quiet.

           Janet seems a little puzzled.

                                 TONY PERKINS
                        So, I‚Äôm not seeing...Marion?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Of course you‚Äôre seeing her, but 
                        the first glimpse any boy gets of a 
                        nude woman is of his mother. By 
                        seeing this woman in her place, in 
                        a way you‚Äôre betraying that sacred 
                        trust.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        The spying...does it excite him to 
                        the point where what he really 
                        wants to do is rape Marion?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        No.  He's impotent.  But he has a 
                        large...knife.

           The moment lays there for a beat, then--

                                 TONY PERKINS
                        Why is there a gaping hole on this 
                        side and then a tiny hole.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        You want to be able to see through 
                        the hole at the greatest possible 
                        angle in case she walks out of 
                        view...If your eye is two inches 
                        further back, the angle would be 
                        cut down.  Try it.

           Tony presses his face to the hole.  We see what's on the 
           other side-- just stage hands moving flats around.
                                 TONY PERKINS
                        God...you really research these 
                        things, don't you?...

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (a beat)
                        Yes.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S DEN - DAY

           Hitchcock walks in and looks around carefully, as if he's 
           sure he's being watched.  At the typewriter, there are pages 
           of the final Psycho sequence that Alma is rewriting.  He 
           looks pleased at this.

           Not so pleased is he with Alma's earring still next to the 
           phone directory and Whit's manuscript.  

           Hitchcock HEARS the front door open and shut-- like a 
           Hitchcock movie,it makes him move faster.  He leans over the 
           desk and opens a file drawer.  From the back of the drawer he 
           removes a stack of files revealing a hidden file laying flat 
           beneath them.

                                 ALMA (O.S.)
                        Hitch?

           HITCHCOCK HOUSE

           Alma has a couple of bags of groceries; oranges stick out the 
           top of one of the bags.  It becomes another mini-suspense 
           moment-- Hitch doesn't answer her.  She knows he's home but 
           isn't sure where or why he isn't answering.

           She hears some RUSTLING in the den and is surprised.  We 
           follow her to the kitchen; she puts the bags down then, still 
           in Hitchcock movie style, moves cautiously toward the den.

           She hears more rustling.  She hesitates outside the partially 
           closed door, listening.  When she finally opens the door, 
           Hitch is standing there, surreptitiously blocking the door.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Was there a line at the market?

                                 ALMA
                        No.  Actually, I'm back sooner than 
                        I expected.

           He nods and walks past her, out of the room.  She is about to 
           leave when she sees the CORNER OF A MANILLA FOLDER that 
           caught in the file drawer when it was closed.
           It's sitting there in front of her, such an obvious "clue."  
           She thinks about it but doesn't approach.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK (O.S.)
                        Cocktail?

           Alma turns, leaving the den and the "clue" untouched.

                                 ALMA
                        No, and you shouldn't either.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           In the dark, both Hitchcock and Alma, in their separate beds, 
           are staring sleeplessly at the ceiling.  There is friction 
           between them, even though it sounds very low key:

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Maybe you'll come to the set 
                        tomorrow?

                                 ALMA
                        I'll see how my day shapes up.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        What did you do with yourself 
                        today?

                                 ALMA
                        I puttered around the garden.

           There is a pause.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Did you talk to Whit?

           Alma's radar activates with the question.

                                 ALMA
                        I meant to, but I never got the 
                        chance.
                             (pause)
                        What made you ask?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        On the set today with that hollow 
                        tree John Gavin.  I don't know 
                        which will be more horrifying.  The 
                        shower scene, or his love scene. 

           Alma laughs a little.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        It made me think, he's not even as 
                        attractive as my good friend, 
                        Whitfield Cook; nor as suave, 
                        certainly not as intelligent.

                                 ALMA
                        You should tell Whit.  He'd be 
                        flattered.

           He arches an eyebrow.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I was too dismissive about his new 
                        book.  Maybe he and Elizabeth can 
                        come over this weekend and he could 
                        walk me through it.

           She ruminates.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Lovely woman, Elizabeth.

                                 ALMA
                        When you look like Cary Grant you 
                        get the beautiful blonde.  You 
                        should know that-- it happens in 
                        all your movies. 

           Hitch purses his lips.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S CAR - TRAVELLING - MORNING

           Alma drives Hitchcock.  She stops the car at Universal and 
           hands him his lunch pail.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        This would be as good a day as any 
                        for you to come on set.

                                 ALMA
                        No, but I thought I'd stop in on 
                        Peggy.

           Hitchcock hesitates then gets out of the car.  Alma pulls 
           around and parks.

           INT. JANET LEIGH'S DRESSING ROOM

           Vera Miles is sitting with Janet Leigh who is having shoes 
           tried on her by COSTUMER RITA RIGGS.
                                 JANET LEIGH
                        But I already told him I wouldn't 
                        do it--

                                 VERA MILES
                        He makes people change into what he 
                        wants.  That's his style.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        Vera...no, no....

                                 VERA MILES
                        He is the Jimmy Stewart part in 
                        Vertigo...

           Janet is about to say something but Vera holds up her hand.

           On the wall through the open door, outside the room, they see 
           ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S DISTINCT SHADOW PROFILE creep closer.

           The women look at each other.

           The shadow lingers then recedes.  It is like a creepy ghost 
           story, and Vera doesn't make it easier for Janet, as she does 
           a sing-song whisper like a campfire ghost story:

                                 VERA MILES
                        He's always watching you.

           Janet is about to disagree, but she's STARTLED, jumping a 
           little, as a voice booms from offstage:

                                 ASSISTANT DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Mrs. Leigh, on the set in five...

           Janet laughs at herself.  Vera and the Rita laugh along with 
           her.

           INT. HITCHCOCK UNIVERSAL OFFICE

           Alma strides in to find Peggy puzzling over a wall chart 
           shooting schedule.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        Hitch wants to shave another day 
                        off the schedule.

                                 ALMA
                        Make him shoot an extra hour on 
                        your last three days and eliminate 
                        the wrap party.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALMA (CONT'D)
                        Hitch has a miserable time at those 
                        parties and that way, he won't be 
                        tempted by cake and champagne.

           Peggy, excited, changes the chart.

                                 ALMA
                        That just saved forty thousand 
                        dollars.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                             (quietly)
                        Why haven't you been around?  Is 
                        everything okay?

                                 ALMA
                        You know what it's like.
                             (handing over pages)
                        Here's my rewrite of the big reveal 
                        at the end.

           Peggy glances over the pages.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        If you ask me the credits ought to 
                        read "Screenplay by Joseph Stefano 
                        and Alma Reville."  

           Alma takes a beat.

                                 ALMA
                        Nonsense. 

           Alma walks out.

           INT. BATES MOTEL - BATHROOM SET - MORNING

           Hitchcock sits in his director's chair, smoking a big cigar.   
           On one side is Saul Bass and his story boards.  Sitting next 
           to him on the other side, legs crossed, is a woman, NAKED, 
           who looks like Janet-- the NAKED STAND-IN.  She casually 
           leafs through a magazine, not TRYING to conceal anything.

           The Crew completely ignores the Stand-in.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Napa Valley...is your family in the 
                        wine business?...

           Janet Leigh walks over in a robe, shocked that the stand-in 
           is completely bare and flaunting it.  Hitchcock, oblivious to 
           the nudity but enthralled by his wine conversation, ignores 
           Janet.  Janet looks at the revised storyboards and is upset.
                                 STAND-IN
                        Not my parents, but my Uncle Carlo, 
                        tests the soil for a few vineyards.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Which ones...

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        Hitch...you changed the 
                        storyboards...

                                 STAND-IN
                        Bogle, Mumm--

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        We discussed this already...I won't 
                        take off my clothes.

           Hitchcock looks at Saul and Janet for a few beats, then turns 
           to the Stand-in, more interested in wine.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Marked improvement since fifty-
                        four.  Is it the soil?

                                 STAND-IN
                        It's a lot of things...the 
                        rainfall...pollution...

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        I can't be nude.

                                 SAUL BASS
                        We have to have those shots, 
                        they're key--

           The Stand-in returns to her magazine.  Hitch turns to Janet 
           and takes her hand, giving her his full attention.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        What Mr. Bass means is those panels 
                        represent less than a blink of an 
                        eye in screen time.  And your stand-
                        in will take on whatever you can't.

           Janet is a little taken aback by the idea of a Stand-in.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (to Saul)
                        Add a shot of the drain, too, with 
                        her blood circling down.

           Thinking, Janet walks off.
           INT. HITCHCOCK'S CAR - TRAVELLING - MORNING

           Alma drives up to her house.  She looks behind her, acting as 
           if she thinks she's being followed.  She shakes her head at 
           having such paranoid thoughts.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Alma walks in, looks around, then makes a beeline for the 
           den.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S DEN - CONTINUOUS

           The file that was left poking out of the file drawer looms in 
           the foreground as Alma enters.  She thinks about it, then 
           can't resist.

           She opens the drawer and sees the sloppily placed folder.  It 
           is stuffed with 8x10's.

           She puts the file on the desk and opens it.

           Inside are pictures of BLONDES, spanning over thirty-years.  
           Some of them are actresses we would know from various 
           Hitchcock movies.  Many are actresses we've never seen-- long-
           since-failed and forgotten starlets.  Each one is posed in a 
           similar fashion and wears the same gown.

           We move in on Alma's eyes.  Each photo gets turned over a 
           little more roughly than the last.  It is hard to say if the 
           anger is coming from seeing the photos, or the thought that 
           he left them so purposely for her to find.

           She puts the photos back in the folder.  She grabs the phone 
           and dials.  We move around to the back of her head as she 
           waits for the answer.  She sounds like her normal self.

                                 ALMA
                        Whit?...It's Alma.  I need someone 
                        who knows how to listen.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

           A view of the coast and the snaking road.  We find Whitfield 
           Cook's Mercedes, top down.  Alma, wearing a kerchief on her 
           head and white-rimmed sunglasses, throws back her head, 
           laughing.  Whitfield, in true Hitchcock male star style, has 
           the perfect amount of wind blowing through his hair, and a 
           suave, detached coolness.  They both nearly have to yell to 
           be heard over the wind.
                                 ALMA
                        He's just so involved in this 
                        movie, I think it affects his 
                        nature.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        He's like any great artist...Hard 
                        to live with but worth the effort.

           They drive and she enjoys the scenery.

                                 ALMA
                        I'm only ever in a car when I'm 
                        driving Hitch.  It's nice not to 
                        have to take care of someone, even 
                        if it's just for an hour.
                             (beat)
                        You haven't told me where we're 
                        going?

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        You'll see....

           Light reflected from the dailies flickers on Hitchcock's 
           mortified face.   Hitchcock is rubbing his eyes when Lew 
           comes into the room, and moves down the row toward him.  
           Peggy is next to him making notes.

           Lew looks around-- the only other person in the room is 
           Hitch's cameraman.  He does not look happy either.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Where are the Paramount execs?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I forbade them to come.

           Lew is a little surprised, then shrugs.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Fuck 'em, right?  It's your 
                        picture, not the studio's.

           Lew looks from Hitch's face, to the screen, back to Hitch.  
           Lew looks at Peggy who signals that Hitch is taking it badly.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        There were holiday decorations on 
                        the streets of Phoenix for the rear 
                        screens, and no money to reshoot.
                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                             (beat)
                        Christmas pictures always do well.

           Hitchcock isn't amused.

           EXT. UNIVERSAL OFFICE - DAY(LATER)

           Hitchcock, looking drained, taps his shoe impatiently, 
           waiting to be picked up.  A car pulls up and costumer Rita 
           Riggs rolls down a window.

                                 RITA RIGGS
                        Need a ride?

           Hitchcock looks at the car with alarm -- it is a Volkswagen 
           Beetle.  Hitch ponders, then with great effort inches his 
           massive frame into the car.  The Beetle sags noticeably.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY (LATER)

           The car continues to comically sag.

                                 RITA RIGGS (PRE-LAP)
                        You all right, Mr. Hitchcock?

           INT. VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Adolf Hitler drew the design for 
                        this car on Ferdinand Porsche's 
                        cocktail napkin in a Berlin 
                        beergarden.

           Hitchcock is uncomfortable, but oddly thrilled that 
           PASSENGERS in passing cars do doubletakes as they see the 
           esteemed director in the sagging Beetle.

           Hitchcock tries to move but is wedged against the dash and 
           the roof of the car.  He struggles.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        And now I truly appreciate just how 
                        diabolical a madman Mr. Hitler was.

                                 RITA RIGGS
                        Did you know him?

           Insulted, Hitchcock does a slow turn to face Rita, who is 
           flustered.
                                 RITA RIGGS
                        I mean, you were contemporaries... 
                        And "A.H." -- you have the same 
                        initials.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I never met Aldof Hitler, but 
                        Aldous Huxley and I share a set of 
                        monogrammed bath towels.

           She reaches back behind the seat, fumbling and not looking at 
           the road.  Hitch's eyes widen as they swerve slightly.

                                 RITA RIGGS
                        Hungry?

           She comes out with a pint of strawberries.  Hitch takes one.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Have you ever had French Alpine 
                        strawberries, Miss Riggs?  One of 
                        life's great pleasures.

                                 RITA RIGGS
                        I've never been out of the country.

           He eats the strawberry, surprised how good it is.  He savors 
           it.  She eats one too, making sounds of delight.

                                 RITA RIGGS
                        Doesn't Alma always drive you home?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (beat)
                        Not always.

           He grabs a few more strawberries.

           INT. HITCHCOCK ENTRANCE - EARLY EVENING

           Hitch, having trouble walking, enters.  We see the Volkwagen 
           pulling away, and Rita gives a distinctive horn toot.  
           Hitchcock waves his thanks, then closes the door, holding his 
           back.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Hello?

           The house is eerily empty.  Hitchcock is nervous.

           HITCHCOCK'S DEN

           Hitchcock walks in and sees the photo folder out. 
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (calling out)
                        Dearest?

           No answer.  Hitchcock takes the folders out of the back of 
           the file drawer, puts his photo file back in its hiding 
           place, and replaces the other folders.  He looks guilty and 
           very alone.

           EXT. SANTA BARBARA BEACH - SUNSET

           Alma and Whit sit out on the sand watching the sunset.  It is 
           pleasant and friendly-- not at all romantic.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        You sure you don't want to tell me 
                        what's bothering you?

                                 ALMA
                             (shrugging)
                        Hitch has always used his 
                        obsessions to fuel his art.  I just 
                        don't like it when he uses them 
                        against me.

           The water nearly comes up to her feet.

                                 ALMA
                        I could get used to this.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        What do you think of that cottage?

           He nods to a little beach house up the way.

                                 ALMA
                        Could use a coat of paint.  Why?

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        It's mine.

           Her mouth opens in surprise.  He smiles suavely.  She gets up 
           and starts running toward the house gleefully.  He chases.

           INT. BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           It is old, falling apart, with functional furnishings that 
           have been there for years.  Alma rushes in, and looks around.

                                 ALMA
                        I just saw Elizabeth; why didn't 
                        she tell me?
                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        She doesn't know about it.

                                 ALMA
                        When did you buy it?

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        I'm just leasing it during the off-
                        season.  Place to get away from the 
                        wife and kid and write.
                             (beat)
                        You might find that room 
                        interesting.

           Alma looks-- the door is partially open and she sees a double 
           bed.  

                                 ALMA
                        Oh, no, Whit...I hope you don't 
                        have the wrong idea...I would 
                        never...

           He shakes his head and nods her forward.  She walks to the 
           door and pushes it open.  The first thing she sees is an awe 
           inspiring view of the ocean.  On the DECK outside the 
           bedroom, two large TYPEWRITERS are set up at a table facing 
           the ocean.

           Alma looks back at Whit as he walks closer, entranced by the 
           soothing sound of the pounding waves.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        If you were serious about helping 
                        me adapt my book, I thought it 
                        would be the perfect hideaway.

           She lets it sink in for a moment, then, excited, goes out to 
           the deck.  He goes out with her.  They sit at different spots 
           and begin to work, starting a heated discussion on where the 
           screenplay should start.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Hitch, restless in bed, hears a noise.  He closes his eyes 
           when Alma walks in the room.

           She goes in the bathroom and turns the light on.  He watches 
           from bed as she takes off her clothes and leaves them on the 
           floor, quickly pulling on a nightgown.

           Hitch closes his eyes again when the bathroom light switches 
           off.  
           Alma walks out, stops at the foot of his bed and looks at 
           him.  She's not completely sure that he's actually awake, but 
           she suspects.

           She goes to her bed and gets in.  After a few moments, 
           Hitchcock gets up, goes into the bathroom.

           BATHROOM

           Hitchcock closes the door and puts on the light.  He looks at 
           himself in the mirror.  He tries to calm himself, but it's 
           useless.

           He looks down at her clothes, then picks them up.  He goes 
           through the pockets-- empty.  He goes over the surfaces, 
           looking for clues.

           He picks up her trousers and is surprised as a PILE OF SAND 
           falls from the cuff onto the bathroom counter.  He checks the 
           cuff-- even more sand.  He mutters to himself as he pushes 
           the sand together to check the size of the pile.

           His mind races.  He catches a glimpse of something-- Eddie is 
           staring blankly at him from the mirror--it looks like Eddie 
           is right over his shoulder!

           He turns to see if Eddie is behind him-- no one is there.  
           And when he turns back to the mirror, the killer is gone.

           Hitchcock opens the medicine cabinet mirror that he just saw 
           Eddie in and takes out an amber tinted BOTTLE OF BAYER 
           ASPIRIN.  He dumps the tablets into the toilet and flushes 
           them.  Very carefully, he sweeps the BEACH SAND into the 
           aspirin bottle.  He caps the bottle, puts it in his robe 
           pocket, then tidies up and shuts off the light.

           INT. PSYCHO SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

           There is a table full of KNIVES.  Hitchcock's hand lingers 
           over one, then grabs a different, more savage looking one.

           He turns as a SHEET is removed to reveal a disturbingly 
           lifelike prosthetic FEMALE TORSO.  Hitchcock PLUNGES the 
           knife in, disappointed by the ridiculous geyser of FAKE 
           BLOOD.  MAKE-UP MEN JACK BARRON and ROBERT DAWN await his 
           reaction.  He wipes his hand with a handkerchief.

           INT. WARDROBE DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Janet eats an alpine strawberry from a large box as Rita 
           molds MOLESKIN to Janet's breasts.  Janet MOANS in delight.
                                 RITA RIGGS
                        They're French Alpine Strawberries.  
                        Mr. Hitchcock sent me a whole crate 
                        just for driving him home.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        He is such an angel, isn't he?

           Rita smiles unconvincingly as she adjusts the moleskins.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        And you're sure these moleskins 
                        will stay on?

                                 RITA RIGGS
                        Mr. Hitchcock promised.

           Neither woman looks absolutely sure, but they continue with 
           uneasy faith in what they're doing.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        They'd better...I can't let a stand-
                        in get all my screen time.
                             (looking in the mirror)
                        And I'm gonna be in that shower all 
                        week.

           One of the moleskins drops to the floor and Janet barely 
           covers herself in time.  Rita and Janet look at each other.

           INT. BATES MOTEL - BATHROOM MONTAGE

           We follow the mole skin as Janet steps into the shower.  
           During the MONTAGE, there is no Bernard Hermann music.  Most 
           shots show the camera crew and the variety of camera set-ups.

           It is a slow start.  There is shot after shot of Janet, in 
           the shower, struggling to keep the mole skin on.  Hitch is 
           frustrated with her.

           ANOTHER DAY

           A make-up person squirts BOSCO CHOCOLATE SYRUP onto Janet to 
           simulate blood.  She is cold, and tired.  

           ANOTHER DAY

           We see Hitchcock in his directors chair.  He has the BAYER'S 
           ASPIRIN BOTTLE in his hand, and dumps the sand into his palm.  
           He looks up and sees EDDIE, mingling with crew, staring at 
           Hitch approvingly.
           Hitch puts the sand away and steps to the NORMAN STAND-IN who 
           holds the knife.  (We no longer see Eddie.)

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        More violent...remember, you are 
                        possessed with a homicidal rage; 
                        let it arouse you.

           Janet and Rita aren't at all pleased to hear this.

           Shots of STABBING and SLASHING resume.  As Hitch becomes more 
           pleased with the outcome, Janet becomes more upset by the 
           process.

           Janet is having trouble.  She's been doing this scene a week 
           straight.  The knife comes at her-- she can no longer hold 
           onto the moleskin.  She's naked in the shower, being stabbed 
           again and again.

           Between takes, Janet is confused, crying and shivering.

           Hitchcock casually points the crew to the next camera set-up.

           We see Janet's footwork as fake blood runs down her legs.  We 
           see the moleskin in the bottom of the tub, but Janet is still 
           fighting off the knife, continuing the scene.

           Stabbing through the water.  Plunging into her stomach.

           Hitchcock gets into the stabbing-- flinching his 
           encouragement, mesmerized.  Finally, Janet's Marion DIES a 
           grisly death.  She grabs onto the SHOWER CURTAIN.

           The curtain flies loose and the rings spin.  Janet falls, 
           slumped over the tub, her buttocks exposed, her eyes open.

           Hitchcock watches.  The crew waits.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Thank you, Miss Leigh.  Onto the 
                        next scene, boys.

           The crew erupts with applause.  Rita rushes over and covers 
           Janet with a robe.  Janet looks up for her director's 
           approval, but Hitchcock is already walking away.  Janet is 
           alone.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Alma enjoys a roast in some sort of sauce, with potatoes and 
           asparagus covered in cheese.  Hitchcock clicks his fork 
           loudly as he eats salad.
           EXT. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS - DAY

           Hitchcock walks briskly, followed by Peggy and a P.R. FLACK.

                                 P.R. FLACK
                        Please, the national and 
                        international outlets are driving

                        The more we frustrate them, the

                        The more we frustrate them, the 
                        more their interest will wane.

           Peggy and the Flack look at each other as Hitchcock enters:

           INT. MAKE-UP TRAILER - DAY

           Hitch enters and motions for Jack and Robert to demonstrate 
           their next display.  It's a model of the corpse head--it's 
           much more cartoonish than the one finally used-- it has 
           blackened skin, bugged eyes, and hair standing on end.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        More frightening, but simple.  It's 
                        in the script.

                                 JACK BARRON
                        We didn't show you the best part.

           Jack flips a switch on a large motor connected to the model.  
           There is a GRINDING NOISE, then WORMS slowly ooze from false 
           flesh and eye sockets.

           Hitch glances in the mirror behind them and sees the specter 
           of Eddie glowering unhappily at the contraption.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        She'd be impeccably preserved.  
                        Show some respect.

           Hitchcock charges out of the office.  (Eddie is no longer in 
           the mirror).  Jack and Robert continue looking at the oozing 
           worms for a few beats.  
                                 ROBERT DAWN
                        So..."no" on the maggots?

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S TRAILER

           Hitchcock grabs his phone.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Maxim's of London.

           A CREW MEMBER raps on the door, looking through the window 
           beseechingly.  Hitchcock heartlessly lowers the blind.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Yes, this is Mr. Hitchcock, in 
                        Hollywood, California.  I need two 
                        pounds of fois gras couriered to 
                        me...today.

           EXT. HITCHCOCK'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

           A CHAUFFEUR drives up in a Lincoln.  He gets out and holds 
           the door, helping Hitchcock get out.  He then hands Hitch a 
           shopping bag with MAXIM printed on it.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S DEN - CONTINUOUS

           We hear the DOGS barking and howling as the front door opens 
           and Hitchcock comes in.  He pets them.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK (O.S.)
                        Down...down...good little men...

           We hear movement as Hitch looks around the house.  At the 
           same time we slowly move toward a stack of papers on the 
           desk.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK (O.S.)
                        Alma?

           After a few moments he comes into the den.  Just then we see 
           the title page on the stack of papers:  TAXI TO DUBROVNIK.  
           SCREENPLAY BY WHITFIELD COOK & ALMA REVILLE. 

           A moment later Hitchcock's hand comes down on the page.  We 
           pan up to see his tightening expression.

           He shakes, then he TEARS THE SCRIPT TO BITS, flinging it 
           around the room.
           EXT. HITCHCOCK'S HOUSE - NIGHT(LATER)

           Alma drives up and parks.  She walks to the house.  She 
           pauses a moment when she hears THE RITE OF SPRING playing.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The dogs jump up and down as Alma enters the house.  
           Hitchcock is sitting in an overstuffed chair, in pants, shirt 
           and a robe, enjoying fois gras, wine, and cheese.

           Alma glances at him.  The music is blasting from the den.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        What a surprise.  You haven't been 
                        home much the last two weeks.

                                 ALMA
                        May I turn that down, please?

           He shrugs slightly.  Alma walks to the den.

           DEN

           Alma turns off the music then hesitates when she sees her 
           script pages torn and tossed all over the room.  She is calm.

                                 ALMA
                        Somebody didn't care for my script.

           LIVING ROOM

           Alma walks out, ready to have it out.

                                 ALMA
                        It was only a carbon, but still...

           Hitchcock thrusts his hand over the table and holds it there 
           a moment, building suspense, finally revealing the Bayer 
           Aspirin bottle.  Alma waits calmly.

           Hitch opens the bottle and lets the SAND HE FOUND IN ALMA'S 
           CLOTHES run out slowly into a heap on the table.  He puts 
           down the bottle and stares at Alma, looking for a reaction.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Spending a lot of time at the 
                        beach?

                                 ALMA
                        I was writing.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Is that all?

                                 ALMA
                        Yes.  And you know it is.  But even 
                        that's too much for you.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        A script by Alma and Whit.  God 
                        forbid I deprive the world of the 
                        next "Under Capricorn."

           He's finally pushed the right button.  She stalks over to 
           him, glowering.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        You know what kind of pressure I'm 
                        under with this picture yet you do 
                        everything in your power to derail 
                        me.

                                 ALMA
                        May I remind you, besides doing 
                        countless rewrites on your script, 
                        I will be in the editing room 
                        alongside you, day and night.  I'll 
                        listen to every scoring session 
                        with you.  When you preview the 
                        film, it will be my notes you want 
                        first, and when you're out 
                        promoting it, I will stand slightly 
                        behind you, smiling for the press, 
                        even when I'm ready to drop, being 
                        gracious to people who look through 
                        me as if I were invisible because 
                        all they can see is you.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        You left that script for me to find 
                        on purpose.  You wanted to hurt me.

                                 ALMA
                        You want me to really hurt you?

           She snatches his fois gras --he reaches desperately for the 
           bowl but she throws it on the floor!  He's devastated as the 
           dogs rush over and lap it up.

                                 ALMA
                        At least I didn't leave a folder 
                        with photos of my sexual obsessions 
                        for you to find.  
                             (she walks to the stairs)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALMA (CONT'D)
                        I don't look like those women; I 
                        don't dress like them, I don't act 
                        like them.  I'll never be one of 
                        your blondes!

           Alma charges up the stairs and we hear the door SLAM. 

           EXT. HITCHCOCK POOL - CONTINUOUS

           A light comes on and Hitchcock sadly leaves the house.  He 
           sits in the lounge chair with a glass.  In the background, in 
           the house, the dogs finish off the fois gras.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        And I'll never look like Whitfield 
                        Cook.

           Hitch looks over and sees Eddie, on another lounge chair in 
           the shadows.  Eddie raises a glass to Hitchcock.  Hitchcock 
           hesitates, then raises his glass and drinks silently with his 
           film's subject.

           EXT. PLAINFIELD CEMETARY - 1957 - DAY

           There is SNOW FALLING and some on the ground.  We pan slowly 
           across the graves and find AUGUSTA GEIN'S HEADSTONE.  A 
           little further and we find Eddie, weeping, torn by guilt. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Help me.  I can't...stop.

           We pull back to reveal Hitchcock standing next to him.  Hitch 
           puts his hand comfortingly on Eddie's shoulder.

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. HITCHCOCK POOL - SUNRISE

           Alma comes out the back to let the dogs out and sees Hitch in 
           the lounge chair-- he's dreaming about Eddie.  She's 
           irritated to see him there.

                                 ALMA
                        Hitch?...

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (delirious)
                        Can't...stop....

           She walks to him and looks very worried when she sees him.  
           His eyes open, but they look glassy.  Her mothering instinct 
           overcomes her vexation and she feels his brow.
                                 ALMA
                        You're burning up.

           INT. PSYCHO HOUSE SET - STAIRCASE - DAY

           It's the familiar set manned by the movie crew, a crane above 
           the set.  Things are in disarray.  Tony stands with Saul Bass 
           and MARTIN BALSAM.  Peggy, on the phone, walks over toward 
           them, pulling the wire.

                                 TONY PERKINS
                        I know it would cost a lot to shut 
                        down for a few days, but--

                                 SAUL BASS
                        It's my storyboard-- I'm the one 
                        who directed the shower scene....

           Peggy recoils as she stands in front of Saul with the phone.  
           She holds it out to him.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        Mr. Hitchcock wants to talk to you.

                                 SAUL BASS
                        Did he...hear me...?

           Peggy thrusts the phone at him and walks away.

                                 SAUL BASS
                        Hey, Hitch....we all miss you.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Hitch has the flu and has taken to his bed along with 
           storyboards and script pages.  He has the phone receiver 
           pressed to his ear.  Alma comes in with SOUP on a tray.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I don't want these shots you have 
                        in the boards.  You don't get 
                        killed for walking up stairs-- 
                        don't shoot it as if that's what he 
                        expects to happen....

           He hangs up the phone.

                                 ALMA
                        Tell me.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        It's hard not being there, and 
                        we're already days behind schedule.
                                 ALMA
                        There's something else.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Last week I overheard Joe Stefano 
                        saying Psycho had nothing to do 
                        with Bloch's book, nothing to do 
                        with me, that it's all his script.  
                        Now I just heard Saul Bass saying 
                        something similar about his own 
                        contributions...

           Hitch swings his legs off the bed. 

                                 ALMA
                        Be happy they're fighting for 
                        credit.  If it was going badly, 
                        they'd be blaming you instead...

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I've got to get over there....

                                 ALMA
                        Back in bed with you.
                             (beat)
                        I'll go.

           Hitch is surprised but pleased.

                                 ALMA
                        Under the blankets.  Right now.

           He gets back down and she arranges his blankets.  She puts 
           the tray on his bed.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (contritely)
                        I don't want to take you away from 
                        your writing partner...

                                 ALMA
                             (kindly)
                        Eat your soup.

           He is genuinely grateful.  She silently arranges his blanket, 
           plumps his pillows, gets her handbag and kerchief and leaves. 

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S CAR - TRAVELLING - DAY

           Alma, all business, drives the large car.  She reaches the 
           Universal gate and is waved through.
           INT. NORMAN BATES HOUSE - DAY

           The set is in turmoil, there is an argument going on between 
           crew members, and some people are just sitting around.  
           Peggy, in the middle of things, is getting a little 
           frustrated with the attitude of the crew.

           Saul Bass is in the director's chair, and is having a heated 
           exchange with the Cameraman, who has had enough of Saul.

           Then Alma steps in the door, and everything stops.

           Peggy looks relieved, as does the Cameraman.

           Saul Bass forces a smile, then slinks off the set.  Every 
           crew member, all men in suits, comes to attention as she 
           passes.  It's the effect of the school principal coming into 
           class after the substitute has lost control.

                                 ALMA
                        Don't stop work because of me.  I'm 
                        only paying your salaries.

           The crew members suddenly start busting their asses.  Alma 
           takes a seat like a queen in Hitch's DIRECTOR'S chair.  You 
           can tell as her eyes dart around the set that she ISN'T 
           MISSING A THING.  Peggy comes and stands next to her.

                                 ALMA
                        Scene?

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        Seventy-four.

                                 ALMA
                        Storyboards?

           Peggy hands them to Alma.  She glances over them efficiently, 
           then watches as the AD sets the actors.  Peggy looks at Alma 
           and mouths: "THANK YOU" for bringing chaos back to order.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           We see Alma, alone, looking sure of herself and determined, 
           striding down the hall.  She stops in front of a door, knocks 
           and enters.

           INT. SAUL BASS'S OFFICE - DAY

           It is a small office with a couple of drawing boards and 
           stacks of storyboards everywhere.  Saul, working, is 
           surprised and stands when Alma enters.  She's all business.
                                 SAUL BASS
                        Alma?  To what do I owe the 
                        pleasure?

                                 ALMA
                        If you come on set again, you will 
                        stay in the background.

           He looks stunned, but not apologetic.

                                 ALMA
                        Hitch is a genius with you, Mr. 
                        Bass, and he's a genius without 
                        you.  I know he's not one to spread 
                        credit; but I'm not one to stand by 
                        and let you take it.

                                 SAUL BASS
                        Alma, let me explain what you might 
                        have heard...

                                 ALMA
                        We all contribute.  But there's one 
                        director.

           He's about to argue, but Alma's glare tells him he's not 
           going to win.  He shrugs, lowers his head and nods.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. HARDWARE STORE - CONTINUOUS

           The bell rings over the door, as Frank Worden, the man we saw 
           teasing Eddie at the bar, enters.

                                 FRANK WORDEN
                        Hey mom, back for a spell...Mom?

           He is surprised when he notices the CASH REGISTER IS GONE-- 
           He sees a spot of blood, then grows alarmed as he sees a 
           streak of blood leading to the door.  Frank grabs the phone.

                                 FRANK WORDEN
                        Art?  Get over to the store.  
                        Something happened to my 
                        mother....Wait...

           Frank sees a hand-written receipt, crumbled and left on the 
           floor next to the rifle.  He opens the receipt and sees the 
           name:  EDDIE GEIN, 2 gallons antifreeze, $2.00. 

                                 FRANK WORDEN
                        Jesus.  It's Eddie Gein.
           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY

           Whitfield Cook is staring out at the ocean when he hears a 
           car pulling toward the house.  He's surprised to see Alma and 
           runs over to open the door gallantly.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        I wasn't expecting you...

                                 ALMA
                        I like surprising people...

           She bends and picks up a handful of sand, looking at it.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        Hitch feeling better, I take it?

                                 ALMA
                        Back to his old self.  I think he's 
                        only really happy when he's behind 
                        the camera.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        It's probably the only place left 
                        in his life where he feels like 
                        he's in complete control.
                             (beat)
                        I can't feel sorry for him.  Most 
                        of us never get to have that 
                        feeling at all.

           She looks at the sand in her hand sadly, then lets it trickle 
           away into the breeze.  

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        Let's go write...

           Whitfield leads her into the house to write.

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM AREA - DAY

           Hitchcock walks Janet Leigh toward her dressing room.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        It was more than a pleasure having 
                        you here, and I shall miss you 
                        terribly.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        It was my pleasure, Hitch...

           She steps inside and SCREAMS for her life!
           DRESSING ROOM

           The "Mother" prototype is sitting facing her!  Much better 
           than the original, Hitch's notes to the make-up men have made 
           it fantastically scary.  Crew members come running as 
           Hitchcock steps morbidly into the doorway.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        It's only Mrs. Bates.  Since you're 
                        finished, I told her she could have 
                        your dressing room.

           The crew, so concerned a moment before, laughs.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I think she's wearing one of your 
                        brassieres.

           INT. FRUIT CELLAR SET - DAY

           We can see the camera and Hitchcock sitting in his chair, in 
           full control.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Easy....easy...something's here, 
                        you can feel it....

           Vera walks cautiously down the stairs, looking around.  He 
           points to the rocking chair where "mother" sits, back to us.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        It's her.  Now you can get your 
                        questions answered...

           INT. IRENE HILL'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

           Eddie sits on the living room couch, sipping coffee from a 
           mug.  Irene Hill (a character we met previously outside Mary 
           Hogan's bar) brings out a large cake with an even larger 
           KNIFE, and sets it in front of him.   Her two BOYS, seven and 
           twelve, are running around the living room wildly.

           Eddie stares at the knife, then slowly looks to Irene's 
           throat.

                                 IRENE HILL
                        I'm gonna keep my eyes open for the 
                        right woman for you.  You just ask 
                        Mary Carter-- I'm a pretty good 
                        matchmaker.

           Eddie looks at her, a flash in his eyes.  He glances at a 
           large CAKE KNIFE next to the cake.  It glints invitingly.  
           He reaches over and picks up the knife, looking at it-- it 
           all seems innocent to Irene, like he's about to cut the cake.

                                 EDDIE
                        You know, Irene, a woman like you 
                        is all a man would ever--

           Eddie stops, mesmerized as he looks out the window and sees 
           FLASHING LIGHTS approaching the house.

           EXT. IRENE HILL'S HOUSE - EVENING

           SHERIFF ART SCHLEY and A DEPUTY get out of the car.  The 
           Sheriff immediately wanders to Eddie's car and glances 
           inside.  Irene comes out.

                                 IRENE HILL
                        What's going on, Art?

           Eddie loafs out of the house, pulling on his hunting hat.  He 
           hesitates, embarrassed, then joins Art and the Deputy.

                                 EDDIE
                        Thanks for the pork chops, Mrs. 
                        Hill....

           INT. FRUIT CELLAR SET

           Vera puts her hand on "Mother's" and the corpse turns around.  
           We see her frightening skin-covered skull.

           Vera screams and moves back, hitting the dangling LIGHT BULB 
           which swings back and forth, in and out of frame.

           We end on the light bulb swinging back and forth in front of 
           Hitchcock's own face as he watches with passionate intensity.

                                                       MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. EDDIE GEIN'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

           Eddie squints as he is brought into a bright light.  LARGE 
           LAMPS, like MOVIE lights, have been set up and run by a 
           generator-- Eddie had no electricity.  In fact, the whole 
           scene is reminiscent of the crew activity on the Psycho film.  
           One OFFICER is filming with a 16mm BELL & HOWELL. 

           Trash and newspapers are piled everywhere.  There is grime 
           and dark stains on the cabinets and counters.  At the sink-- 
           KNIVES of various shapes and sizes.

           On the counter are boxes filled with fingers, and preserved 
           vaginas.  There are TWO SEVERED HANDS, FOLDED IN PRAYER.
           Twelve OFFICERS and MEDICAL EXAMINER EMPLOYEES, scattered 
           about the room, stop their search and look at Eddie.  

                                 ART SCHLEY
                        We found Bernice's body, dressed 
                        out like a deer; we found her 
                        heart.  I don't mean to sound flip, 
                        but where's her goddamned head?

           A CAPTAIN calls down from the landing where an OFFICER is 
           taking a crowbar to the boards nailed up in front of his 
           mother's room.

                                 CAPTAIN SCHOEPHOERSTER
                        I think we got his hiding spot.

           Eddie, seeing what they're doing, suddenly shows emotion as 
           he completely freaks out!

                                 EDDIE GEIN
                        No!  No!

           He breaks free and makes a dash for the stairs.  A moment 
           later he is pinned face down on the stairs (on the spot where 
           he attacked Bernice) by Art and the Deputy.  Art cuffs his 
           hands behind his back, and the Deputy hauls him to his feet.

           The last of the boards are pried away.

                                 EDDIE GEIN
                        You can not go in there! 

                                 CAPTAIN SCHOEPHOERSTER
                        What are we going to find?!  How 
                        many victims are in here!

                                 EDDIE GEIN
                             (overlapping)
                        No!  Stop him!  No!

           They stand Eddie before the door, and throw it open.  The 
           cops are stunned by what they see-- no bodies, no gore, no 
           litter or newspapers or trash like in the rest of the house.  
           Just a neat, perfectly preserved room, with the bed made.

                                 EDDIE GEIN
                        That's...my...mother's...room!!  
                             (whispering)
                        I miss her...

           He collapses to his knees, blubbering and moaning in anguish.  
           The cops glance at each other.  
           At that moment, the Sheriff looks like he feels sorry for 
           him, and gives Eddie's shoulder an awkward pat.

           INT. SECURE CELL SET - DAY

           The cell door is closed on Tony, not in character, as he is 
           led in by makeup and costume people.  He laughs and talks 
           quietly with them.  He sits in a chair against the wall and 
           the make-up bib is taken away.  The blanket is arranged.

           The crew becomes silently reverential.  This is the last 
           scene, an important one.  You could hear a pin drop.

           As the crew moves away, Tony goes into the "Norman Bates as 
           Mother" character, staring out blankly. 

           Hitchcock steps close to Perkins-- we do not see the camera 
           or the crew, only Perkins staring and Hitchcock, reading from 
           a script in his OWN voice, not a false woman's voice.

           The camera tracks in-- but unlike the movie, which tracks in 
           on Norman, we track in on Hitchcock.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        "It's sad when a mother has to 
                        speak the words that condemn her 
                        son.  But I couldn't allow them to 
                        believe that I would commit murder.  
                        They'll put him away now, as I 
                        should have, years ago.  He was 
                        always bad.  And in the end he 
                        attempted to tell them I killed 
                        those girls and that man.  As if I 
                        could do anything except just sit 
                        and stare, like one of his stuffed 
                        birds.  They know I can't even move 
                        a finger.  And I won't.  I'll just 
                        sit here and be quiet....just in 
                        case they do suspect me."

           He stops, looking at Tony as he shifts his eyes around 
           crazily.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        "They're probably watching me.  Let 
                        them.  Let them see what kind of a 
                        person I am."
                             (to Tony)
                        A fly just landed on your hand.

           Tony looks slowly down at his hand.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (continuing)
                        "I'm not even going to swat that 
                        fly.  I hope they are watching, 
                        they'll see; they'll see and 
                        they'll know and they'll say, 'Why 
                        she wouldn't even harm a fly.'"

           Tony looks up and smiles as "Mother."

           PSYCHO FOOTAGE

           We see a piece of the shower scene, but without any of the 
           music or sound effects that make it so powerful.

           INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY 

           The footage is not going over well-- the reaction is flat as 
           we move across the faces of the few viewers.

           Lew sits with Barney Balaban and two executives.  Barney 
           checks his watch out of boredom.

           June and two other Censors look appalled.

           Bernard Herman is sitting in the back row with Alma, and he's 
           making notes.  She has her poker face on, but she glances 
           back at Hitchcock who is pacing around, beside himself by the 
           projection room door.

           INT. OUTSIDE SCREENING ROOM

           Hitchcock, depressed, is joined by Alma and Hermann.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        It's hopeless...

                                 BERNARD HERMANN
                        What Alma and I talked about is 
                        really going to play.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I don't want music in the shower...

                                 BERNARD HERMANN
                        Alma said she'd change your mind.

           Hitch looks at Alma.  Bernard Herman leaves and June and the 
           two censors come out.

                                 JUNE
                        You're going to have to cut the 
                        nudity.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        What nudity?  It was suggested.

                                 ALMA
                        A woman of Janet Leigh's stature 
                        would never take off her clothes.

                                 OTHER CENSOR
                        But I did see a knife hitting her.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        No.  We didn't do a shot like that.

                                 JUNE
                        I'd stake my reputation on it.  
                        We're denying your seal.

           Hitchcock is livid, but holds his tongue.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I'll go over it frame by frame and 
                        set up another screening for you.

           June and the Censors walk away, talking amongst themselves, 
           as Lew comes out involved in a quiet but intense discussion 
           with the bored Barney Balaban.

                                 ALMA
                        There was nudity.  

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Her breasts are very large, dear, 
                        it was hard not to show them.

                                 ALMA
                        And there was a knife plunging into 
                        her stomach.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I actually shot it pulling out, but 
                        showed the footage backwards.

                                 ALMA
                        You'll have to cut the frame where 
                        she blinks when she's dead.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        We've seen the footage a thousand 
                        times.  She doesn't blink.

           Barney stops in front of Hitch.  To show his dismay, he looks 
           him in the eye and shakes his head.  The project is doomed.
           Barney leaves and Lew stays behind with Alma and Hitch.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        It's too late for Balaban to back 
                        out no matter what he says.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        All that work...

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Two choices-- Plan A:  book New 
                        York, then open nationally in 
                        thousands of theaters at the same 
                        time a week later.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        What's the point of that, Lew?

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        It won't let word of mouth bury us.  
                        Because of the low budget, you 
                        might have a chance at breaking 
                        even.  Or Plan B.  Recut it as a 
                        two-parter for the TV series.

           Hitchcock seems devastated by the harsh realism.

                                 ALMA
                        That's not showing much faith.

                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        Faith is for preachers and 
                        oddballs. 

                                 ALMA
                        You can't scare people by looking 
                        at them and saying, "boo."  They 
                        have to anticipate it.  That's what 
                        the music and sound effects are 
                        going to make this film, they're 
                        going to let the audience know 
                        they're going to be scared.

           Her enthusiasm isn't contagious.  She checks her watch.

                                 ALMA
                        We finished earlier than I thought.  
                        I'm going to run...

           She nods, then heads for the door.  Hitchcock watches sadly, 
           knowing where she's headed.  Lew doesn't pick up on what's 
           passed between the couple.
                                 LEW WASSERMAN
                        I made Jimmy Stewart rich on 
                        "Winchester 73," and that was 
                        complete shit.  At least I could 
                        sit through this.

           INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

           The EDITOR runs the scene a frame at a time through a 
           Moviola.  Hitchcock watches over his shoulder with Peggy.  He 
           stops on Janet, face against the floor, blinking.

                                 EDITOR
                        I'll be damned...she blinked.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (deeply impressed)
                        There's no one like Alma.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        Maybe you should tell her sometime.

           Hitchcock thinks about it, dismayed, but returns his 
           attention to the moviola.

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY

           Alma, full of anticipation, walks over from car across the 
           sand.  She goes up the steps to the entrance to the deck.

           She sees the typewriters and paper out but suddenly stops.  
           In the bedroom, through the window, she sees Whitfield Cook.  
           He's making love to a young man--it is the Waiter Whit had 
           his eye on in the restaurant.

           Alma and Whit's eyes meet.  Whit is horrified at being 
           caught..

           Alma ducks her head, wheels around and walks toward her car.

           ALMA'S CAR

           Alma opens the door, but Whit is running out of his house, 
           buttoning trousers, shirtless and shoeless.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        Alma...I thought you weren't coming 
                        until tonight...

                                 ALMA
                        And I thought you rented this place 
                        so we could write.
                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        I did.  I swear-- this just 
                        happened.

           She gets in her car.  He puts his hand desperately on the car 
           door.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        You won't say anything, will you?

                                 ALMA
                        Don't worry.  I won't tell 
                        Elizabeth.

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        I mean to Hitch.

           Alma tries to hide what a punch to the gut this is.

                                 ALMA
                        Is that the only reason I've been 
                        writing this with you?

                                 WHITFIELD COOK
                        Alma-- you're incredibly talented.
                             (smiling feebly)
                        But, afterall...we want him to read 
                        "Taxi to Dubrovnik" with an open 
                        mind.

                                 ALMA
                             (beat)
                        I wouldn't worry about that, Whit.

           She pulls slowly away and drives off.  He watches anxiously, 
           then deflates, knowing he's fucked everything up.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S DEN - DAY

           Tight on the television.  Titles from a 1950 melodrama: 
           "SECRET HEART," written by WHITFIELD COOK.

           Alma watches alone, sniffling before the movie even starts.

           She hears the front door and Hitchcock greeting the dogs.  
           She tries to stop herself from crying.

           After a few moments Hitchcock enters.  He looks at her, and 
           down at the tissue in her hand.

           He takes a seat next to her and silently starts watching 
           along with her.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Secret Heart?

           Alma nods, trying not to burst into tears.  Hitchcock stares 
           at the television screen.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I didn't pull it off this time.  I 
                        should have stuck to the movies I 
                        know how to make.  It was too late 
                        to try anything different.

           Alma doesn't look at him.

                                 ALMA
                        You're right.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        What do you mean, "I'm right?"  
                        What kind of thing is that to say? 

                                 ALMA
                        Don't get cross with me.  I was 
                        agreeing with you.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Here I am at my lowest hour, I'm 
                        tired, I'm beaten, I'm about to 
                        lose our investment...and you're 
                        agreeing with me.  Well, I find 
                        that quite disagreeable.

                                 ALMA
                        Then go down to the editing room 
                        and get to work.  That's where your 
                        genius is, Hitch.  Making all the 
                        tiny pieces work as one.  You may 
                        not be the easiest man to live 
                        with, but you know how to cut a 
                        goddam picture.

           He glances at her.  She continues watching the screen.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Only if you're there with me.

           She shrugs slightly.  He turns back to the screen.  A beat, 
           then softly:

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Whit isn't worth a damn unless he's 
                        working with you.

                        Neither am I.

           Hitchcock reaches over and takes her hand.  In this moment, 
           it's enough.  The couple silently watch the love story.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

           WE BEGIN A MONTAGE...Hitch and Alma in action.  Film hangs 
           everywhere in bins around three upright moviolas; FOUR 
           ASSISTANTS are working but not fast enough for either of 
           them.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I thought I told you to cut away to 
                        the shower head...

                                 ALMA
                        Take thirty frames off the head....
                             (next Moviola)
                        No, no, the second take, the light 
                        is better on his hands... 

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        More cuts.  The minute I lose one 
                        person I've lost the whole 
                        audience....

           The Editor rushes in with several reels of magnetic stock.  

                                 EDITOR
                        Transfer of Mr. Hermann's rough 
                        score...

           INT. SOUND RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           Peggy watches as Hitchcock raises a large knife and plunges 
           it into an ORANGE with a large microphone next to it.  Alma, 
           listening on headphones with a Technician, shakes her head, 
           disapproving.

           Instead of trying one of the melons, Hitch tries another 
           ORANGE, stabbing it viciously several times.

                                 ALMA
                        Try one of the melons.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I'm not--
                             (stab)
                        Done--

                             (stab)
                        With the oranges.

           Hitch stabs the orange one more time, then gathers his wits.  
           He stabs a cabasa melon and the Alma gives the thumbs up.

           INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

           Hitch and Alma are seated at a moviola and feverishly 
           recutting the shower scene, working with balletic grace.

           EXT. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS - DAY 

           Hitchcock, in a black rain coat, holds an umbrella over his 
           head with one hand, and a headset to one ear with the other.   
           Next to him are Alma and Peggy, in raincoats, and the sound 
           TECHNICIAN, in a poncho, who holds out a microphone.

           Hitch looks dissatisfied.  Pulling back slowly we see he's 
           under a rain tower hooked to a WATER TANK.  We can barely 
           hear him over the sound of the rain.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Harder.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                             (in disbelief)
                        Harder?!

                                 ALMA
                             (yelling upwards)
                        Harder!

           The GRIP on the Water Truck looks incredulous, then turns the 
           valve all the way-- it comes off in his hand.

           The rain teems even HARDER around Hitch.  He listens on the 
           headphone, and finally nods that he's satisfied.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Now that's rain.

           He offers the headphone to Alma, energized.

           INT. SOUND RECORDING BOOTH - DAY

           Hitch, delighted, is with PAUL JASMIN, a friend of Tony's.  
           Jasmin, in awe of the director, changes his vocal performance 
           as Mother as instructions fly at him fast and furious.

                                 PAUL JASMIN
                        Norman.  What do you think you're 
                        doing?  Don't you touch me, don't.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Too wheedling.  I need scary.

                                 PAUL JASMIN
                        Norman!  What do you think you're 
                        doing?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        You still sound like my 
                        grandmother.  You're not bringing 
                        out a tray of cookies.  You're a 
                        strident, frightening, scolding, 
                        contemptuous shrew.

                                 PAUL JASMIN
                             (screeching viscerally)
                        Norman!!

           Hitch is thrown back a little by the yell and smiles slowly, 
           satisfied, as THE MONTAGE ENDS.

           INT. SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT

           A whole different atmosphere at this screening which 
           includes, along with technical crew and spouses, Jasmin, 
           Tony, Janet, Vera, Joe Stefano, Saul Bass, Peggy, HERMANN 
           and, of course, Alma.  The audience finds it gripping, and 
           Hitch watches faces more than the screen.

                                 NORMAN'S MOTHER (V.O. - ON SCREEN)
                        Norman!

           Jasmin leans over and whispers to Alma. 

                                 PAUL JASMIN
                        It sounds like my voice, but not 
                        really...

                                 ALMA
                        Hitch spliced your voice together 
                        with two actresses...to confuse the 
                        audience.  You all have different 
                        words in each sentence.

           Paul is amazed and sits back, thinking.

           BACK ON THE SCREEN: the shower scene, now with the terrifying 
           Hermann score.  Different members of the audience lean 
           forward in rapt anticipation; just when the waiting seems 
           unbearable, Janet is stabbed!  Everyone comes out of their 
           seats six inches.

           Janet SCREAMS in the audience.
           Hitch is satisfied.  Alma pats his hand.

           INT. SCREENING ROOM LOBBY - NIGHT(LATER)

           Hitch is surrounded by people gushing at him.  Alma stands a 
           couple of steps behind Hitch, silently enjoying the triumph.

                                 JANET LEIGH
                        I believed that the knife went into 
                        me! 

                                 TONY PERKINS
                        I don't know how you made me so 
                        sympathetic...

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        This will be the one you'll always 
                        be remembered for.

           Tony isn't sure how he feels about this. 

           INT. MOTION PICTURE CODE REVIEW OFFICE - DAY

           The Censors sit across from Hitchcock.

                                 JUNE
                        Mr. Danforth no longer sees the 
                        nudity, now he sees the stabbing.  
                        Mr. Kramer no longer sees the 
                        stabbing...or the nudity. 

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        And you?

           She hesitates, and he leans forward.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Trust me.

           June heaves a frustrated sigh.  Hitch leans in as far as he 
           can.  He looks very uncomfortable with what he has to say:

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Have I told you how much I respect 
                        what you do?

           She stares at him skeptically.  He keeps his poker face.

           INT. HITCHCOCK'S UNIVERSAL OFFICE - DAY

           Hitch sweeps in.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        We have our seal.  Take a memo...

           Peggy, flustered, whips out her steno pad.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        We‚Äôre writing a book on how to sell 
                        Psycho.

           INT. PRINTING PRESS -- DAY

           BOOKLETS make the rounds on a conveyor-like contraption. As 
           the booklets are bound by swift-moving WORKERS, we see the 
           cover: ‚ÄúThe Care and Handling of Psycho By Alfred Hitchcock.‚Äù

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S VOICE 
                        Tip One for Theatre Owners: I 
                        suggest the hiring of Pinkerton 
                        guards to enforce admission 
                        policies...

           EXT. NEW YORK THEATRE -- FLASH FORWARD 

           ALFRED HITCHCOCK‚ÄôS PSYCHO on a movie palace marquee. PAN down 
           to a LARGE CROWD on a hot summer day, excitedly filing in.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S VOICE 
                        These men of the law will not only 
                        handle lines and crowds admirably, 
                        but can also help your cashier 
                        explain my policy when the doors 
                        are closed.

           Suddenly GUARDS step forward and block patrons from entering.

           INT. NEW YORK THEATRE -- FLASH FORWARD  

           A MANAGER hangs an enormous CLOCK in the lobby.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S VOICE
                        While perusing the additionally 
                        enclosed publicity kit, please note 
                        order forms for large lobby clocks 
                        to remind audiences of the starting 
                        times for the movie.

           The manager grins, satisfied.

           EXT. NEW YORK THEATRE -- FLASH FORWARD

           Hitch‚Äôs voice booms from large erected speakers.
                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S VOICE
                        The manager of this theatre has 
                        been instructed, at the risk of his 
                        life, not to admit to the theatre 
                        any persons after the picture 
                        starts.

           We PAN DOWN the line of sweating PATRONS broiling in the sun. 
           The line goes on for blocks and despite the wait, most of 
           them grin, enjoying Hitch‚Äôs sense of showmanship.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S VOICE
                        Any spurious attempts to enter by 
                        side doors...

           INT. HOLLYWOOD RECORDING BOOTH -- PRESENT

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        ...fire escapes or ventilating 
                        shafts will be met by force.

           Hitch lays down the track into a large microphone. 

                                 ALMA
                        Try it with more gravity, darling.

           Hitch nods.

           INT. PARAMOUNT BOARD ROOM -- DAY

           Barney Balaban reads ‚ÄúThe Care and Handling of Psycho‚Äù aloud 
           to his assembled board. 

                                 BARNEY
                        ‚ÄúExperience has shown that it 
                        enhances the dignity and importance 
                        of Psycho to close your house 
                        curtains over the screen after the 
                        end-titles of the picture, and keep 
                        the theatre dark for 1/2 minute.‚Äù

           INT. NEW YORK THEATRE -- FLASH FORWARD

           The crowd sits stunned in the dark. 

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S VOICE
                        ‚ÄúDuring these 30 seconds of stygian 
                        blackness, the suspense of Psycho 
                        is indelibly engraved in the mind 
                        of the audience...
           INT. BOARD ROOM -- DAY

           Barney finishes reading aloud from the booklet.

                                 BARNEY
                        ‚ÄúNever, never, never will I permit 
                        Psycho to be followed by a short 
                        subject or newsreel. Sincerely, 
                        Alfred Hitchcock.‚Äù

           Barney closes the book. Silence. Then --

                                 BOARD MEMBER
                        Barney -- what the hell's he doing?  
                        This campaign will cost us a 
                        fortune.  He won't even show it to 
                        critics.

                                 BARNEY
                        It's better that way; I almost 
                        nodded off at a screening.
                             (beat)
                        At the end of the day, it‚Äôs a minor 
                        Hitchcock movie.  One week, and 
                        it'll be gone.  Like a bad dream.

           EXT. NEW YORK BROADWAY MOVIE THEATRE -- NIGHT

           WHOOSH.  Massive KLIEG LIGHTS are turned on to illuminate a 
           MARQUEE which reads, "PSYCHO WORLD PREMIERE!"

           INT. TOWN CAR - NIGHT

           Neon blinks vulgarly, courtesy of Times Square, 1960.  Hitch, 
           silent, clearly nervous is in his trademark suit. Alma, next 
           to him in a lavish gown and white elbow-length gloves, takes 
           his hand.  They drive on in silence.

           INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - NIGHT

           The opening night CROWD watches Norman putting the car in the 
           swamp.  We hear NERVOUS TITTERS from the audience.

           INT. BACK OF THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           We move down from the projection beam and find Hitchcock, in 
           the back of the theater, standing next to Alma.  We do not 
           see any audience members, we only hear them laugh.  Hitchcock 
           seems confused by the laughter.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (whispering)
                        Why are they laughing?
           Alma doesn't find it a cause for a concern, and pats his 
           shoulder lightly to put him at ease.  More laughter.

           INT. THEATER LOBBY - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Hitch, Alma and Peggy are on their way out.  There are still 
           SCREAMS in the theatre as the show continues.

                                 PEGGY ROBERTSON
                        Here's a bit of good news.  Walt 
                        Disney announced he won't let his 
                        children see "Psycho."  That'll 
                        boost the box office.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Peggy...I probably haven't done 
                        this in too long.  Thank you for 
                        all your hard work.

           She is stunned but pleased, and so is Alma.  Peggy stays 
           behind as Hitch moves through the doors and Alma follows.

           EXT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           A mob, waiting to get in, sees Hitchcock and goes crazy.  
           Flashbulbs pop.  Alma is falling behind Hitch.

                                 WOMAN WAITING ON LINE
                        Mr. Hitchcock, how does it end?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I'm sworn to secrecy.

           He gets a laugh.  Hitch is next to a Pinkerton GUARD. 

                                 GUARD
                        Mr. Hitchcock, what do I do if my 
                        wife won't take a shower after she 
                        sees your movie.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Have her dry-cleaned.

           More laughter from the crowd.  Alma watches from a few feet 
           back.  The reporters run after Hitch as he tries to leave and 
           the people on line rush for autographs. 

           Hitch stops and sees an incredible sight.  A LINE OF PEOPLE 
           SNAKES AROUND FOUR CITY BLOCKS!

           It's a PHENOMENON.
           Hitchcock gestures for Alma to take her place next to him 
           instead of behind him, and share the moment.  She appreciates 
           it.

                                 ALMA
                        It's the biggest hit of your 
                        career, Hitch.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                             (beat)
                        Our career, Alma.

           They look at each other, then get in the limo and drive away.

           INT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - THE NEXT DAY

           The suite is filled with dozens of large flower arrangements, 
           fruit baskets, and congratulatory banners.  Alma sits at the 
           table going through a large stack of telegrams.  Hitchcock is 
           looking at newspapers.

                                 ALMA
                        Here's one from Jimmy, 
                        "Congratulations on the sold-out 
                        shows...you've outdone them all."

           She opens another.  "CONGRATULATIONS, ALMA.  LOVE, WHIT."

                        hours.

                        deserved!" Barney Balaban and your 
                        friends at Paramount Pictures.

           He goes to the window and stares out, irritated.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Trouble with Harry got fewer laughs 
                        and that was a comedy.

                                 ALMA
                        It's nervous laughter.  They're 
                        terrified.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I think the appearance of the nun 
                        at the end of Vertigo is more 
                        harrowing than anything in this.

                                 ALMA
                        Hitch, why can't you just be 
                        satisfied?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        To me...the film is like a vintage 
                        from a poor year...it's like that 
                        Cabernet we had in Nice last 
                        summer.  Not terrible but--

                                 ALMA
                        You've given them wine your whole 
                        career, but this one isn't wine, 
                        Hitch.  Don't you see?

           He is confused.

                                 ALMA
                             (pleased)
                        It's beer.

           The very notion seems to cut him.

                                 ALMA
                        Here's one from Lew Wasserman.  
                        "What will you do for an encore?"

           She finds it amusing, but Hitchcock starts to think and is 
           mortified.

           INT. CENTRAL STATE HOSPITAL WARD - DAY

           It is a cozy, nicely lit dining room.  Several non-violent 
           INMATES are eating at different round tables around the room.  
           An ATTENDANT is watching, and an ORDERLY mops the floor. 
           (Note:  There are NO female patients nor staff members.)

           Eddie is at a table with two other patients, including a soft 
           spoken older man, CHET.  Eddie is heavier, his hair is 
           whiter, and he is much more at ease than we've ever seen.  On 
           his plate: BLUE-blueberry pie and ORANGE SLICES.

                                 EDDIE
                        Blue-blueberry pie.  I love the way 
                        he puts the food coloring in the 
                        crust, makes the whole thing blue.

                                 ORDERLY
                             (to the Attendant)
                        Guess what I'm doing this weekend?

                                 ATTENDANT
                        What?

                                 ORDERLY
                        Claudine and I are driving to 
                        Chicago, staying with her folks, 
                        and we're all seeing that movie, 
                        "Psycho."

           The Attendant knows the connection, but the Orderly DOESN'T 
           know Eddie was the inspiration for Psycho, and NEITHER DOES 
           EDDIE!  He doesn't seem to pay attention to the conversation.

                                 ATTENDANT
                             (shaking his head)
                        Clive...

                                 ORDERLY
                        No, really, you heard about it?  
                        They say it's the scariest thing 
                        anyone's ever seen....can't wait.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Yeah.
                             (glancing at Eddie)
                        Want me to tell you how it ends?

                                 ORDERLY
                        Do not reveal the secret-- haven't 
                        you seen the ads?  How do you know 
                        how it ends anyway?--

           The Attendant pulls Orderly aside, and whispers to him, 
           nodding toward Eddie.  The Orderly's jaw drops!  It is the 
           coolest thing he's ever heard and he looks at Eddie like he's 
           a celebrity.  Meanwhile, Eddie yawns, content.
                                 EDDIE
                        The pie's even better than the 
                        chicken ala king!

           The Orderly takes a piece of pie from an empty spot at 
           another table and puts it in front of Eddie.

                                 ORDERLY
                        Have another piece, Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                             (surprised and touched)
                        Well that's....Thanks a lot, Clive.

           Orderly looks at him in awe.  The Attendant, finding it 
           amusing, guides his friend away to talk about Eddie.

                                 CHET
                        You really like it here, don't you?

                                 EDDIE
                        It's like I took a bottle of pop 
                        and shook it all up.  It was 
                        spraying all over and I couldn't 
                        stop it.  This place is like a 
                        cork.  This is a good place.

                                 CHET
                        I think you're the happiest guy 
                        I've ever known.  How you do it?

                                 EDDIE
                        I tell you.  You live your life, 
                        and it's hard sometimes... 
                        unbearable, almost.  Here's the 
                        secret, Chet; the big secret no one 
                        else knows or wants to tell...
                             (leaning closer, 
                              whispering)
                        There is a God.  And he's so big 
                        and powerful, he doesn't always 
                        know you're there.  It's not his 
                        fault; it's not yours.  He's God, 
                        and you're nothing more than a 
                        speck in all he's made.  
                             (he eats pie, savoring it)
                        But if you can get his 
                        attention...and he sees your 
                        suffering...he'll take care of you.

           He takes a long drink of milk.  He is content.
                                 EDDIE
                        My mother used to tell me-- She 
                        passed away, God bless her...the 
                        one thing God truly loves and 
                        understands...is suffering.
                             (thinking)
                        After all, he invented it.

           Eddie takes one more bite of blue-blueberry pie.

                                                       CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. HITCHCOCK ROSE GARDEN -- SEVERAL MONTHS LATER

           Alma is tending her garden. Hitch walks up, in his suit.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Good news.  Tomorrow we leave on a 
                        worldwide publicity campaign to 
                        promote the picture.  London, 
                        Munich, Berlin, Frankfurt, and 
                        Paris.

                                 ALMA
                        I don't have the clothes...

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        I'm buying you several new frocks 
                        on every stop.  

           She gets up off her knees.

                                 ALMA
                        It sounds like we'll be gone for 
                        weeks.  What about your next 
                        project, you'll go crazy if you're 
                        away from work that long.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        The next picture is going to be a 
                        problem. 

                                 ALMA
                             (concerned)
                        Why's that?

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Casting the female lead.  I've 
                        realized I'll never be able to find 
                        a Hitchcock blonde who is as 
                        beautiful as my wife.
                                 ALMA
                        You do realize I've waited all my 
                        life to hear you say that.

           He smiles slyly.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        And M'dam...that's why they call me 
                        "The Master of Suspense."

           He walks away from her and she turns away to fill up a 
           watering can.  He turns and looks into the camera.

                                 ALFRED HITCHCOCK
                        Of course, I could never suspect my 
                        wife of infidelity, nor would she 
                        tolerate such outlandish behavior 
                        on my part.  What you've just 
                        witnessed is the result of several 
                        poorly recalled rumors being woven 
                        into a tapestry of lies, with no 
                        forethought, solely for your 
                        entertainment.  Like "Psycho," it 
                        was only a "moo-vie."
                             (beat)
                        By the way, any viewers, including 
                        professional critics, drawing a 
                        correlation between the dessert 
                        served at Mr. Gein's mental ward 
                        and the fare served at my blue 
                        soiree, will find themselves in 
                        deep and especially hot water with 
                        my attorneys.  Now if you'll excuse 
                        me, I must begin the exhaustive 
                        search for my next project.  
                        Goodnight.
