           EXT. ORANGE COUNTY CA, 5 FREEWAY - MORNING RUSH HOUR

           It is a hot early September morning and the freeway is a 
           snarled parking lot, full to capacity with immobile, verge of 
           violence, pissed off drivers.

           INT. KENDRA HOLLOWAY’S CAR, 5 FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           KENDRA HOLLOWAY(25), pretty, conservative hair cut, is behind 
           the wheel of her five year old Ford Bronco.  Her son, 
           CONNER(7), is strapped into his booster seat in back.  

           On Kendra’s car radio, we can hear, “THE ELI WEBB SHOW,” with 
           its razor tongued conservative talk show Host, ELI WEBB.

                                 ELI (O.C.)
                        Welcome back to the program.  Let’s 
                        take a few calls.  We have, Dale, 
                        from Garden Grove.  Go ahead, Dale, 
                        you’re on, The Eli Webb Show.

           The soft, sheepish voice of DALE(30’s), can be heard calling 
           into the show.  He is clearly intimidated by Eli and 
           expecting to get his ass verbally handed to him.

                                 DALE (O.C.)
                        Oh, ah, yes, ah, Eli...?

                                 ELI (O.C.)
                        Time is money, Dale.  What do you 
                        have to say?

                                 DALE (O.C.)
                        Oh, right.  Well, as the child of a 
                        single mother, I don’t feel it’s 
                        fair of you to characterize all 
                        single mothers as irresponsible-

                                 ELI (O.C.)
                        How many times have you been in 
                        rehab, Dale? 

                                 DALE (O.C.)
                        Huh?

                                 ELI (O.C.)
                        Drug Rehabilitation clinics.  How 
                        many times have you been a patient 
                        in one?

                                 DALE (O.C.)
                        I don’t see how that’s relevant-
                                 ELI (O.C.)
                        That means many times.  How many 
                        days a week are you consensually 
                        sodomized by a man whose name you 
                        don’t know?

                                 DALE (O.C.)
                        I’m not gay.

                                 ELI (O.C.)
                        Maybe not on a regular basis, but 
                        you dabble in the stronger sex, 
                        don’t ya, Dale?

           Kendra contorts her face as she listens, clearly annoyed by 
           Eli but unable to bring herself to change the station.

                                 DALE (O.C.)
                        No.

                                 ELI (O.C.)
                        Liar liar, bisexual junky on fire.  
                        You indulge in illegal drugs and 
                        masculine strangers and countless 
                        other immoralities because you have 
                        no compass, Dale.

                                 DALE (O.C.)
                        You don’t know me-

                                 ELI (O.C.)
                        Like so many other wastes of life, 
                        inhabiting our nation’s prisons and 
                        bath houses and meth labs, you have 
                        no compass because you had no 
                        Father and most of the blame for 
                        that falls on your mother.

                                 DALE (O.C.)
                        Hold on-

                                 ELI (O.C.)
                        Oh, I know the whole sob story: 
                        your Dad abandoned her when she was 
                        pregnant or skipped town when you 
                        were a toddler and I’m not saying 
                        he’s not a slime ball but most of 
                        the blame is still your mother’s 
                        because, SHE SHOULDN’T HAVE HAD SEX 
                        WITH HIM!!!

           Before Dale can get out a syllable in response, Eli 
           disconnects the call.  Kendra’s annoyance becomes anger.
                                 ELI (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                        Thank you for your call, Dale, from 
                        Garden Grove.  We’re going to take 
                        a short commercial break and be 
                        right back on, The Eli Webb Show, 
                        Orange County’s only source of 
                        reason in a world gone completely 
                        insane.

           INT. OFFICE, PARACOM ENTERTAINMENT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           It is a large, plush conference room in the middle of a 
           large, plush office on the top of a tall building in Century 
           City.  The view from the enormous picture window stretches 
           all the way to Catalina.

           High powered, impeccably dressed Paracom Executives, 
           DREW(40’s), MARGARET(40’s) and WARREN(50’s) sit on one side 
           of the gigantic mahogany table across from ELI WEBB(40’s), 
           equal parts intellectual and Used Cars Salesman, and his 
           Agent, DAVIS(30’s), Armani suit and matching glasses.

           The Executives look at Eli knowing that they hold all the 
           cards.  Eli smiles nervously, needing badly to impress.

                                 WARREN
                        Our plan is to syndicate The Eli 
                        Webb Show in every major US market.

                                 MARGARET
                        With Ad revenue participation, you 
                        could be looking at an annual take 
                        well into eight figures.  

           Eli sneaks a subtle peak at Margaret’s pronounced cleavage 
           and she totally busts him on it.

                                 DREW
                        Throw in the book deal with our 
                        subsidiary and we’re talking nine 
                        figures.

                                 DAVIS
                        That sounds more than fair.

                                 ELI
                        Did you want me to moderate my 
                        views for a national audience?

                                 WARREN
                        No.
                                 MARGARET
                        Heck no.

                                 DREW
                        Hell no.

                                 WARREN
                        We want the, fire breathing Eli 
                        Webb.

                                 MARGARET
                        The, burn, slash, humiliate, Eli 
                        Webb.

                                 DREW
                        The, obliterate all liberals and 
                        eat their children, Eli Webb.

           Eli cringes slightly at that image.

                                 WARREN
                        More importantly, that’s what 
                        America wants.

                                 MARGARET
                        Anger.

                                 DREW
                        Domination.

                                 ELI
                        No problem.  I can do that.
                            (beat)
                        Been doin’ it for years.

           Warren leans in closer to Eli and speaks in a somewhat softer 
           tone.

                                 WARREN
                        It’s come to our attention that 
                        there are certain parts of your...
                            (cautious beat)
                        Private life, that may not be 
                        consistent with your, on air, 
                        personality.
                            (more cautious beat)
                        We would need to know that these, 
                        influences, will be kept out of the 
                        public eye.

                                 MARGARET
                        Otherwise, our position could be 
                        put in question.
                                 DREW
                        And by extension, your position.

           Eli swallows hard, knowing that he has to do and say exactly 
           what they want to see and hear.

                                 ELI
                        I practice what I preach.

           EXT. THE BARTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           It is the first day of school at the highly exclusive private 
           elementary school that looks like it required more money to 
           build than most colleges.  A procession of heavily pampered 
           children are being led out of Range Rovers by Latina Nannies 
           and up to their expansive classrooms.

           Kendra is crouched down at the entrance to the first grade 
           classroom, talking to her son, Conner who’s not sold on the 
           whole concept of school.  Kendra is trying to lovingly coax 
           Conner inside while Conner is fighting like a Gladiator to 
           keep from crying.

                                 CONNER
                        Why can’t I stay home with you, 
                        Mom?

                                 KENDRA
                        Because you’re a big boy.  Big boys 
                        go to school.

                                 CONNER
                        I’m not a big boy.  I’m little.  
                        Tiny even.

                                 KENDRA
                        You loved Kindergarten.  You’ll 
                        love first grade.

                                 CONNER
                        Kindergarten was no pressure.  
                        First grade is war.

                                 KENDRA
                        It hasn’t even started yet.

                                 CONNER
                        You could home school me.  

                                 KENDRA
                        Home schooled children grow up to 
                        have deep seeded emotional 
                        problems.
                                 CONNER
                        Our neighbor Carly is home 
                        schooled.

                                 KENDRA
                        And she chews crayons.

                                 CONNER
                        If you home school me, I promise I 
                        won’t chew crayons.

           Conner feels a tear start to form around his eye and quickly 
           wipes it away.

                                 KENDRA
                        That’s a very generous offer, big 
                        guy but you’re going to school 
                        because you will flourish in school 
                        and grow into a brilliant, free 
                        thinking, self assured young man.

                                 CONNER
                        Talk about pressure.

           Kendra brings her face an inch away from Conner’s face and 
           smiles with a warmth and confidence that makes Conner’s fear 
           melt away.  Their bond is deep and undeniable.

                                 KENDRA
                        No one on earth knows you better 
                        than I do and do you know why?

                                 CONNER
                        Why?

                                 KENDRA
                        Because you came from my body.  
                        We’re connected.  You are always 
                        right here-

           She points to her heart.

                                 KENDRA (CONT'D)
                        And I am always right here-

           She points to Conner’s heart.

                                 KENDRA (CONT'D)
                        If you’re ever sad or lonely or in 
                        trouble, I will know and I’ll be 
                        there to help you through it.
                                 CONNER
                        Forever?

                                 KENDRA
                        And a day.

           Conner takes a deep breath, looking inside the classroom and 
           considering his options.

                                 CONNER
                        Okay.  I’ll tough it out.

                                 KENDRA
                        That’s my boy.

           Conner starts to walk inside.

                                 KENDRA (CONT'D)
                        Conner.

           He turns around and faces his mother.

                                 KENDRA (CONT'D)
                        I love you.

                                 CONNER
                        We’re being watched here.

           Conner quickly turns back around and joins the class.  Kendra 
           beams with pride, fights back a tear herself and turns around 
           and walks towards the parking lot.

           C.U. BIG SCREEN TELEVISION

           It is a cooking show with celebrity Chef, TORI HANSON-
           WEBB(30’s), very pretty, roboticly jovial, demonstrating how 
           to make key lime pie for an enraptured studio audience.  
           Tori’s colorful apron reads, “COOKING WITH TORI.”

                                 TORI
                        Now you want to grate some of the 
                        lime peel into the key lime pie to 
                        really give it that pop.  You know 
                        what I’m talking about when I say, 
                        pop, don’t ya?

           The audience members all yell, “YES” in perfect unison.

                                                      PULL BACK TO:
           INT. PLUSH DANA POINT HOME, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sitting five feet in front of the enormous television is Tori 
           Hanson-Webb, watching her own performance with strong focus.

                                 TORI
                        Lower angle.  I need a lower angle. 
                            (beat)
                        What do you think, honey?

           Tori turns towards the kitchen where her husband, Eli Webb, 
           is standing on the marble floor, eating potato chips off the 
           granite counter top and drinking an imported beer.

                                 TORI (CONT'D)
                        Eli...?

                                 ELI
                        Yeah?

                                 TORI
                        You’re the marketing genius.  Do 
                        you think I need a lower camera 
                        angle?

           Eli responds without even looking up, as if by pure instinct.

                                 ELI
                        Stay with the middle shot.  You 
                        want your audience to feel your 
                        accessible.

           Tori smiles.  He was listening and she’s impressed by his 
           insight.

           The front door opens and in walk Eli and Tori’s son, 
           REAGAN(7), noticeably quiet, painfully shy, with his Nanny, 
           LETICIA(35), thick Mexican accent.  Eli sees his son and 
           smiles too widely at him.

                                 ELI (CONT'D)
                        Hey, Reagan.  How was the first day 
                        of school?

                                 REAGAN
                        Fine.

                                 TORI
                            (without looking up)
                        Hi, Reagan.

                                 REAGAN
                        Hi.
           Reagan walks through the kitchen with his head down, making 
           no eye contact with either of his parents.

                                 ELI
                        Want to shoot some hoops with me?

                                 LETICIA
                        We have our Spanish lesson now, 
                        Mister Eli.

           Reagan starts to walk upstairs with his head still down.

                                 ELI
                        Oh.  Right.  How about in an hour? 

                                 LETICIA
                        His Piano teacher will be here.

                                 ELI
                        Oh.  Right.  Maybe tonight we can 
                        play the new XBox I got ya?

                                 REAGAN
                        I don’t like video games.

           Reagan walks up the stairs and out of frame.  Leticia follows 
           behind him.  Eli looks at Tori in disbelief.

                                 ELI
                        Our son doesn’t like video games.

                                 TORI
                        Next time, you might want to try 
                        talking to him for five minutes 
                        before you buy his present.

                                 ELI
                            (to himself:)
                        What the fuck kind of seven year 
                        old boy doesn’t like video games?

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The bedroom is pitch dark except for a shaft of light from 
           the window, shining on the bed and the face of, Kendra 
           Holloway who looks bored out of her mind.  She is in the 
           middle of having sex with her husband, TREVOR HOLLOWAY(30), 
           clean cut, equally bored.

           Kendra lies on her back and if it weren’t for her blinking 
           eyes, you would think she was a corpse.  Trevor is slowly 
           pumping away on top of Kendra, too embarrassed and 
           uncomfortable to look her in the eye or attempt to kiss her.
           After a few seconds, Trevor lets out a moan as he climaxes.  
           Kendra gives a brief look of relief while Trevor rolls off of 
           her, still unable to meet her eyes.

                                 TREVOR
                        Thanks, honey.

                                 KENDRA
                        No problem.

           Kendra turns away from her husband and closes her eyes, 
           preparing for sleep.

           EXT. ORANGE COUNTY CA, 5 FREEWAY - MORNING RUSH HOUR

           The cars are once again proceeding at a sloth’s pace down the 
           freeway. 

           INT. TREVOR HOLLOWAY’S CAR, 5 FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Trevor is behind the wheel of his Ford F150 with, “Holloway 
           Pools” written on the outside of the driver’s side door.  
           Playing on Trevor’s car radio is, “The Eli Webb Show.”

                                 ELI (O.C.)
                            (whiner voice:)
                        “Oh, global warming.  Global 
                        warming.  Our planet is dying.”
                            (angry voice:)
                        I swear, if I hear one more mealy 
                        mouthed, unshaven, grow your own, 
                        Berkley Professor, cry and moan 
                        about, global warming, I’m going to 
                        drive my Lincoln Navigator right 
                        over his free range, organic ass!

           Just like Kendra, Trevor is irritated by Eli Webb but unable 
           to bring himself to change the station.

           EXT. IRVINE CA, HOLLOWAY POOLS - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           It is a modest office front in a small strip mall.

           INT. HOLLOWAY POOLS, TREVOR’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Trevor sits behind his cluttered desk inside his cramped 
           office with pictures all over the walls of the variety of 
           pools his company has in construction.  There is a posed 
           family photograph on the desk of Trevor, Kendra and Conner, 
           huddled closely together and smiling like the ideal white 
           bread American family.
           Sitting in the chair across from Trevor’s desk is, 
           BRITTANY(22), far from beautiful but skillfully milks every 
           last drop of her sex appeal.  Trevor looks over Brittany’s 
           job application in confusion because it appears to be blank.

                                 TREVOR
                        Okay, Brittany; do you have any 
                        secretarial experience?

                                 BRITTANY
                        Nope.

                                 TREVOR
                        Have you ever worked in an office 
                        before?

                                 BRITTANY
                        Nope.

                                 TREVOR
                        Have you ever worked for a Pool 
                        contractor before?

                                 BRITTANY
                        Nope.

                                 TREVOR
                        Are you qualified with Microsoft 
                        Office software?

                                 BRITTANY
                        I have no idea what that is.

                                 TREVOR
                        What work experience do you have?

                                 BRITTANY
                        Deja Vu, in Carson.

           Trevor sighs deeply, wrestling his impatience.

                                 TREVOR
                        The ad I placed for a Secretary 
                        asked for only people with office 
                        experience.

                                 BRITTANY
                        I suck cock better than anyone who 
                        ever lived.

           Trevor draws back in shock but then thinks about it for a 
           second.  A long, silent beat passes.
                                 TREVOR
                        I’ll need you to prove that.

           INT. KATY SLATE’S BAR - DAY

           It’s the kind of small, run down, anonymous bar that caters 
           to cirrhosis sufferers.  The half dozen half dead patrons 
           appear chemically fused with the cheap furniture.

           Drinking Scotch alone at a small table is, BILLY(40’s), bald, 
           unclean, considers the bar his home office.  He is watching a 
           baseball game on the television above the bartender’s head.

           JONAH(35), happy go lucky, moderately successful Bookie, 
           walks over and sits down with Billy.  The nearly comatose 
           Waitress brings over Jonah’s usual shot of tequila and plunks 
           it down on the table, spilling a third of it in the process.

                                 JONAH
                        Billy.

                                 BILLY
                        Jonah.

                                 JONAH
                        Didn’t I tell you that only Special 
                        Olympians bet on baseball?  Makes 
                        football look predictable.

           Billy pulls an envelope out of his jacket pocket and slides 
           it over to Jonah.  Jonah looks surprised and peaks inside the 
           envelope, very impressed by what he sees.

                                 Jonah (cont’d)
                        Paid in full.  I’ll be a monkey’s 
                        fuck buddy.

                                 BILLY
                        Five games I want to bet this week.

           Jonah puts the envelope of money in his jacket and takes out 
           a note pad and pencil.

                                 JONAH
                        Or you could just toss the money 
                        down a storm drain.

                                 BILLY
                        Phillies over the Giants-

           Jonah marks down each bet in his note pad as Billy says it.
                                 Billy (cont’d)
                        Brewers over the Cardinals.  Angels 
                        over the Blue Jays.  Tigers over 
                        the A’s.  Indians over the Orioles.

                                 JONAH
                        Dimes?

                                 BILLY
                        Quarters.

           Jonah’s eyes get really big when he hears the size of the 
           bet.  He puts his note pad back into his jacket and downs his 
           shot of tequila.

                                 JONAH
                        You gonna tell me how you’ve come 
                        to your sudden and uncharacteristic 
                        wealth?

                                 BILLY
                        No.

           INT. KENDRA AND TREVOR’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The television in the bedroom has, “Cooking With Tori,” on.  
           Tori is placing sliced apples inside an uncooked apple pie 
           very carefully and smiling in her big fake TV smile.

                                 TORI
                        If you space the apples too closely 
                        together they will bulge into each 
                        other when they’re cooked.  And we 
                        can’t have that now, can we?

           Trevor, with a very guilty look on his face, is getting 
           dressed into sweat pants and a T-shirt with his back to 
           Kendra who’s lying in bed and leafing through a magazine.

                                 KENDRA
                        Did you hire a secretary today?

           Trevor’s look of guilt multiplies by ten.  He’s very careful 
           to keep his back to Kendra.

                                 TREVOR
                        Huh?

                                 KENDRA
                        A secretary.  You were interviewing 
                        candidates today.

           Trevor swallows hard and treads lightly.
                                 TREVOR
                        Oh.  Ah, yeah.  I hired one.
                            (beat)
                        Brittany.

                                 KENDRA
                        What’s she like?

                                 TREVOR
                        Old.  Fat.

                                 KENDRA
                        I don’t care what she looks like.  
                        What kind of experience does she 
                        have?

                                 TREVOR
                        Lots.  Worked for a pool contractor 
                        for ten years.  In Arizona.  Before 
                        she moved here.  With her husband.

                                 KENDRA
                        That’s great.

                                 TREVOR
                        Yeah.  I think she’s going to work 
                        out.

           EXT. HUNTINGTON BEACH PIER - DAY

           Eli, wearing big sunglasses and hat pulled low over his head, 
           sits morosely on a bench in the middle of the pier.  Seagulls 
           fly over his head and roller bladers whiz past his bench.  He 
           checks out a hot female roller blader a little too long.  

           After a moment, Billy, baseball gambler from Katy Slate’s 
           bar, sits down next to Eli, holding a paper bag.  Eli looks 
           at Billy and bristles with hostility.

                                 BILLY
                        How ya doin’, Eli?

                                 ELI
                        Let’s make this quick.  Being near 
                        you gives me a rash.

                                 BILLY
                        That’s funny.  The conservative 
                        pundit thing doesn’t work out you 
                        should audition at the Improv.
                                 ELI
                        You’ve been paid.  I understood 
                        that to be the last I’d ever hear 
                        from you.

                                 BILLY
                        I’ve become aware of new 
                        information.

                                 ELI
                        What kind of information?

                                 BILLY
                        About your daughter.

                                 ELI
                        Okay...?

                                 BILLY
                        Your illegitimate daughter, Kendra.  
                        Just in case you’d forgotten about 
                        her.

           Billy reaches into the paper bag, pulls out a photograph of 
           Kendra as a one year old and shows it to Eli.  Billy clearly 
           enjoys torturing Eli.

                                 ELI
                        You showed that to me last time.

                                 BILLY
                        Kendra Wilkerson.  Whose single 
                        Mother, Helen Wilkerson, you de-
                        flowered, impregnated and dumped 
                        twenty five years ago without even 
                        a thank you note.

           Billy takes out a twenty five year old photograph of, HELEN 
           WILKERSON(18), pretty, happy, smiling, and shows it to Eli 
           who is becoming very annoyed at going over all of this a 
           second time.

                                 ELI
                        What’s the new information?

                                 BILLY
                        Your baby girl, Kendra, grew up to 
                        have a successful career in film...

           Billy pulls out a video tape and puts it right in Eli’s face.  
           The glossy box cover reads, “DIRTY DEEDS,” with title in 
           large print.  
                                 Billy (cont’d)
                        Adult film.

           The Porn Actress on the box cover IS KENDRA HOLLOWAY, at 
           eighteen years old, with flowing bleached platinum blonde 
           hair and double D breast implants.  She is wearing a 
           miniscule dress and a, I’m raring to rip somebody’s clothes 
           off, look in her eye.

           Under the title, “DIRTY DEEDS,” the cover reads, “STARRING, 
           NINA NAUGHTY.”

                                 Billy (cont’d)
                        Her porn name was, Nina Naughty, 
                        which I must say I find kind of 
                        catchy.  I’m told she had an open 
                        back door policy but, of course, I 
                        myself haven’t seen any of her 
                        work, so I couldn’t say for sure.

                                 ELI
                        You’re full a shit.  This is a 
                        fucking shake down.

                                 BILLY
                        Fine.  Don’t believe me.  Look it 
                        up for yourself.  The internet’s a 
                        vast and wondrous universe.

           Billy puts the video and pictures back in the paper bag and 
           stands up.

                                 Billy (cont’d)
                        I’ve got five different tabloids on 
                        speed dial.  A hundred thousand 
                        cash, tomorrow noon, or you and the 
                        cum chugging fruit of your loins 
                        will be on display on every 
                        supermarket counter in America.

           Billy turns and walks away.  Eli watches him leave like it 
           requires every ounce of his strength to keep from jumping off 
           the bench and beating Billy to death with his shoe.

           INT. ELI’S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

           Eli makes sure the office door is locked and then sits down 
           at his computer.  He gets up the Google screen and types, 
           “Nina Naughty” into the search box.
           After a couple seconds, three hundred sites pop up.  The 
           first one reads, “Nina Naughty, Porn Star, full biography and 
           filmography.”  Eli clicks on that one and after a second a 
           picture pops up of Kendra, looking like she did on the porn 
           video box cover but in a different sexy pose and wearing a 
           bikini.

           Eli scrolls down to the biography, scanning through the 
           information until he comes to, “Born: Kendra Elaine 
           Wilkerson, Anaheim California, 1981.”

           As Eli reads this information his face turns five different 
           shades of gray.  Finally, he leans back in his chair and 
           stares at the wall like he just took an uppercut from Mike 
           Tyson.

                                 ELI
                        Ah...fuck me.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           It is an expansive park with several large play structures 
           and a beautiful view of the mountains.  Kendra is pushing 
           Conner in a swing.

                                 KENDRA
                        Don’t you think it’s about time you 
                        started calling Trevor, Dad?

                                 CONNER
                        He’s not my Dad.

                                 KENDRA
                        He’s your step Dad.  

                                 CONNER
                        What is my real Dad like?

           The question hits Kendra like an elbow in the stomach.  She 
           fights valiantly to appear unaffected.

                                 KENDRA
                        We’ve talked about him before.

                                 CONNER
                        Not really.

                                 KENDRA
                        What do you want to know?

           A clean cut man, KEITH(30’s), leads his five year old 
           daughter onto the swing next to Conner’s and starts pushing 
           her.
                                 CONNER
                        Everything.

                                 KENDRA
                        I wish I could tell you your real 
                        Dad’s a seven foot tall triathlete 
                        with a heart of gold but no such 
                        luck, pal.

           Keith steals glances over at Kendra as if he recognizes her.  
           Kendra instinctively turns her face away from him.

                                 CONNER
                        So, my real Dad’s an ass wipe?

                                 KENDRA
                        Language.

                                 CONNER
                        Sorry.

           Keith stops pushing his daughter and takes two steps towards 
           Kendra with a big smile on his face.

                                 KEITH
                        Excuse me?  Have you been in 
                        commercials?

           Kendra answers Keith without looking at him.

                                 KENDRA
                        No.

                                 KEITH
                        Were you on one of those reality 
                        shows?

                                 KENDRA
                        No.

                                 KEITH
                        I know I’ve seen you on TV. 

           Kendra gets a look of extreme dread and quickly stops 
           Conner’s swing, pulling him off.

                                 KENDRA
                        Nope.  Not me.
                            (to Conner:)
                        Time to go, buddy.

                                 CONNER
                        We just got here.
           Kendra grabs Conner’s hand and starts to strongly lead him 
           towards the parking lot.

                                 KENDRA
                        It’s getting dark.

                                 CONNER
                            (re: the high sun)
                        Dark?

           As they start to walk away, it dawns on Keith that he’s seen 
           Kendra in porn movies.  He smirks like the cat who caught the 
           canary.

                                 KEITH
                        Oh.  Yeah.  Now I remember.

           Kendra picks up her pace, almost dragging Conner away.

                                 KEITH (CONT'D)
                        Love your work.

                                 KENDRA
                        Fuck off!

                                 CONNER
                        Language.

                                 KENDRA
                        Sorry.

           INT. BILLY’S CAR, 5 FREEWAY - MORNING RUSH HOUR

           Billy sits behind the wheel of his ten year old, beat to shit 
           Honda Accord, looking very impatient about the traffic.  On 
           his car radio, we can hear, The Eli Webb Show.

                                 ELI (O.C.)
                        Just keep it in your pants.  We’re 
                        not water buffaloes.  We’re human 
                        beings.  Men who father children 
                        they can’t care for should spend 
                        years in prison and women who bed 
                        down with these Cretans should be 
                        sterilized.  They’re not having 
                        children, they’re mass producing 
                        the un-guided missiles that are 
                        laying waste to our culture!  
                        Think, before you take your clothes 
                        off!  There are consequences to 
                        your lack of impulse control!  
                        Global consequences!
           Billy smiles at the irony of Eli’s rant.

           EXT. HUNTINGTON BEACH PIER - DAY

           Eli sits on the same bench as before, looking even more 
           morose.  This time, he’s the one holding the full paper bag.  
           After a second, Billy walks over and sits down next to Eli.

                                 BILLY
                        No one can say you’re not a 
                        pragmatist.

                                 ELI
                        I need a guarantee that this is the 
                        last I will ever hear from you.

                                 BILLY
                        I swear that this is the last you 
                        will ever hear from me.  Unless I 
                        become aware of new information.

           Eli looks furious but then sighs, realizing that’s the best 
           he’s going to get and reluctantly hands Billy the paper bag.  
           Billy looks inside and counts the money without taking it 
           out.  Satisfied it’s the full amount, Billy smiles very 
           widely and stands up.

                                 Billy (cont’d)
                        I hear the show’s going into 
                        syndication.  Good luck with that.

           Billy walks quickly away without looking back.  Eli stares 
           out at the ocean, looking deeply defeated.

           INT. LOW RENT NURSING HOME - DAY

           It is a poorly maintained, understaffed, overpopulated 
           nursing home.  The sleeping quarters are lined with single 
           beds filled with elderly, and/or, infirm patients.

           Kendra is sitting next to one of the beds and feeding her 
           mother, HELEN WILKERSON(40’s), decrepit Multiple Sclerosis 
           sufferer in a wheel chair, almost completely paralyzed from 
           the neck down.  We can only recognize Helen a little from the 
           twenty five year old picture we saw of her.  

           Helen’s head slumps to one side and she’s only able to open 
           her mouth part way as Kendra spoons in baby food.  On a small 
           hand held radio by Helen’s bed, “The Eli Webb Show” is on.
                                 ELI (O.C.)
                        Children are not born with a sense 
                        of right and wrong!  It is given to 
                        them by their parents!

           Kendra shakes her head in amazement and turns off the radio.

                                 KENDRA
                        He left you broke and pregnant but 
                        you’re still his number one fan.

           Helen smiles faintly.  No matter what Eli did to her, she 
           will carry a torch for him till the day she dies.  She speaks 
           to Kendra through partially paralyzed vocal chords.

                                 HELEN
                        Different strokes.

           The Nursing Home Orderly walks up quickly to Kendra.  THE 
           ORDERLY IS, BILLY, ELI’S BLACKMAILER, wearing rubber 
           gloves, rubber shoes and a white jacket with his name tag on 
           it.  Kendra looks at Billy with irritation.

                                 KENDRA
                        It’s about time.  You’re supposed 
                        to be doing this.

                                 BILLY
                        Sorry, I’m all alone.  Henry quit 
                        yesterday and Maria called in sick.

           Kendra stands up and hands the baby food to Billy who sits 
           down and starts feeding Helen, talking to her with genuine 
           affection and it’s clear that they’ve developed a bond.

                                 Billy (cont’d)
                        Hi ya, Helen.  How’s my girl today?

                                 HELEN
                        Peachy.

                                 BILLY
                        You are always the highlight of my 
                        day.

           Kendra looks around at the dilapidated condition of the 
           Nursing Home, none too happy about where her Mother is.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           It is a spacious, spotless office with volumes of medical 
           journals on the shelves and a collage of framed diplomas on 
           the wall from every University in the Ivy League.
           Eli sits in the chair across from the desk, looking bored.  
           After a second, the door opens and in walks, DR. JAMES 
           ACKERMAN(55), distinguished, sensitive, in his white lab 
           coat.  He shakes Eli’s hand with a warm expression but no 
           smile.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        Hey, buddy.  Thanks for coming in.

           Dr. Ackerman walks around and sits behind his desk, seeming 
           to have to work to look Eli in the eye.

                                 ELI
                        Nothing brings me greater joy than 
                        waiting for an hour in a doctor’s 
                        office.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        Sorry about that.  The lab results 
                        from your physical came back.

                                 ELI
                        You could have guilted me about my 
                        cholesterol over the phone.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        I didn’t call you down here to talk 
                        about your cholesterol.

                                 ELI
                        Okay.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        I’ve been your Doctor for a long 
                        time.

                                 ELI
                        You’re scaring me, Jim.  If this is 
                        just about my hemorrhoids I’m going 
                        to be really pissed.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        You’re HIV positive.

           The life seems to drain completely out of Eli’s body and he 
           struggles momentarily to keep from falling out of his chair.

                                 ELI
                        What?

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        You’re HIV positive, Eli.
                                 ELI
                        That’s...not...possible...

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        We need to start you on a course of 
                        AZT right away.  There’s a few 
                        other proteas inhibitors I’d like 
                        to include that have shown success 
                        in trials.  It’s called, the 
                        cocktail.

                                 ELI
                        It’s got to be a mistake.  I, can 
                        not have HIV.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        I checked it myself three times.  
                        But you’re more than welcome to get 
                        it re-tested.

                                 ELI
                        I’m not gay.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        Viruses don’t discriminate.

                                 ELI
                        You’re not hearing me.  I’m Eli 
                        fucking Webb.  I can’t have AIDS.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        You don’t have AIDS.  You have HIV, 
                        the virus that causes AIDS.  And if 
                        you deal with it accordingly, 
                        decades will pass before it ever 
                        becomes AIDS.

           Eli is rocked even more by Dr. Ackerman’s tone.  He blinks 
           several times like he’s hoping to awaken from this nightmare.  
           Dr. Ackerman looks at him even more urgently.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
                        Eli, it’s absolutely crucial that 
                        anyone you’ve had unprotected 
                        sexual contact with in the last 
                        three years be tested as soon as 
                        possible.

           Eli isn’t able to hear Dr. Ackerman’s words, having now put 
           his brain on autopilot.
                                 DR. ACKERMAN (cont’d)
                        I’ll give you a minute alone.  When 
                        I come back we can discuss your AZT 
                        schedule.

           Dr. Ackerman looks at Eli for confirmation but sees that he’s 
           on auto pilot.  He gets up from behind the desk and exits the 
           office, leaving Eli all alone.

           Eli stares at the wall with the same look he had after he 
           found out that Kendra was a porn star.

                                 ELI
                        Ah...fuck me.

           INT. KENDRA AND TREVOR’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Kendra and Trevor are sitting up in bed reading books.

                                 KENDRA
                        I need to put Mom in a nicer 
                        nursing home.

                                 TREVOR
                        It’s got to come out of your end.  
                        I’m squeezed to capacity.

                                 KENDRA
                        My savings can only cover Conner’s 
                        school.

           Trevor looks at Kendra with judgmental eyes.

                                 TREVOR
                        All those years, doing what you 
                        did, you’d think you’d have more to 
                        show for it.

           Kendra looks deeply ashamed.  A long silent beat passes 
           between them.

                                 KENDRA
                        I was recognized today.

                                 TREVOR
                        Where?

                                 KENDRA
                        The park.

                                 TREVOR
                        With Conner?  
                                 KENDRA
                        Yeah.  But he didn’t get it.

                                 TREVOR
                        Lucky.

                                 KENDRA
                        Very lucky.
                            (beat)  
                        Maybe I should change my hair.  
                        Again.

                                 TREVOR
                        There’s always going to be some 
                        jerk off who recognizes you.

           Trevor looks at Kendra with somewhat judgmental eyes.  Kendra 
           looks deeply hurt and she turns away from him, shuts off her 
           light and puts her head down on the pillow to sleep.

                                 KENDRA
                        Good night.

           Trevor looks at Kendra for a long moment, conducting a mental 
           debate on wether or not to try for sex.  Finally, he realizes 
           it would be fruitless and turns away from her, shuts off his 
           light and puts his head down on the pillow to sleep.

                                 TREVOR
                        Good night.

           INT. ELI’S DANA POINT HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Eli sits on the couch in his living room, looking like he 
           just came back from war.  He stares straight ahead, not 
           moving a single fiber in his body and appears as if he’s been 
           sitting in the same spot with the same expression for hours.

           Leticia, Reagan’s nanny, walks through the hallway and stops, 
           startled to see Eli on the couch.

                                 LETICIA
                        Oh.  Mr. Eli.  I did not see you 
                        there.  You no work today?

                                 ELI
                        No.

                                 LETICIA
                        Well, I see you later.

           Leticia starts to leave.
                                 Eli
                        Are you picking up Reagan at 
                        school?

                                 LETICIA
                        Yes.

                                 ELI
                        I’d like to pick him up.  If that’s 
                        okay.

           Leticia looks at Eli like he just asked her if he can wear a 
           dress and sing Ethel Merman songs.

                                 LETICIA
                        Ah...okay.

                                 ELI
                        Great.  Thanks.

           Eli gets up from the couch and walks towards the front door.

           EXT. THE BARTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, PLAYGROUND - DAY

           It is pick up time at the school as children are being led 
           out of the classrooms by their nannies and towards the 
           parking lot.  

           Conner is playing on a play structure WITH REAGAN, ELI’S SON.  
           Kendra stands near by, watching.  Reagan’s shy nature seems 
           to diminish somewhat around Conner. 

                                 CONNER
                        Mom, can me and Reagan have a play 
                        date at our house?

                                 KENDRA
                        We have to ask his nanny.

           In the background, Eli walks past the classrooms in a fog 
           since it’s the first time he’s ever been to the school in his 
           life.  He finally looks out at the playground and spots 
           Reagan playing with Conner.

                                 ELI
                        Hey, Reagan.  Ready to get going?

           Reagan looks very strangely at his Father, having more 
           expected the Easter Bunny.  Kendra hasn’t spotted Eli coming 
           towards her yet because she’s still watching Conner.
                                 REAGAN
                            (to Eli:)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ELI
                        Can’t your Dad pick you up once in 
                        a while?

           KENDRA TURNS AND LOOKS AT ELI.  When she realizes who he is, 
           her mouth falls wide open and her knees buckle.  She stares 
           at her Father as if he might be a mirage.  

           Eli glances at Kendra like she’s any other parent or nanny.

                                 Eli (cont’d)
                            (to Kendra:)
                        How ya doin’?
                            (to Reagan:)
                        Let’s go, buddy.

                                 REAGAN
                        Conner wants me to come to his 
                        house for a play date.

                                 ELI
                        Oh.

           Eli turns to Kendra who has to sit down on the swing to keep 
           from passing out.

                                 Eli (cont’d)
                        Are you, Conner’s Mom?

           Kendra can’t generate any sound above a whisper.

                                 KENDRA
                        Ah huh.

                                 ELI
                        Have we met?

                                 KENDRA
                        No.

                                 ELI
                        You look really familiar.

                                 KENDRA
                        That’s probably because half my DNA 
                        is yours.
           Eli is stunned by this and takes a much closer look at 
           Kendra, finally recognizing her from the porn movie box 
           cover.

                                 ELI
                        Holy...Mary Mother of God.

           Kendra lets out a sickly giggle and falls back slightly in 
           the swing, catching herself just before she hits the ground.  
           Conner looks at his Mom and knows right away that something’s 
           wrong.

                                 CONNER
                        Mom?  Are you okay?

           Kendra takes a gigantic deep breath, regaining her composure 
           somewhat and addresses Conner while looking very seriously at 
           Eli.

                                 KENDRA
                        Conner.  This is your Grandfather.

           Eli is now fighting mightily himself to keep from passing 
           out.  Conner looks Eli over from head to toe like an 
           Inspector who’s not completely sold on the quality of the 
           item he’s inspecting.

           Then, after a couple seconds, something strange occurs to 
           Conner and he looks at Reagan in an entirely new light.

                                 CONNER
                            (to Reagan:)
                        Wait.  That means you’re my...?

                                 KENDRA
                        Uncle.

           INT. ELI’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Eli drives his Lexus LS 430 down the street looking like he’d 
           give a kidney for a tranquilizer.  Reagan sits in his booster 
           seat in the back looking deeply confused.  

           Reagan is very uncomfortable talking to his Father but 
           struggles through it because he so badly needs his questions 
           answered.

                                 REAGAN
                        So, Conner’s Mom is my...sister?

                                 ELI
                        Yes.
           Reagan starts doing the math in his head.

                                 REAGAN
                        Then, Mom had Conner’s Mom when she 
                        was ten?

                                 ELI
                        Mom is not Conner’s Mom’s Mom.

                                 REAGAN
                        You had a baby with someone else?

                                 ELI
                        Yes.

                                 REAGAN
                        Were you married to Conner’s Mom’s 
                        Mom before you married Mom?

                                 ELI
                        No.

                                 REAGAN
                        Did you pay child support?

                                 ELI
                        Where did you learn about child 
                        support?

                                 REAGAN
                        Most of the kids in my class have 
                        Dads that pay child support.

                                 ELI
                        I didn’t pay any child support.

                                 REAGAN
                        Then, you’re a dead beat Dad.

                                 ELI
                        Where did you learn about dead beat 
                        Dads?

                                 REAGAN
                        “VH1 Behind the Music - Bobby 
                        Brown.”

                                 ELI
                        No more television.
           INT. KENDRA AND TREVOR’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Kendra is cleaning the kitchen with a great deal of hostility 
           in every scrub.  Conner is in the den, playing with a giant 
           toy castle.

           On the small television on the kitchen counter, “COOKING WITH 
           TORI” IS PLAYING, with Tori displaying a newly completed tart 
           along with her enormous manufactured smile.

                                 TORI
                        Like a lot of things in life, so 
                        much of a tart is in the 
                        presentation.

           Trevor walks into the kitchen looking exhausted after a long 
           day of digging swimming pools.

                                 TREVOR
                        Hey.

                                 KENDRA
                            (without looking up:)
                        Hey.

           Trevor puts a warm grin on his face and steps towards Conner.

                                 TREVOR
                        Hey, Conner.

                                 CONNER
                        Hey, Trevor.
                            (beat)
                        Dad.

                                 TREVOR
                        How was your day today, buddy?

                                 CONNER
                        Good.  My Teacher brought a live 
                        gopher snake to school, I met my 
                        Grandfather and Mom took me to 
                        Chuck E. Cheese.

                                 TREVOR
                        Whoa.  Hold on.  What was that 
                        about your Grandfather?

                                 CONNER
                        I met him in the school playground.

           Trevor turns to Kendra in complete bewilderment.
                                 TREVOR
                        Huh?

                                 KENDRA
                        Can we put off talking about it?  
                        Say, forever?

           INT. ELI’S AGENT’S OFFICE - DAY

           It is a very large, plush office overlooking Beverly Hills.  
           Eli’s Agent, Davis, sits behind his desk, answering emails.  
           Eli is standing up across the room and staring out the window 
           in deep, depressed thought.

                                 DAVIS
                        So?  Buddy?  You ready?

                                 ELI
                        For what?

                                 DAVIS
                        Your debut.  National syndication. 
                            (off his look:)
                        If you tell me you forgot it was 
                        tomorrow, I’ll be very concerned.

                                 ELI
                        I didn’t forget.

                                 DAVIS
                        So you ready?

                                 ELI
                        Ready as I’ll ever be.

           Davis gets a look of worry and stands up, walking over closer 
           to Eli.

                                 DAVIS
                        The single biggest day of your 
                        career and you act like you’re 
                        going to the Dentist.

                                 ELI
                        Did you know that, Eli Webb, isn’t 
                        my real name?
                            (beat)
                        It’s, Richard Sullivan.
                            (beat)
                        Even my wife calls me, Eli.

                                 DAVIS
                        Of course I know.  I’m your Agent.
                                 ELI
                        What was wrong with, Richard 
                        Sullivan?  Why doesn’t, Richard 
                        Sullivan sound right wing enough?

                                 DAVIS
                        Gotta give the audience what they 
                        want.

                                 ELI
                        Everything about me is bull shit.

           Davis gets up very close to Eli and smiles warmly at him like 
           he’s the best friend he’ll ever have.

                                 DAVIS
                        Eli.  Richard.  My friend and 
                        comrade.  You’re in show business.  
                        You know this as well as anyone.

                                 ELI
                        I know this better than anyone.

           INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

           Kendra is wheeling a full shopping cart down the isle with 
           Conner walking alongside her.

                                 CONNER
                        Why haven’t I ever met my 
                        grandfather before?

                                 KENDRA
                        Because I never met him before.

                                 CONNER
                        Was he a bad father?

                                 KENDRA
                        He was no father at all.

           Kendra looks up and sees two FRAT BOYS(early twenties), 
           standing at the end of the aisle and staring at her.  She 
           quickly turns her head away from them and pushes her cart in 
           the opposite direction.

                                 CONNER
                        We already went this way.

                                 KENDRA
                        I forgot something.
           The Frat Boys smirk at each other and follow Kendra.  Kendra 
           turns the corner and breathes a sigh of relief when she 
           doesn’t see them behind her.  She looks up at the rows of 
           canned vegetables.

                                 KENDRA (cont’d)
                        Here we go, lima beans.

                                 CONNER
                        I hope that’s a joke.

           Kendra turns back to the isle and the two Frat Boys are 
           standing right in front of her with big shit eating grins on 
           their faces.

                                 FRAT BOY#1
                        Excuse me?  My friend and I have to 
                        know.  Are you, Nina Naughty?

           Kendra is mortified but tries to play it cool for Conner.

                                 KENDRA
                        I don’t know who that is.

                                 FRAT BOY#1
                        Come on, I know it’s you.  I’ve 
                        seen every one of your videos.  
                        Many times.

                                 KENDRA
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

           Seeing that Kendra is getting irritated, Frat Boy #2 grabs 
           #1’s sleeve to go. 

                                 FRAT BOY#2
                        Come on, dude.  It’s not her.

                                 FRAT BOY#1
                            (to his friend:)
                        Yes it is!  I’m sure of it!
                            (to Kendra:)
                        Please, if you could let me get a 
                        picture of us together, it would 
                        make my year.

           Kendra looks at Conner who is very confused by all of this. 
           She whispers to the Frat Boy out of ear shot of her son.

                                 KENDRA
                        Do you mind?  I’m with my kid here.
           The Frat Boy ignores Kendra and takes a camera cell phone out 
           of his pocket, handing it to his friend.

                                 FRAT BOY#1
                        I’m begging you: one quick picture 
                        of us together. 

           Kendra’s face turns to stone and she looks at Frat Boy#1 with 
           venom in her eyes, still speaking to him out of ear shot of 
           Conner.

                                 KENDRA
                        Get the fuck away from me, you 
                        dickless piece a shit.

           Instead of scaring him off, this infuriates Frat Boy#1 and he 
           gets right back in Kendra’s face.

                                 FRAT BOY#1
                        Lick my balls, you tore up skank.

           Frat Boy #1 takes the camera phone back and snaps a quick 
           picture of Kendra by herself.  Then he grins powerfully in 
           her face and walks away.  

           Kendra is utterly devastated.  She turns slowly to Conner, 
           seeing that he is on the verge of tears.  

           She has absolutely no idea what to say to her son.

           INT. HOLLOWAY POOLS - DAY

           Brittany sits behind a desk in a small office connected to 
           Trevor’s office.  She is reading a magazine while the phone 
           rings off the hook.

           Trevor walks in looking very irritated.

                                 TREVOR
                        Why don’t you answer the phone?

                                 BRITTANY 
                        Because it’s always some pissed off 
                        customer whose tile is chipped or 
                        heater is busted or diving board 
                        sends their kid through the kitchen 
                        window.  I can’t hear all that 
                        negativity.

           Trevor rolls his eyes and picks up the ringing phone himself.
                                 TREVOR
                        Holloway Pools.
                            (beat)
                        Hello, Mrs. Everett.
                            (beat)
                        Well, where is it leaking, exactly?
                            (beat)
                        Ooh.  That’s not good.  Can you 
                        hold for one second?  Thank you.

           Trevor pushes the hold button and looks very sternly at 
           Brittany who hasn’t put down her magazine.

                                 TREVOR (cont’d)
                        You’re fired.

                                 BRITTANY
                        What?  Why?

                                 TREVOR
                        You do no work whatsoever.

                                 BRITTANY
                        I can type a hundred words a 
                        minute.

                                 TREVOR
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 BRITTANY
                        Because you’d make me type 
                        something.

           Trevor sighs in frustration.

                                 BRITTANY (cont’d)
                        But I can type stuff now.  If you 
                        want.  And it’s not something, ya 
                        know, too huge.

                                 TREVOR
                        I don’t know...

                                 BRITTANY
                        I’ll answer the phones.  I actually 
                        have great people skills.

                                 TREVOR
                        I don’t know...

           Brittany gives him a predatory grin and lifts her short skirt 
           slightly, spreading her legs two feet wider apart.
                                 BRITTANY
                        You’ll miss out on a lot if you 
                        fire me.

           Trevor sees her legs spreading slowly and can’t help but be 
           intrigued.

                                 TREVOR
                        I’ll give you a two week trial 
                        period.

           Brittany smiles ear to ear.  Trevor hits the hold button, 
           reconnecting the phone call.

                                 TREVOR (cont’d)
                        Okay, Mrs. Everett, I can be at 
                        your house in an hour.  Does that 
                        work for you?
                            (re: Brittany’s legs)
                        Better make that two hours.  Just 
                        to be safe.

           EXT. HUNTINGTON BEACH PIER - DAY

           Eli sits on the same bench with the same morose expression.  
           Billy walks over and sits down next to him.  Eli can’t even 
           bring himself to look at Billy.

                                 ELI
                        What’s the new information?

                                 BILLY
                        Helen has MS.

           Billy takes a picture out of his pocket and hands it to Eli.  
           It is a current picture of Helen at the nursing home, sitting 
           in her wheel chair and looking very sickly.

                                 BILLY (CONT'D)
                        She’s in a nursing home.

                                 ELI
                        So, what is this supposed to mean 
                        to me?

                                 BILLY
                        It means you pay me another hundred 
                        grand not to call the National 
                        Enquirer.  

                                 ELI
                        You rat weasel shit bag!
                                 BILLY
                        They would kill for the story of 
                        sad, pathetic, Helen Wilkerson, 
                        rotting away in a third rate 
                        nursing home without a cent from 
                        her ex boyfriend, nationally 
                        syndicated conservative radio talk 
                        show host, Eli Webb.  The same, Eli 
                        Webb, who impregnated, MISS, 
                        Wilkerson twenty five years ago, 
                        begged her to have an abortion and 
                        when she didn’t, never so much as 
                        bought a diaper!

           Billy stares daggers into Eli’s eyes, genuinely hating him 
           for how he treated Helen.

                                 Billy (cont’d)
                        So, who’s really the, “Rat weasel 
                        shit bag?”  You tell me, Eli.

           Eli can’t hold Billy’s eyes, knowing he’s absolutely right.  
           Billy finally stands up to leave without taking back the 
           picture of Helen.

                                 Billy (cont’d)
                        Keep the picture.  Helen would want 
                        you to have it.
                            (beat)
                        Have the money for me before you go 
                        on the air tomorrow or the whole 
                        country will know her plight.

           Billy walks away.  Eli stares long and hard at the picture of 
           Helen.

           INT. KENDRA AND TREVOR’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           It is pitch dark.  Trevor is on the verge of sleep while 
           Kendra sits up in deep, tormented thought.

                                 KENDRA
                        He barely knows how babies are 
                        made.  How am I supposed to tell 
                        him his Mother won an adult video 
                        award for best gang bang?

                                 TREVOR
                        We can’t lie to him forever.

           Kendra looks at Trevor and this time, surprisingly, his eyes 
           are not judgemental.  Even so, she is deeply hurt and 
           terrified.
           EXT. HUNTINGTON BEACH PIER - DAWN

           The sun is barely peaking over the mountains to the east.  
           Eli sits on the same bench holding a full paper bag.  Billy 
           is sitting next to him with a confident smile.

                                 ELI
                        This is the last time.  Not another 
                        nickel.  I don’t care if you have 
                        pictures of me blowing a mountain 
                        lion.  It ends today.

           Billy looks at Eli and smiles even wider, knowing he has him 
           by the balls.

                                 BILLY
                        Whatever.

           Billy takes the bag of money, stands up and walks away.  Eli 
           stares straight ahead as if seeing for a thousand miles.

           INT. RADIO BOOTH - DAY

           Eli sits behind the microphone with headphones on his head, 
           appearing to be fighting off a complete mental and emotional 
           breakdown.  A computer on his desk allows him to choose what 
           phone calls to take.

           Behind Eli, is a small sound proof control booth with thick 
           glass between it and the radio booth.  Inside are the three 
           Paracom Executives, Drew, Margaret and Warren, along with 
           Eli’s Agent, Davis, Eli’s Producer, KARL(40), long hair, 
           focused, and the ENGINEER(30’s), glasses, working the 
           controls.

           The Paracom Executives and Davis have big smiles on their 
           faces in stark contrast to Eli who looks like he’s about to 
           have his liver removed with a dull deer antler.  The red, ON 
           AIR light shines on the wall and Eli speaks tentatively into 
           the microphone, battling ferocious cotton mouth for the first 
           time in his entire life.

                                 ELI
                        Welcome, America, to the Eli Webb 
                        Show, broadcasting for the first 
                        time from sea to shining sea...

           INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Davis and the Executives are starting to look nervous about 
           Eli’s demeanor.
                                 ELI (O.S.)
                        Radio, as you know it, will never 
                        be the same.

                                 WARREN
                            (to Davis:)
                        He seems a little off to me.

                                 DAVIS
                        Opening day jitters.  

           INT. RADIO BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Eli scans the computer screen in front of him for the next 
           caller, hitting a button on his control panel to activate the 
           call.

                                 ELI
                        Lets take our inaugural phone call, 
                        shall we?  Rudy, from Acton, 
                        Massachusetts, you’re on the 
                        nationwide, Eli Webb Show.

           The voice of RUDY(40’s), confident, stern, comes over the 
           radio.  His tone couldn’t be more the opposite of Eli’s.

                                 RUDY (O.C.)
                        Yes, hello.  Thank you for taking 
                        my call.

                                 ELI
                        What do you have to say to the 
                        entire country, Rudy?

                                 RUDY (O.C.)
                        I was in Costa Mesa recently and I 
                        heard your show when you said that 
                        all women who give birth out of 
                        wedlock should be forced to give 
                        their children up for adoption.

           Eli gets a look of extreme fear on his face, having 
           completely lost his footing.  From the control booth, the 
           Paracom Executives and Davis look at Eli strangely, having 
           never seen this expression on his face before.

                                 ELI
                        Ah, well, I don’t believe I 
                        actually justified-
                                 RUDY (O.C.)
                        Yes, you did!  I heard you say it!  
                        You called for forced adoptions of 
                        all children of unwed mothers and 
                        prison terms for the fathers!

           Eli glances over at the control booth with sweat beads 
           beginning to form on his forehead.  Warren’s expression has 
           gone from confused to hostile.

                                 ELI
                        What do you do for a living, Rudy?

                                 RUDY (O.C.)
                        What’s that got to do with 
                        anything?

                                 ELI
                        Are you not going to answer the 
                        question?

                                 RUDY (O.C.)
                        No, because it’s irrelevant.

           A small measure of color returns to Eli’s face.

                                 ELI
                        Then my only option is to guess.  
                        Director of a Clean Needles 
                        program?  Counselor at an Abortion 
                        Clinic?

           INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           A grin starts to form on Davis’s face.  The Paracom 
           Executives don’t look angry anymore but they’re still not 
           completely reassured.

                                 RUDY (O.C.)
                        I’m a Social Worker.  Not that it’s 
                        any of your business.

           INT. RADIO BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Eli’s cotton mouth is gone and his confidence is slowly 
           starting to filter back.

                                 ELI
                        Ah.  A defender of the poor, the 
                        oppressed, the huddled masses 
                        yearning to be free?
                                 RUDY (O.C.)
                        Well, yeah, that’s-

                                 ELI
                        Free to use their wombs as conveyor 
                        belts to mass produce a never 
                        ending stream of future addicts and 
                        felons?

           INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           The Paracom Executives now smile confidently.  Warren gives 
           Davis a pat on the back and Karl pumps his fist.

                                 RUDY (O.C.)
                        Whoa, hold on there-

           INT. RADIO BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           The confident, venomous Eli Webb has returned in force.  

                                 ELI
                        Go ahead, Rudy, keep singing 
                        “Kumbaya” to parasites.  Keep 
                        allowing them every indulgence 
                        their primitive nervous systems 
                        demand and they’ll keep thanking 
                        you by sapping our public debt, 
                        bankrupting our hospitals, 
                        carjacking my Lexus and raping your 
                        wife.

                                 RUDY (O.C.)
                        Hey!

                                 ELI
                        Our nation owes you a debt of 
                        gratitude, Rudy.  Keep up the bad 
                        work.  

           Eli hits a button on his control panel, disconnecting Rudy’s 
           call.  

                                 ELI (CONT'D)
                        Thank you for your call, Rudy from 
                        Acton, Massachusetts.

           INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone in the control booth has the inner glow of people 
           who smell truck loads of money.
                                 DAVIS
                        No need to fear.  Eli Webb is here.

           INT. RADIO BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Looking like the king of the world, Eli quickly scans his 
           computer screen for the next caller and then connects it.  

                                 ELI
                        Our next caller is, James, from 
                        Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.  Go 
                        ahead, James, throw in your two 
                        cents?

           The voice of JAMES(40’s), low, brooding, slowly comes over 
           the speakers.

                                 JAMES(O.C.)
                        You think you’re pretty clever, 
                        don’t ya, “Eli?”

                                 ELI
                        Just trying to be a light house in 
                        the storm.  Are you a light house, 
                        James?  Or a jagged rock?

                                 JAMES (O.C.)
                        Call me, Jimmy.

                                 ELI
                        Time’s money, Jimmy.  What do you 
                        have to say to the nation?

                                 JAMES (O.C.)
                        It’s what I have to say to you, 
                        RICHIE.

           Eli’s eyes go very wide when he hears, “Richie,” and he loses 
           a small measure of his confidence.

                                 ELI
                        Sounds like it’s happy hour in 
                        Gettysburg.

                                 JAMES (O.C.)
                        Yes, it is.  But I’m calling about 
                        Irvine.  Where you grew up, little 
                        Richie Sullivan.  And where I grew 
                        up.  I’m Jimmy Seward.  Remember 
                        me?

           Eli freezes like a statue and his face turns ashen gray.
           INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone in the control booth can tell by Eli’s expression 
           that he’s come unglued.

                                 DAVIS
                        Hang up, Eli!  Why won’t he hang 
                        up?!

           INT. RADIO BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Eli can’t muster the strength to hang up on the call, looking 
           more and more like a twelve year old who knows he’s powerless 
           to avoid a beating.  James continues to talk in a low, 
           tormenting tone.

                                 JAMES (O.C.)
                        You’re pretty good at making people 
                        feel small.

                                 ELI
                        Ah, I, ah-

                                 JAMES (O.C.)
                        Kinda like I used to make you feel.

           INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Warren turns desperately to the Engineer.

                                 WARREN
                        Hang up the call!

                                 ENGINEER
                        All I can do is cut off the show.

           Everyone In the booth shake their heads, knowing that that’s 
           too drastic a step.

           INT. RADIO BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Eli continues to slowly wilt under James’s onslaught.

                                 JAMES (O.C.)
                        Do I still make you piss your 
                        pants, Richie?  Like I used to in 
                        Junior High?  Is that why you can’t 
                        hang up on me now?  Because after 
                        all these years I still OWN YOU.

           In the control booth, Warren starts yelling at Davis who then 
           joins him at imploring Karl and the Engineer to cut off the 
           show.  Karl and the Engineer then confer.
                                 JAMES (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                        Remember how I used to make you beg 
                        me not to hurt you?
                            (beat)
                        You never told anyone about our 
                        time together, did ya, little girl?  
                        Kept it to yourself all these years 
                        and thanked God when I moved away 
                        after eighth grade, didn’t ya?
                            (beat)
                        But you’re still my bitch.

           The Engineer hits some buttons, cutting off the show 
           completely.  After a couple seconds of dead air, a muffler ad 
           comes loudly over the speakers.

                                 MUFFLER AD SPOKESMAN (V.O.)
                        Is your muffler giving you the old, 
                        clickity clak?! 

           Davis and the Paracom Executives look through the glass at 
           Eli with an equal mixture of sympathy and contempt.  Eli 
           feels their eyes upon him and bows his head in shame.

                                 MUFFLER AD SPOKESMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Then bring your car down to Speedy 
                        Mufflers, stat!

           INT. KENDRA AND TREVOR’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           On the television is a news broadcast with Anchor, SUZANNE 
           COUGHLIN(40), pretty, intelligent, in the middle of her 
           broadcast.

                                 SUZANNE
                        ...and The Orange County District 
                        Attorney’s Office may file stalking 
                        charges.  Paracom issued a 
                        statement soon after the incident, 
                        saying that Mr. Webb is taking a 
                        leave of absence until the matter 
                        is resolved.

           Kendra and Trevor are lying in bed together and watching the 
           news.  Trevor turns off the television with the remote.

                                 KENDRA
                        He’s my Father.

                                 TREVOR
                        Who?
                                 KENDRA
                        Eli Webb.

                                 TREVOR
                        What?

                                 KENDRA
                        Remember Conner saying he met his 
                        grandfather at school.  That was 
                        him.

                                 TREVOR
                        When were you going to tell me 
                        this?

                                 KENDRA
                        I’m telling you now.

                                 TREVOR
                        No secrets, Kendra.  That’s what we 
                        said.

                                 KENDRA
                        No secrets for me.  For you I’m not 
                        so sure.

           Guilt momentarily washes across Trevor’s face.

                                 TREVOR
                        What does that mean?

                                 KENDRA
                        That means that every last gory 
                        detail about my past is out in the 
                        open but when it comes to you, it’s 
                        like you were in a monastery.

                                 TREVOR
                        Oh, well forgive me if I didn’t 
                        spend my early adulthood being 
                        triple penetrated on film.

           This hurts Kendra deeply and she looks long and hard at her 
           husband.

                                 KENDRA
                        Why, Trevor?

                                 TREVOR
                        Why what?
                                 KENDRA
                        You could have had your pick of 
                        women.  Why me?

                                 TREVOR
                        Because I love you.

           She looks even harder at him, not sure if she believes what 
           he says.

           EXT. ELI’S HOUSE, BACK YARD PATIO - NIGHT

           The Pacific Ocean stretches out in the distance.  Eli sits in 
           a lounge chair, staring at the pool and drinking an enormous 
           glass of brandy.  He is shit faced drunk and giggles as the 
           phone inside the house rings non-stop.

           After a couple seconds, Tori rushes out onto the patio, 
           wearing her clothes from work.  She looks at Eli with deep 
           concern.

                                 TORI
                        Eli?

                                 ELI
                        Why it’s my lovely bride.

                                 TORI
                        Are you okay?

                                 ELI
                        You are no doubt referring to my 
                        less than stellar national debut.

                                 TORI
                        Who the hell was that guy who 
                        called you?

           Eli looks away from her, the phone call still stinging 
           mightily despite the alcohol.  Tori sits down on the end of 
           the lounge chair.

                                 ELI
                        A phantom.

                                 TORI
                        Who is he, Eli?

                                 ELI
                        He is, what he says he is.
                            (beat)
                        He didn’t lie.
                                 TORI
                        I’m so sorry, honey.

                                 ELI
                        Funny how some things, no matter 
                        how much time passes, you just 
                        can’t shake.

                                 TORI
                        The Police will find him.  Don’t 
                        worry.

                                 ELI
                        Can the Police get him out of my 
                        head?

           Tori strokes Eli’s knee tenderly.

                                 TORI
                        You take as much time off as you 
                        need.  We’ll go to Cabo for a 
                        couple weeks.  Or Maui.  Then 
                        you’ll be ready to get back in the 
                        saddle.

                                 ELI
                        I’m not going back to work.  Ever.

                                 TORI
                        What do you mean?

                                 ELI
                        My job is bull shit.  I don’t want 
                        to do it anymore.

                                 TORI
                        You’re just shook up.  Anyone would 
                        be.

           Tori stands up and walks towards the house.  Eli swallows 
           hard and the color drains from his face as he prepares to 
           drop the HIV bomb.

                                 ELI
                        Tori, I need to tell you 
                        something...

           She stops and looks at him.  His courage evaporates.

                                 ELI (CONT'D)
                        I’ll be taking Reagan to school 
                        from now on.  And picking him up, 
                        too.  
                                 TORI
                        His nanny takes him to school.  And 
                        picks him up.

                                 ELI
                        Yeah, I know.  His nanny wakes him 
                        up in the morning, gets him 
                        dressed, feeds him breakfast, takes 
                        him to school, picks him up from 
                        school, helps him with his 
                        homework, feeds him dinner, reads 
                        him a story and puts him to bed.   
                            (beat)
                        What I’m not clear on, is what his 
                        parents do in his life.

           Tori stops in her tracks, offended by Eli’s implication.  She 
           turns around to face her husband, trying hard to stay 
           sympathetic.

                                 ELI (CONT'D)
                        My child is a stranger to me, Tori.  
                        That has to end.

           EXT. THE BARTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CONNER’S CLASSROOM - DAY

           Kendra walks up to the classroom, looking through the open 
           door and spotting Conner gathering his book bag along with 
           all the other children.

                                 KENDRA
                        Hey, buddy.  Almost ready?

           Conner hears his Mother’s voice but can’t look her in the 
           eye.  His cold reaction to her is a stark contrast to the way 
           he’s always been with his Mother.

                                 CONNER
                        Yeah.

                                 KENDRA
                        Everything alright?

                                 CONNER
                        Yeah.

           Kendra knows something’s off but lets it go.  She turns to 
           her right and sees REAGAN STANDING THERE, STARING AT HER.  
           She is more than a little put off by him.

                                 KENDRA
                        Hey.
                                 REAGAN
                        Hey.

                                 KENDRA
                        How’s...it...going?

                                 REAGAN
                        Do you like fruit strips?

                                 KENDRA
                        I’m sorry?

                                 REAGAN
                        Fruit strips.  You like ‘em?

                                 KENDRA
                        Ah, yeah.  Sure.

                                 REAGAN
                        Me too.
                            (beat)
                        Think that runs in the family?

           Kendra starts to answer but is interrupted by Conner who 
           walks over to Kendra without looking at her.

                                 CONNER
                        Okay, I’m ready.

                                 KENDRA
                        Great.

           Kendra is bothered by her son not being able to look at her 
           but doesn’t pursue it.  They turn to leave.

                                 KENDRA (cont’d)
                            (awkwardly to Reagan:)
                        Bye.

                                 REAGAN
                        Bye.

                                 CONNER
                            (to Reagan:)
                        See ya, uncle.

                                 REAGAN
                        See ya, nephew.

           They walk out of the classroom and down the pathway to the 
           parking lot.  It is tense between them and neither one is 
           able to say a thing.  After a few strides, they bump into Eli 
           coming the other way to pick up Reagan.
                                 ELI
                        Oh.  Hello.

           Kendra snorts in disgust and continues on her way.  Conner 
           sneaks a glance at his grandfather and then turns back, 
           continuing walking away with Kendra.

           EXT. BARTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Eli walks up to his Lexus with Reagan and opens the back seat 
           door.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Eli?  Can I have a word?

           Eli turns towards the voice and sees Dr. Ackerman standing 
           there.  He’s not sure if he should be angry or embarrassed.

                                 ELI
                        Go ahead in the car, Reagan.

           Reagan steps into the back of the Lexus and Eli closes the 
           door, looking around to see if anyone’s watching him talk to 
           Dr. Ackerman.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        You won’t return my calls.

                                 ELI
                        How did you know I’d be here?

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        Your wife.

                                 ELI
                        You talked to my wife?!

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        Don’t worry.  I told her it was 
                        about a golf tournament.

                                 ELI
                        I’m sure she bought that one.  I 
                        hate golf.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        Why are you ducking me?

                                 ELI
                        I’ve had a lot to think about.
                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        The Pharmacy says you haven’t 
                        picked up your AZT.

                                 ELI
                        I will.  In time.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        You don’t have time, Eli.  Every 
                        day you waste could reduce your 
                        life expectancy.

                                 ELI
                        Christ.  When you put it that way.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        Have you done your notifications?

                                 ELI
                        My what?

           Dr. Ackerman looks away in frustration over Eli having no 
           idea what he’s talking about.  He takes a deep breath and 
           steps closer to Eli, speaking to him in an intense whisper.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        The people you’ve had unprotected 
                        sex with in the last three years.  
                        Have you told them to get tested?

                                 ELI
                        Hell no.  That’s more than a few 
                        people, Jim.

                                 DR. ACKERMAN
                        All the more need for them to know.  
                        It could make the difference when 
                        they live or die.

           Eli thinks long and hard about that, seeing the urgency for 
           the first time.

           INT. KATY SLATE’S BAR - NIGHT

           Billy sits at the same table he sat at before, once again 
           drinking a glass of scotch and watching baseball.  After a 
           second, Jonah comes over and sits down with him as the 
           Waitress delivers Jonah’s tequila.

                                 JONAH
                        I’d say you’re on a losing streak 
                        except you never win.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JONAH (cont'd)
                            (beat)
                        You’re tainted. 

           Billy takes a big drink, ignoring Jonah.

                                 Jonah (cont’d)
                        I only knew one other person who 
                        was tainted.  He would bet a horse 
                        and it was like the thing suddenly 
                        caught rabies.
                            (beat)
                        Can horses catch rabies?

           Billy slides a full envelope over to Jonah.

                                 Jonah (cont’d)
                        Pay your debts.  Reflection of 
                        strong character.

                                 BILLY
                        I got ten games I want to bet this 
                        week.

                                 JONAH
                        There’s something about taking your 
                        bets that makes me feel like a 
                        grizzly bear, eating a baby bird.

           Billy gives Jonah a look that says, “Give me a break.”  Jonah 
           sighs, drinks his shot of tequila and takes out his note pad 
           and pencil.

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, BATH ROOM - DAY

           Eli is standing in front of the mirror and looking down at a 
           note pad with lots of writing on it.

           The top of the paper reads, “NOTIFICATION LIST,” with two 
           dozen names of women underneath.  Eli stares long and hard at 
           the name at the top of the list - “WIFE.”  After a lengthy 
           internal debate, Eli crosses off, “Wife” from the top of the 
           list and writes it in at the bottom, saving it for last.

           Eli then turns the page to what is titled, “NOTIFICATION 
           SCRIPT,” with lots of hand writing underneath, starting with, 
           “THANKS FOR SEEING ME, _____, I WISH I WAS JUST HERE JUST TO 
           SAY HELLO.”

           Eli starts reciting the Notification Script while looking in 
           the mirror, sneaking peaks at the writing in an attempt to 
           memorize the words.
                                 ELI
                        “Thanks for seeing me, blank.  I 
                        wish I was just here to say, 
                        hello...”
                            (refers to script)
                        “But unfortunately, I’m here to 
                        talk to you about something very 
                        difficult...”
                            (looks back in the mirror)
                        “I recently discovered, that I’m 
                        HIV positive.”

           Eli stops at the bottom of the paragraph where it reads, 
           “ALLOW TIME FOR NEGATIVE REACTION,” in parenthesis.  He acts 
           out a few sympathetic looks in the mirror, pauses for a bit 
           and then continues reading from the next paragraph of the 
           script.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        “Yes, blank, I can certainly 
                        understand how upsetting this must 
                        be.  But you might be comforted to 
                        know that some leading researchers 
                        have said on record that 
                        contracting HIV through normal 
                        heterosexual intercourse is less 
                        likely than being struck by 
                        lightning.”

           INT. TELEVISION NEWS SOUND STAGE - DAY

           The News Anchor we saw before, Suzanne Coughlin, is finishing 
           up reading the news on camera.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Well, that’s our news for tonight.  
                        I’m Suzanne Coughlin.  For John 
                        Covington and the entire crew here 
                        at Channel Five News, we wish all 
                        of you a safe evening.

           After a second, the lights dim and we can here the voice of 
           the show’s DIRECTOR.

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        And, we’re out.  Good show, 
                        everyone.  See you all here 
                        tomorrow.

           Suzanne takes a microphones out of her ear and stands up.  
           Her Personal Assistant, SHELLY(30), accompanies her as she 
           walks off stage.
                                 SUZANNE
                        Nothing tonight I hope.  I just 
                        want to get home.

                                 SHELLY
                        You have the, “Fighting Autism” 
                        dinner at John Wayne Airport.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Okay, but that’s it, right?

                                 SHELLY
                        Not exactly.  Eli Webb is here to 
                        see you.

           Suzanne gets a worried look on her face but can’t help but be 
           intrigued.

                                 SUZANNE
                        What the hell does he want?

                                 SHELLY
                        He wouldn’t say.  He’s been waiting 
                        two hours.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Alright.  Give me ten minutes and 
                        send him in.

           Suzanne closes her office door behind her and Shelly rushes 
           off.

           INT. SUZANNE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Suzanne sits behind her large desk reading papers.  The 
           office is large with pictures all over the walls of Suzanne 
           with an assortment of celebrities and world leaders.

           There’s a knock on the door.  Suzanne straightens her hair 
           and clears her throat.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Come in.

           Eli walks inside looking nervous and holding his note 
           pad/Notification script.  He gives Suzanne a pressed smile 
           and she stands up to greet him, polite with Eli but not 
           particularly happy about him being there.

                                 ELI
                        Hey, Suzanne.
                                 SUZANNE
                        Hello, Eli.

           They give each other an awkward cheek kiss then sit down.  
           Eli is shitting gargantuan bricks.

                                 SUZANNE (cont’d)
                        Have to say I was intrigued to hear 
                        you’d come to see me.  And a little 
                        scared.  If I’m being honest.

           Eli looks at Suzanne and panic washes across his face, 
           completely forgetting what he was going to say.  Suzanne 
           notices his panic and is taken aback.

                                 ELI
                        Just a second...

           He opens the Notification Script and eases his tension 
           somewhat when he looks at the words, turning back to Suzanne 
           in over-rehearsed fashion.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        “Thanks for seeing me, Suzanne.  I 
                        wish I was just here to say, 
                        hello...”

                                 SUZANNE
                        Before you start, I appreciate it 
                        if you want to give me your first 
                        interview since the...stalker, 
                        thing, but Marty does all the face 
                        to face stuff and I could never 
                        step on his toes.

           Suzanne’s interruption throws off Eli’s timing and he 
           struggles to get back to where he was on the script, looking 
           back at the page with his hands starting to shake.

                                 ELI
                        No, wait, that’s not...
                            (refers to script:)
                        “But unfortunately-”

                                 SUZANNE
                        Oh, this is a twelve step thing, 
                        isn’t it?  Make amends to all the 
                        people you fucked over?

           Eli’s timing is even more thrown off and he madly searches 
           back on his script for where he was.
                                 ELI
                        No, please, let me just-
                            (re: the script)
                        “I recently learned that I’m HIV 
                        positive...”

           Suzanne gets a bizarre, crooked smirk on her face like she 
           thinks this is some kind of sick joke and she’s not sure 
           wether to laugh or throw a sharp object.  Eli continues on 
           with the script unabated.

                                 ELI (CONT'D)
                        “My Doctor has asked me-”

                                 SUZANNE
                        Whoa whoa!  What is this?

                                 ELI
                            (skipping down)
                        “Since you and I were intimate, 
                        blank,” two, “years ago-”

                                 SUZANNE
                        Stop!  What are you doing?

                                 ELI
                        Notifying you.

           Suzanne stands up and steps around her desk, looking down at 
           Eli with venom in her eyes.

                                 SUZANNE
                        If this is some hidden camera bull 
                        shit, I swear I will pay to have 
                        you castrated.

           Feeling incredibly flustered, Eli skips down to the, “After 
           allowing time for negative reaction,” section of the 
           script.

                                 ELI
                        “Yes, blank,” Suzanne, “I can 
                        certainly see how upset-”

           Suzanne grabs Eli’s note pad out of his hand and flings it 
           across the room.  Then she gets right up in his face and he 
           cowers in fear.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Tell me what the fuck this is all 
                        about!
                                 ELI
                        No bull shit.  I’m HIV positive.

           Suzanne deflates, drawing back form Eli like she was kicked 
           in the stomach and speaks in a dull whisper. 

                                 SUZANNE
                        For real?

                                 ELI
                        For real.

                                 SUZANNE
                        You’re not fucking with me?

                                 ELI
                        Not at all.
                            (beat)
                        I am so sorry.

           She gets a frantic expression and walks around behind her 
           desk, looking wildly at all four walls as if a zillion 
           thoughts are colliding in her brain.  

                                 SUZANNE
                        Oh shit.  Oh shit.  Oh shit.  What 
                        the hell am I gonna tell my 
                        husband? 

           Guilt eclipses Eli’s entire body as he watches the breakdown 
           he caused.

                                 SUZANNE (cont’d)
                        He has no idea you and I slept 
                        together.  I have to admit...
                            (thinks)
                        I could have infected him.  I could 
                        have killed my husband!

           Eli stands up but doesn’t move forward, unsure if he should 
           be too close to her.

                                 ELI
                        No.  You don’t know that.  Get 
                        tested.  You’re most likely 
                        negative.  Then you don’t have to 
                        tell him anything.
                            (ad libbing badly:)
                        “Leading researchers have said on 
                        record that contracting HIV through 
                        normal heterosexual intercourse is 
                        less likely than being struck by 
                        lightning.”
                                 SUZANNE
                        How did you get it?

                                 ELI
                        Normal heterosexual intercourse.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Then shut the fuck up!

                                 ELI
                        I am truly sorry, Suzanne.  But 
                        this could have happened to anyone.  
                        I mean, who hasn’t passed on an STD 
                        a time or two in their life?

           Suzanne hauls off and punches Eli hard in the face, knocking 
           him flat on his ass.  She looks down on him like he’s vermin.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Genital warts don’t kill you, ya 
                        piece a shit!

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, BATH ROOM - NIGHT

           Eli, with a big bruise over his left eye, is standing in 
           front of the mirror again and looking down at his 
           “NOTIFICATION LIST.”  Suzanne Coughlin’s name is crossed out 
           at the top.

           Eli turns the page to his, “NOTIFICATION SCRIPT,” and crosses 
           out everything after, “THANKS FOR SEEING ME, _____.  I WISH I 
           WAS JUST HERE TO SAY, HELLO,” virtually obliterating the 
           entire script.

           He turns to a blank page in the note pad and take a long beat 
           to consider what he’s going to now write.  Finally, he puts 
           pen to paper and starts slowly writing a new script.

                                                      CUT TO:

           MONTAGE:

           INT. CHILI’S RESTAURANT - DAY

           Eli sits alone at a table talking to a WAITRESS who he 
           clearly knows well.  He has his script out on the table but 
           doesn’t look at it.

           He recites the script to her for a few seconds and then she 
           starts balling.  She dumps his drink on him, throws her order 
           pad in his face and runs off crying.
           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, BATH ROOM - NIGHT

           Eli throws his entire NOTIFICATION SCRIPT in the trash.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Eli is talking to an attractive female BARTENDER whom he 
           clearly knows well.

           He gives her the speech and she looks at him like he’s Jack 
           the ripper and starts throwing bottles at his head.  Eli 
           ducks out of the way in terror as the bottles shatter into 
           pieces against the wall behind him.

           INT. STRIP BAR - NIGHT

           It is a crowded strip bar with lots of excited looking men 
           staring at the naked woman dancing on stage.  Eli is off to 
           the side, talking quietly to a STRIPPER whom he clearly knows 
           well.

           The stripper gets a furious look on her face and takes off 
           her eight inch heels to use as a weapon.  Eli quickly high 
           tales it out of the place.

           EXT. ANGELS STADIUM - DAY

           It’s just before the start of a game.  Eli is talking to a 
           female TICKET TAKER by the gate whom he clearly knows well.  
           She stares back at him with a very blank expression.

                                 TICKET TAKER
                        But I made you wear a condom.

                                 ELI
                        Oh.  Yeah.
                            (beat)
                        Never mind.

           Eli breathes a huge sigh of relief and walks out.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        This isn’t so hard.

           INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY

           Eli gives the news to a young ASIAN WOMAN, thick accent, who 
           works at the Dry Cleaners.  She turns bright red and kicks 
           him in the balls.  Eli crumples onto the floor in agony.

                                 ASIAN WOMAN
                        You scum!  Plague!  Vermin!  That 
                        you, Eli Webb!
           The woman tries to kick Eli while he’s down but the owner of 
           the Dry Cleaners rushes over and restrains her.

           END MONTAGE:

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, BATH ROOM - DAY

           Eli stands in front of the mirror, holding his prescription 
           bottle of AZT.  He stares long and hard at the label which 
           reads, “Eli Webb” at the top and, “AZT” at the bottom.

           He opens the lid and looks down at the pills.  The bottle is 
           filled to the top because he hasn’t taken any yet.  Eli seems 
           to be holding a mental debate on wether or not to start 
           today.

           After a long moment, Eli puts the lid back on the bottle 
           without taking any of the pills.  He opens the cabinet under 
           the sink and hides the bottle of AZT way in back behind the 
           toilet paper.

           Then he looks at the NOTIFICATION LIST, on the counter.  Only 
           two names remain.  The last one is, “WIFE.”  He puts the note 
           pad in the cabinet near the AZT and closes the door.

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Eli walks out of the bathroom and bumps into Leticia holding 
           a large basket of clean laundry.

                                 LETICIA
                        Mr. Eli, you want I pick up Reagan 
                        at school?

                                 ELI
                        No.  I’ll pick him up.

                                 LETICIA
                        I not have much to do no more.

           Eli swallows and summons his courage.

                                 ELI
                        Ah, Leticia.  I need to talk to you 
                        about ah....
                            (off her look:)
                        “I wish I was just here to say, 
                        hello...” 

                                 LETICIA
                        Huh?
           Eli can’t meet her eyes and struggles to form the words.  
           Leticia’s poor grasp of the English language has her at a 
           major disadvantage.

                                 ELI
                        The road of life is a winding, 
                        mountain road.

                                 LETICIA
                        Huh?

                                 ELI
                        My Doctor has asked me to notify 
                        everyone I’ve had unprotected sex 
                        with in the past three years.

                                 LETICIA
                        Sex?

                                 ELI
                        Yes.  You and I.  Had sex.  About a 
                        year and a half ago.  A few times.

           Leticia blushes five different shades of red.  Eli is crushed 
           to have to give her this news, feeling worse now than with 
           any of the other notifications.

                                 LETICIA
                        Ah.  Yes.

                                 ELI
                        Well...Leticia...I recently 
                        discovered that I’m HIV positive.

                                 LETICIA
                        I no understand.

                                 ELI
                        I have the HIV virus.  That causes 
                        AIDS.

                                 LETICIA
                        You...?  AIDS...?

           It dawns on Leticia what he’s saying.  She gasps and drops 
           the laundry basket, putting her hands over her mouth.

                                 LETICIA (cont’d)
                        Aye, dios mio.

                                 ELI
                        You need to get tested.  As soon as 
                        you can.
           Leticia starts to cry.  The guilt causes Eli’s eyes to well 
           up and he has to fight to keep from crying.

                                 LETICIA
                        Mi esposo, y mi ninos!

                                 ELI
                        No, this won’t effect your 
                        children.  If you have it, which I 
                        highly doubt, you can’t have passed 
                        it on to them.

           Leticia’s crying escalates.

                                 LETICIA
                        Aye, voy a mi eglesia 
                        immediatamente!

           She rushes past him to leave the house, crying even harder.

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Eli sits on his couch holding his NOTIFICATION LIST in his 
           lap.  All of the names are crossed off except for the last 
           One, “WIFE.”  He stares long and hard at the last name, his 
           guts ripping out of his stomach the more he looks at it.

           The door to the garage opens and Eli quickly scrambles to 
           hide the notebook under the couch.  After a second, Tori 
           walks in looking deeply depressed and collapses on the couch 
           next to Eli’s.

                                 TORI
                        Hey.

                                 ELI
                        Bad day?

                                 TORI
                        Positively apocalyptic.  You?

                                 ELI
                        End of the world on my end too.

           Tori leans her head back on the couch, looking like she could 
           sleep for a week.  

           Eli swallows hard, preparing to give Tori the bad news and 
           knowing full well that when he does, their entire world will 
           come crashing down around them.
                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        Ah, listen, honey.  I need to talk 
                        to you about something really... 
                        difficult-

                                 TORI
                        They dropped my show from the 
                        schedule.

           Eli’s expression of dread morphs into one of sympathy.

                                 ELI
                        They say why?

                                 TORI
                        “Focus groups found my enthusiasm 
                        forced.”

                                 ELI
                        No way.

                                 TORI
                        That plus the ratings suck.

                                 ELI
                        Fuck the focus groups.  And fuck 
                        the ratings.

                                 TORI
                        I’ll drink to that.  Forgot where 
                        we keep the tequila.

                                 ELI
                        Cabinet above the freezer.

           Tori lifts herself off the couch with some effort and starts 
           towards the kitchen, remembering that Eli wanted to talk.

                                 TORI
                        So, what did you want to talk to me 
                        about?

           Guilt blankets Eli’s face but he manages a pained smile.

                                 ELI
                        It can wait.

           INT. CONNER & REAGAN’S CLASSROOM - NIGHT

           Conner and Reagan’s Teacher, AUDREY(30’s), pretty, 
           authoritative, sits in a circle of parents, Kendra and Eli 
           included.  Eli sneaks shy glances at Kendra while Kendra acts 
           like Eli doesn’t exist.
                                 AUDREY
                        Thank you, parents, for coming to 
                        the monthly meeting.  I know you 
                        all have busy schedules so I 
                        appreciate you making the time.  
                        Lets open up the floor for 
                        questions and concerns.

           PAULINE(40’s), rigid, never had an orgasm in her life, shoots 
           up her hand to say something.  She is sitting next to Kendra 
           and seems to lean away from her as if she suspects Kendra has 
           whooping cough.

                                 PAULINE
                        I’m very worried about the 
                        influence of the media on our 
                        children, more specifically in 
                        regards to pornography.

           Pauline drifts her head towards Kendra now and then as if 
           she’s thinking about her as she speaks.

                                 PAULINE (CONT'D)
                        I have recently discovered that 
                        there are parents of children in 
                        our school who work, or have 
                        worked, in the adult film industry.

           Some of the other parents’ eyes widen.  Kendra withers in 
           embarrassment, trying really hard to contain her reaction so 
           that no one else notices.  Eli perks up, watching his 
           daughter closely.

                                 AUDREY
                        I’m not quite sure what your 
                        concern is.

                                 PAULINE
                        My concern is that children are 
                        coming to this school, or even this 
                        class, with daily exposure to hard 
                        core pornography, gaining knowledge 
                        and materials that they could then 
                        share with their classmates.

           Pauline turns her head even more towards Kendra but doesn’t 
           look directly at her.  Kendra is in hell but tries to play it 
           cool.  Feeling like he needs to come to Kendra’s aid, Eli 
           leans forward and addresses Pauline like she’s a misbehaving 
           child.
                                 ELI
                        What a parent does or doesn’t do on 
                        their own time is their own 
                        business.  You take care of your 
                        kid and the rest of us will take 
                        care of ours.

                                 PAULINE
                        Spare us your hypocrisies, Mr. 
                        Webb.

                                 ELI
                        No skeletons in your closet, 
                        madame?  No one night stands or 
                        unwanted pregnancies or lesbian 
                        trysts before you became frigid and 
                        judgmental?

                                 PAULINE
                        What did you call me?

                                 ELI
                        What’s in the past is in the past.  
                        Move the fuck on!

           Before the two can really go at it, Audrey steps in.

                                 AUDREY
                        Okay, lets all take a deep breath 
                        and dial it back a couple notches.

           EXT. CONNER & REAGAN’S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A group of parents congregate outside the classroom after the 
           meeting.  Kendra walks out to leave and some of the other 
           parents give her quick dirty looks.  Kendra feels their eyes 
           upon her but pretends to not be bothered.

           As she walks away from the class, Eli quickly joins her.

                                 ELI
                        Hey.  How’s it going?

                                 KENDRA
                        “How’s it going?”

                                 ELI
                        Yeah.

                                 KENDRA
                        That’s what you ask me?
                                 ELI
                        How about, what’s up?  That’s 
                        pretty tame.

                                 KENDRA
                        Look, let’s both just pretend the 
                        other one doesn’t exist.  You’ve 
                        been doing that for twenty five 
                        years so, just keep it going.

                                 ELI
                        When your mom got pregnant, I was a 
                        kid.  I couldn’t keep a houseplant 
                        alive, much less be a father.

                                 KENDRA
                        Mom was a kid too.  She didn’t run 
                        from her responsibility.

                                 ELI
                        Your mom is a much stronger person 
                        than I am.

                                 KENDRA
                        Clearly.

           EXT. THE BARTON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           They reach Kendra’s car.  She gets her keys out of her purse 
           very quickly, in a rush to get the hell away from Eli.

                                 ELI
                        If I had it to do over, believe me, 
                        I would do a lot of things 
                        differently.  A LOT of things.  I 
                        can’t make up for the past but I 
                        would like very much for us to 
                        spend some time together.  Nothing 
                        major, just, once in a while.
                            (off her look:)
                        A great while.

                                 KENDRA
                        I’ve never trusted men.  My whole 
                        life.  And I definitely don’t trust 
                        you.

                                 ELI
                        You have good reason not to trust 
                        me.
                            (beat)
                        How about, we have a play date?
                                 KENDRA
                        A play date.

                                 ELI
                        Yeah.  At my house.  Reagan would 
                        love to play with...Bonner.

                                 KENDRA
                        Conner.

                                 ELI
                        Conner.  Sorry.  I knew that.

                                 KENDRA
                            (very suspicious)
                        When?

                                 ELI
                        Tomorrow?  The next day?  The day 
                        after?  My schedule’s fairly wide 
                        open these days.

                                 KENDRA
                        I’ll think about it.

                                 ELI
                        Great.  Thank you.

           Kendra gives him one last suspicious look and then gets into 
           her car and starts up the engine.  She drives away without 
           looking back.

           EXT. ELI’S HOUSE, BACK YARD - DAY

           The back yard is expansive and well landscaped.  Eli and 
           Reagan are shooting hoops together on a small basketball 
           court.  Eli coaches Reagan on his jump shooting form.  Reagan 
           holds the ball and looks up at the hoop without a shred of 
           confidence in getting it in.

                                 ELI
                        Okay.  Remember to bend your knees.
                            (beat)
                        And keep your eyes on the rim.
                            (beat)
                        And follow through.  Critical to 
                        follow through.

           Reagan is about to shoot when he’s interrupted by more 
           coaching.
                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        And rotate the ball.
                            (beat)
                        And bend your knees.
                            (beat)
                        Did I say that one already?

                                 REAGAN
                        Yes.

                                 ELI
                        Sorry.  Just have fun.  Name of the 
                        game.
                            (beat)
                        Critical to have fun.
                            (beat)
                        Even more than the follow through.

           Finally feeling free of his Dad’s instruction, Reagan takes a 
           deep nervous breath and shoots the ball without a speck of 
           athletic ability.  The ball goes sailing up and over the 
           backboard and lands on the roof, permanently stuck behind the 
           chimney.

                                 REAGAN
                        Whoops.

                                 ELI
                        Okay.  Not bad.  Good rotation.  
                        Bent your knees.  We have a lot to 
                        work with here.

                                 REAGAN
                        Dad.  I don’t like sports.

                                 ELI
                        Huh?

                                 REAGAN
                        I don’t like sports.

                                 ELI
                        What do you mean?

           Reagan signs his hands as if Eli were deaf and speaks extra 
           slowly.

                                 REAGAN
                        ME.  HATE.  SPORTS.

                                 ELI
                        But you’re in a soccer league.  In 
                        the spring you start T-ball.
                                 REAGAN
                        I don’t want to do any a that shit.

                                 ELI
                        Okay?
                            (long beat)
                        Well.  What do you like?

                                 REAGAN
                        Flowers.

                                 ELI
                        Flowers?

                                 REAGAN
                        Yeah.  And plants.
                            (off his look:)
                        Ya know, trees.  Shrubs.

                                 ELI
                        Why didn’t you ever tell me this 
                        before?

                                 REAGAN
                        I never knew you before.

           Eli looks long and hard at his son, realizing the 
           significance of what he just said.  He steps over and puts 
           his arm around Reagan’s shoulder, leading him off the court.

                                 ELI
                        After I pick you up from school one 
                        day next week, how about we take a 
                        ride up to Huntington Gardens?

                                 REAGAN
                        What’s that?

                                 ELI
                        Oh, it’s great, a huge private 
                        garden around Pasadena, open to the 
                        public.  Hundreds of acres of 
                        exotic plants and trees.  Biggest 
                        rose garden west of the Mississippi 
                        River.

                                 REAGAN
                        Yeah?

                                 ELI
                        Yeah.
           INT. KENDRA’S CAR - DAY

           Kendra drives down the street with Conner in back.  Conner 
           still can’t look at his mother and Kendra is becoming even 
           more bothered by it.

                                 CONNER
                        Am I supposed to call him, Grandpa?

                                 KENDRA
                        No.  Definitely don’t call him, 
                        Grandpa.
                            (beat)
                        Call him, Mr. Webb.

                                 CONNER
                        I can’t call him, Eli?

                                 KENDRA
                        I’d really rather you didn’t.

                                 CONNER
                        Why?

                                 KENDRA
                        After this play date, I don’t plan 
                        on spending much more time with 
                        him.

           A long tense silence passes between them.

                                 KENDRA (cont’d)
                        Ah, Conner, I know you have a lot 
                        of questions about what happened at 
                        the grocery store.

                                 CONNER
                        No.  Not really.

                                 KENDRA
                        Regardless, I think we should talk 
                        about it.

                                 CONNER
                        I don’t.

                                 KENDRA
                        Well, I do.

           Before Kendra can say anything, Conner puts his IPod 
           headphones in his ears and closes his eyes, effectively 
           tuning his mother out.  Kendra gets annoyed but can’t bring 
           herself to say anything.
           EXT. ELI’S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           The enormous front door opens and Eli is standing there, 
           greeting Kendra and Conner who look up at him nervously.

                                 ELI
                        Hello.  Welcome.

           Conner is extra formal.

                                 CONNER
                        Hi.  Mr. Webb.

                                 ELI
                        Well hello, Conner.  You can call 
                        me, Eli.

                                 CONNER
                            (off Kendra’s look:)
                        Okay.

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Conner and Reagan are constructing an enormous lego structure 
           in the family room.  Eli and Kendra sit on opposite sides of 
           the kitchen table, sipping coffee and looking like it 
           requires an act of Congress to get them to talk to each 
           other.

                                 ELI
                            (re: Conner)
                        He seems like a good kid.

                                 KENDRA
                        How would you know?

                                 ELI
                        I’m just trying to compliment your 
                        mothering ability.

                                 KENDRA
                        For all you know, I conduct medical 
                        experiments on him every night.

           Eli thinks about that for a second.

                                 ELI
                        Do you conduct medical experiments 
                        on him every night?
                                 KENDRA
                        My point is that you know nothing 
                        about how I mother him because 
                        you’ve been nowhere in sight.

           A silent beat passes.  Eli stares at Reagan.

                                 ELI
                        How much money do you suppose you 
                        could make conducting medical 
                        experiments on your children?
                            (beat)
                        Cuz these days, I could use a side 
                        gig.

           Kendra can’t help but smirk at that but she fights it.

                                 KENDRA
                        Just drop it, okay?

           They both smile faintly, thawing the iceberg between them 
           ever so slightly.  A silent beat passes as they stare at 
           Reagan and Conner.

                                 ELI
                        Maybe we could do this every week.

           Kendra’s smile completely evaporates and she looks at Eli 
           with eyes as cold as stone.

                                 KENDRA
                        No chance.

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, BATH ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kendra sits on the toilet, staring blankly at the wall.  She 
           finishes urinating and reaches over to the spool seeing that 
           there’s no toilet paper.

           Frustrated, she gets off of the toilet and opens the cabinet 
           under the sink.  Not seeing any toilet paper at first, she 
           rummages through, seeing a few rolls in back.

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Eli sits alone at the kitchen table, looking like he’s in 
           deep thought.  After a second, Conner sits down where Kendra 
           was sitting and looks at Eli.

                                 CONNER
                        Hey.

           Eli smiles at Conner awkwardly.
                                 ELI
                        Hey.

                                 CONNER
                        You don’t look like a grandfather.

                                 ELI
                        Oh.  Okay.  Thanks.

                                 CONNER
                        Grandfather’s are old and 
                        crotchity.  You don’t seem 
                        crotchity.  Just kinda old.

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, BATH ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kendra grabs a roll of toilet paper from inside the cabinet 
           and hears the sound of a plastic bottle being knocked over.  
           Reaching to pick it up, she sees that it’s a prescription 
           pill bottle.

           She looks around, wondering to herself if she should be 
           looking at this and then decides that she can’t resist, 
           lifting the pill bottle out of the cabinet.

           Kendra looks closely at the bottle and gasps when she sees, 
           “Eli Webb” and “AZT.”  She quickly puts the bottle back where 
           she found it.

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Eli and Conner continue to sit together.  Eli has an awkward 
           look on his face, unsure of what to say to his grandson.

                                 CONNER
                        My mom doesn’t like you.

                                 ELI
                        I noticed.

           A long silent beat passes.

                                 CONNER
                        You need to go see her Mom.

                                 ELI
                        Her Mom?

                                 CONNER
                        In the nursing home.  If you go and 
                        see her, maybe my mom will like you 
                        better.
           Eli is struck by the simple wisdom of that and amazed he 
           hadn’t thought of it.

           EXT. ELI’S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Eli walks Kendra and Conner out to their car to leave.  
           Kendra has a new, knowing look in her eye.

                                 ELI
                        Thanks for coming.

                                 KENDRA
                        Thanks for having us.

           Conner walks up to Eli with a lot of formality and holds out 
           his hand to shake.

                                 CONNER
                        Thank you, Eli.

                                 ELI
                        You’re very welcome, Conner.  Come 
                        back anytime.

                                 CONNER
                            (off Kendra’s look:)
                        We will.

           Conner jumps into the back of the car and closes the door.

                                 ELI
                            (to Kendra:)
                        I hope you will.

                                 KENDRA
                        I don’t know.

           Just then, Reagan rushes up to Kendra wanting to hand her 
           something.

                                 KENDRA (CONT'D)
                        Oh.  Hey.

                                 REAGAN
                        I want you to have this.

           Kendra holds out her hand and Conner drops a flower onto it.

                                 REAGAN (cont’d)
                        It’s Impatience.  Partial sun.

                                 KENDRA
                        Oh.  Thanks.
           They look at each other for a couple seconds and then Reagan 
           turns and runs back in the house.  Kendra watches Reagan go 
           into the house and then looks at Eli in a slightly different 
           light.  

           Eli shares a second of eye contact with Conner, remembering 
           his words.

                                 ELI
                        I was hoping to get a chance to go 
                        and see your mom.

           Kendra is taken aback, unsure if she’s angry or touched.  She 
           takes a beat to consider her answer.

                                 KENDRA
                        Let me think about it.
                            (beat)
                        Why don’t we have dinner?  Spouses, 
                        no kids.  Then we’ll go from there.

                                 ELI
                        Great idea.

           Kendra gets in her car, starts up the engine and backs out of 
           the driveway, looking back at Eli and giving a polite wave.  
           Eli waves back, surprised and happy.

           EXT. HUNTINGTON BEACH PIER - DAY

           Eli sits on the same bench with a confident, resigned 
           expression that he has never had in any of the previous times 
           he’s sat on this bench.  Billy sits down next to Eli, a 
           little put off by his new demeanor.

                                 ELI
                        Lay it on me.  What’s the new 
                        nugget?

                                 BILLY
                        You have a grandson.

           Eli smiles, finding it amusing that Billy doesn’t know how 
           much Eli already knows that he has a grandson.  Billy hands 
           Eli a seven year old picture of Kendra cradling baby Conner.

                                 BILLY (CONT'D)
                        An illegitimate grandson.

                                 ELI
                        What a coincidence.
                                 BILLY
                        I know I’ve been milking you so I’m 
                        gonna drop the price to fifty 
                        thousand.

                                 ELI
                        Nope.

                                 BILLY
                        What do you mean, nope?

                                 ELI
                        Bank’s closed.  You get nothing.  

                                 BILLY
                        I don’t think you know what you’re 
                        saying.

                                 ELI
                        Go ahead.  Call the Enquirer.  Call 
                        the Star.  The Globe, People, Time 
                        and Newsweek.  Call the fucking 
                        Washington Post for all I give a 
                        fuck.

                                 BILLY
                        You’re going to be really sorry.

                                 ELI
                        Eat shit and die, leech.

           Eli glows with empowerment, stands up and walks away.  Billy 
           is left dumbstruck on the bench.

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, BATH ROOM - NIGHT

           Eli stares at his face in the mirror while he holds the 
           bottle of AZT.  Then he looks down at the, as yet, untouched 
           pills.

           He seems to want to take out a pill and put it in his mouth 
           but something is stopping him from doing it.  Some large 
           force is preventing him from stepping off the cliff into full 
           acknowledgment of his disease.

           After another second, Eli puts the top back on the bottle 
           without taking out a pill.  He puts the bottle in the same 
           spot under the sink and walks out of the bathroom and up the 
           stairs towards his bedroom.
           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Eli walks into the bedroom and can hear Tori in the bathroom 
           brushing her teeth.  He sits down on the bed and gathers 
           every ounce of his courage to tell her the earth shattering 
           news.

                                 ELI
                        Tori?  I need to tell you-

           Tori rushes out of the bathroom with a big smile on her face.

                                 TORI
                        You’re not going to believe it.

                                 ELI
                        Wait-

                                 TORI
                        Walter Hollis called my Agent 
                        today.

                                 ELI
                        Okay...?

                                 TORI
                        He’s going to publish the book.
                            (off his confused look:)
                        “A Hundred Pies For a Hundred 
                        Occasions.”

                                 ELI
                        You wrote that years ago.

                                 TORI
                        I know.  I’d totally forgotten 
                        about it but Walter said he came 
                        across the proposal a couple weeks 
                        ago and his company just happened 
                        to be looking for a dessert cook 
                        book, so, voila!

           Eli looks down, wanting even less to drop the bomb now.

                                 ELI
                        That’s...terrific.

                                 TORI
                        They want me to start promoting it 
                        right away.  I’m going on a local 
                        talk show tomorrow.
           Tori goes back into the bathroom.  Eli struggles mightily to 
           overcome his even now bigger fear for telling her.

                                 ELI
                        Great.

                                 TORI
                        We should celebrate.  Let’s go out 
                        tomorrow night.  Leticia can stay 
                        late with Reagan.

                                 ELI
                        Leticia quit.

                                 TORI (O.C.)
                        Really?  Why?

                                 ELI
                        Ah, she had some...family issue.  
                        Had to go to Guatemala.

           INT. HELEN’S NURSING HOME - NIGHT

           Billy is feeding Helen baby food while she sits in her wheel 
           chair, barely able to open her mouth wide enough to eat.  
           Billy glances over at a picture of Eli Webb over her bed.

                                 Billy
                        He has to have made millions.  Tens 
                        of millions.
                            (beat)
                        Heard he’s got one of those big 
                        houses in Dana Point.
                            (beat)
                        Overlooks the ocean.  

           Billy, looks hard at Helen, considering the best path to 
           attack.

                                 Billy (cont’d)
                        He’s swimming in his pool on a 
                        cliff over the Pacific while you 
                        sit here.  
                            (beat)
                        Would only cost him a tiny fraction 
                        of what he earns to put you some 
                        place nicer.  A lot nicer.

           Billy waits for a reaction from Helen but there isn’t one.

                                 Billy (cont’d)
                        But of course he would never do 
                        that.
                                 (MORE)
                                 Billy (cont’d)
                            (beat)
                        That has to make you mad.
                            (beat)
                        Makes me mad.
                            (beat)
                        Your daughter and me are the only 
                        people who truly care about you.

           Still no reaction.  Billy puts down the now empty jar of baby 
           food and moves his face closer to Helen’s.

                                 Billy (cont’d)
                        If you wanted to talk about Eli, ya 
                        know, on the record, I know a few 
                        publications that would pay you a 
                        lot of money for your story.

           No reaction from Helen at all.  It’s like Billy is talking 
           about the weather, but he is not about to give up.

                                 Billy (cont’d)
                        Finally be able to really take care 
                        of yourself.  Move out of here.
                            (beat)
                        All I’d ask for in return is...a 
                        twenty percent finder’s fee.

           It finally registers on Helen’s face what Billy is saying.  
           Her eyes narrow in disgust which makes Billy deeply ashamed. 

                                 BILLY (cont’d)
                        I’m doing this for you, Helen.  All 
                        of it.

           She struggles to very slowly get the words out:

                                 HELEN
                        Shame on you.

           INT. TABLOID NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY

           It is a very large, loud room.  A hundred beat reporters sit 
           at small desks, scrolling through their computer screens and 
           talking aggressively on telephones.

           Billy sits at the desk of, NIGEL(30’s), Australian accented 
           field reporter, long hair, scruffy beard.  Nigel is looking 
           over a handful of materials that Billy has given him on Eli, 
           including pictures of Eli and Helen together, pictures of 
           Helen in the nursing home and pictures of Kendra as Nina 
           Naughty.
                                 NIGEL
                        Will the ex-girlfriend go on the 
                        record?

                                 BILLY
                            (bad liar)
                        If you pay her enough.

           Nigel snorts at the absurdity of that.

                                 NIGEL
                        What about the porn star daughter?

                                 BILLY
                            (worse liar)
                        Her you’d have to pay even more.

           Nigel gets a genuine chuckle out of that one.  He throws the 
           pictures down on the desk like he doesn’t think much of them.

                                 NIGEL
                        Rush Limbaugh turned out to be a 
                        junky and nobody gave a shit.  His 
                        ratings are as high as ever.

                                 BILLY
                        Yeah, but it was a great story.  
                        Sold a lotta paper.

                                 NIGEL
                        For the mainstream media, maybe.  
                        Why don’t you take this stuff to 
                        them?

                                 BILLY
                        I need somebody who pays.

                                 NIGEL
                        Our readers expect right wing 
                        pundits to have skeletons.  It’s 
                        more of a story for us when they 
                        don’t.

           Billy sighs deeply, not liking where this is going.

                                 BILLY
                        Alright.  I’ll give you everything 
                        I’ve got for ten grand.

                                 NIGEL
                        Sorry, mate.  You couldn’t give it 
                        to me.
           INT. HOLLOWAY POOLS - DAY

           The phone is ringing off the hook.  Brittany sits at her 
           desk, juggling three different phone calls and talking to 
           customers with a new and very improved work ethic.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Yes, Mrs. Quinn, I understand 
                        completely what a hassle a clogged 
                        filter can be.  I sympathize with 
                        you.  Completely.

           Kendra walks in, looking around for Trevor and not seeing 
           him.  She looks at Brittany, having no idea who she is.

                                 KENDRA
                        Is Trevor around?

                                 BRITTANY
                            (hand over the phone)
                        Who wants to know?

                                 KENDRA
                        His wife.

           Brittany snaps to attention and speaks back into the phone 
           with new urgency.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Would you please hold for one quick 
                        second, Mrs. Quinn?  Thank you so 
                        much.
                            (to Kendra)
                        Ah, no, Mrs. Holloway.  He’s on a 
                        job.

                                 KENDRA
                        He’s not answering his cell.  When 
                        he checks in, could you let him 
                        know that I made a dinner date for 
                        us tonight with my Father and his 
                        wife?

                                 BRITTANY
                        Sure.  I’ll tell him.

                                 KENDRA
                        This is probably going to shock him 
                        quite a bit, given that my Father 
                        is a monumental dick wad who never 
                        gave a rat’s ass about me till two 
                        weeks ago.
                                 BRITTANY
                        Okay...?

                                 KENDRA
                        I’m not quite sure why I’m telling 
                        you all this.  Who are you?

                                 BRITTANY
                        Brittany.

                                 KENDRA
                        But, you’re not old.  Or fat.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Thanks?

           Kendra looks suspicious and turns around to leave, stopping 
           at the door as she realizes something else.  Brittany takes 
           Mrs. Quinn off of hold but then pushes the button again when 
           she sees Kendra turn around.

                                 KENDRA
                        What part of Arizona did you live 
                        in?

                                 BRITTANY
                        I never lived in Arizona.  Orange 
                        County born and bred.

                                 KENDRA
                        Don’t wear your wedding ring?

                                 BRITTANY
                        I’m not married.

                                 KENDRA
                        Really?  Huh.

           This really makes Kendra suspicious.

                                 KENDRA (cont’d)
                        Okay.  Nice meeting you.

                                 BRITTANY
                        You too.

           Kendra turns and walks out of the office.  Brittany breathes 
           a big sigh of relief and reconnects her phone call.

           INT. KATY SLATE’S BAR - NIGHT

           Billy sits in his usual spot drinking his usual scotch but 
           this time has a very nervous look on his face.  
           Jonah walks over and sits down with him.  On the television 
           behind Jonah, TORI IS ON A TALK SHOW, discussing her new 
           book.

                                 JONAH
                        As a lifetime Yankees fan, all I 
                        ask is that you start betting on 
                        the Red Sox.

                                 BILLY
                        I don’t have the money I owe you.

           Jonah’s usual easy going nature is immediately wiped away.  
           He looks at Billy as if he didn’t hear him correctly.

                                 JONAH
                        What does that mean?

                                 BILLY
                        The fuck you think?

                                 JONAH
                        Don’t get testy with me, bitch.  
                        You are into me six figures and you 
                        couldn’t pick a winner if it was 
                        tattooed on your balls.

                                 BILLY
                        I’ll have your money.  Next week.  
                        Week after at the latest.

           Jonah leans back in his chair, thinking over how to proceed.  
           The Waitress delivers his usual tequila which he immediately 
           downs.

                                 JONAH
                        My money?  You know who backs me, 
                        right?

                                 BILLY
                        Of course.

                                 JONAH
                        So it’s not me you owe.  It’s him.  
                        And he wants his money.

                                 BILLY
                        He’ll get it.

                                 JONAH
                        In full next week.  Or try booking 
                        a seat on the space shuttle.
           Jonah gets up quickly and exits the bar.  Billy looks too 
           scared to move.

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Eli and Tori are both well dressed to go to dinner.  Tori is 
           looking at Eli like he just told her he was born on a distant 
           planet.

                                 TORI
                        Wait.  So, you want to celebrate my 
                        book being published by going out 
                        to dinner with a woman you fathered 
                        twenty five years ago out of 
                        wedlock and never told me about?

                                 ELI
                        Essentially.

                                 TORI
                        Am I supposed to pretend your lying 
                        to me for eleven years isn’t a 
                        problem?

                                 ELI
                        It might help the evening go more 
                        smoothly.

                                 TORI
                        Do you expect me to welcome her 
                        into the family?

                                 ELI
                        Only if you’re comfortable with 
                        that.

                                 TORI
                        I’m not comfortable with any of 
                        this!  It all makes me decidedly 
                        uncomfortable!

                                 ELI
                        I should probably also tell you 
                        that she’s a retired porn star.  
                        Just in case it comes up in 
                        conversation.

                                 TORI
                        Ah huh.
                            (beat)
                        No fucking way.
           Tori takes off her high heels and starts walking back up to 
           her bedroom.

                                 ELI
                        Wait.  Please, Tori.

           She stops and turns around, looking at Eli like, what could 
           you possibly have to say?

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        I’m her Father.  I don’t want to 
                        pretend anymore that I’m not.

           Tori sees the expression on Eli’s face and sighs deeply, 
           thinks about it for a second and then puts her high heels 
           back on.

           INT. TREVOR’S CAR - NIGHT

           Trevor and Kendra are dressed up for dinner and driving 
           through Dana Point.  Trevor looks very confused by what he’s 
           doing and Kendra looks pissed.

                                 TREVOR
                        I don’t get why you want to do 
                        this.

                                 KENDRA
                        It’s dinner, not a U.N. Summit.

                                 TREVOR
                        You talk about your Father like 
                        you’d love to see him dead.  Now 
                        we’re going to share shrimp 
                        dumplings with him?

                                 KENDRA
                        Oh, he’ll be dead.

           Trevor looks at Kendra strangely for that comment.  She plays 
           it off.

                                 KENDRA (cont’d)
                        Ya know.  Some day.

           A long heavy silence passes between them.  Kendra skillfully 
           dampens the anger she has towards Trevor and speaks to him in 
           a soft tone.

                                 KENDRA (cont’d)
                        I was in the office today.
                                 TREVOR
                            (perked up:)
                        Yeah?

                                 KENDRA
                        Met Brittany.

           Guilt washes over Trevor’s face.  He looks out his window for 
           a second, fighting to look innocent.

                                 TREVOR
                        Ah huh?

                                 KENDRA
                        Very young.  And thin.

           A bead of sweat appears on Trevor’s forehead but he doesn’t 
           wipe it away.

                                 TREVOR
                        You think so?

                                 KENDRA
                        Definitely.  I told her she must be 
                        used to the hot weather, being from 
                        Arizona and all and she told me 
                        she’s never even been to Arizona.

                                 TREVOR
                        Why would you think she’s from 
                        Arizona?

           Kendra smirks, spotting Trevor’s lie in a micro-second.  She 
           speaks in an even more easy going tone.

                                 KENDRA
                        You told me she was.  And that she 
                        was married, but strangely enough, 
                        she doesn’t wear a wedding ring.

                                 TREVOR
                        I never told you she was married.

                                 KENDRA
                        No?

                                 TREVOR
                        No.

           Kendra smirks again, loving the power of knowing Trevor is 
           lying.  She looks out her window and calmly lets it go.
                                 KENDRA
                        Oh.  I must be confused.

           Trevor sees that she’s looking the other way and quickly 
           wipes the sweat off his forehead.

                                 TREVOR
                        Must be.

           INT. FIVE STAR RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The restaurant is packed with Orange County’s most upscale 
           residents.  Eli, Tori, Kendra and Trevor sit at a large table 
           in the middle of the floor with a squadron of Waiters and Bus 
           Boys kissing their asses.  

           The tension is as thick as New England clam chowder.  Tori is 
           pissed at Eli but hides it well.  Kendra is livid with Trevor 
           but hides it even better.  All of them look like they would 
           rather be receiving shock treatment than be at this dinner 
           right now.

           They read menus to avoid eye contact at all costs.  Kendra 
           chugs a large Martini and waves down the Waiter who is on her 
           in a micro-second.

                                 KENDRA
                        I’m gonna need another of these.

                                 WAITER
                        Yes, ma’am.

                                 TORI
                        I’d like one too, please.

                                 WAITER
                        Of course.

                                 KENDRA
                            (to Trevor:)
                        Have a cocktail, dear.

                                 TREVOR
                        I’m driving.

                                 KENDRA
                        Can’t cheat and drive?

                                 TREVOR
                        What was that?

                                 KENDRA
                        Drink and drive.
           Kendra smiles politely like it was just a slip of the tongue.  
           Trevor lets it go but sneaks worried peaks at Kendra out of 
           the corner of his eye.

           Tori points at one of the Bus Boys and whispers to Eli.

                                 TORI
                        Looks kind of like you.

                                 ELI
                        Maybe a little.

                                 TORI
                        He another bastard of yours?

           Eli shifts in his seat uncomfortably but doesn’t say 
           anything.  The Waiter brings over Kendra’s and Tori’s 
           martinis and they start drinking them immediately.

                                 ELI
                        Could I have one of those too 
                        please?

                                 WARREN
                        Yes, sir.

                                 TREVOR
                        One for me as well.

           INT. FIVE STAR RESTAURANT - HALF AN HOUR LATER

           They are eating gorgeous appetizers and all four guzzling 
           martinis.  Tori and Kendra have a good buzz on.

                                 TORI
                        So?  Kendra?  Eli tells me you were 
                        in porn.

           Kendra spits out a mouth full of martini.  Trevor looks 
           around nervously for whoever might have heard that.

                                 KENDRA
                        Is that like, in the stock market?

                                 TORI
                        Sorry.  This is all pretty new to 
                        me.  I only learned about you an 
                        hour ago.
                            (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 TORI (cont'd)
                        Does your husband have any 
                        illegitimate children he just 
                        sprung on you because I could use a 
                        little advice on how to deal with 
                        it?

                                 KENDRA
                        Not that I know of.  But he does 
                        have a secretary he’s boning.

           Trevor spits out a mouth full of martini.

                                 TORI
                        Oh.  I guess that’s worse than an 
                        illegitimate child.  But I’m not 
                        sure.
                            (to Eli:)
                        Which one is worse, honey?

                                 ELI
                        Boning the secretary.  In my 
                        opinion.

                                 TREVOR
                        No way.  It’s not even close.

           Kendra stares daggers at Eli.

                                 KENDRA
                        Having an illegitimate child is 
                        worse.  That you abandon.  Ignore.  
                        Disavow.

                                 TREVOR
                        I completely agree.

                                 KENDRA
                        Shut up.

                                 ELI
                            (to Kendra:)
                        I’m sorry, okay?  Really sorry.  
                        But you of all people should know 
                        what’s it like to have skeletons.

           Kendra turns red with fury.

                                 KENDRA
                        Oh, “Me of all people?”

           Eli desperately tries to back track.
                                 ELI
                        No, I just...think that no one is 
                        recognizing that I’m trying to make 
                        things right.

                                 TORI
                        Aren’t you the fucking boy scout.

                                 KENDRA
                        I can not believe I was considering 
                        letting you see my Mother.

           INT. FIVE STAR RESTAURANT - HALF AN HOUR LATER

           Enormous plates of entrees sit in front of each of them.  
           They pick at their food, each now looking pretty sloshed.  
           Trevor is attempting to apologize to Kendra.  Eli is 
           attempting to apologize to Tori.  Each couple talks out of 
           ear shot from the other.

                                 TREVOR
                            (to Kendra:)
                        I’m sorry, okay?  Really sorry.  It 
                        didn’t mean anything.  It was...  
                        recreation.

                                 KENDRA
                        Oh.  You mean like a rowing 
                        machine?

                                 ELI
                            (to Tori:)
                        I didn’t tell you because, I didn’t 
                        think it would ever be discovered.

                                 TORI
                        You have an Enron Executive’s grasp 
                        of honesty.

                                 TREVOR
                            (to Kendra:)
                        We could go to counseling.  Talk it 
                        out.  Try to move forward.

                                 KENDRA
                        Is a Marriage Counselor able to go 
                        back in time and prevent your penis 
                        from entering your secretary?

                                 TREVOR
                        No.  They can’t do that.
                                 ELI
                            (to Tori:)
                        Why does it matter so much?  It was 
                        twenty five years ago, for Christ’s 
                        sake.

                                 TORI
                        Because it makes me think that 
                        you’ve been lying to me about a lot 
                        of other, bigger things, for the 
                        entire time we’ve been married!

           That hits Eli hard, knowing full well that he has been lying 
           to her about a lot of other, much bigger things.

                                 TREVOR
                            (to Kendra:)
                        I’ve forgiven you for a lotta shit.  
                        You should be able to forgive me 
                        for this.

                                 KENDRA
                        What I did in my past was before I 
                        took an oath to be faithful to you.

                                 TREVOR
                        For armies of faceless men you were 
                        Grand Central Station, but for the 
                        one man you promised to love and 
                        honor till death do you part, 
                        you’re a frigid corpse.

           Trevor’s words are like a meat cleaver to Kendra’s chest.  
           She looks at him on the verge of tears and violence, 
           simultaneously.

                                 KENDRA
                        If you’d done what I’ve done and 
                        been through what I’ve been 
                        through, you would never have sex 
                        again in your entire life.  I 
                        promise you that.

                                 TREVOR
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t mean-

                                 KENDRA
                        Tomorrow, Conner and I are packing 
                        up our stuff and we’re leaving.

                                 TREVOR
                        No, please-
                                 KENDRA
                        Fuck you.

           Kendra gets up from the table and walks drunkenly towards the 
           exit.  Trevor doesn’t have the strength or sobriety to chase 
           after her.

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, BATH ROOM - MORNING

           Eli stands in front of the mirror, holding the completely 
           full bottle of AZT.  He looks down at the pills, wanting to 
           put one in his mouth but unable to make his hand do it.

           Finally he puts the lid back on the bottle without taking a 
           pill and hides it in the cabinet in its usual spot.

           When he closes the cabinet, Eli stands up straight and looks 
           himself in the eye for a long moment in the mirror.  He does 
           not like the person he sees.

           After a second, Eli remembers something and pulls his cell 
           phone out of his pocket, dialing a number from a ripped piece 
           of paper on the bathroom counter.

           INT. KENDRA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Kendra is driving down the freeway, looking very frazzled and 
           very pissed.  Conner is sitting in back.  Her cell phone 
           rings and she answers it.

                                 KENDRA
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT BETWEEN: ELI’S BATHROOM AND KENDRA’S CAR

                                 ELI
                        Hi.  It’s...
                            (wants to say, Dad)
                        Eli.

           Kendra could not be less thrilled to talk to Eli right now.

                                 KENDRA
                        Oh.  Hello, Eli.

                                 ELI
                        Look, I just wanted to apologize 
                        for last night.  Didn’t exactly go 
                        as planned.

                                 KENDRA
                        I don’t know, I thought it was a 
                        hoot.
                                 ELI
                        Let me make it up to you.

                                 KENDRA
                        No. 

                                 ELI
                        As in, no?

                                 KENDRA
                        I thought you might have a place in 
                        my life, but ya know, you really 
                        really don’t.

                                 ELI
                        But-

                                 KENDRA
                        You should have stayed away, Eli.  
                        It would have been better for 
                        everyone involved.

                                 ELI
                        Look, I-

                                 KENDRA
                        You’re gonna die alone, “DAD.”  A 
                        miserable, broken shell of a man.  
                        And that’s how it should be.

           Kendra hangs up her phone and presses down hard on her car’s 
           accelerator.

           Eli stares at his cell phone as the dial tone reverberates in 
           his ear.  He is too crushed to move.

           INT. ELI’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Eli walks into his bedroom.  Tori is lying in bed and 
           suffering through an agonizing hang over.

                                 TORI
                        Owww.  How did you let me drink so 
                        much?

                                 ELI
                        I couldn’t have stopped you.

           He sits down on his side of the bed.  Tori rolls over and 
           looks at him for a long beat.  Eli can’t meet her eyes.

                                 TORI
                        Do you remember when we met?
                                 ELI
                        Of course.

                                 TORI
                        I was the, star eyed, idiot 
                        wannabe.  You were the polished, 
                        confident, media star.

                                 ELI
                        Had you fooled.

                                 TORI
                        God, I loved that about you.  That 
                        confidence.  That unwavering belief 
                        in yourself.  I can’t remember ever 
                        wanting someone so much.
                            (beat)
                        Where has that gone, Eli?

                                 ELI
                        Richard.

                                 TORI
                        Huh?

           Eli turns around and meets his wife’s eyes, never allowing 
           himself to look away.

                                 ELI
                        My name is, Richard Sullivan.  Not, 
                        Eli Webb.

                                 TORI
                        Why in God’s name are you bringing 
                        that up?

                                 ELI
                        Because I can’t lie anymore.

                                 TORI
                        Okay...?

                                 ELI
                        What you said in the restaurant, 
                        about me lying to you about much 
                        bigger things.  You were right.

           Tori swallows hard, not sure she wants to hear this 
           confession.

                                 TORI
                        What do you mean?
                                 ELI
                        I have been lying to you.  About a 
                        lot bigger things.  For a long 
                        time.

           Tori’s face becomes very pale.  She sits up, awaiting the 
           nuclear missile that is about to land on her head.

           Eli looks in his wife’s eyes for a long moment, hating that 
           he is about to crush her like a bug but unable to carry the 
           lie anymore.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        I’m HIV positive.

           The only sound in the room is of all the air escaping from 
           Tori’s lungs.  Her eyes instantly fill with tears.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        I’ve been unfaithful to you.  Many 
                        many times.  You need to get tested 
                        right away.

           Instead of getting angry, Tori seems to wilt like a dead 
           flower, maintaining silent eye contact with her husband as 
           tears flood down her face.

           Eli starts to cry as he watches Tori come apart at the seems.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        I’m sorry, Tori.  I am so, so very 
                        sorry.

           She takes a gargantuan breath and considers very carefully 
           what she’s about to say before opening her mouth.

                                 TORI
                        Get out.
                            (beat)
                        And don’t ever come back.

           INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Kendra and Conner walk into the cramped, beat up room 
           carrying two suitcases.  They look around, very unimpressed.

                                 CONNER
                        I like it.  It’s small.  But dirty.

                                 KENDRA
                        It’s temporary.
           Kendra collapses on the bed in exhaustion.  Conner looks at 
           Kendra out of the corner of his eye, still feeling tension 
           towards her.

                                 CONNER
                        Can we have a play date with Reagan 
                        and Eli?

           Kendra is so tired that the edit function doesn’t kick in, 
           saying the first thing that comes to mind.

                                 KENDRA
                        When Flamingos fly out of my butt.

           Kendra looks at Conner, realizing that she probably shouldn’t 
           have said that to a seven year old.  After a second she 
           smirks and then Conner smirks.  Then they both bust out 
           laughing hilariously, providing a much needed thaw in the 
           tension between them.

           Their laughter goes on for several seconds and then subsides.  
           Kendra takes a long silent look at her son, knowing what she 
           has to do.

                                 KENDRA (CONT'D) (cont’d)
                        Conner, come over and sit down for 
                        a minute.

           Conner reluctantly sits down on the other bed, across from 
           Kendra.

                                 KENDRA (cont’d)
                        We need to talk about what happened 
                        at the grocery store that day.
                            (beat)
                        That man called me, Nina Naughty.  
                        And some other, terrible things.
                            (beat)
                        He called me those things because 
                        that’s what I was.  That’s who I 
                        was.  I used to star in adult 
                        films.  Pornography.  Do you know 
                        what that is?

           Conner shakes his head no and looks very scared by what he 
           thinks he’s about to hear.

                                 KENDRA (CONT'D)
                        Remember when we had our talk about 
                        sex?
                            (off his nod:)
                        Well, pornography is movies.  With 
                        sex.  
                                 CONNER
                        Like, The Lion King?

                                 KENDRA
                        Is there sex in, The Lion King?

                                 CONNER
                        I think so.

                                 KENDRA
                        Pornography is not at all like, The 
                        Lion King.

           Kendra takes a deep breath, thinking hard about how to 
           explain this adequately.

                                 KENDRA (CONT'D)
                        In pornography, live people have 
                        sex.  It’s very graphic and the 
                        people in the movies become 
                        objects.  Pieces of meat.
                            (beat)
                        I was one of the people that had 
                        sex in those movies.  That’s why 
                        that man talked to me like I was 
                        trash.
                            (beat)
                        Because I was trash.

           Conner starts to cry.

                                 CONNER
                        Why did you do that?

                                 KENDRA
                        I was a very young, single mom and 
                        it was the only way I could put 
                        food on the table.  I was 
                        desperate.  And I didn’t much like 
                        myself.
                            (beat)
                        But as you started getting older, I 
                        realized that I had to change my 
                        life to be an example for you.  To 
                        be someone you could look up to.

                                 CONNER
                        Are you ever going to be in those 
                        movies again?

                                 KENDRA
                        No.  Never.
                                 CONNER
                        Promise?

                                 KENDRA
                        Promise.

           Conner slows his crying and takes a tissue off the night 
           stand, dabbing his eyes.  He sits back on his bed and turns 
           on the television with the remote control.

                                 CONNER
                        You’re not trash.  You’re my Mom.

           Kendra chokes back a tear and stares at her son for a long 
           moment, wanting to say something to make everything okay.  
           After a few seconds, she realizes it’s unnecessary and sits 
           back in her bed, watching the television.

           INT. FOUR STAR HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Eli walks into the large, well stocked, beautifully furnished 
           room with a suitcase in one hand and a garment bag over his 
           shoulder.

           He drops his luggage down on the floor and looks around at 
           his new home, letting out a big sigh.

           EXT. HELEN’S NURSING HOME, OUTSIDE DECK - DAY

           Kendra sits with her mother on the small deck, staring out at 
           the Burger King parking lot.

                                 KENDRA
                        Eli wants to come and see you.

           Kendra searches her Mother’s face for a reaction but there 
           isn’t any.

                                 KENDRA (cont’d)
                        I told him no way.

           Still no reaction.  Kendra isn’t sure if it’s that she 
           doesn’t care or her limited mobility won’t allow it.

                                 KENDRA (CONT'D)
                        I can’t allow him to ease his 
                        guilt.  I’d rather he swim in it.
                            (beat)
                        He would never be reaching out to 
                        me if he wasn’t sick.
                            (off her look:)
                        He has HIV.
           Helen is hit hard by this news, having clearly never stopped 
           loving Eli.  She looks off in the distance with tears forming 
           in her eyes.

                                 HELEN
                        He’s a part of you.

           Helen’s words hit Kendra hard.  She looks at her mother for a 
           long moment, really thinking about what she said.

           We pull back through the open sliding glass doors to the 
           deck:

           INT. HELEN’S NURSING HOME, SLIDING DOORS - CONTINUOUS

           STANDING THERE IS BILLY, eavesdropping on Helen and Kendra’s 
           conversation.  He gets a smirk on his face like he just won 
           the lottery and then scurries off.

           EXT. HUNTINGTON GARDENS, ROSE GARDEN - DAY

           Eli walks through the humongous rose garden with Reagan who 
           is enthralled with the endless variety of roses.  Eli looks 
           carefully at the placards under each plant, explaining them 
           to Reagan with genuine enthusiasm.

                                 ELI
                        This one’s a hybrid.

                                 REAGAN
                        That like a mutt?

                                 ELI
                        Exactly.
                            (beat)
                        Bet we could make our own hybrid.

                                 REAGAN
                        Really?

                                 ELI
                        Sure.  We buy a couple different 
                        rose bushes from a nursery, graft 
                        the roots together, and see what 
                        grows.

                                 REAGAN
                        Cool.

                                 ELI
                        Very cool.
                                 REAGAN
                        Dad?

                                 ELI
                        Yeah?

                                 REAGAN
                        Do you think flowers are gay?

                                 ELI
                        Absolutely not.

                                 REAGAN
                        Some of the kids in my class think 
                        they are.

                                 ELI
                        Well, they’re wrong.

                                 REAGAN
                        Cuz I like flowers.  But I’m not 
                        gay.

                                 ELI
                        Take it from me: flowers are not in 
                        the slightest bit gay.

           Reagan smiles widely at his Father.  A contented silence 
           passes between them as they walk past several impressive rose 
           bushes.

                                 REAGAN
                        When are you coming home?

                                 ELI
                        I don’t know, buddy.

                                 REAGAN
                        You and mom have a fight?

                                 ELI
                        I did something very wrong.  And 
                        Mom isn’t sure if she can ever 
                        forgive me for it.

                                 REAGAN
                        Can’t you undo it?

                                 ELI
                        No.  I’m afraid not.

                                 REAGAN
                        Will you get divorced?
                                 ELI
                        I don’t know.

           Reagan starts to cry.  Eli sees this and kneels down, holding 
           his son by the shoulders.

                                 REAGAN
                        I don’t want you to get divorced.

                                 ELI
                        I don’t want that either.

                                 REAGAN
                        I hate mom!

                                 ELI
                        No.  I’m the one who was bad.  Not 
                        her.

           Eli hugs his son tightly.

                                 REAGAN
                        Will you still take me to school in 
                        the morning?  

                                 ELI
                        Definitely.  

                                 REAGAN
                        And pick me up?

                                 ELI
                        No matter what.

                                 REAGAN
                        Cuz I like that.

                                 ELI
                        Me too.

           INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Kendra and Conner sit back on their beds watching television.  
           Kendra looks at the clock impatiently.

                                 KENDRA
                        How long ago did we call Dominos?

                                 CONNER
                        Long.

                                 KENDRA
                        I’m going to call them again.
           Kendra starts to pick up the phone when the there’s a knock 
           at the door.

                                 KENDRA (cont’d)
                        Finally.  I could eat a wildebeest.

                                 CONNER
                        I could eat a warthog.

                                 KENDRA
                        I could eat two warthogs.

           Kendra walks to the door and opens it.  Standing there is 
           Trevor.

                                 TREVOR
                        Hey.

                                 KENDRA
                        Hey.

                                 TREVOR
                        I would have called, if I didn’t 
                        think you’d hang up.

           Kendra steps outside with Trevor and closes the door behind 
           her.

           EXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kendra stands against the door and looks hard into Trevor’s 
           eyes.  Trevor has an apologetic expression on his face.

                                 TREVOR
                        How have you been?

                                 KENDRA
                        Fine.

                                 TREVOR
                        And Conner?

                                 KENDRA
                        What do you want?

                                 TREVOR
                        To see you.  To talk to you.  To 
                        apologize to you.

                                 KENDRA
                        Alright.  Here I am.
                                 TREVOR
                        What I did was terrible but it’s 
                        not unforgiveable.

                                 KENDRA
                        You mean, it’s not unforgiveable 
                        for a slut like me.

                                 TREVOR
                        I didn’t say that.

                                 KENDRA
                        In the restaurant you said that.

                                 TREVOR
                        I was drunk.  I was looking for any 
                        justification for fucking my 
                        secretary.

           Kendra softens a bit.  Trevor sees this and pauses to think 
           before speaking.

                                 TREVOR (CONT'D)
                        I admit, sometimes I struggle with 
                        what you used to be and I wonder 
                        what kind of person could have done 
                        those things.
                            (beat)
                        But I love you, Kendra.  That fact 
                        has never changed.

           Kendra looks like she’s starting to be swayed by Trevor.

                                 KENDRA
                        You love me?

                                 TREVOR
                        Very much.

           Kendra takes a long beat, looking deeply into Trevor’s eyes 
           and running his words over and over in her brain.

                                 KENDRA
                        I don’t believe you.  

                                 TREVOR
                        Why?

                                 KENDRA
                        You will always use my past against 
                        me.
                                 TREVOR
                        No, Kendra-

                                 KENDRA
                        I can forgive myself for what I 
                        was.  You can’t.  And the days of 
                        me letting people treat me like 
                        dirt are over.

                                 TREVOR
                        I have never treated you like dirt.

                                 KENDRA
                        You did last night.  And in small 
                        ways pretty much every day we’ve 
                        been together.
                            (long beat)
                        Good bye, Trevor.

           Kendra starts to go back in the room but Trevor grabs her arm 
           desperately.

                                 TREVOR
                        Okay, you’re right.  I’m sorry.  I 
                        can change.

                                 KENDRA
                        No.  I’ll always be Nina Naughty to 
                        you.

           INT. ELI’S AGENT’S OFFICE - DAY

           Eli sits in the chair across from Davis’s desk, looking like 
           this is the last place on earth he wants to be.  Davis sits 
           at his desk, reading a list off his computer.

                                 DAVIS
                        I’ve had a bounty of offers for you 
                        to do television.  Two different 
                        game shows have called me for you 
                        to host and a half dozen sitcoms 
                        want guest spots.

                                 ELI
                        Uh, I don’t know...

                                 DAVIS
                        Of course, if you wanted to get 
                        back into radio, Paracom would be 
                        willing to start slow.  Let you get 
                        your feet wet first before you dive 
                        back in.
           Eli is staring to look like he did at the beginning of his 
           national broadcast, fighting off a complete breakdown.

                                 ELI
                        I need to use the bathroom.

                                 DAVIS
                        Okay.

           Eli gets up and walks quickly to the bathroom.

           INT. ELI’S AGENT’S OFFICE, BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Eli splashes a cold water in his face and stands in front of 
           the mirror, looking hard into his own eyes.  It’s as if he’s 
           looking into the eyes of a complete stranger who would 
           require a mountain of effort to get to know.

           Slowly, a glimmer of recognition comes over Eli’s face as a 
           speck of realization washes over him.  A very slight smile 
           forms in the corner of his mouth.

           Eli remembers something and reaches into his pocket, pulling 
           out the pill bottle of AZT.  He holds the bottle up in front 
           of his eyes to examine it and takes off the lid, looking into 
           the full bottle.

           He stares at the pills as if fighting a pitched battle with 
           his own soul on whether or not to pick one up and put it in 
           his mouth.  Finally, with great tormented effort, Eli reaches 
           down and picks up one of the pills.

           He holds the pill in front of his eyes, examining every 
           contour and considering all the ramifications of ingesting 
           it.  Then, in one quick motion, he puts the pill in his 
           mouth, turns on the faucet to drink, and SWALLOWS THE PILL.

           He looks himself in the eye in the mirror for a long moment 
           as if seeing an entirely different person than he’s ever seen 
           before.

           INT. ELI’S AGENT’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Eli strolls out of the bathroom with a confident, content 
           look on his face.  He walks right up to Davis’s desk with his 
           hand out to shake.

                                 ELI
                        I want to thank you, Davis.  You’ve 
                        been a good Agent.

           Davis stands up but doesn’t shake Eli’s hand.
                                 DAVIS
                        That doesn’t sound good.

                                 ELI
                        I’m out.  Done with it all.  But I 
                        don’t want you to blame yourself.
                            (beat)
                        It’s just not me anymore.

           Davis hesitates for a long beat and then shakes Eli’s hand.

                                 DAVIS
                        If you change your mind, you know 
                        where to reach me.

                                 ELI
                        I won’t.

           They shake hands for a long moment and then Eli turns and 
           walks out of Davis’s office.

           EXT. HUNTINGTON BEACH PIER - DAY

           Billy sits alone on the bench.  After a second, Eli walks 
           over and sits down next to him with an amused smirk on his 
           face.

                                 ELI
                        I couldn’t resist coming.  These 
                        days, it’s my biggest source of 
                        entertainment.

                                 BILLY
                        You’re HIV positive.

           Eli’s amused smirk dissolves.

                                 BILLY (cont’d)
                        Still entertained?

                                 ELI
                        How the...?

                                 BILLY
                        When it comes to you, I know 
                        everything.

                                 ELI
                        You are just...fucking filth.
                                 BILLY
                        Now, you may be off the air, so 
                        having a bastard porn star child 
                        might not be worth much, but HIV?  
                        That’s the mother load.

                                 ELI
                        I’ve paid you a lot of money.  Why 
                        can’t you just leave me alone?

                                 BILLY
                        I’ll tell you why, Eli.  Because 
                        despite being the most 
                        hypocritical, two faced weasel who 
                        ever walked the earth, you still 
                        think you’re better than me.

                                 ELI
                        I don’t think I’m better than 
                        anyone.

                                 BILLY
                        Bull shit.  The price is two 
                        hundred thousand.
                            (off his look:)
                        I would have kept it at a hundred 
                        but cuz you gave me such a high 
                        hand last time, it’s doubled.

           Billy stands up but doesn’t walk away.  He speaks to Eli with 
           his back turned to him.

                                 BILLY (CONT'D)
                        I can see the headline now: former 
                        conservative radio talk show host 
                        and firebrand advocate of strict 
                        Christian values and moral 
                        responsibility, is rumored to have 
                        contracted, A FAGGOT’S DISEASE!
                            (beat)
                        Has a ring to it-

           Billy smiles like a Cheshire cat and turns around to gloat in 
           Eli’s face just in time to meet...

           ELI’S FIST, punching Billy square on the jaw with a 
           roundhouse right hook.  Billy falls back flat on his back, 
           blinking in and out of consciousness.  The people around them 
           yell out in shock and jump away.

                                 ELI
                        Two hundred thousand, huh?
                            (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELI (cont'd)
                        Well, that was one.  Lets count out 
                        the rest, shall we?

           Eli kneels over Billy and gives him another hard right hook 
           to the face.  Blood shoots out of Billy’s nose.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        That’s two.

           Eli punches him again even harder.  Billy is now completely 
           unconscious.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        Three.  This might take a while.

           Eli punches Billy again.  The people around him are utterly 
           horrified to see Eli beating the piss out of an unconscious 
           man whose face now looks like hamburger.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        Four.  I’m tired already.

           Eli punches Billy again.  Several of the spectators take out 
           cell phones and quickly dial.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        Five.  I think I’m getting my 
                        second wind.  Just a hundred ninety 
                        nine thousand nine hundred and 
                        ninety five more to go.

           Eli draws back his fist, preparing to throw yet another 
           punch.

           INT. LOW RENT NURSING HOME, COMMON ROOM - DAY

           C.U. TELEVISION

           Suzanne Coughlin is reading the news on the television.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Former conservative radio talk show 
                        host, Eli Webb, was arrested today 
                        in Huntington Beach on charges of 
                        aggravated assault and battery.

           The show cuts to camera footage of Eli being led in handcuffs 
           into the back of a police car and a crowd of reporters 
           yelling, “What happened, Eli?!”  Eli doesn’t answer, just 
           keeping his head down and ducking into the car.

           We pull back to see Helen, sitting in her wheel chair and 
           watching the television with the most concern she can muster 
           with her limited facial mobility.
                                 SUZANNE (cont’d)
                        The victim is reported to have 
                        suffered multiple fractures...

           Suzanne can’t help but give a little smirk at Eli’s 
           misfortune.

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Two uniformed POLICE OFFICERS lead Eli, in handcuffs, up to 
           the Sergeant's desk.

                                 POLICE OFFICER #1
                        Sullivan.  Richard.  Felony assault 
                        and battery.

           The DESK SERGEANT looks up curiously at Eli.

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                        He looks like that dick head on the 
                        radio.

           INT. ORANGE COUNTY JAIL, PROCESSING AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Eli, still in his street clothes, is lead into the jail along 
           with two dozen other recently arrested men.  Four Sheriff’s 
           DEPUTIES watch over the men, each wearing rubber gloves.

                                 DEPUTY#1
                        Take off all your clothes and stand 
                        on the white line!

           The other men begin complying, taking off their clothes.  Eli 
           looks around strangely and then starts slowly taking off his 
           clothes.

           INT. ORANGE COUNTY JAIL, PROCESSING AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           All the men, Eli included, are now stark naked and standing 
           on the white line in the middle of the floor.  One of the 
           deputies is checking each of their open mouths with a flash 
           light.

                                 DEPUTY#1
                        Bend over and spread your ass 
                        cheeks.

           The men all bend over and reach back spreading their ass 
           cheeks.  Deputy #2 walks behind them flashing a flash light 
           up their ass.

                                 DEPUTY#2
                        Cough.
           The man coughs and the deputy walks behind Eli, shining a 
           flash light up Eli’s ass.

                                 DEPUTY#2 (cont’d)
                        Cough.

           Eli coughs.

           INT. ORANGE COUNTY JAIL, PROCESSING AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           The men are all dressed in orange, O.C. Jail, jumpsuits.  
           They file slowly past a Deputy holding a clip board.

                                 CLIP BOARD DEPUTY
                        Name?

           A LATINO MAN speaks to the Deputy with a thick accent.

                                 LATINO MAN
                        Gonzalez.

                                 CLIP BOARD DEPUTY
                        HIV or AIDS?

                                 LATINO MAN
                        No.

           The Deputy nods for the man to continue down the hallway.  He 
           complies and Eli steps up to the Deputy.

                                 CLIP BOARD DEPUTY
                        Name?

                                 ELI
                        Sullivan.

                                 CLIP BOARD DEPUTY
                        HIV or AIDS?

                                 ELI
                        HIV.

           The Deputy draws back from Eli and shouts towards a Deputy in 
           the opposite direction.

                                 CLIP BOARD DEPUTY
                        Virus!

           The Deputy in the opposite direction waves Eli to come 
           towards him.  Eli complies, walking past Deputies who look at 
           him like he has bubonic plague.

           Eli is led into a small cell.  A very effeminate inmate, 
           JUAN(30’s), sickly, is lying on the bottom bunk and coughing 
           deep, tuberculosis coughs that seem to bring up half his 
           lungs with each hack.

           Eli looks at Juan in revulsion and tries to stay away from 
           him which is no easy feet given the tiny dimensions of the 
           cell.

                                 ELI
                        Hey.

                                 JUAN
                        Hey.

           Eli gets up on the top bunk and lies his head on the pillow.  
           Juan continues to cough.

                                 ELI
                        You okay?

                                 JUAN
                        Bitch, shut the fuck up.

           INT. GROCERY STORE, CHECK OUT LINE - DAY

           Kendra is in line with a full grocery cart.  She approaches 
           the clerk and looks in stunned disbelief at what she sees in 
           the tabloid rack.

           One of the tabloid magazines has a picture on the cover of 
           Eli, being led off the Huntington pier in handcuffs by 
           Police.  The headline reads, “Eli Webb, arrested for assault. 
           Report says he has HIV.”

                                 KENDRA
                        Oh...no.

           Kendra quickly grabs the magazine off the rack and looks 
           closely at it.  She appears deeply saddened for her Father’s 
           plight.

           INT. ORANGE COUNTY JAIL, ELI’S CELL - DAY

           Eli lies on the top bunk, semi asleep.  Juan lies on the 
           bottom bunk, continuing to cough up his lungs.

           A big, HARD ASS DEPUTY, walks over to the cell and bangs hard 
           on the bars with his night stick.
                                 HARD ASS DEPUTY
                        Sullivan!  Let’s go!

           The cell door opens and Eli looks at the Deputy in confusion.

                                 ELI
                        Huh?

                                 HARD ASS DEPUTY
                        You’re sprung!  Move it!

           Eli jumps off the bunk and moves towards the Deputy, still 
           appearing confused.

                                 ELI
                        I make bail?

                                 HARD ASS DEPUTY
                        I look like your Lawyer to you, 
                        mother fucker?!

           Eli steps out of the cell, taking one last look back at Juan 
           who continues to cough horribly.

                                 ELI
                        He sounds really sick.

                                 HARD ASS DEPUTY
                        Get the fuck outta here!

           INT. ORANGE COUNTY JAIL, ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Eli, now in his street clothes walks past Deputies towards 
           the exit, still not entirely sure what’s going on.

           Standing by the exit, is Kendra.  Eli is very pleasantly 
           surprised to see her.

                                 ELI
                        Wow.  I’m...amazed.

                                 KENDRA
                        That makes two of us.

           EXT. ORANGE COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS

           They walk out of the jail and into the massive parking lot.

                                 ELI
                        Thanks.  A lot.

                                 KENDRA
                        I was in the neighborhood. 
                                 ELI
                        How much was bail?

                                 KENDRA
                        Bail?  You didn’t hear?  District 
                        Attorney dropped the charges.

                                 ELI
                        What?  Why?

                                 KENDRA
                        The victim disappeared.
                            (off his look:)
                        The guy you beat up.  DA’s office 
                        said no one can find him.  No 
                        victim, no crime.

           Eli is amazed with his good luck.  They reach Kendra’s car 
           and she fishes in her purse for her car keys.

           INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER

           Kendra and Eli sit across from each other in a large booth.  
           Eli is eating ravenously.  Kendra is staring at her father in 
           deep thought.

                                 KENDRA
                        Weren’t you curious?

                                 ELI
                        Huh?

                                 KENDRA
                        Weren’t you curious?  About me?  
                        All those years you knew I was 
                        growing up, living life.  Weren’t 
                        you curious what I was doing?  What 
                        I was like?
                            (beat)
                        Your daughter?

           Eli swallows all the food in his mouth and takes a deep 
           breath, considering his answer.

                                 ELI
                        Whenever I thought about you, I 
                        just felt guilty.  I felt like a 
                        terrible person.
                            (beat)
                        So, I forced myself not to think 
                        about you.
           Kendra looks away, thinking about Eli’s answer.  A long 
           silence passes between them.

                                 ELI (CONT'D)
                        My real name’s, Richard Sullivan.

                                 KENDRA
                        I know.

                                 ELI
                        I have HIV.

                                 KENDRA
                        I know.

                                 ELI
                        I regret almost everything.  But as 
                        much as any of it, I regret not 
                        being a Father to you.

           Kendra looks long and hard at her Father, trying to figure 
           out how she now feels about him.

                                 KENDRA
                        I believe you.

           A long silent beat passes between them.  There is no urgency 
           to speak on either of their parts.  An ease has developed 
           between them.

                                 KENDRA (cont’d)
                        When you finish, we should go.

                                 ELI
                        Where?

                                 KENDRA
                        To see Mom.

           INT. HELEN’S NURSING HOME, COMMON ROOM - DAY

           Helen sits alone in her wheel chair, staring out the window.  
           After a second, she turns slightly to look at someone 
           approaching her.

           Although barely able to show any expression, she is clearly 
           amazed by who she sees.

           Standing over Helen is Eli.  He hesitates for a second, 
           unsure of what to do and then pulls up a chair and sits down 
           next to her.
           Eli looks into Helen’s eyes, trying to find the words to say 
           to her and realizing that there are no words he could 
           possibly say to her.  She stares back at him, waiting 
           unconditionally.

           After several seconds, Eli starts to cry.  He continues to 
           look Helen in the eye as the tears increase, flowing down his 
           cheeks and onto his shirt.

           Helen watches Eli cry, not feeling any judgement towards him 
           whatsoever.  With her very limited mobility, she manages 
           through great effort to raise her hand and place it on his 
           hand.

           Eli looks down at Helen’s hand on his hand.  He smiles 
           faintly at her and she smiles faintly back.  A burden is 
           lifted.

                                                      WE PULL BACK TO:

           KENDRA AND CONNER 

           Twenty feet away, sitting on the floor around some toys.  
           Kendra watches her parents hold hands for a long beat.  Then 
           she turns back and looks at Conner who’s also watching Eli 
           and Helen.

           Conner meets Kendra’s eyes, grins, and sums up just how 
           unexpected, unusual, and yet fundamentally necessary this 
           dysfunctional family reunion is.  Sounding like nothing so 
           much as Eli’s grandson, the soul of devilish wit, he whispers 
           to his mom:

                                 CONNER
                        Mom, a flamingo just flew out of 
                        your butt.

                                                      FADE OUT:
