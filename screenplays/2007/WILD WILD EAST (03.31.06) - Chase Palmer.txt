           I HEART AFGHANISTAN 

           INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY

           The driver, PVT. BEST, a girl not more than twenty-two, 
           navigates aggressively through the insane traffic of 
           Kandahar, Afghanistan. Her civil affairs team, a SERGEANT in 
           shotgun and TWO SPECIALISTS in back, fill out the vehicle.

                                 SERGEANT
                        You know, Best, for a chick you 
                        drive okay.

                                 PVT. BEST
                        Fuck you very much.

                                 SPECIALIST 1
                        That an invitation or recap?

           She scowls at him in the mirror. Doesn’t see...

           A TRUCK

           SIDESWIPE the humvee, plowing right into the Sergeant’s door. 

           Glass EXPLODES. Metal CRUNCHES. The humvee spins out and 
           lurches to a stop...

           Pvt. Best recovers, looks to the Sergeant beside her. A  
           tangled mess. Blood everywhere. He’s dead.

                                 PVT. BEST
                        Guys?

           The Specialists, both shaken but alright.

                                 SPECIALIST 1
                        Yeah... shit... 

                                 SPECIALIST 2
                        What the fuck was that?

           Pvt. Best, looks through the cracked windshield. Sees the 
           truck rolled on it’s side, cargo everywhere. A TECHNICAL, 
           pick-up rigged with a machine gun, skids to stop.

                                 PVT. BEST
                        Ali Babas! Out! Out! Out!

                        He’s dead, asshole.

           EXT. SIDE STREET - KANDAHAR - DAY

           Pvt. Best and the Specialists storm from their Humvee, M-4’s 
           locked and loaded, pissed and scared as hell. Thinking 
           ambush. Thinking anything.

           FOUR ALI BABAS, Afghan militia types, jump from the 
           technical, hands up, placating.

           Pvt. Best and the Specialists strafe over their heads.

                                 PVT. BEST
                        Get back! Get Back!
                      (then, in Farsi)
                        <<Away from truck!>>

           The Ali Babas do this.

                                 SPECIALIST 1
                        Fucking move, Osama! 

           Specialist 2 sees something on the road. Picks up a BRICK OF 
           HEROIN.

                                 SPECIALIST 2
                        Uh, guys?

           ALI BABA 1 steps forward, broad smile pasted on his handsome 
           face. His demeanor curiously unruffled, unworried.

                                 ALI BABA 1
                        Uncle Sam all cool, Joe.

                                 PVT. BEST
                        Uncle Sam is definitely not cool. 
                        Our man is definitely not cool.

           She points to the humvee, the dead Sergeant.

           Ali Baba 1 sees this, his demeanor blackens.

                                 ALI BABA 1
                        You should get him to hospital.

                                 SPECIALIST 1
                        Shut him the fuck up! 

           Specialist 1 gets aggressive waving his rifle.

                                 ALI BABA 1
                        This is bad scene, Joe. You don’t 
                        want to do this.

           Pvt. Best throttles him to the ground.

                                 PVT. BEST
                        Who you callin’ Joe?

           Specialist 2 sees heroin bricks all over the road, scattered 
           from the back of the van. He backpedals to the humvee, rifle 
           up.

                                 SPECIALIST 2
                        I’m gonna call this shit in.

           Ali Baba 1 looks back to his second, or perhaps his boss, 
           FACE COVERED BY A HEAD SCARF, only the eyes blazing. 
           Specialist 1 sees the exchange.

                                 SPECIALIST 1
                        You! Get over here!

           Scarfman doesn’t move.

           Specialist 2 at the humvee, grabs the radio.

                                 SPECIALIST 1
                        Now, Osama. And lose the headscarf. 
                        Tell him, Best.

           Pvt. Best, distracted for the moment.

                                 PVT. BEST
                      (in Farsi)
                        <<Remove your headscarf.>>

           Ali Baba 1 knocks away her rifle. Shots rings out.

           Specialist 1 turns...

           The Scarfman whips out an old school SMITH & WESSON revolver, 
           gunslinger style, and wastes Specialist 1 with a shot in the 
           ear.

           Specialist 2 sees this, fumbles in desperation, half with the 
           radio, half raising his weapon.

                      (over radio)
                        Oh my God? Hello? Hello?

           A third Ali Baba jumps on the technical’s flatbed and opens 
           up its big-ass machine gun on the humvee. 

           Specialist 2 shredded inside.

           Pvt. Best wrestles Ali Baba 1 for control of her rifle. He’s 
           stronger, but she’s scrappier. A head butt square in the nose 
           sends him yowling. She takes back the gun and strafes him at 
           close range, blood coating her.

           She rolls up, the Scarfman kicking her rifle from her hands.

           He’s got her dead to rights, Smith & Wesson in her face. They 
           exchange a last, hard look.

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

           Words exploding on screen with each gunshot. Ennio Morricone 
           inspired “spaghetti western” cords set the badass mood.

           SCARFMAN removes his headscarf. No remorse. He’s AMERICAN.

           KIEV, UKRAINE - DAY (ONE YEAR LATER)

           We swoop over the stark, sword wielding Rodnya Mat 
           (Motherland Statue) overlooking the snow-dusted city of Kiev.

           INT. PREMIER PALACE - DAY

           Track through the Soviet-chic lobby of a luxurious hotel, 
           recently-renovated with new money and zero taste. A man with 
           Johnny Cash confidence and the wardrobe to back it up lingers 
           pretending to read Dashiell Hammett’s Red Harvest.

           STEPHENS, a Brit in his 50’s, sees the book title. Comes up.

           INT. CAFE - PREMIER PALACE - DAY 

           The Fixer takes a seat across from Stephens and a young, very 
           attractive UKRAINIAN GIRL.

                                 STEPHENS
                        The consulate rejected her visa 
                        application. I can’t leave without 
                        her. I won’t.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Just married?

                        Money’s not an issue.

           The Fixer sizes up the girl.

                                 THE FIXER
                        I’ll bet.

           She blows smoke in his face.

                                 STEPHENS
                        Just like that?

                                 THE FIXER
                        Just like that. Here to do 
                        business, I know people. Here to 
                        party, I know other people.

           The Fixer levels her a knowing stare.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Can I talk to your new bride? 
                        Alone.

                                 STEPHENS

                        I’ll send for my boy.

                        I don’t have any plan but getting

                        You wanna go anywhere, you’ll tell

                        What if he doesn’t want me then?

                                 THE FIXER
                        Then he wouldn’t make much of a 
                        father, would he?

           She walks to the bar like it were a gas chamber. 

           The Fixer watches her tell him. She’s gentle, her steely 
           facade softened. Stephens face falls into a blank mask. He 
           forces a smile, whispers comfort, then walks over to The 
           Fixer.

                        She’ll likely leave you before you 
                        pick up your baggage.

           Stephens knows this, but doesn’t care.

                        Meet the kid. If everyone still 
                        wants to do this, get in touch. 
                        I’ll get both visas. One for her, 
                        one for the child.

           The Fixer turns to see CHEEVER, a rooster necked American 
           smoothie in a bad suit and cheap sunglasses. (NOTE: Also not

                        existed before noon.

           Cheever leans against a JEEP sporting DIPLOMATIC PLATES.

           Driver drives, they ride. Friendly acquaintances who wouldn’t 
           crawl into a lifeboat together.

                        Sorry it’s so last second. My

                        I’d think that be grounds for

                                 CHEEVER
                        I can’t. She’s a spy for the 
                        Ukrainian SBU. Better to know the 
                        snake in your grass, even if that 
                        snake schedules my lunches.

           INT. PARLOUR - DAY 

           Angle overhead on an opulent Tzarist-era room and middle-aged 
           blond beauty, cocked back Christ-like in a chair. Other women 
           attend to her hands and feet like little birds, giving a 
           manicure and pedicure. A hand-picked pool of journalists hang 
           on her every word. This is VITA LYSENKO (40), darling of the 
           orange revolution, Ukraine’s democracy movement.

                                 VITA
                        A lot has been made that I’m a 
                        woman. Even more that I am too 
                        beautiful. Too young. This is true, 
                        of course...

           The room chuckles.

                        But it shouldn’t distract from the

           sleeve. The room goes tense. For a moment it appears Vita 
           might go ballistic. If it’s reminiscent of the introduction 
           to Al Capone in ‘The Untouchables,’ that’s not by accident. 
           She smiles graciously, continuing...

                        Ukraine is at a pivotal time in our 
                        history. We have the cultural 
                        assets of Europe and the capitalist 
                        instinct of America. The only thing 
                        we lack is faith in our government. 
                        But the Soviets didn’t put 
                        corruption in our DNA. It was there 
                        from Eden, like everyone else. The 
                        difference between this country and 
                        our friends in the west is our 
                        corruption is self-defeating while 
                        theirs greases the hands of 
                        everyone. So if corruption is 
                        inevitable, then what?

           She pauses. Holds the room by its throat.

                        Why then, vote for the corruption 
                        that pleases most. That’s

                        skirting tax laws.

           The Businessman steps from his office, clueless. 

           The Gangster looks up and smiles. Rolls the magazine in his 
           hands like he’s about to smack a dog.

           Local scene only gangsters, politicians and brave western 
           tourists can afford. The Fixer there with Wolahan, plates 
           clean, dinner done.

                        The girls, of course.

           INT. HIRED CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           They ride down the broad boulevard, city outside twinkling 
           like a winning slot machine. Arrive at a hulking factory on 
           the riverfront. Intimidator SUV’s, tin can taxis and hard men 
           line-up outside.

           The Fixer and Wolahan at the door. Bouncers wand them down. 
           The Fixer peels off some local currency and in they go...

           INT. THE KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT

           They enter a thumping, writhing club of Stalinist 
           proportions. Ukrainian girls in scant, fuck-me attire prowl 
           the floor, dance. Businessmen, thugs, young ex-pats drink at 
           tables, size up the merchandise. 

           It’s a brothel and Cheever is already there. He waves them to 
           his booth, where he enjoys a carafe of vodka and the view.

           INT. BATHROOM - THE KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT

           Music video swank, Socialist seedy. The Fixer pisses at a 
           trough. Wolahan stands by. He awkwardly smiles at the super-
           sexy Russian bathroom attendant, KARINA, who ices him with a 
           antarctic stare.

           The Fixer zips up, drops cash in Karina’s tray and whispers 
           in her ear. No stranger to propositions, Karina is genuinely 
           surprised and intrigued. She looks to Wolahan, shrugs her 
           bare shoulder and with a cute little move pulls a snub nose 
           PISTOL from under her slight skit.

           The Fixer palms it off to Wolahan, exiting without a word. 
           Wolahan’s impressed, he cocks the gun like a pro...

           INT. DANCE FLOOR - THE KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT

           The Fixer snakes his way through bodies on the jumping, 
           booming dance floor.

           Wolahan follows with a newfound steely determination. He 
           points the pistol AT THE FIXER’S BACK! 

           Before he can shoot, a student-age prostitute, NEEKA, pulls 
           him into her orbit.

           The Fixer slips into the crowd, oblivious.

           INT. BOOTH - THE KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT

           Wolahan returns with Neeka in tow. Cheever sits with his own 
           girls, all Cheshire smiles.

                                 CHEEVER
                        How’d I do? Two hundred bucks for 
                        the night. You can do anything you 
                        want.

           Neeka cozies up beside Wolahan.

                        Welcome to Kiev!

           EXT. THE KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT

           Wolahan slides into the hired car, Neeka onto his lap.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Driver knows where to go.

           The Fixer slaps the roof and the car zooms off.

           Cheever piles into his Jeep with his two girls.

                                 CHEEVER
                        Ride with us, sport!

                                 THE FIXER
                        Forget it, Cheever. I gotta walk 
                        off the cheap perfume.

                                 CHEEVER
                        You kill me. Only man walks in and 
                        out of that place without the 
                        talent.

           Doors slam. Jeep rolls away.

           EXT. MIKHAYILOVSKY SQUARE - NIGHT

           Blue-white halo of dawn begins to break. The Fixer walks 
           across the deserted square, his shoes scuffing loudly on the 
           crusty snow. 

           More scuffing starts up from behind. A THUG follows him at a 
           lingering distance.

           As The Fixer reaches the far side of the square, a parked car 
           comes to life, high beams blinding him. Two more THUGS step 
           out of the tiny dented Zaporzhets.

                                 ZAZ THUG

           angle. As do the Zaporzhets thugs. The Fixer’s surrounded. 

                                 THE FIXER
                        <<We taking a trip to the ATM?>>

           Hands twitch, as if at holsters. Everyone faces off. 

                                 ZAZ THUG
                        <<We already been paid.>>

           Guns BLAZE from the high beams, the thugs all around. 

           The Fixer is mowed down. He lies lifeless, splayed on the 
           square. 

           The three thugs converge on the body, make certain it’s cold 
           and dead. Standing over him, they puzzle at the lack of 
           blood, at the SNOWBALL clutched in The Fixer’s hand. He 
           rifles it at a thug’s face... 

           SPLAT! The Fixer springs to life like bottled lightening and 
           rolls the thugs with moves no legal man should know. In a 
           violent flash, the three thugs lay wasted at his feet and The 
           Fixer trains two smoking gun barrels at the Zaporzhets.

           The DRIVER peels away in reverse down the thoroughfare.

           The Fixer coolly stalks after the car. He squints into the 
           high beams, waits a beat, then blasts both front headlights 
           out. 

           Now able to make out a SILHOUETTE OF A FIGURE behind the 
           wheel, he marks up and volleys off three rounds.

           The Zaporzhets lurches and sways, careening into a kiosk and 
           flipping over, its tires spinning at the moon. 

           He stalks up to the car, the thug inside still alive, 
           whimpering. The Fixer grabs him by the throat.

                                 THE FIXER
                        <<Who sent you?>>

                                 DYING THUG  
                        <<You did.>>

           The Fixer lets him go, walks away, clipping off a couple 
           shots into the Zaporzhets without even looking. The thug’s 
           whimpering silenced.
                                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           EXT. FIXER’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Tucked away off a gritty, back-alley courtyard. Perfect place 
           for under-the-radar living. The Fixer enters.

           INT. FIXER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Spare and post Soviet-chic. The Fixer unbuttons his shirt, 
           wearing underneath a kevlar vest--U.S. MARINE ISSUE stenciled 
           near the nape of the neck.

           He peels it off and inventories a pattern of bruises across 
           his bare chest and back from the slug impact.

           Then he squirrels away the vest into a cache beneath the 
           floorboards. More guns, loose cash, passports, other U.S. 
           MARINE ISSUE gear, including his M-4 assault rifle. He closes 
           the cache. 

           INT. FIXER’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           The Fixer kisses a WEDDING BAND threaded along with his DOG 
           TAGS on a strap around his neck. His name and social security 
           number filed off like the serial number of a stolen car.

           INT. FIXER’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           POUNDING on the door riles The Fixer awake. 

           He pads to the window, sees TWO UKRAINIAN POLICE CARS out in 
           the courtyard.

           POUNDING continues.

           The Fixer looks at the floorboards then the door. 

           Opens it to a DETECTIVE backed by several uniformed COPS. 
           They don’t look happy.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

           Scarred walls, florescent light. The Fixer gets the 
           treatment.

                                 DETECTIVE
                      (in Ukrainian, subtitles)
                        When did you arrive home last 
                        night?

           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                 THE FIXER
                        Don’t look at the time that late.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Why’s that?

                                 THE FIXER
                        Nothing good ever happens after 2 
                        a.m.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Especially to foreigners.

                                 THE FIXER
                        What exactly are you charging me 
                        with?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        An American disappeared last night 
                        from his hotel. You were seen at 
                        Kryvorizhstal together.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Trip Wolahan?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Yes, that’s the name. Only two 
                        people know of this man’s 
                        arrangements in Kiev. One is the 
                        diplomat. The other is you.

           He pushes over a PHOTO. ENLISTMENT SNAPSHOT stamped A.W.O.L. 
           THE FIXER, years younger, an army brat.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        This was in his room.

           The Fixer betrays nothing, but it’s like looking at an open 
           wound.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        He come to find you? Blackmail you?

                                 THE FIXER
                        Just to show him the sights.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        And did you?

                                 THE FIXER
                        What about the prostitute? He left 
                        with a girl.

                        Hotel staff says your Wolahan 
                        walked in alone. You know her name?

                                 THE FIXER
                        She’s a whore. What do you think?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        I think you find yourself in some 
                        trouble here.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           The Fixer walks out with Cheever, who’s hopping mad.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Thanks for getting me out.

                                 CHEEVER
                        Yeah, well, this is a rat’s nest 
                        for the embassy. Goddamn 
                        kidnappings. Kills these young 
                        countries. It’s a plague and it’s 
                        spreading.

                                 THE FIXER
                        It’s a good business for bad men.

                                 CHEEVER
                        Does The Fixer get a cut?

           The Fixer stops, insulted.

                                 THE FIXER
                        What about you?

                                 CHEEVER
                        Me? I’m a guy whose only chore here 
                        is to cheer the economy and keep 
                        the politicians out of Moscow’s 
                        back pocket. Losing Westerners 
                        waving money does not inspire 
                        confidence.

           Cheever walks on.

                                 THE FIXER
                        This hit the press yet?

                        No. And it won’t. Wolahan’s 
                        disappearing act stays off the 
                        record ‘til we know what’s what.

                                 THE FIXER
                        What about the man’s family?

                                 CHEEVER
                        What about the whore? He’s not 
                        thinking about ‘em why should we.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Cops say he was alone.

                                 CHEEVER
                        Ukrainian cops will say the sky’s 
                        made of cotton candy someone pays 
                        them enough.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Well, Wolahan isn’t found, the only 
                        sky I’ll be seeing is from inside a 
                        Ukrainian Gulag. 

                                 CHEEVER
                        It’s a democracy. They’re prisons 
                        now.

                                 THE FIXER
                        You got immunity. What about me?

                                 CHEEVER
                        Never heard of you and neither has 
                        the embassy. Sorry, sport, but 
                        you’ve just become radioactive.

           Cheever leaves him, stranded.

           INT. PREMIER PALACE - DAY

           The Fixer walks into the lobby. The Maitre De blocks him.

The Fixer gets the 
           message, goes.

           EXT. KHUTOROK RESTAURANT - DAY

           The Fixer tries his go-to eating establishment, but the 
           DOORMAN stops him at the door.

                                 THE FIXER
                        You can’t be serious. Everyone in 
                        Kiev does business here.

                                 DOORMAN
                        Then looks like you’re out of 
                        business.

                                 THE FIXER
                        But I come every day!

                                 DOORMAN
                        They know that.

           Points to...

           A BLACK INTIMIDATOR SUV 

           Parked on the street. A MAFIA-TYPE opens the door, nods The 
           Fixer over.

           INT. INTIMIDATOR SUV - PARKED - DAY

           The Fixer slides in next to the mafia-type. A grey-skinned 
           man in goggle-like mirrored sunglasses turns from the front 
           passenger seat. This is DARKO, best boy of the baddest 
           businessman in Kiev, and blind as a bat.

                                 DARKO
                        You know who I am?

           The Fixer knows.

                                 DARKO
                        Then you know who I work for.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Lazar Kindrachuk.

           Darko pecks a kiss to RAWA, an austere, steely-eyed Afghan 
           woman behind the wheel. She floors it, launching them into 
           traffic.

KINDRACHUK’S BUILDING - DAY

           An art nouveau landmark. Armed men move aside and the gate 
           yawns open to a fortressed courtyard. Darko’s SUV pulls in.

           INT. KINDRACHUK’S BUILDING - DAY

           There’s a vacuum of humanity, as if construction wrapped 
           seconds ago.

           Rawa has Darko’s arm like a guide dog. Together the pair are 
           both tender and menacing. They lead The Fixer to an elevator 
           bank, where yet another armed man grooves to his ipod.

           INT. ELEVATOR - ASCENDING - DAY

           Silence, like a dive to the deepest, darkest ocean floor. 
           Only up.

                                 THE FIXER
                        He’s the only one in the building, 
                        isn’t he?

           DING!

           INT. KINDRACHUK’S PENTHOUSE - DAY

           Doors slide open. TWO BODYGUARDS greet them, one holding an 
           UZI, the other a pair of WHITE SLIPPERS. Both bodyguards wear 
           slippers of their own.

                                 DARKO
                        Put them on.

           The Fixer dons the white slippers and steps from the 
           elevator. By the time he looks back for Darko and Rawa the 
           doors shut and he’s left alone with the slippered bodyguards. 

           They chaperone him through the labyrinthine penthouse, 
           decorated in Tzarist decadence, slippers whooshing against 
           the marble floor.

           The Fixer turns the corner to the living room, where a man in 
           smart suit pants and an undershirt tinkers over a half-
           assembled, 50’s era open-wheel racing Jaguar. If Dick Cheney 
           was a gangster, he’d be LAZAR KINDRACHUK.

                        Rivals any puzzle, don’t you think? 
                        I had it disassembled and shipped 
                        from a collection in Macau with the 
                        original blueprints.

           He proudly hoists up a crinkled set of blueprints.

                        When I’m finished it will make for 
                        a beautiful piece of sculpture.

           Kindrachuk likes him already.

                        Novel, yes. Like yourself. A man no 
                        one knows, who seems to know 
                        everyone. Take a seat.

           The Fixer clears the spare parts littering the sofa cushions.

                                 THE FIXER
                        If I crossed you in some way, that 
                        was not my intention.

           Kindrachuk rolls up a loose tire, perches face to face with 
           The Fixer.

                        If you did you’d be dead. Fact is I 
                        thought we could work together.

                                 THE FIXER
                        I work for myself.

                        This is going to be a challenge 
                        given your current reputation. Your 
                        American, Mr. Wolahan, went poof 
                        into thin air. Not good for 
                        anybody. Particularly you. I hear 
                        police have interest. I can help.

                                 THE FIXER

                        Don’t you mean the election?

           Kindrachuk smiles, dismissive.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        I controlled all the federal 
                        police. I still have influence. 
                        This unpleasantness can go away.

                        Working for you. 

           Kindrachuk opens his palms, playing innocent.

           The Fixer smiles to himself, sees the angle.

                                 THE FIXER
                        You wouldn’t happen know which thin 
                        air my American went poof into?

                        From what I’ve heard, Mr. Wolahan 
                        was in Kiev considering certain gas 
                        interests of mine. A facility the 
                        state also wants. I think they were 
                        behind his abduction.

                        I don’t know. I was thinking 
                        Istanbul these days. War on the 
                        border, fast track to the E.U. 
                        What’s Ukraine got but pretty girls 
                        and ugly gangsters.

           Kindrachuk chills him with look, then thaws.

                        That’s why I need a western face.

           The Fixer looks to his feet.

           The Fixer walks out, briefcase and slippers in hand. Darko 
           greets him coolly.

                                 DARKO

           Darko grabs him by the scruff of the shirt.

                                 DARKO
                        I know you. You’re the one I’ll 
                        have to clean up when you stray. 
                        You have no loyalties. Mr.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Afraid he might forget you now that 
                        I’m around?

STAIRWELL - FIXER’S BUILDING - DAY

           The Fixer climbs to his landing, stops cold at the door to 
           his apartment. Television blares from inside. He stashes 
           Kindrachuk’s briefcase behind a radiator and enters... 

           INT. FIXER’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           TWO SECRET POLICE AGENTS kick back watching a badly produced 
           Ukrainian music video, smoking like fiends.

           A THIRD and FOURTH sift through The Fixer’s cache of 
           passports, weapons and cash under the floorboard.

           INT. ICE RINK - DAY 

           The agents deliver The Fixer, who takes a slippery, uncertain-
           footed trek to the center of the ice. There, Vita Lysenko 
           glides gracefully across the empty rink.

                        Ukrainian girl dreamed of the ice. 
                        Men throwing flowers at your feet.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Now they all want to be you. Isn’t 
                        that right, Ms. Lysenko?

                        Not immunity from prosecution for

                        Some people use power and money to 
                        take more power, more money. Others 
                        return it to the people. That was 
                        the difference between Kennedy and

           A TICKET-TAKER snores behind the donation desk. Darko stands 
           in the gallery of vintage prints from Soviet-era propaganda 
           campaigns. Only one there.

           He vibes The Fixer’s entrance.

                                 DARKO
                        You’re late.

                                 THE FIXER
                        How you know it’s me?

                                 DARKO
                        Who cares about old lies?

           On cue TWO AUSTRALIAN TOURISTS walk in.

           general direction, almost hitting The Fixer and waking the 
           snoozing ticket-taker.

           The Australians book it out of there.

                                 DARKO
                        Let’s go.

           INT. CATALOGUE ROOM - DAY 

           Darko brings The Fixer in back, where prints and artifacts 
           not on display are catalogued. Darko gropes along the wall 
           until he gets to a huge propaganda billboard trumpeting the 
           virtues of pig-iron. He swings it open to reveal a second, 
           vault-like door with a combination dial.

           Darko presses his ear to the door and works the dial. The 
           vault yawns open. A ladder descends into a flickering 
           fluorescence.

                                 DARKO
                        You first.

           INT. SECRET VAULT - DAY 

           They descend into an ample, well lit basement. Two diminutive 
           men, 70-YEAR OLD TWINS, bustle about the various presses and 
           printers, screens and stamps, magnifying glasses and markers. 
           They run this underground counterfeiting and forgery 
           operation like clockwork.

                                 DARKO
                        The Becker Brothers. Very talented. 
                        Very precise. Very Swiss.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Looks like Kinko’s for crooks.

                                 DARKO
                        What’s Kinko’s?

                                 THE FIXER
                        It’s a place where lines are long, 
                        nothing works and nobody cares. 
                        Very Soviet. You’d appreciate it.

           Darko hands The Fixer a sheath of documents.

                        That’s what everyone keeps telling 
                        me.

           On top is a U.S. PASSPORT, inside The Fixer’s PHOTO, name: 
           TRIP WOLAHAN.

                                 THE FIXER
                        This retouched or a fake?

                                 DARKO
                        Retouched would tell you we know 
                        where to find him, when we don’t. 
                        Kindrachuk saw opportunity in the 
                        man’s disappearance.

                                 THE FIXER
                        I’ll bet.

           The Fixer flips through the sheath. Bills of Lading from 
           China and Ukraine, Articles of Incorporation filed with the 
           U.S. Secretary of State. WOLAHAN’S SIGNATURE everywhere.

                                 THE FIXER
                        And the rest of this?

                        one of Mr. Kindrachuk’s gas 
                        facilities by a foreign consortium 
                        lead by Trip Wolahan. Now led by 
                        you.

                                 THE FIXER
                        So what’s the job?

           EXT. GAS PLANT - EASTERN UKRAINE - DAY 

           Heavy industry hell. K-GAZ, Kindrachuk’s brand. Gas is piped 
           into tanker trucks.

           INT. PREMIER PALACE - DAY 

           The Fixer struts in like he owns the place. He’s back. 

                                 DARKO (V.O.)
                        The tax money will have disappeared 
                        with the American businessman.

           INT. CAFE - PREMIER PALACE - DAY 

           The Fixer regroups over cocktail. Maitre De approaches, now 
           all cozy.

                                 MAITRE DE
                      (Ukrainian, subtitles)
                        <<Good to have you back, my 
                        friend.>>

           The Fixer ignores him, sees something that amps his interest, 
           out the window:

           NEEKA, the prostitute, walks by in a NURSE UNIFORM.

           EXT. PREMIER PALACE - DAY 

           The Fixer runs outside. Spots her down the street. She 
           disappears into...

           INT. SUBWAY STATION (PLAZA ENTRANCE) - DAY

           Neeka down an endless escalator, The Fixer a few bodies 
           behind.

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY

           Neeka squeezes into one end of the car, The Fixer the other. 
           She grabs a handhold and buries her nose in a medical text 
           book. The Fixer drifts toward her. Looking up, she catches 
           his eye, perhaps making the connection, then goes back to 
           reading.

                        <<You look very familiar.>>

                                 NEEKA
                        <<I look like a girl you’re trying

                        <<I know. The Kryvorizhstal.>>

           Passengers in the car perk up, gawk at Neeka.

                        <<I don’t know what you’re talking

                        <<You went home with a friend of

           She SLAPS him and retreats to the next car.

           EXT. NEEKA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY 

           A dreary Soviet suburb on the outskirts of the city. 
           Ubiquitous Brezhnev-ugly high-rise apartment blocks brace 
           against the plain. 

           Neeka spills from the subway with a crowd of commuters. The 
           Fixer follows, keeping his distance.

           INT. NEEKA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY

           Neeka enters the junky lobby. Keys open a mailbox and grabs 
           her mail. The Fixer spies from the front door.

           Neeka catches the elevator. The Fixer ducks inside and checks 
           out the apartment number on the mailbox.

           INT. NEEKA’S FLOOR - DAY 

           The Fixer approaches Neeka’s apartment door. Knock-knock. 
           Footsteps inside. A beat.

                      (from behind the door)
                        <<Fuck off pervert or I call the 
                        police.>>

           The Fixer slides $200 under the door.

                                 THE FIXER
                        <<You can pay their gas for the 
                        trip or we can just talk.>>

           Door opens and Neeka thrusts a GUN in his face.

                                 NEEKA
                        <<Ukrainian girl’s best protection

                        <<So you do remember me.>>

           She pockets the $200 and closes the door behind her.

                                 NEEKA
                        <<Let’s talk outside. My mother’s

           EXT. CHILDREN’S PLAYGROUND - DAY 

           The Fixer and Neeka stroll between apartment blocks.

                                 THE FIXER
                        <<She know what you do? Your

                        <<She knows I’m in nursing school.

                        Better to pretend not to. This way 
                        men say things around you they 
                        think you don’t understand. Things 
                        that will let a girl know if she is

                        We never went back to hotel. He

                                 THE FIXER
                        Why not get his money’s worth?

                                 NEEKA
                        He said I reminded him of his 
                        daughter. That’s why he was here, 
                        in Kiev.

                                 THE FIXER
                        His daughter?

                                 NEEKA
                        Yes. He was a sad man. Not all who 
                        come to that place are hard. Many 
                        are sad. Your friend was the 
                        saddest.

                                 THE FIXER
                        No friend. Just another American. 
                        Anything else?

           Neeka considers holding back, then decides against it.

                                 NEEKA
                        Before I pulled him. In the club. 
                        He was going to shoot you.

           INT. BATHROOM - THE KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT

           The Fixer whispers to Karina, the bathroom attendant, 
           dropping cash in her tray. She looks up, not buying what he’s 
           buying.

           INT. BOOTH - THE KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT

           Karina slides into a booth with The Fixer.

                                 KARINA
                        You’re wasting your time.

                                 THE FIXER
                        You must see and hear all sorts of 
                        things in your position?

                                 KARINA
                        It’s exactly that I forget what I 
                        see and hear that I have position 
                        at all. Otherwise I’d be one of 
                        them. Desperate.

           She nods to the DANCE FLOOR where a writhing throng of women 
           put themselves on display. NEEKA among them. 

           The Fixer sees her, zeros in his gaze. Neeka catches it, 
           looks away embarrassedly. Karina gauges this timid exchange.

                                 KARINA
                        I’d take her home. Too bad Darko 
                        doesn’t like staff to play with the 
                        merchandise.

                                 THE FIXER
                        I’m not worried about Darko.

                                 KARINA
                        You should be. He’s worried about 
                        you.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Yeah, well, it’s the seeing eye 
                        Afghani that spooks me.

           He nods to Rawa, who greets a twosome of TURKISH GANGSTERS at 
           a cage-like ELEVATOR that rises to a private level high 
           above.
                                                               (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                 KARINA
                        I hear she’s not only his eyes and 
                        ears, but his wrath.

           THE TURKS negotiate something, gesture toward the dance 
           floor.

                                 THE FIXER
                        What’s she run up there? More 
                        girls?

                                 KARINA
                        These are different girls.

           Rawa goes to the dance floor.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Different how?

           KARINA doesn’t answer.

           RAWA grabs Neeka.

           THE FIXER, concern growing.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Different how?

                                 KARINA
                        VIP only. Very expensive. You 
                        really don’t know?

           RAWA drags Neeka from the dance floor. She looks back 
           pleadingly at The Fixer.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Maybe some things I don’t want to.

                                 KARINA
                        They’re kidnapped. Traded. 
                        Russians, Lithuanians, even a 
                        Filipino or two.

                                 THE FIXER
                        What about Ukrainians?

           Karina’s look says it all... yes.

                                 KARINA
                        We call them Kryv girls.

           RAWA delivers Neeka to the Turks.

           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)           THE FIXER leaps from the booth. Pushes his way through 
           patrons. CHEEVER intercepts him.

                                 CHEEVER
                        Hello, Sport. You’re not an easy 
                        man to find these days.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Not now, Cheever.

                                                 CUT TO:

           Rawa, Neeka and the Turks step into the elevator. Rawa uses a 
           KEY strung around her neck to activate the cab. Doors 
           close...

           THE FIXER arrives just in time, holds the door.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Wait!

           Rawa shoots daggers with a look. Neeka sobs. The Turks 
           confused.

                                 THE FIXER
                        She’s with me.

                                 TURK 1
                        Who is this fuck-o?

                                 THE FIXER
                        I paid for the night.

           Darko calls from behind, flanked by THUGS.

                                 DARKO
                        They’re paying for far more than 
                        that.

           The Fixer takes Neeka’s hand, steers her from the elevator.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Then they better find themselves a 
                        new girl.

           Turk 1 grabs Neeka.

                                 TURK 1
                        We’re done shopping.

           The Fixer seizes his nuts like a vice.

                        Right you are.

           Turk 1 buckles to the floor. Turk 2 makes a move. The Fixer 
           stops him with a wag of the finger. A badass not to be 
           trifled with. Turk 1 moans on the floor. Turk 2 backs down. 

           The Fixer pulls Neeka away.

           Darko blocks their path...

                                 DARKO
                        You fuck up, she gets hurt.

           ...then lets them go.

           INT. TAXI - MOVING - NIGHT

           They ride together, Neeka still trembling, The Fixer afraid 
           to comfort too closely a woman he’s just bought.

                                 NEEKA
                        Thank you.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Don’t think about it.

                                 NEEKA
                        I can’t help it. Girls are kept 
                        drugged up there. I hear if they 
                        make trouble or try escape, there’s 
                        the vampire.

           The Fixer’s antennae perk, perk, perk.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Did you say vampire?

                                 NEEKA
                        Bad business to damage the goods, 
                        especially if your business is 
                        flesh. Kryv girls aren’t beaten, 
                        they’re bled. Those who get 
                        punished, it’s impossible to tell.

                                 THE FIXER
                        And you believe these stories?

SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

           Neeka steps from the taxi. Wants to say something to The 
           Fixer, doesn’t know how.

                                 NEEKA
                        You know, you paid for--

                                 THE FIXER
                        I didn’t.

           She smiles shyly.

                                 NEEKA
                        Are you hungry? I’ll treat.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Listen Neeka, I ever see you back 
                        there, I’ll hurt you myself.

           He slams the door in her face. Taxi sputters away, Neeka left 
           stinging.

           INT. TAXI - MOVING - NIGHT

           The Fixer catches his reflection, hating himself. He dials 
           his cell.

                                 THE FIXER
                      (into phone)
                        I think I found your man.

           EXT. DNIEPHER RIVERFRONT - NIGHT 

           Ice-clogged and industrial. The Fixer and Vita rendezvous in 
           front of a rusty, listing boat. The Kryvorizhstal lit up like 
           a lavish Hollywood premier in the distance.

                                 VITA
                        We can’t just raid the  
                        Kryvorizhstal. It’s protected. 
                        Powerful men like to play there. 
                        Men I work with. We’ll have to get 
                        him out quietly.

           She drops a direct look, an appeal for help.

           The Fixer, back in favor, dines after hours. Only the chefs 
           and wait staff eat at a table nearby. 

           MAFIA-TYPES enter and surround his table. The Fixer goes 
           about his meal, the ultimate cool customer. The restaurant 
           people scram. Darko enters last.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

           A convoy of Intimidator SUV’s cut through the Ukrainian 
           steppes, blood-orange sun rising fast.

           The Fixer looks around the stony, murderous expressions of

                        Please, my woman dresses me in the 
                        morning like a child. I could look 
                        like a goat herder and wouldn’t 
                        know the difference.

           Darko leans back for a better show of his attire.

                                 DARKO (CONT’D)
                        Now tell me? I don’t want to be 
                        fucked with. Do I look the part?

                                 THE FIXER
                        Yeah, your woman knows what she’s 
                        doing.

           This pleases Darko immensely. He gives his shirt a little 
           tug.

                                 DARKO
                        You know I was KGB in Afghanistan. 
                        Only man to survive our helicopter 
                        shot down by Mujahideen. Rawa found 
                        me blinded. Crawling like a dog 
                        through the mountains. She nursed 
                        me back to health. If her village 
                        knew, they’d have killed us both. 
                        She is only thing good I know in 
                        the world. Do you have such a 
                        person?

                                 THE FIXER
                        No.

           Darko smiles slyly.

                                 DARKO
                        I knew you were a liar.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 

           The convoy continues on. Brash ODESSA looms in the horizon, 
           the glassy Black Sea beyond.

           INT. MEN’S CLOTHING STORE - ODESSA - DAY 

           The Fixer fitted for a NEW SUIT. Darko a blind witness.

                        A wedding. And a funeral.

           The Fixer shows off his new attire. 

                                 THE FIXER
                        How do I look?

           Darko doesn’t find it funny.

           EXT. ODESSA TRAIN STATION - DAY 

           A white palace. DARKO’S CONVOY parked out front, blending 
           into the bustle of the station.

           INT. DARKO’S SUV - DAY

           Darko’s men ready their weapons, prep their assault. The 
           Fixer can see this is bad news. Looks to...

           EXT. PANTELYEMONOVSKY CHURCH (ACROSS FROM STATION) - DAY 

           Four silver onion domes. Very Eastern Orthodox. WEDDING 
           GUESTS in dapper, reproachless dress line-up outside. A wall 
           of SECURITY GUARDS vet the arrivals.

                                 THE FIXER (V.O.)
                        We’re not invited, are we?

                                 DARKO
                        You are.

           Darko hands over a WEDDING INVITATION.

                                 THE FIXER
                        And who am I?

                                 DARKO
                        New York lawyer we picked up 
                        connecting in Frankfurt. On his way

                        made him very, very rich. A client 
                        he’s never met.

                                 THE FIXER
                        You mean a client I’ve never met.

                        he owns two TV stations.

                                 DARKO

                        We’re here to kill everybody. The 
                        bride’s his only daughter. First 
                        time in months he’s exposed.

                                 THE FIXER
                        WHAT DO YOU MEAN EVERYBODY?

                                 DARKO
                        Kindrachuk wants to send message. 
                        There are no longer petty gangsters 
                        or strong-arm businessmen in 
                        Ukraine. Only him. Only us.

           The Fixer steels himself, a knot of resolve in his jaw.

                                 THE FIXER
                        What’s Zuperov look like?

           EXT. PANTELYEMONOVSKY CHURCH - DAY 

           The Fixer approaches the security guards at the entrance, 
           flashes his invite. They cross his name off the list. Pat him 
           down, take his CELL PHONE.

           A CELL PHONE CHECK GIRL gives him a claim ticket. The Fixer 
           turns a last anxious glance back at the TRAIN STATION.

           The Fixer makes his entrance. Flowers everywhere. Children 
           run around. Family and friends take their seats. It’s a 
           convivial, joyful atmosphere. He looks for...

           BODYGUARDS AND GANGSTERS

           Everywhere. The Fixer walks down the aisle and counts them, 
           cases the scene. Then he spots:

           ZUPEROV, a proud, coarse little man by the stairs. He 
           dispenses orders to a PRIEST, then disappears to the upper 
           chambers of the church.

           The Fixer pivots and walks swiftly for the exit. A BOY (5), 
           horsing around, nearly trips him. The boy ducks behind his 
           SISTER (8) in a pew.

                                 SISTER
                        <<Sorry.>> 

           The boy smiles, sheepish. 

           The Fixer considers the boy, his sister, then looks to the 
           exit. Darko lurks somewhere outside, massacre on his mind. 

           The Fixer takes a knee, whispers to the boy.

                                 THE FIXER
                        <<Want to play a game?>>

           The boy nods, not sure what he’s nodding about.

                                 THE FIXER
                        <<I want you to hide. Hide until I 
                        tell you to come out, okay? Take 
                        your sister.>>

           The boy grabs his sister and they duck between the pews, 
           playfully keeping down.

           The Fixer’s expression hardens. He goes to the stairs. A 
           BODYGUARD stops him.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Toilet?

                                 BODYGUARD ON STAIRS
                        <<Family only.>>

           The Fixer bounces up and down. Gotta go bad.
                                                 (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)

                        Please. I haven’t pissed since New 
                        York. You speak American? 

           The bodyguard, sufficiently irritated, pats down The Fixer 
           and waves him by. We follow the Fixer as he climbs the 
           stairs.

           (NOTE: The rest of the sequence is one continuous shot, the 
           camera stalking with The Fixer like he were a character in a 
           shoot ‘em up video game.)

           INT. UPPER CHAMBERS - CHURCH - DAY 

           Wedding party people flutter this way and that. The Fixer 
           looks out for Zuperov. TWO GANGSTER-TYPES notice him out of 
           place, go for their guns.

                                 GANGSTER-TYPE
                        <<Hey you. What are you doing up 
                        here?>>

           Viper-quick The Fixer takes them. Smashes one guy’s nose into 
           his brain, turns the gun on the other. BLAM!

           The wedding party people scream, duck for cover.

           The Fixer grabs both guns and double-fisting it, kicks down 
           doors one by one until he gets to...

           INT. BRIDE’S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

           Zuperov and his daughter, the BRIDE, in her wedding white. A 
           moment interrupted.

           The Fixer stalks in, guns leveled. 

                                 THE FIXER
                        <<Tell her to step back.>>

           The bride screams. She clings to her father. Zuperov knows 
           what’s coming. He wrenches her away.

                                 ZUPEROV
                        <<Kindrachuk can burn in hell.>>

           The Fixer holds for a moment, struggles with the horror he’s 
           about to inflict on this beautiful young girl.

                                 THE FIXER
                        <<You can warm it up for him.>>

           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Zuperov’s BLOOD splatters on his daughter’s 
           wedding white. The bride curdles a cry.

           INT. UPPER CHAMBERS - CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           The Fixer steps out. He’s met by the bodyguard who let him 
           pass, leading a charge of Zuperov’s men. Guns blaze! 

           The Fixer wastes them left and right, a ballet of bullets. 
           More of Zuperov’s men materialize. The Fixer ducks into...

           INT. CHOIR BENCH - CONTINUOUS

           Seating for the choir open to the congregation below. Pushing 
           through the singers, The Fixer leaps... 

           INT. PANTELYEMONOVSKY CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           ...and CRASHES onto an extravagant flower arrangement.

           The Fixer staggers to his feet and flees down the aisle, 
           picking off anyone with a gun. 

           He passes the boy and his sister, still hiding in the pew, 
           and shushes them to stay down and be quiet.

           EXT. PANTELYEMONOVSKY CHURCH - DAY 

           The Fixer blows away the last security guards on the steps. 

           Darko’s convoy wheels up. Men step out, ready to raid.

                                 THE FIXER
                        It’s done.

                                 DARKO
                        What do you mean it’s done?

                                 THE FIXER
                        Zuparov’s dead. I killed him. 

           The church doors burst open. What’s left of Zuperov’s men, 
           hot after The Fixer. Darko and company raze them down.

                                 DARKO
                        What about everyone else?

                        Bride’s wearing him on her wedding 
                        dress. That clear enough message?

           POLICE SIRENS whine in the distance. Darko brightens.

                                 DARKO
                        Maybe I was wrong about you.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Let’s just get back the hell to 
                        Kiev.

           They pile into the SUV’s and take off.

           INT. KIEV OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT 

           The orchestra warms up. Kindrachuk, with entourage, makes his 
           way up the stairs to the balcony box. He pulls aside the 
           curtains and sees...

           INT. BOX - OPERA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Vita, always a stunner. She greets him brightly, two flutes 
           of champaign in hand.

                                 VITA
                        Hello Lazar. Don’t you just love 
                        the opera? It’s so... full of shit.

           Kindrachuk, not happy about the ambush.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        What are you doing here, Vita?

                                 VITA
                        I might ask you. This is the state 
                        box is it not? Last time I checked, 
                        you were no longer part of this 
                        government.

           He nods to his entourage.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        Please, give us a moment.

           The curtains close, Vita and Kindrachuk left alone. They 
           circle each other like caged spiders.

                                 KINDRACHUK

                        I thought we’d celebrate.

           She offers the flute.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        You and I have nothing to 
                        celebrate.

                                 VITA
                        No? Our old friend Zuperov was 
                        butchered, didn’t you hear?

                                 KINDRACHUK
                      (unmoved)
                        I did.

                                 VITA
                        Lucky for us, don’t you think? Old 
                        friends, old rivals. Three’s a 
                        crowd in politics I say.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        Two’s a crowd in this box.

                                 VITA
                        You’ll find one a crowd in your 
                        prison cell, I promise.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        I should have kept you in yours.

                                 VITA
                        Like you keep your son? How is he 
                        these days.

           Kindrachuk narrows his eyes.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        Glad he’s away from you.

                                 VITA
                        I wonder how a junkie knows if he’s 
                        glad or not?

           Kindrachuk opens the curtains.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        I think we’re done here.

           Vita winks, hands him the flute on her way out.

                        My dear, we’re just getting 
                        started.

           INT. BATHROOM - THE KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT

           Karina opens a BRITISH PASSPORT to her own photo. The Fixer 
           hands her a PLANE TICKET and a small purse of uncut DIAMONDS.

                                 THE FIXER
                        You can get enough from those to 
                        start a new life away from here. 
                        Five new lives.

                                 KARINA
                        What are you asking me to do with 
                        this one?

           EXT. THE KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT 

           Guards wand down one of Vita’s secret police agents, AGENT 1 
           from The Fixer’s apartment, undercover as a mafia-type.

                                 THE FIXER (V.O.)
                        Four men will see you.

           INT. BOOTH - THE KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT 

           AGENT 1 passes by, steals a glance with AGENT 2 (also 
           undercover), who shoots a vodka.

                                 THE FIXER (V.O.)
                        Each on his own.

           INT. BATHROOM - THE KRYVORIZHSTAL

           A man with ORANGE SOCKS zips up. AGENT 3.

                                 THE FIXER (V.O.)
                        Look for the orange socks.

           He tips Karina, who eyes a stall: ‘OUT OF ORDER’

                        You’ll supply each a weapon.

           INT. THE KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT

           Karina catwalks past The Fixer sidled at the bar, a parting 
           glance goodbye...

                                 THE FIXER (V.O.)
                        Then you walk out of here, go 
                        directly to the airport and never 
                        look back.

           The Fixer looks to undercover AGENTS 1-4, now together, 
           negotiating with Rawa at the elevator.

           Darko steps beside The Fixer.

                                 DARKO
                        I don’t like those men with Rawa. 
                        Go with her.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Who, me?

                                 DARKO
                        You know what’s upstairs. 

                                 THE FIXER
                        Doesn’t mean I wanna see it.

                                 DARKO
                        You’ve proven yourself more than 
                        just a convenient face.

           He gives The Fixer a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Make sure they behave. Otherwise, 
                        Odessa.

                                                 CUT TO:

           AGENTS 1-4 herd into the ELEVATOR. Rawa keys the activation. 
           The cab doors close. The Fixer holds them last second. 

                                 THE FIXER
                        Room for one more? Darko’s orders.

           He steps into an elevator he shouldn’t be in.

ELEVATOR - ASCENDING

           The Fixer’s shotgun gets looks from the agents. Rawa’s sharp 
           eyes cut through the conspiring air.

           INT. SEX SLAVE CELLBLOCK - NIGHT 

           They land at a private level in the rafters of the converted 
           steel factory.

           Rawa, The Fixer and Agents 1-4 step out into a reception 
           area, where a wall of PLASMA SCREENS capture the closed-
           circuit goings-on in all the cells. 

           GIRLS who are not engaged primp and pose before the camera. 

           Rawa hands the agents a SEX MENU, a description of stats and 
           specialties for the girls on display.

           The Fixer notices a CAGE DOOR that bars entry to a CORRIDOR 
           and the girls beyond. Looks to the key around Rawa’s neck.

           The agents make their picks, point to the displays. 

           Rawa glimpses Agent 1’s GUN tucked away in his belt line as 
           his jacket lifts.

           The Fixer sees that Rawa knows something’s up. 

           Rawa sees that he sees. She’s uncertain who’s side he’s on.

           TIME SEEMS TO STOP...

           ...as they both devise their next move...

           The Fixer cocks his shotgun at her.

           Rawa kicks it away. It fires...

           BLOWS the chest out of Agent 4.

           The shotgun skitters across the floor. Then...

           WRATH

           RAWA, with frightening velocity, sticks a dagger into Agent 
           1’s stomach, then grabs the gun she saw in his waistband. 

           Agent 2 and 3 draw theirs.

           blasts away Agent 2 and 3 as they futilely fire back into 
           their comrade.

           In a bloody blink, The Fixer is all that’s left. He scrapes 
           after the shotgun.

           Rawa flies at him like a giant bat, all flowing black robes, 
           screaming for the fatal blow. 

           The Fixer gets behind the shotgun in time. BLOOEY! 

           Rawa blasted out of the air like a spinning skeet. She lands 
           with a lifeless thud.

           The Fixer yanks off the KEY strung around Rawa’s neck.

           CELLBLOCK CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           The Fixer looks furiously for the vampire junkie, only 
           finding girl’s cells. 

                                 THE FIXER
                        Where’s the vampire?

           A SEX SLAVE, maybe 17 or 18, pipes up.

                                 SEX SLAVE
                        I know.

           The Sex Slave leads him past more cells, a shower, even a 
           gym. At last they come to a DOOR. The girl’s look tells all. 
           The Fixer busts it down, charges inside...

           INT. ROMAN’S CELL - NIGHT

           Posh prison living. He finds a cadaverous, 30-something male 
           splayed unconscious and tangled in prostitutes. ROMAN 
           Kindrachuk, the vampire junkie, doped out of his skull.

           INT. CELLBLOCK CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           The Fixer drags Roman, NOW DRESSED IN THE CLOTHES OF AGENT 1, 
           orange socks included, back toward the elevator. 

           The sex slaves follow him like liberated villagers.

SEX SLAVE CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

           The Fixer steps over Rawa’s corpse, over the stripped Agent 

           The girls see what’s happening. See him step into the 
           elevator. They beg to be taken too. Beg for freedom. 

                                 THE FIXER
                        I can’t. I can’t.

                                 SEX SLAVE
                        Please. You can’t leave us.

           His helplessness kills him. 

                                 THE FIXER
                        I’m so sorry.

           He activates the elevator with Rawa’s key and the doors slide 
           shut.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DESCENDING

           Back to the high decibel music below. The Fixer takes a deep 
           breath. Roman Kindrachuk hangs off him like a rag doll. They 
           reach the bottom and...

           INT. THE KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT

           Doors open. There’s Darko. 

                                 DARKO
                        Any trouble?

           The Fixer and Roman, dressed like the agent, are clearly 
           reflected off Darko’s mirrored goggles.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Like you thought. This guy was 
                        carrying.

           Hands Darko the agent’s gun.

                                 DARKO

                        Taking care of the others. I was 
                        gonna throw this asshole in the 
                        river.

           Darko smiles blindly.

                                 DARKO
                        Do it then.

           The Fixer carries Roman away. 

           Darko steps in the elevator cab, produces a KEY of his own.

           The Fixer double times it through the crowded club, getting 
           sidelong looks as he goes, never looking back.

                                                 CUT TO:

           Darko going up. Something dawns on him.

           EXT. KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT

           The Fixer walks the vampire junkie right out the front door 
           of The Kryvorizhstal. Longest walk of his life.

           INT. SEX SLAVE CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

           Elevator doors open, girls scream and scatter. Darko steps 
           out. He already knows.

                                 DARKO
                        Rawa?

           He trips over something. Feels at a corpse. Agent 1, 
           stripped.

                                 DARKO
                        Where is she, you whores!

           The sex slaves look on, quiet as mice.

           Darko fumbles over dead bodies, frightened as a child. He 
           finally feels her silken robes.

           EXT. ABANDONED FAIRGROUND - DAY 

           A Ferris wheel tilts in decay. The Fixer meets Vita. He’s 
           alone. She’s backed by agents in her Benzo.

                                 VITA

                        I got him, alright. After your guys 
                        blew cover. Now I’m in the fuck

                        You want your vampire junkie, I 
                        want in on what you know about the

                        I have a feeling Wolahan’s a blind 
                        spot in my rearview mirror. I need 
                        to know what’s coming.

MORGUE - DAY 

           A CORONER pulls out a slab from a corpse locker. On it a 
           small square object covered by a white sheet. 

           The Fixer looks to Vita. She pulls the sheet. Inside a metal 
           tray is Wolahan’s SEVERED HEAD.

                                 THE FIXER

                        Nothing from who or where. No 
                        demands. No claim of 
                        responsibility. Just...

           INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

           A CLERK furnishes a PHOTOGRAPH of some Ukrainian family from 
           the 80’s.

                        Any idea what this means?

                        One.

           The clerk wands a GEIGER COUNTER over the evidence photo. 
           Pops and crackles. It’s RADIOACTIVE.

           EXT. DNIEPHER RIVERFRONT - DAY 

           Been here before. The site of the rusty, listing boat. The 
           Fixer pops a HATCH. Inside Roman Kindrachuk, who shakes and 
           vomits. Vita looks pained for the addict.

           Vita hands The Fixer the EVIDENCE PHOTO.

           She winks.

           INT. BEST EVER TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY

           Cheery fliers trumpet group tours to CHERNOBYL. ONDREJ, a 
           tour guide, sells it like a day trip to Lake Como.

                                 ONDREJ
                        Chernobyl is highlight experience. 
                        We have very nice radioactive 
                        protective suits for you. Of course 
                        these are just for ambiance. And 
                        there is lunch. Two, three days 
                        tops for official paperwork.

           The Fixer slaps down cash next to Ondrej’s SNOWGLOBE OF A 
           NUCLEAR PLANT.

                                 THE FIXER
                        That paperwork enough to go now?

           ONDREJ’S CRAP KAWASAKI zips by, Ondrej and The Fixer riding 
           tandem. They skid to a stop under a SERIOUS LOOKING SIGN 
           saying something in Russian.

                                 ONDREJ
                        “Exclusion zone” very close.

                        No checkpoint on private tour.

           Ondrej slaps down his visor, revs the bike and pilots them 
           onto a field, bee-lining it to the tree line.

           EXT. WOODS - “EXCLUSION ZONE” - DAY 

           Ondrej and The Fixer ride in jags and spurts through the 
           brittle, snow-packed woods. Trees skulk overhead like inky 
           black spiders. They pass a WOLF.

           EXT. BACK ROAD - DAY 

           They emerge across from an abandoned school, decayed like a 
           sunken ship. Ondrej kills the motor. There’s an eerie quiet, 
           the dead echo of evacuation and swings creaking in the 
           poisoned, listless air.

                        Nothing now but you, me and 
                        contained nuclear holocaust. We are 
                        safe.

                                 THE FIXER
                        How far is the squatter?

                                 ONDREJ
                        Not so much. But I am telling you, 
                        his marbles are very lost from his 
                        head.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Just take me there.

           EXT. EVACUATED VILLAGE - DAY 

           Breached by the unchecked creep of mother nature. The 
           Kawasaki zips past the derelict dachas, coming to... 

           EXT. SQUATTER’S DACHA - DAY 

           A small cabin reclaimed from ruin. Ondrej kills the bike. The 
           Fixer dismounts. BEAR TRAPS litter the path from the gate to 
           the front door.

                                 ONDREJ
                        He’s not so hot for visitors.

                        You don’t say.

                                 ONDREJ
                        It’s okay. We’ve made friendly 
                        pact.

           Ondrej tip toes through the traps. The Fixer gingerly 
           follows.

           CLAP! of a rifle shot SPRINGS A TRAP inches from The Fixer’s 
           ankle.

                                 THE FIXER
                        What kind of pact?

           SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! Three more traps spring from rifle shots at 
           The Fixer’s feet.

           LEONID, a fire-breathing oldster, pokes his head from a 
           window, sights set behind a Kalashnikov.

                                 LEONID
                      (Ukrainian, subtitles)
                        <<Get lost!>>

           Ondrej waves his arms wildly.

                                 ONDREJ
                        <<Wait! Leonoid! It’s me! Ondrej 
                        from Best Ever Tours!>>

           Leonid squints through the sight, smiles heartily.

                                 LEONID
                        <<Best Ever Ondrej! Why not say so! 
                        Did you bring my material?>> 

           INT. SQUATTER’S DACHA - DAY 

           Ondrej hands Leonid a little trove of magazines, People, US 
           Weekly and In Touch.

                                 ONDREJ
                        I also brought an American.

           The Fixer surveys Leonid’s home with wonder. PHOTOGRAPHS cram 
           every square inch of wall space. Shoeboxes brimming with more 
           photos are stacked on the floor. A cataloguing of sorts seems 
           to have begun.

                        He has great curiosity to meet 
                        mayor of dead zone.

           Leonid eyeballs The Fixer with deep-seated suspicion.

                                 LEONID
                        Okay. But no pictures!

           INT. KITCHEN - SQUATTER’S DACHA - DAY 

           Again, snapshots everywhere. Leonid prepares tea, the 
           Kalashnikov slung around his shoulder.

                                 LEONID
                        The people in Kiev, they are 
                        whiners. Every ailment they blame 
                        Chernobyl. A rash. Chernobyl. Car 
                        breaks down. Chernobyl. My wife 
                        cheating on me. Chernobyl. 
                        Chernobyl. Chernobyl.

           He serves up teacups to The Fixer and Alexsei, who regard the 
           offering like it were, well, radioactive.

                                 LEONID
                        I was here for meltdown and 
                        returned when the Soviets went 
                        kaput. Sixteen years and I’m 
                        healthy as a bear. The radiation 
                        has got used to me. 

           Leonid gulps his tea.

                                 THE FIXER
                        That why they call you the mayor?

                                 LEONID
                        I am mayor because I have people.

           He proudly waves over all the photos, the people in them.

                                 LEONID
                        I collect them from abandoned 
                        homes.

                                 ONDREJ
                        Probably he’s been into every

                        I don’t steal, mind you. Just 
                        custodian until they return.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Of course.

           The Fixer passes Leonid the EVIDENCE PHOTO from Wolahan’s 
           head. Some Ukrainian family from the 80’s.

                                 THE FIXER
                        What can you tell me about this?

           Leonid looks up gravely.

                                 LEONID
                        They will not be returning.

           INT. SQUATTER’S DACHA - DAY

           Leonid holds The Fixer’s photo up against a collage on the 
           wall. The Fixer and Ondrej lean in. The family in the 
           evidence photo IS THE SAME as that smiling back from several 
           of the squatter’s framed snapshots.

                                 THE FIXER
                        You know these people?

                                 LEONID
                        No. I saved the pictures from their 
                        apartment in Prypyat. An evil 
                        place. I will never go back.

                                 ONDREJ
                        Why not, Leonid?

                                 LEONID
                        Men are taken to vanish there. It 
                        is nothing but an anonymous grave, 
                        that block.

                                 THE FIXER
                        What men?

                                 LEONID
                        The innocent. The guilty. All men.

                        Whoever can afford the silence of 
                        checkpoint police. This is not 
                        attraction you want to see.

           The Fixer turns to Ondrej.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Yes, it is.

           EXT. PRYPYAT - DAY 

           The ghost city’s desperate final hours are frozen in time, 
           contamination cast overhead like illuminated milk. Patches of 
           snow like lesions.

           Ondrej’s crap Kawasaki sluices down an EMPTY BOULEVARD. 

           They take a short cut through the lobby of a POLICE STATION.

           They weave around a cluster of apartment blocks. 

           They finally arrive at the tallest building in town, THE 
           PROMETHEUS. Ondrej kills the bike. He looks up at the eerie, 
           corpse-like structure.

                                 ONDREJ
                        Maybe I stay down here. With the 
                        bike.

           The Fixer understands, heads inside alone...

           INT. LOBBY - THE PROMETHEUS - DAY

           The Fixer looks at the back of the evidence photo. Newly 
           penciled in: APT. 1107

           He peers up the open elevator shaft, down at the water filled 
           elevator pit, iced over. Power out, he heads for the stairs.

           INT. STAIRWELL - THE PROMETHEUS - DAY 

           The Fixer climbs and climbs. Higher he gets, worse the 
           stench. He muffles his nose.

           The Fixer ventures into a hallway strewn with personal 
           effects: a left shoe, head of a doll, lidless tea kettle, 
           calender circa 1986.

           He steps over a DEAD BODY with a sack over its head. (The 
           Journalist)

           Looking for Apt. 1107, he half-glimpses through the cracked 
           doors of rooms hits, executions, murders. Many shot. Some 
           stabbed. Still others strung up, tortured with power tools. 
           All decomposing, food for birds that flutter in freely 
           through the broken windows. Ukraine’s answer to the bottom of 
           the Hudson River.

           The Fixer steels his gaze forward, trying to ignore the hell 
           he walks in. He reaches Apt. 1107. Pushes open the door... 

           INT. APT. 1107 - THE PROMETHEUS - DAY 

           The Fixer takes a probing step inside. There, a HEADLESS BODY 
           propped in front of a cracked TV set. 

           He fishes the corpse’s pockets. Pulls WOLAHAN’S PASSPORT.

           He can’t help notice a SNAPSHOT taped to the TV set. He grabs 
           it. He recognizes: 

           PVT. BEST. 

           The driver who was killed. Beaming proudly as she gathers a 
           gaggle of Afghan children in front of her humvee.

           Written on the back:

           “DAD, BE HOME SOON. MUCH LUV. - S”

           The Fixer looks up, the mystery coming into focus.

           CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Gunfire breaks the spell. He looks out 
           the window.

           THE FIXER’S POV:

           Car below, a BEEMER. Ondrej shot dead on the pavement. THREE 
           MEN charge into the building.

           The Fixer runs to the stairwell.

           INT. STAIRWELL - THE PROMETHEUS - DAY 

           The Fixer on the landing, hears a barrage of boot heels take 
           the stairs. It’s as if they know exactly where to find him.

           The boot heels get louder. The men get closer. No where to go 
           but up. The Fixer runs for the ROOF...

           EXT. ROOF - THE PROMETHEUS - DAY 

           The Fixer emerges high above the ghost city, the SARCOPHAGUS 
           of the CHERNOBYL PLANT hulking in the distance.  

           He circles the edge for a way out, a way down. Comes across a 
           WINDOW WASHER SCAFFOLD. He casts it over the edge. The rope 
           snaps into dust. The scaffold plummets and splinters on 
           pavement fourteen stories below.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Nice.

           He returns to the roof door. LOCKED! From the inside. He can 
           hear the boot heels behind it. He’s trapped.

           Desperation falls. He looks for anything, sees an EXHAUST FAN 
           DOME.

                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. ROOF - THE PROMETHEUS - SECONDS LATER 

           The door bursts open and out noses an old-school SMITH & 
           WESSON revolver, handled by none other than THE AMERICAN WHO 
           KILLED PVT. BEST. 

           This is LT. BIXBY, and he’s flanked by two other American 
           soldiers of fortune: big nigga LEONE and CRAZY MARY, nineteen 
           and pretty as a girl.

           Leone props opens the door and they fan out with military 
           strike precision. The Fixer nowhere to be found. 

           Crazy Mary notices the EXHAUST FAN DOME, cockeyed and loose. 
           He kicks it away. An man-sized opening leads to the ELEVATOR 
           MOTOR ROOM below.
                                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)

MOTOR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bullets spray the room. Bixby, Crazy Mary and Leone drop in, 
           guns drawn. Again no Fixer. Only dated, turbine-looking 
           elevator motors.

           A cable strung from one of the motors through a grate in the 
           concrete slab jiggles with the weight of something alive. 

           Bixby grins ear to ear. Peers down the elevator shaft and 
           shouts:

                                 LT. BIXBY
                        Hello Captain, que pasa?

           Pops off several shots.

           INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS 

           The Fixer dangles precariously from a cable over the pitch 
           black abyss. Bixby framed overhead by a square of light. 

                                 LT. BIXBY
                      (shouting down)
                        You fucking dead yet or what?

           INT. MOTOR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bixby nods to Crazy Mary who strafes the shaft with his M-4.

           INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

           Bullets whiz and snap around The Fixer, who lets go of the 
           cable. He drops with a BIG CLANG atop the elevator cab wedged 
           a floor below.

                                 LT. BIXBY
                      (shouting down)
                        I mean, we tried to make it easy in 
                        Afghanistan.

           Hands it to Bixby, who shines it down the shaft.

           INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

           The light spots on The Fixer, who grimaces. Blood squirts 
           from his side. He’s hit.

                        Chernobyl for the love of Christ!

           The Fixer sees the rusted out BRAKE clenching the cable. 

           Bixby sets his sights for the kill with his Smith & Wesson.

           The Fixer KICKS OFF THE BRAKE and the elevator cab PLUMMETS 
           down the shaft.

           INT. LOBBY - THE PROMETHEUS - CONTINUOUS

           The cab SPLASHES heap-like into the water filled elevator 
           pit, which somewhat braces the fall. The Fixer rolls out into 
           the lobby. Shaken hard, shot, but in one piece.

           Bixby turns to his men. Shit.

           EXT. THE PROMETHEUS - CONTINUOUS

           The Fixer hobbles out. Sees Ondrej dead. Turns to the 
           Kawasaki. Grabs the spare gas can.

           Bixby and company dash down the stairs.

           EXT. THE PROMETHEUS - CONTINUOUS

           The Fixer douses Bixby’s Beemer with gas. He mounts the 
           Kawasaki, sparks a lighter and tosses it on the hood of the 
           car.

           They run outside. Flames swallow the Beemer. The Fixer 
           escaped.

           INT. BEDROOM - NEEKA’S APARTMENT - MORNING 

           The Fixer blinks awake, patched up and cleaned off, in 
           Neeka’s bed. A RECORDING IN UKRAINIAN plays from a small 
           device on her desk. A man speaking seriously.

           He sees Neeka, fresh and pink from the shower, naked and 
           dressing. She catches him peeking.

                                 NEEKA
                        Feeling better, pervert?

                                 THE FIXER
                        What am I listening to?

                                 NEEKA
                        I record the doctors at the 
                        hospital so I won’t forget what I’m 
                        learning. You hungry?

           INT. KITCHEN - NEEKA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           The Fixer wolfs down breakfast. Neeka slides the PHOTO OF 
           PVT. BEST across the table. 

                                 NEEKA
                        Who is she? Girlfriend?

           Neeka’s Mother sits there checking him out, listening 
           intently.

                                 NEEKA
                        Don’t worry, she can’t understand.

           The Fixer handles the photo.

                                 THE FIXER
                        She’s the daughter of that 
                        American. One who... 

                                 NEEKA
                        Disappeared?

                        I found him.

                                 NEEKA
                        He was looking for her? His 
                        daughter?

                                 THE FIXER
                        She was killed in Afghanistan. I 
                        think he came looking for me.

           Neeka waits for an explanation.

                                 NEEKA’S MOTHER
                        <<What is he saying?>>

           The Fixer holds the photo up, squints for comparison.

                                 THE FIXER (CONT’D)
                        I can see why you reminded him of 
                        his little girl.

                                 NEEKA
                        Does he blame you?

                                 THE FIXER
                        He’s dead.

           The Fixer and Neeka lock eyes.

           INT. BEDROOM - NEEKA’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           Neeka opens a CLOSET with a rack of MEN’S CLOTHES.

                                 NEEKA
                        You like, take something from here.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Whose are these?

                                 NEEKA
                        My father was like you, kind of a 
                        dissident. He disappeared when I 
                        was seven. Mother convinced herself 
                        it was the KGB. I knew better. I 
                        knew he escaped west. 

                                 THE FIXER
                        How’d you know?

                                 NEEKA
                        He wore his best suit. The KGB 
                        didn’t give time to get dressed.

                                 THE FIXER
                        I’m sorry.

                                 NEEKA
                      (bitterly)
                        I’m sure he was too.

           The Fixer goes to the closet and chooses a suit.

           Neeka watches him dress in silence.

           The Fixer finally turns to her for appraisal. Neeka steps 
           toward him. She straightens and smooths the ill-fitting 
           clothes.

                                 THE FIXER
                        It’s shor--

           NEEKA KISSES HIM HARD, cutting him off. They embrace. She 
           digs at his clothes, her father’s clothes, starts ripping 
           them off. The Fixer suddenly pushes her away.

                                 NEEKA
                        I’m not that girl in the 
                        photograph.

                                 THE FIXER
                        You don’t know what I am.

           He goes to the window, lights a smoke.

                                 THE FIXER (CONT’D)
                        If you had five lives. Five lives 
                        to do whatever you choose. Who 
                        would you be?

                                 NEEKA
                        I don’t know. 

           She thinks about it, list popping into her head.

                        What about a figure skater?

                                 NEEKA
                        No. That’s it.

                                 THE FIXER
                        That’s only four.

                        Five is who I am.

           He adores that answer.

                                 NEEKA (V.O.)
                        What about you? If you had five 
                        lives what would you do?

                                 THE FIXER
                        Atone for this one.

                                 NEEKA
                        That’s sad.

                                 THE FIXER
                        It’s the truth.

                                 NEEKA
                        I think it’s a foolish game, five 
                        lives. There’s only one that 
                        counts. You can atone for it today 
                        if you wanted to.

           He looks to her. She’s right.

           EXT. U.S. EMBASSY - DAY 

           The Fixer struggles to take his first step across the 
           threshold of the front gate. Neeka, there for support, 
           removes something from her necklace. She places a CRUCIFIX 
           CHARM in The Fixer’s hand.

                                 NEEKA
                        My grandmother gave to me. It gets 
                        me through times I’m frightened.

                                 THE FIXER
                        I hope that’s not often.

           She opens her palm, the flesh bruised and pierced where she 
           clutched the crucifix like a vice.

                        I soldiered in Afghanistan under a

                        you’ll be a hero.

                                 CHEEVER
                        Sorry, sport. I’d rather be rich. 
                        Drugs are more lucrative than book 
                        deals.

           Cheever pulls a gun from his drawer.

                                 CHEEVER
                        Bixby promised me a cut. Who do you 
                        think arranged to have you both 
                        killed in Kiev?

           With a glint in his eye, The Fixer calmly approaches Cheever, 
           who squeezes the trigger. CLICK.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Yeah, that occurred to me.

Takes a small device from his 
           pocket. Clicks a button.

                                 CHEEVER
                        Fuck.

           The Fixer bashes Cheever in the skull with the gun. The 
           rooster-necked smoothie goes night-night.

           INT. CHEEVER’S OUTTER OFFICE - DAY

           The Fixer saunters out. The Secretary hands him BULLETS from 
           Cheever’s gun clip. He tosses back an envelope of cash.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Better to know the snake in your 
                        grass.

           He winks.

           INT. HALLWAY - U.S. EMBASSY - DAY 

           The Fixer discards the gun and clip down a mail slot, then 
           ducks down a service staircase just as Bixby, Leone and Crazy 
           Mary turn the corner.

           INT. CHEEVER’S OUTTER OFFICE - DAY 

           Bixby and company enter. Secretary looks up, all smiles.

                                 BIXBY
                        He in?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Just out of a meeting.

           They head into Cheever’s office.

           INT. COURTYARD - U.S. EMBASSEY - DAY 

           The Fixer walks briskly, rewinding the recorder, tucking it 
           into his jacket pocket.

           They find Cheever on the floor, just coming to.

                                 CHEEVER
                        He’s here.

                                 BIXBY
                        Who’s here?

                                 CHEEVER
                        Your fucking Captain! And he’s got 
                        everything on record!

           Leone looks from the window...

                                 LEONE
                        There!

           EXT. GATE - U.S. EMBASSEY - DAY 

           The Fixer walks past a Marine. A phone rings... 

           INT. HALLWAY - U.S. EMBASSY - DAY

           Bixby, Crazy Mary and Leone launch down the service 
           staircase.

           EXT. U.S. EMBASSY - DAY

           The Fixer exits to freedom. Looks for Neeka. She’s gone.

           An Intimidator SUV skids up, back door swings wide. There’s 
           Neeka. Darko with a gun to her head. He nods to get in.

           INT. COURTYARD - U.S. EMBASSEY - DAY

           Bixby and his boys race to the gate...

           EXT. U.S. EMBASSY - DAY

           They run into the street, the taillights of Darko’s SUV gone 
           around the block.

                                 BIXBY

THE KRYVORIZHSTAL - DUSK

           The sun sets angry and dirty behind the snow clouds. Darko’s 
           SUV rolls up.

           INT. DARKO’S SUV - DUSK

           Bouncers drag Neeka from the vehicle. The Fixer, hands bound 
           behind his back, tries what he can.

                                 THE FIXER
                        No!

           Darko reins him in. 

                                 DARKO
                        You left a vacancy to fill.

           She’s taken, screaming and struggling, inside.

                                 THE FIXER
                        You hurt her...

                                 DARKO
                        It’ll be nothing like what I’m 
                        going to do to you.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Darko’s SUV maneuvers down a narrow mud logging road. The 
           Fixer DRAGGED behind on a tether by his bound wrists.

           EXT. STATUE CEMETERY - NIGHT

           They come to a large clearing, the SUV’s headlights splashing 
           over HUNDREDS OF SOVIET-ERA STATUES. Lenin’s and Stalin’s 
           everywhere, fists raised, eyes scowling. Other statues too, 
           scrapped communist ideals. Snow gently begins to fall.

           Ride over, The Fixer skitters to a bruising stop at a pair of 
           shiny black wing-tips. Kindrachuk stands next to his Zil with 
           some men.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        Where’s my son?

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        I know you delivered him to that 
                        bitch, Vita Lysenko.

           The Fixer grips Neeka’s charm, still in his hand. It’s drawn 
           blood.

                                 THE FIXER
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

           Kindrachuk gives Darko the go-ahead.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        String him up.

           A NOOSE hangs high, thrown over a Stalin statue’s thrusting 
           fist. They string up The Fixer by his feet, like a pig to be 
           drawn and quartered. 

           THE DIGITAL RECORDER falls from his pocket.

           Kindrachuk picks it up. 

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        What’s this?

                                 THE FIXER
                        Nothing.

           But Kindrachuk can tell it’s something. He presses the 
           button. ONE OF NEEKA’S DOCTORS DRONES AWAY IN UKRAINIAN.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        Nothing, you say?

           Kindrachuk SMASHES the devise. The Fixer’s dream of 
           redemption smashed with it. Cheever’s recording, gone.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        Crossing me will get you killed.

           Darko pulls a SCYTHE and HAMMER off a nearby iron statue.

                                 KINDRACHUK (CONT’D)
                        Using my son will make it slow.

                                 THE FIXER
                        You were holding him against his 
                        will. He wanted to go.

                        He was too far gone to want 
                        anything but another fix. I gave 
                        him what he wanted. Now I want him 
                        back.

           The Fixer picks away at his binds with Neeka’s crucifix.

                                 THE FIXER
                        The police have him now. I don’t 
                        know where.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        I own the police. What are you 
                        talking about?

                                 THE FIXER
                        Vita’s gonna make him testify about 
                        your order to execute that 
                        journalist back when you were 
                        interior minister.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        Is that what she told you? 

                                 THE FIXER
                        If I delivered your son, he’d 
                        deliver you.

           Kindrachuk erupts with laughter.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        The only one I trust with an order 
                        like that can’t ID anyone.

           Darko removes his mirrored goggles, smiles through scorched 
           eye-sockets.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        Seems for a man so adept at playing 
                        sides, you’ve been played yourself.

                                 THE FIXER
                        I don’t understand? 

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        This was all a vendetta. My 
                        ministry jailed Vita for 
                        corruption. My son blew the 
                        whistle. They were lovers back when 
                        she was stealing her fortune. Back 
                        when we were all stealing fortunes.

                        He’s the last link to her criminal 
                        past. The only man who could 
                        destroy the darling of the new 
                        democracy movement.

           The Fixer, furious.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Let me fix this. I’ll get him back.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        So you do know where he is?

                                 THE FIXER
                        No, but give me 24 hours.

           Darko bites at the bit to avenge Rawa.

                                 DARKO
                        You can’t let him go. I can’t even 
                        cry for her. Please.

           Kindrachuk, considering, respects this.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        Make him hurt. If he says anything 
                        about my son, give me a call.

           Darko flips the hammer to one of his men and raises the 
           scythe. He advances on The Fixer, ready for blood.

           Kindrachuk jumps into his Benzo and drives away.

           The Fixer desperately picks his binds, almost there.

                                 DARKO
                        Did she scream like this...

           Darko lashes at The Fixer’s stomach, who bellows a scream. 
           Scythe snags. There’s no blood.

           Darko rips away the scythe and some of his jacket, revealing 
           BODY ARMOR. Marine issue kevlar. Darko’s stunned.

           The Fixer frees his hands with the crucifix. Punches Darko 
           and grabs the scythe, dropping the charm in the snow.

           One of Darko’s men pulls a gun. 

           The Fixer decapitates his gun-wielding hand with a stroke. 
           Then cuts his feet free from the noose, thudding to the 
           ground.

           (cid:13)                            (cid:13)           THE MAN WITH THE HAMMER charges The Fixer, whacks the scythe 
           out of his hand. Whacks The Fixer back. Raises the hammer for 
           a fatal blow.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Darko!

           Darko groping blindly to his feet, pulls a gun. SHOOTS... 

           The man with the hammer in the back. He drops.

           The Fixer takes off...

           Darko’s last man fires after him. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

           But The Fixer disappears deep into the statue cemetary. 

           Darko regains his composure. Looks around with his dead eyes.

           The man with the decapitated hand moans in the snow. As does 
           the man with the hammer, shot and dying. Darko’s last man 
           steps up.

                                 LAST MAN
                      (Ukrainian, subtitles)
                        <<He’s gone into the cemetary.>>

                                 DARKO
                        <<He’s as dead as Lenin.>>

                                                 CUT TO:

           THE FIXER  

           Hides among the creepy Soviet-era statues. Lenin EXPLODES! 
           Dzerzhinsky (founder of KGB) EXPLODES! The Fixer somersaults 
           as the world heaves around him.

           DARKO and his last man sweep the cemetary, GRENADE BELTS 
           slung over their shoulders. With a keen ear, Darko listens 
           and points his man where to throw. They advance behind the 
           blasting grenades, beaters for the hunt.

                                 DARKO
                        I know you’re out there! I can hear 
                        your beating heart! I’m going to 
                        rip from what’s left of your chest!

           THE FIXER hunkers down, still and silent. He hears a branch

           the wolf carcass. Darko hears movement, points to...

           THE FIXER springs from the darkness and TACKLES Darko’s last 
           man. 

           Darko turns his gun on the struggle, firing blindly around 
           them.

           The Fixer yanks a grenade, crams it down the man’s pants, 
           then rolls away.

           The panicked last man desperately fishes his pants. Darko 
           shoots him dead.

                                 DARKO
                        I get him?

           The Fixer ducks behind a statue.

           KA-BOOM!

           Last man’s blown to bits. Darko blasted back. 

           The Fixer’s okay. He comes over Darko’s shattered body. 

                                 DARKO
                        Smells like... Afghanistan.

           Darko drifts into death. 

                                                 CUT TO:

           NEEKA’S CRUCIFIX

           The Fixer picks it up.

           Jumps into Darko’s SUV.

                                 CHEEVER
                        Why do you care?

           Vita finally rips off his blindfold. Hands Cheever, who’s 
           soaked, a towel.

                                 VITA
                        This is a civilized country. My 
                        country. And I don’t like Americans 
                        running around it with guns.

           INT. KINDRACHUK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kindrachuk asleep in bed. An ENGINE roars to life somewhere 
           in his apartment. He snaps awake.

           The roar accelerates for his bedroom door, sound of glass 
           SMASHING, furniture SPLINTERING...

           bed. Kindrachuk dives for his life. The Jag launches out the 
           window wall and plummets into the courtyard below.  

           Kindrachuk peels himself off the floor. A gun is pressed to 
           his temple.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        You better be here to kill me.

                                 THE FIXER
                        I’d rather make a deal. I found 
                        your son.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        Alive?

                                 THE FIXER
                        Seems while Vita doesn’t want him 
                        to talk, she can’t quite put him 
                        out of his misery. She reminds me 
                        of you, actually.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        What makes you think you can get to 
                        him?

                                 THE FIXER
                        They trust me like you did. And I 
                        got to you, didn’t I?

           He surveys the destroyed penthouse.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        You’ll bring him to me? At what 
                        cost?

                                 THE FIXER
                        The girls. All the sex slaves in 
                        the Kryvorizhstal. And Neeka better 
                        be with them.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        My son for forty whores?

                                 THE FIXER
                        Call it Ukrainian math. That and 
                        the price off my head. Agreed?

                                 KINDRACHUK

                        They tell me this is a democracy.

           Kindrachuk snorts with laughter.

           INT. KRYVORIZHSTAL - NIGHT 

           Cheever plays messenger. Gathered at a booth are Bixby, Crazy 
           Mary and Leone, extremely fucking pissed.

                                 BIXBY
                        Who does this chick think she is? 
                        Hillary Clinton?

                                 CRAZY MARY
                        Ten million for gettin’ that gear 
                        off our hands. Sounds like a good 
                        deal to me, Lieutenant. 

                                 LEONE
                        Twice that won’t protect us from 
                        the people who want this over. 
                        Won’t protect us from Tokyo Six.

                                 CHEEVER
                        Who is this Tokyo Six anyway?

           A sudden black chill settles at the table.

                                 BIXBY
                        Maybe you. Maybe us. Maybe that 
                        motherfucking Fixer. That’s the 
                        thing. He’s everywhere and nowhere. 
                        An Architect and a ghost.

                                 CHEEVER
                        Architect of what?

                                 BIXBY
                        You State guys really are clueless 
                        fucks, aren’t you? This 
                        administration can always scare up 
                        cash for its war on terror. Even 
                        for that black hole Iraq. The 
                        Afghan drug money is for a war 
                        nobody wants to talk about.

                                 CHEEVER
                        What war is that?

           Nothing but Arctic stares. A question better not asked.

           Bixby, Crazy Mary and Leone off-load the drug shipment into 
           the back of a POLICE MINI-VAN. Customs officials look on, 
           giving protection.

           EXT. BORYSPPIL AIRPORT HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING

           The police mini-van, flashers on, sweeps down a straight shot 
           of road fenced in by inky-black trees barring any glimpse of 
           the countryside, a Soviet-era landscaping quirk.

           Neeka cramps into the drum-dark hold with the rest of the sex

           FEDERAL POLICE assemble. A handpicked force. The Fixer slams

                                 BIXBY
                        What the fuck are you doing?

           Everyone aims at everyone. A shooting gallery waiting to 
           happen.

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        I must know first. Where’s my son?

           The Fixer doesn’t blink.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Afghanistan.

           BLACKOUT

           The platforms goes dark. The Fixer throttles Cheever, his gun 
           discharging as it skitters between the tracks. 

           THE GUNPLAY BEGINS, SERGIO LEONE ‘SPAGHETTI WESTERN’ STYLE

           Everyone shoots wildly at everyone else, muzzle flash 
           illuminating the chaos. 

           Crazy Mary strafes away with his M-4. 

           Kindrachuk blasts back, his bodyguards taking and giving 
           bullets. 

           Leone is killed. 

           Cheever crawls on all fours, keeping down like a cockroach.

           Bixby hunts The Fixer, easy prey between the tracks, with his 
           Smith & Wesson. 

           EXT. PLAZA - NIGHT

           Police surround the tanker truck.

           Police stampede through shoppers, raid the subway...

PLATFORMS - SUBWAY - NIGHT

           Bixby finally gets a clean shot at The Fixer. Only an EXPRESS 
           TRAIN whooshing through, its carriage shredded by gunfire, 
           saves him. 

           The train past, Bixby’s lost the shot. The Fixer’s gone. 
           Before he can look, he hears a voice from behind. 

                                 THE FIXER
                        Que pasa, Lieutenant.

           The Fixer mows Bixby down in the back with Leone’s M-4.

                                 THE FIXER
                        You dead yet or what?

           EXT. PLAZA - NIGHT

           Police attempt to pry open the hold of the tanker truck. 
           BOOM! It pogos into a FIREBALL.

           EXT. SUBWAY STATION (PLAZA ENTRANCE) - CONTINUOUS

           Vita witnesses the FIREBALL across the plaza as police raid 
           the station.

                                 VITA
                        My God.

           INT. PLATFORMS - SUBWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Chandeliers shake. Everyone feels the explosion. The Fixer 
           picks up his radio earpiece.

                                 VITA (O.S.)
                      (over earpiece)
                        The girls are gone! He blew the 
                        truck!

           He locks eyes with Kindrachuk across the tracks.

           POLICE swarm the platforms.

           Crazy Mary and Kindrachuk’s bodyguards go down shooting.

           Kindrachuk leaps onto the tracks and flees down the subway 
           tunnel.

           chases after him.

           Cheever crawls into an AIR SHAFT.

           INT. TUNNEL - SUBWAY - NIGHT

           The Fixer pursues Kindrachuk, shadows clamoring down the 
           black hole. Kindrachuk pops off wild defensive shots.

           INT. AIR SHAFT - NIGHT

           Cheever finds a ladder to the surface. He climbs to freedom.

           INT. PLATFORMS - SUBWAY - NIGHT

           After taking casualties, police kill Crazy Mary, Kindrachuk’s 
           bodyguards. Gunfight over.

           INT. TUNNEL - SUBWAY - NIGHT

           The Fixer, sick of this running shit, sights the clamoring 
           shadow as a guide and squeezes the trigger. 

           BLAM!

           A CRY and the SHADOW FALLS.

           INT. PLATFORMS - SUBWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Police control the scene. Vita hears the shot. She races into 
           the tunnel.

           INT. TUNNEL - SUBWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Kindrachuk, blood in his eyes, writhes on the tracks. The 
           Fixer stands over him like Bixby had Pvt. Best, dead to 
           rights with the Smith & Wesson. 

                                 KINDRACHUK
                        My son... We had a deal.

                                 THE FIXER
                        You killed those girls. What’s a 
                        deal between devils.

           They exchange a last, hard look.

                                             SMASH CUT TO:

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

           Over flashlights and footsteps. The Fixer turns to Vita, who 
           runs up. She sees Kindrachuk, dead as dust.

                                 THE FIXER
                        There’s a second truck.

           EXT. PLAZA - NIGHT

           Cheever crawls from a grate in the sidewalk, police flashers 
           across the park. The twisted, charred hull of the tanker 
           still smoldering. He smooths himself down and walks away cool 
           as Kansas...

           EXT. SIDESTREET - NIGHT

           Cheever passes a back alley courtyard. He hears pounding, 
           muffled screams, as if from inside...

           EXT. ALLEY COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           The SECOND K-GAZ TANKER TRUCK, driver door ajar. Whoever was 
           guarding it has bailed and gone.

           Bixby walks up to the scene like it were Christmas morning 
           and too good to be true. He puts his ear to the hold.

                                 CHEEVER
                        Hello girls.

           He licks his lips. Looks around, just to be sure.

           INT. TANKER TRUCK - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

           Cheever jumps behind wheel. Finds the keys in the ignition. 
           Turns it...

           A BLINDING LIGHT... 

           Cheever looks up. His eyes adjust to...
                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)           EXT. ALLEY COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Three Ukrainian squad cars skid to stop, spotlights in his 
           face. They block the exit. The Fixer and Vita jump out. 

           INT. TANKER TRUCK - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

           Cheever raises his hands in surrender and smiles like a fox 
           caught stealing the henhouse.

           INT. HOLD - TANKER TRUCK - NIGHT

           Blackness. Commotion outside. A disk of light opens. Neeka 
           blinks, gasps for air. A policeman’s hand reaches in. The 
           girls are pulled to freedom one by one...

           EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           The Fixer helps policemen pull girls from the hold. At last 
           he pulls out NEEKA. They embrace. He returns her crucifix 
           charm.

           A jealous smile stirs in Vita, who stands over Cheever, 
           handcuffed on the ground.

                                 CHEEVER
                        You gimmie that recording I won’t 
                        say a word about this to my 
                        embassy.

                                 VITA
                        There is no recording, Mr. Cheever.

           Cheever can’t fucking believe it.

           INT. FIXER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           The Fixer packs his slippers, hands Vita the briefcase he 
           received from Kindrachuk.

                                 THE FIXER
                        My cash from Kindrachuk. Divide it 
                        between the Kryv girls. Neeka too. 
                        Give them something to go home 
                        with.

                        ended here, yesterday.

           She kisses him on the cheek, tantalizingly close to his 
           mouth.

                                 VITA (CONT’D)
                        Good luck.

                        Thanks. You too. If it means 
                        anything, you have my vote.

           She smiles.

                        You know, with Kindrachuk gone and 
                        the Americans off the scent, you 
                        could stay in Kiev indefinitely.

                        You don’t think having someone 
                        around who knows your past is a 
                        liability?

                        Makes us remember who we were. Who 
                        we want to be.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Who we want to be, eh?

                        Be best if you don’t look.

           Everything else, what might have been, acknowledged and left 
           unsaid between them. He opens the door. She grabs his sleeve.

                                 NEEKA
                        I never got your real name. Mine’s

                        won’t be using anymore.

           The Fixer whispers in her ear.

           Neeka places her crucifix charm in his palm, then closes his 
           hand and kisses it goodbye.

           INT. TERMINAL - BORYSPIL AIRPORT - DAY 

           Immigration STAMPS the passport of STANLEY CHEEVER, diplomat.

           The Fixer takes it, walks through...

           INT. GATE - BORYSPIL AIRPORT - DAY 

           The Fixer runs into STEPHENS, the Brit from the opening. He 
           vacantly watches a SMALL BIRD flutter among the rafters of 
           the airport. Trapped.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Wonder how it got in here?

                                 STEPHENS
                        And why it can’t get out.

                                 THE FIXER
                        Where’s the new wife?

                        I’d be a good father to her boy. 
                        But she loves someone else.

           The Fixer knows this all too well.

                                 THE FIXER
                        It’s probably for the best.

                                 STEPHENS
                        That’s what I keep telling myself.

                        I tell myself lies worse than that.

           Stephens smiles sadly. The bird flutters.

           EXT. ISTANBUL - DAY

           Otherworldly minarets dot the skyline of this breathtaking, 
           exotic city. A haunting Adhan call echoes from a mosque. This 
           is the view from...

HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 

           The Fixer lingers, pretending to read Hammett’s Red Harvest. 
           Neeka’s crucifix now dangles with the wedding band and dog 
           tags on a strap around his neck.

           A lupine, smooth as silk FRENCHMAN approaches. This is 
           RICHTER, a bounty hunter. We see him only from the back.

                                 RICHTER
                        They say you’re the fixer?

           The Fixer drops his book and grins, cocky and cool as ever.
