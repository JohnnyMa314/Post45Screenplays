           INT. MEAT LOCKER - DAY

           Dim light. Frozen slabs of beef dangle from hooks. A tape 
           recorder on the greasy floor. Next to it, a pack of 
           cigarettes, an expensive bottle of Scotch, nearly empty.

           FREDDIE ‘SCAP’ SCAPA (30’s) sits crosslegged, eating 
           sausages off a paper plate. Quick methodical bites, like 
           a military man in the mess hall. Scap’s shirtless, shaved 
           head. His entire body is covered in religious tattoos. 
           Angels, a Catholic Cross. Steel-toe boots on his feet.

           Scap snatches up the booze, walks to a corner. He takes 
           long pulls until he finishes the bottle, then tosses it 
           into the trash. The bin is cluttered with empty bottles, 
           cigarette butts. 

           He’s been here for hours. 

           Scap turns, moves past the sides of beef, gathering 
           speed. He pulls a PISTOL out the back of his bluejeans. 

           At last he arrives at KEVIN FULTON (30’s) hanging upside 
           down between two pink carcasses, ankles roped to a hook 
           in the ceiling. 

           Fulton is completely still. Not even a breath. There’s 
           duct tape over his eyes. A dirty bandage on his forehead. 
           His arms and legs are tied. 

           It’s very likely Fulton’s dead. 

           Scap starts circling him. Scap’s seething, a beast of 
           adrenaline and testosterone. His melodic Irish accent 
           comes out in clipped, rapid-fire bursts.

                                 SCAP 
                        D’ya reckon I enjoy this? Bit of a rush? 
                        Bollix. Awful. Nasty business. Sickens me 
                        to death. Only reason I can do what I do, 
                        and even look meself in the mirror is 
                        because what you done, boyo--to me, to 
                        yer mates, to yer poor wife, to every wee 
                        baby from Dublin to Derry--is just about 
                        as foul a thing as a fella can do. But I 
                        reckon that’s why they call you 
                        Stakeknife, ain’t it? Because you stuck 
                        every last one of us right in the heart.

           No answer. 

           Without another word, Scap fires three DEAFENING SHOTS an 
           inch from Fulton’s eardrum. Still Fulton doesn’t stir.

           Finally Scap rips the tape off Fulton’s eyes. They’re 
           open. Hateful red pinpricks. 
           Scap cocks the pistol.

                                 FULTON 
                        I told you, me name ain’t Stake--

           BANG! A noise behind them. 

                                                           CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. HARBOR, GIBRALTAR - NIGHT

           A fortified English town perched on the tip of Spain. 
           Yachts fly the Union Jack. Warehouses, cranes, a car 
           park. Across the bay, oceanfront apartments sit below a 
           prehistoric peak, the rock of Gibraltar.  

           TITLE: ‘February, 1993. One Month Earlier.’ 

           EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

           A GUARD STATION. A drowsy Royal Marine, MCNAB, reads the 
           paper. The headline: ‘Bomb Explodes in World Trade 
           Center.’ His radio chirps. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        He back yet? I’ve a job for you two.

                                 MCNAB
                                 (Irish accent)
                        He’s still in the garage. I’ll fetch him. 

           McNab starts to trudge towards a warehouse.

           EXT. SMALL BOAT - NIGHT

           Down the way, two more Royal Marines lug a crate of life 
           preservers off a boat. The older of the two is Fulton. 
           Here he’s taut, muscular. Handsome despite the bags under 
           his eyes. A radio at his hip.  

           With him is CONOR VALERA (19) still very much a boy. 
           Conor sneaks glances at Fulton like most boys do football 
           stars. Melodic Irish accents.  

                                 FULTON
                        First time in Spain? Mind your fingers.

                                 CONOR
                        Nah, I went down to Barcelona last 
                        Christmas. Big hairy wank it was. 

                                 FULTON 
                        Ya thought so? Me wife’s always sayin’ 
                        how much she loves Barcelona. Lovely 
                        churches, she says. 
                                 CONOR
                                 (backpedaling)
                        Oh, aye. Those are grand. Reckon it’s 
                        just the birds I didn’t like. 

           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 

           An open-air hangar of steel frames. European cars stacked 
           on top of each other. McNab enters, flips the light 
           switch. The florescents stay off. He grumbles, moves 
           through the maze of cars towards a bathroom.

                                 MCNAB
                        Mate, will ya hurry it up! The sergeant’s 
                        already called twi-- 

           McNab STOPS in his tracks.

           The rear window of an old Packard has been SMASHED. An 
           odd SQUEAKING around the corner. Like sneakers on a 
           basketball court.  

           McNab peeks around the corner, horrified to see: 

           A TOWERING MAN, thick-fleshed, face covered by a black 
           balaclava, garrotting another MARINE from behind. The 
           marine’s feet, inches off the floor, squeak against the 
           cement. 

           McNab inches back, draws a gun, crouches against a tire. 

                                 MCNAB (CONT'D)
                        Oh Jaysus--oh Christ--

           McNab reaches for his radio. He doesn’t notice one of the 
           car doors begin to OPEN silently behind him... 

           EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

           Fulton and Conor keep walking with the life preservers. 
           Conor eyes Fulton’s GOLD WATCH.  

                                 CONOR
                        This is gonna sound thick, but can I ask ya 
                        a question? What kind o’ watch is that? 

                                 FULTON
                        Cheap one. Think from the surplus. Why? 

                                 CONOR
                        No reason. Just wonderin’.
                                 (then)
                        That the surplus on Bridge street?
                                 FULTON
                                 (smiles)
                        Aye, lad. That’s the one. 

           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           CRACK! McNab’s face bursts through a car window. TWO 
           MASKED ASSAILANTS yank him out, throw him onto the floor. 
           One stuffs a rag into his mouth, the other pulls out a 
           silenced pistol, blasts open McNab’s kneecap. A muffled 
           scream. Tears flood out of his eyes. 

           They pull the rag out of McNab’s mouth, lean down. Even 
           with the mask, McNab can see one of his assailants is a 
           WOMAN with black garnet eyes. GRACIE MORRISON.

                                 GRACIE
                                 (Irish accent)
                        Ya know who we are? 

           McNab nods. The other assailant leans in. DEAN RAFFERTY.

                                 DEAN
                        So ya know what happens if ya lie to us, 
                        son? 

           McNab eyes LIAM HEGAN, the masked ogre, tossing the dead 
           marine into a car trunk. McNab nods again. 

                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        The Admiral. Has he any more security?

                                 MCNAB
                        I-I don’t know. Maybe one or two.

                                 GRACIE
                        Any family with him? 

                                 MCNAB
                        I think--his daughter. Few of her kids.

           Gracie gives Dean an anxious look. 

                                 DEAN
                        Feck. 

           EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

           Fulton and Conor reach the guard station, put down the 
           life preservers. Conor anxiously bites his lower lip. 

                                 FULTON
                        Wee bit nervous, are ya? 
                                 CONOR
                        Em--no sir. 

           Fulton pats him on the arm.

                                 FULTON 
                        You’ll do fine. Just remember to roll 
                        down your windows. 

           CHIRP! Fulton’s radio BEEPS.

                                 DEAN (O.S.)
                        You’re clear. 

           Fulton and Conor remove the life preservers. Underneath: 

           1) A camera with a large flash.
           2) An Armalite automatic rifle, U.S. military-grade.
           3) A bomb. Semtex plastic explosives in a tupperware box.

           They’re IRA.

           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           McNab’s hands and legs are tied. Liam puts him inside a 
           car trunk, points a pistol. McNab grits his teeth.  

                                 MCNAB
                        Please, mate--

           Liam hears the accent, pulls his mask up.

                                 LIAM
                        Irish? 

           McNab nods, terrified. 

                                 LIAM (CONT'D)
                        Have ya no feckin’ pride, son?  

           Liam closes the trunk, doesn’t shoot. He moves back to 
           Dean and Gracie. Masks lift up, radios buzz. 

                                 FULTON (O.S.)
                        Hold your position. Conor’s bringing the 
                        van ‘round. 

           Gracie puts a nervous hand on the small of Dean’s back.

                                 GRACIE
                        Tell him, love. 

                                 DEAN
                        Em--sir? There’s wee ones on the boat. 
                        Target’s grandkids. 
           EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

           Conor looks up at Fulton, awaiting the order. Fulton eyes 
           a massive YACHT behind them.

                                 FULTON
                        We’re at war, Dean. Try not to forget so. 

           Fulton slides the rifle over his shoulder, slips a 
           balaclava over his face. 

           EXT. YACHT, DECK - NIGHT

           Classical music plays below. Fulton treads softly, bomb 
           under one arm, rifle and camera over his shoulder. He 
           moves past a window. 

           INSIDE: military accolades, pictures of a smiling family, 
           a grandfather in an ENGLISH ADMIRAL’S UNIFORM. 

           Fulton spots BOYS PAJAMAS on the floor. He eyes them, 
           keeps moving. He finds an air-conditioning vent, nestles 
           the bomb inside. He pulls up a metal receiver. 

           EXT. CRANE - NIGHT 

           Seventy feet tall, near the yacht. Fulton climbs the 
           ladder, perches on a platform high above the boat. He 
           takes the camera off his shoulder.

           FULTON’S POV - CAMERA

           Fulton focuses on the bomb. ZOOMS IN on the receiver tip. 

           EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           The rest of the IRA team looks up, watches. Breath held. 

           INT. IRA VAN - NIGHT

           In the car park. Conor quickly rolls down the two front 
           windows. He ducks, covers the back of his neck. 

           EXT. CRANE - NIGHT 

           Fulton aims the camera at the bomb. Three..Two..One...

           FLASH! He snaps a photo. 

           A beat. Nothing. Fulton aims at the antenna, snaps 
           another photo. Nothing. His radio beeps.

                                 DEAN (O.S.)
                        Somethin’ wrong with the trigger? 
           Fulton aims the camera one last time...

           FLASH! Suddenly dazzling light fills the entire harbor. 
           SPOTLIGHTS illuminate Fulton perched in the crane, the 
           IRA team by the garage. 

           EXT. CAR PARK - NIGHT

           Car doors burst open as thirty ENGLISH AGENTS flood out, 
           rifles pointed. THE LEAD AGENT holds a bullhorn.

                                 LEAD MI-6 AGENT
                                 (English accent)
                        This is MI-6! Drop your weapons!

           CRACK! Without warning, two of the spotlights explode. 
           The agents look around, confused. No one fired a shot. 

           EXT. CRANE - NIGHT

           Fulton seizes his microsecond of opportunity. 

                                 FULTON
                                 (into radio)
                        Belt ‘em.

           The harbor erupts into chaos.

           EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT

           THE IRA TEAM opens fire, fans out into the garage.      
           MI-6 AGENTS duck, firing back. Car windshields shatter. 
           Another spotlight inexplicably crackles off. 

                                 LEAD MI-6 AGENT
                        Get me a visual on that fucking shooter!

           CONOR’S VAN squeals out of the car park, beelines for the 
           garage. Bullets ping through the sidewalls. 

           FULTON slides down the crane, fires at MI-6. One agent 
           goes down, hit in the leg. Another spotlight sizzles out. 

           EXT. GARAGE, ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Perched above the melee is the final member of Fulton’s 
           team. ALASTAIR GLASS (40’s) lean, ratty. A Catholic Cross 
           around his neck. 

           Alastair squeezes off rounds from a silenced Barret Light 
           50, a US-made sniper rifle. He makes impossible shots 
           through windows, cracks between car doors. TWO MI-6 
           AGENTS snap and crumple, chests blossoming open. 
           Alastair spots Conor’s van shrieking into the garage 
           below. He slings the rifle over his shoulder, starts 
           climbing down a ladder.

           EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT 

           MI-6 agents snake towards Dean and Gracie, caught behind 
           a forklift. Liam and Alastair dart into the van. 

           Dean SCREAMS, pitches backwards onto the cement, exposed. 
           He clutches his stomach, fingers turning red, fires back.

           EXT. YACHT - NIGHT

           Fulton runs for the van, rifle clattering. Agents spot 
           him, whirl the remaining spotlight. The lead agent eyes 
           the beam dancing across the ship. Suddenly he panics--

                                 LEAD MI-6 AGENT 
                        Wait, not on the--

           The spotlight lands directly on Fulton’s bomb. A red 
           light blinks on the antenna tip. 

           CRACK! An ORANGE FIREBALL devours the yacht. 

           Fulton slams shoulder-first into the side of his van. 
           Instantly the side windows of every car within fifty 
           yards all SHATTER simultaneously.

           Broken glass rains down on everything in the harbor. The 
           remaining spotlight explodes. Total darkness.

           INT. IRA VAN - NIGHT

           The door slides open, Fulton ducks inside. Conor’s 
           terrified, unhurt. Alastair and Liam huddle in the back, 
           reloading. Bullets begin cutting through the sidewalls. 

                                 FULTON
                        Take us home, son. 

           Conor screeches backwards towards Dean, Gracie. Alastair 
           and Liam fire at the agents through back windows.

           EXT. CAR PARK - NIGHT

           Agents hop on motorcycles, start up vans. THE IRA VAN 
           screeches to a halt. Gracie darts in, motions to Dean. 

                                 GRACIE
                        He took one in the gut.

           Fulton grabs Dean’s legs. Bullets clang at Conor’s ear. 
           The boy stomps on the gas. 
                                 GRACIE (CONT'D)
                        Conor, wait--

           Dean’s only halfway inside when the van takes off... 

           EXT. WAREHOUSES - NIGHT

           The van rushes through the harbor with Dean dangling out 
           the side door. Red lights flash. MI-6 tears towards them. 

           INT. IRA VAN - NIGHT

           Fulton and Gracie try to yank Dean in. He’s barely 
           breathing. Hands slip on blood. Gracie looks up, scared.

                                 GRACIE 
                        For Chrissakes--slow down!

           A TIGHT ALLEY approaching, a slim space between two 
           warehouses. Dean’s body heads straight for the wall...

                                 FULTON
                        Almost have him...

           Fulton’s grunting, straining, pulling Dean slowly in...

           EXT. WAREHOUSES - NIGHT 

           MI-6 motorcycles gaining...twenty yards behind...ten...

           INT. IRA VAN - NIGHT 

           All eyes on the alleyway. Gracie’s hands slipping...

                                 GRACIE
                        Goddamit! Fecking stop!

           To Gracie’s horror, Conor looks at Fulton. Fulton looks 
           back at the British, inches behind them, and shakes his 
           head, no. Don’t stop. Conor pounds on the gas. 

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT 

           A rush of sparks. The van slams hard through the alley. 
           Dean’s body grinds up against the wall as he’s ripped 
           from the doorway. 

           The instant Dean hits the ground, an MI-6 motorcycle 
           collides with his midsection. Rider flipping off, break-
           neck into a wall. A van hits the bike, fishtails, 
           overturns. The alleyway is a nest of steel and smoke.

           The IRA van rattles on. 

                                                               FADE OUT.

           EXT. PEACE WALL, BELFAST - DAY (NEWS FOOTAGE) 

           1970’s. Muscled ENGLISH MEN build a tall wooden hedge, a 
           PEACE WALL cutting through the center of the gray city.

                        The first peace wall was erected today in 
                        Belfast, Northern Ireland. Separating the 
                        city’s Catholic and Protestant districts, 
                        the wall was constructed by British forces 
                        in an attempt to curb recent violence from 
                        the Provisional Irish Republican Army.

                        Three more deaths in the Protestant district 
                        of Shankill last night. The IRA claims 
                        bombings will continue until British rule in 
                        Northern Ireland comes to an end.

                        interned here at the Maze Prison, several

                        receive trial. 

           EXT. STREETS, DERRY - DAY (NEWS FOOTAGE)

           Bloody Sunday. The conflict intensifies as ENGLISH

                                 IRISH NEWSREADER (V.O.)
                        Violence erupted again Sunday, when 
                        English soldiers opened fire on a crowd 
                        of catholic civil rights protestors.

                        Nearly 100,000 Irish Nationalists gathered 
                        in mourning today for the funeral of IRA 
                        hunger-striker Bobby Sands. Sands, twenty

                        Though Prime Minister Thatcher escaped the 
                        blast, the IRA issued her this warning: 
                        ‘Remember, we only have to be lucky once. 
                        You will have to be lucky always.’

           INT. PRESS ROOM, LONDON - DAY (NEWS FOOTAGE) 

           1990’s. AN ENGLISH ADMIRAL (70’s) addresses reporters. We 
           recognize him from the family picture in Gibraltar. 

                                 ADMIRAL MONTCLAIR
                        The quality of IRA weapons has diminished. 
                        We’re seeing fewer men join the ranks than 
                        ever before. We are now in the twilight of 
                        our long war with these terrorist killers.

           EXT. HARBOR, GIBRALTAR - DAY (NEWS BROADCAST)

                        The IRA’s latest target, Admiral Charles 
                        Montclair, was tipped off by British anti-
                        terrorist unit MI-6, and moved from his 
                        yacht just hours before it was destroyed. 

           EXT. PEACE WALL, BELFAST - DAY (NEWS FOOTAGE)

           The peace wall is now twenty feet tall, reinforced with 
           steel, and covered in graffiti: ‘Brits Go Home!’ 

           Grim-faced IRISH POLICE bag BODIES in front of the wall.

                                 ENGLISH NEWSREADER (V.O.)

                        each shot twice in the back of the head. 
                        So far police have found no suspects.

           INT. DIRTY HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Peeling paint. Water drips from the ceiling. Trash 
           scattered about the floor. Coffee cups, takeout.  

           A JITTERY MAN rocks back and forth in a tattered chair, 
           watching an American news program on Admiral Montclair. A 
           tan DUFFEL BAG at his feet. 

           He quickly shuts off the TV. We never see his face.  

           INT. FULTON’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Working-class. Mismatched furniture. The repeated hiccup 
           of a record skipping in the other room. 

           Fulton makes love to his wife, FIONA. She’s lovely. Slim, 
           freckled shoulders, strawberry hair. His shirt stays on.

           The act is tender, intimate. Fulton and Fiona focus 
           intensely on each other’s eyes. A slow build. After a 
           moment, Fiona tilts her head back like she’s had an 
           orgasm. She squeezes his shoulders. Soft voices.  

                          FULTON
                                                        FIONA
           Did you--
                                             No.

           Fulton pulls her close, they keep making love. 

                                 FIONA 
                        Go anytime you want. Don’t think I can.

           They continue. After a moment it’s clear Fulton’s no 
           longer turned on. Eventually he rolls over. They lie on 
           their backs, staring up at the ceiling. 

           He touches her leg. Fiona gets up to change the record.

           INT. FULTON’S BEDROOM - DAY 

           Bob Dylan plays ‘Subterranean Homesick Blues’. Fiona’s in 
           the living room. Fulton, shirtless, eyes the purple 
           bruise he’s kept hidden under his shirt. 

                                 FIONA (O.S.)
                        How was London? 

                                 FULTON
                        Deadly dull. Ya see, I picked up that LP 
                        you asked for? 

           He puts on a dress shirt, covers up the bruise.

                                 FIONA (O.S.)
                        Aye. This is it playin’ here.
           Fulton listens to the familiar Dylan tune. 

                                 FULTON
                        Do we not have this one already, love?

                                 FIONA (O.S.)
                        Not in this order.

                                 FULTON
                        Bleedin’ obsessed, you are.

           On the bedside table, a HOME PREGNANCY KIT. 

           INT. FULTON’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Stacks of records. A keyboard against one wall. Fiona 
           wears a bra and a skirt, stands in front of the mirror. 
           She examines her breasts.  

                                 FIONA
                        Me nans look like they’re saggin’ to you?  

           Fulton enters, no pants on, brushing his teeth. Their 
           relationship is comfortable, not new.

                                 FULTON
                        Hope so. I quite like a saggy nan. Sag 
                        ‘em down to China, I say.

           She gives him a look. He eyes her, still quite taken.

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        They’re lovely, Fiona. Lovely like the 
                        rest of ya. 

           The record changes to the uptempo: ‘I Want You.’  

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        Oo, this one I like. C’mere, give us a 
                        twirl.

           Fulton takes her up in his arms, starts to dance with 
           her, his mouth full of toothpaste. He twirls her, plants 
           a toothpaste kiss on her cheek. 

                                 FIONA
                        Bleedin’ nut! Put your trousers on.

           The phone starts to ring, Fiona goes to answer it. Fulton 
           heads back to the bedroom to dress.  

                                 FIONA (CONT'D)
                        Oh, Kevin--I meant to ask. Ya busy

           Fulton dresses, eyes the guitar in the corner. 

                                 FULTON
                        No problem. Ya gonna let me play this time?

           No answer. Fulton continues dressing.

           INT. FULTON’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Fulton enters to find Fiona’s mood has changed 
           significantly. She holds the phone, anxiously flips TV 
           channels till she finds the NEWS.

           ON THE TV: a picture of DEAN. Text: ‘Gibraltar Bomber’. 

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)

                        suspected IRA terrorist, Mr. Rafferty-- 

           Fulton stares at the news, reveals nothing but surprise.

                                 FULTON
                        Jaysus. Jaysus Christ. 

           Fiona covers the receiver. 

                                 FIONA

                        sorry...you sure? Aye, call me back. 

           She hangs up, glances at Fulton. Wheels turning. 

                                 FULTON
                        What?

                                 FIONA 
                        You knew, didn’t ya? I can see it on your

                        That don’t mean he tells me Army business. 

           The phone starts ringing again. Fiona’s getting angrier. 

                                 FIONA
                        But you said yourself, ya do jobs for

                        Just wee things, I said. Takin’ packages 
                        across town and that. 

           She goes into the bedroom, pissed. 

                                 FIONA (O.S.)
                        Big things. Wee things. Still helping 
                        feckin’ terrorists, aren’t ya?

           Fulton eyes the news. Dylan keeps singing ‘I want you...’

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY 

           Old Roman Catholic. Parishioners milling about.  

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Organ music, a PRIEST up front. People filter in. Fulton 
           dips a hand in the baptismal font, crosses himself, sits. 

           Scattered throughout are the members of Fulton’s team, 
           their families. Conor’s with his MOTHER, Alastair’s with 
           his WIFE. Liam has his arm on the back of a teenaged BOY. 

           GRACIE enters alone. People glance at her, whisper. The 
           music stops. She sits in the back. 

                                 PRIEST
                        The Lord be with you. 

           Fulton squeezes Fiona’s hand.

                        And also with you.

                        Mrs. Fulton. What can I do for you? 

                                 FIONA
                        Em--I wanted to talk to you about Kevin?
           EXT. FIELD - DAY 

           Fulton plays Gaelic football with the boys. He moves down 
           the field soloing (toeing the ball into his hands). Just 
           before he reaches he goal, TWO YOUNG BOYS (12) rush up 
           and tackle him. Fulton falls, cries out. 

                                 FULTON
                        That’s a foul there, lads! That’s a foul. 

           INT. RECTORY - DAY 

           The priest looks grave. 

                                 FIONA
                        I mean--I knew when we got married it was 
                        part of his life. I just don’t think I 
                        realized how big a part. 

                                 PRIEST
                        Is there more ya could do to find out 
                        what’s really goin’ on?

                                 FIONA
                                 (a little embarrassed)
                        Aye. But it’s just--when Kevin’s ‘round me, 
                        he’s the sweetest thing ya ever met. If he 
                        is this--other thing too--reckon he’d have 
                        to be like one of them headers, right? 
                        Split down the middle? Terrifying, that is. 

                                 PRIEST
                        If ya don’t mind me asking--are you two 
                        planning to have a family one day?

                                 FIONA 
                        We been tryin’. 

                                 PRIEST
                        Then I think that’s another important 
                        question. What kind of children will ya 
                        raise, if their father is a terrorist?

           Fiona looks out the window, watches Fulton playing with 
           the boys. He spots her, smiles. Fiona gets a chill. 

           EXT. FALLS ROAD - DAY

           Snare drums, trombones, men in orange sashes. A 
           PROTESTANT PARADE marches through the Catholic 
           neighborhood. POLICEMEN with assault rifles stand guard. 
           Not a celebration, more a display of English authority. 

           Down the way, men walk into an UNMARKED BUILDING.
           INT. HIBERNIAN CLUB, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           An IRA bar, poolhall. A whirlwind of chatter. Two 
           MUSICIANS play guitar, sing a ballad.

                                 GUITARIST
                        This Ireland of mine/ Has for long been 
                        half free/Six counties are under/ John 
                        Bull's tyranny.

           Gracie stands by a table. Men walk up, leave flags, 
           flowers. Liam drinks solemnly next to her. He pulls a 
           card out from under the seat. 

                                 LIAM
                        Got somethin’ for ya. Sorry it ain’t more--

           Gracie opens the card. It’s a beautiful pencil sketch of 
           Dean’s face. The words ‘We’ll Miss You’ written above it. 

                                 LIAM (CONT'D)
                        Me son made it.

           Gracie looks at the card, touched. 

                                 GRACIE
                        It’s beautiful, Liam. Tell him thanks. 

           Liam nods. Alastair steps out from the back room, an 
           awful look on his face. Dread and anxiety. He sits with 
           Liam, takes a gulp of beer. A silent beat. 

                                 LIAM 
                        Feck’s the matter? What’d Darcy say?

           Alastair eyes Gracie, lowers his voice. 

                                 ALASTAIR
                        He just told me who’s replacing Dean. 
                                 (then)
                        Freddie Scapa. 

           Liam’s gaze falls down into his beer.

                                 LIAM
                        That the fella from Eniskillen done all 
                        them churches.

           Alastair nods. Suddenly Liam looks very uncomfortable.

                                 LIAM (CONT'D)
                        I heard he wasn’t workin’ anymore.
                                 ALASTAIR
                        No. Darcy said he asked to run with us, 
                        specifically.

                                 LIAM
                        Jaysus. The feck for?

                                 ALASTAIR 
                        Ya got me. Who knows what goes on in the 
                        head o’ that feckin’ mentaller.  

           FULTON AND CONOR enter front. Conor holds flowers. He now 
           wears a cheap GOLD WATCH identical to Fulton’s.  

                                 FULTON
                        Sure you’re alright? 

           Conor nods, twirls the flowers, nervous. Gracie spots 
           them approaching, unable to mask her contempt. Conor puts 
           the bouquet down on the table. Liam and Alastair stand. 

                                 CONOR 
                        I can’t tell ya how sorry I am. 

           Gracie doesn’t say anything.

                                 FULTON
                        Come on, Gracie. Lad’s apologizing here. 

                                 GRACIE
                                 (under her breath)
                        How ‘bout you? You apologizing?

           Fulton’s vitriol quickly flares up. 

                                 FULTON
                        What d’ya think woulda happened if we 
                        stopped? Reckon James Bond takes us alive? 
                        Dean was feckin’ gut-shot, for Chrissakes. 

                                 GRACIE 
                                 (quiet, re: Conor)
                        Still never would of happened if his oul 
                        man had been drivin’ us. 

           Conor looks down at the floor, ashamed. Fulton drags 
           Gracie into a corner, pissed. 

                                 FULTON
                        Goddamit, Gracie. Ya know how rotten it 
                        felt, givin’ that order? Gonna give me 
                        nightmares it will. The boy too. Now, I 
                        don’t want to lose you as well, but if 
                        this is gonna be a problem, we gotta talk 
                        about a transfer. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                                 (then)
                        Are we square?

           Gracie looks away.

                                 GRACIE
                        Aye. We’re square.

           Conor looks at Alastair and Liam expectantly. He opens 
           his mouth to speak-- 

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Don’t put us in the middle, son.

           AT THE COUNTER Guinness and Poteen (Irish Whiskey). 

           Fulton and Conor approach. Fulton puts up two fingers. 
           Two black pints appear. Fulton and Conor take them into 
           the corner. 

                                 FULTON 
                        How’s your oul man? 

                                 CONOR
                        They’re cuttin’ him open again Tuesday. 
                        Bills are gonna be murder.  

           Fulton looks around. When he’s sure no one’s watching, he 
           pulls out a wad of bills, stuffs it in Conor’s pocket.

                                 CONOR (CONT'D)
                        Jaysus--sir, I can’t take that-- 

           Fulton takes a gulp of beer, glances at Alastair, Gracie.

                                 FULTON
                        Just keep it to yourself.

           INT. BACK ROOM, HIBERNIAN CLUB - DAY

           A huge Irish flag. The inner sanctum. Three IRA MEN 
           (30’s) sit at a table, eyeing at a TUBE MAP OF LONDON.

                                 IRA MAN
                        We strike Queensway in the early evening. 
                        Maximize impact.

           Fulton approaches, hands out beers and orders.

                                 FULTON 
                        No. No tube stations. Military targets 
                        only. Roadblocks. Bases. We want dead 
                        soldiers here, not civilians.
           At another booth sit two BOMBMAKERS (20’s). Red eyes, 
           coffee cups. Their jackets are covered in brown dust. 
           Fulton walks up, makes a sour face.

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        Jaysus. You two smell like a monkey’s arse.

                                 BOMBMAKER #1
                        Sorry, sir. Took nearly eight hours to 
                        grind down all the fertilizer. 

                                 FULTON
                        Aye? What kinda grinder you using?

                                 BOMBMAKER #1
                        Just his mam’s. Think it’s a Mr. Coffee.

           Fulton scribbles on a piece of paper, folds it.

                                 FULTON
                        Take this to the restaurant supply on 
                        Brook street. Talk to Eamon. He’ll fetch 
                        ya the proper grinder. 

           Fulton turns to exit.

                                 BOMBMAKER #2
                        Sir? Remember me brother Scotty? You said 
                        he could help the Cause? He’s at the bar. 

           INT. HIBERNIAN CLUB, MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Fulton goes behind the bar, pulls out a small WRAPPED 
           PACKAGE. He scans faces at the bar, finds SCOTTY. It’s a 
           TWELVE YEAR-OLD BOY looking around shyly at all the hard 
           faces. Fulton approaches, gives him the box. 

                                 FULTON 
                        Waverly Billiards. Fella called Grady. 

           As the boy scampers off, A SCARRED HAND settles on  
           Fulton’s shoulder. Fulton turns, a bit uncomfortable. 

                                 DARCY (O.S.)
                        Kevin.

           MR. DARCY (40’s) has a face like dried meat. A cigarette 
           dangles from his cracked lips.

                                 FULTON 
                        Mr. Darcy. I thought ya were in Newry.

                                 DARCY
                        Walk with me, boyo.
                                 (as they move for the door)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DARCY (CONT'D)
                        We’ve a bit of an emergency. How’d your 
                        team like another trip oversees?

           EXT. HIBERNIAN CLUB - DAY

           The clattering PROTESTANT PARADE marches by. Darcy eyes 
           the shuttered windows above.

                                 DARCY
                        Lookit this shite. No bricks, no bottles. 
                        Happened to our pride, Kevin?

                                 FULTON
                        We got some kick left. Lot of fine 
                        soldiers out there. We just need to arm 
                        ‘em properly. 

           Darcy nods, unconvinced. He stares out at the parade.

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry about Gibraltar. Feckin’ MI-6--

                                 DARCY
                        Forget Six. Got another job for ya.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

           We’re high up behind a billboard watching the parade 
           march on the street below. Fulton and Darcy keep talking. 

           We can’t hear what they’re saying. 

           EXT. HIBERNIAN CLUB - DAY

           Back on Fulton and Darcy. Whispers.

                                 FULTON 
                        Someone replacing Dean?

                                 DARCY 
                        Fella from Enniskillen. Freddie Scapa. 
                        You’ll love him. Bit of a hardchaw, but a 
                        good soldier. 

           An anxious look crosses Fulton’s face. He quickly 
           swallows it down. Darcy notices.

                                 DARCY (CONT'D)
                        Ya know him?

                                 FULTON
                        Knew his brother in H-blocks. I didn’t 
                        think Freddie was still active.
                                 DARCY
                        He’s been working on a special assignment 
                        for us. We been tryin’ to keep him out of 
                        the spotlight.

                                 FULTON
                        How’s he do followin’ orders? 

                                 DARCY
                        I don’t know how to put this, so I’ll 
                        just give it to ya straight: on this one, 
                        Scap’s runnin’ lead. 

           Fulton’s face twists in anger.

                                 FULTON 
                        What? You gotta be feckin’ joking me--

                                 DARCY
                        Lower your voice. This ain’t me decision. 
                        Scap’s got the whole Army Council backing 
                        him. 

                                 FULTON 
                        One bollixed job in fifteen years and 
                        some cunt takes me place? What’s so 
                        special ‘bout this new boy, he’s got 
                        everybody eating out o’ his hand?

           Darcy drags on his cigarette. He doesn’t want to answer. 

                                 DARCY
                        Kevin. We both know it wasn’t the one job.

           Fulton clams up, hurt. They both stare at the parade.

                                 FULTON 
                        Who’s the fella we’re sendin’ down a hole?

                                 DARCY 
                        Scap has the details for the hit. He’ll 
                        inform you of the target once you land. 

           Fulton starts to walk off, pissed.

                                 FULTON
                        Aw, bollix to ya. 

                                 MR.DARCY
                        Watch it, son! Don’t forget who you’re 
                        talking to!

           Fulton keeps walking. It’s starting to rain. 
           EXT. BELFAST STREET - TWILIGHT

           Fulton’s truck drives too fast down residential streets. 

           INT. FULTON’S TRUCK - TWILIGHT

           Blaring music. Billy Bragg’s ‘Which Side Are You On’. 
           Fulton’s agitated, slows to a stop. He pulls out a cell. 

                                 FULTON
                        Hey, hon. No, gimme an hour. I’m droppin’ 
                        by the record store. Aye, love ya. 

           Fulton looks out the window. He’s outside HIS HOUSE. He 
           can see Fiona hang up the phone inside. Fulton stares at 
           her sadly, like she’s miles away.

           EXT. FULTON’S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           Fulton drives off. After he’s gone, his garage door 
           begins rattling open. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - TWILIGHT

           MR. VALERA (50’s) lies in a bed. A respirator over his 
           face, wires and tubes snake out from under the covers. 

           Conor enters, holding a newspaper. He pulls up a chair.

                                 CONOR 
                                 (whispers)
                        I did alright, da. Bleedin’ terrifying it 
                        was--but kinda exciting too. I think 
                        Kevin, maybe Mr. Darcy are gonna help out 
                        with some o’ the bills as well. 

           The machines whir. Conor opens the paper to the sports 
           section, finds the football scores. 

                                 CONOR (CONT'D)
                        Anyways, I brought ya the Telegraph. 
                                 (reading)
                        Glentoran beat Portadown. One-nil... 

           EXT. CATHOLIC NEIGHBORHOOD - TWILIGHT

           Fulton’s pickup glides past lower-class apartment towers. 
           Irish flags. Curbs painted green, white, and orange. Up 
           ahead is the oppressive steel PEACE WALL. Fulton drives 
           through a break in the wall, heads into... 

           EXT. PROTESTANT NEIGHBORHOOD - TWILIGHT

           Curbs painted red, white, and blue. Porches fly the Union 
           Jack. Graffiti reads ‘IRA Wankers Ran Away in 69!’
           Fulton drives towards the edge of town. At last he 
           reaches a shelled-out OFFICE BUILDING, gutted by a recent 
           bomb. A vacant construction site at the base. Fulton’s 
           pickup approaches, he kills the lights. 

           Three CONSTRUCTION VANS sit at the base of the building. 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - TWILIGHT

           Rain pouring in sheets. Fulton trudges through the mud, 
           approaches the first van. He puts his ear up to the door, 
           waits for something. 

           No sound. Fulton moves to the second van, puts his ear up 
           to the door. Again, nothing. 

           Fulton puts an ear up to the third van. Two MUFFLED 
           VOICES inside. The sound of a BRASS BAND. Fulton listens. 

           One of the voices is his own.  

                                 FULTON’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Who’s the fella we’re sendin’ down a hole?

                                 DARCY’S VOICE  (O.S.)
                        Scap has the details for the hit. He’ll 
                        inform you of the target once you land. 

           The door slides open. The van is full of SURVEILLANCE 
           EQUIPMENT: microphones, headphones, a laptop computer. 

           A well-groomed, bookish man, BILL CHILDS (50’s) sits on a 
           stool, listens to a recording of Fulton and Darcy.

                                 FULTON
                        How’d we do?

                                 CHILDS
                                 (stiff English accent)
                        I swear, Kevin. Half the time I need a 
                        bloody translator.

           Fulton hops in. He’s a spy for the British. 

           INT. FRU VAN - TWILIGHT

           Moving through Belfast streets. A steel partition blocks 
           off the van’s DRIVER. Stacked folders read: ‘Force 
           Research Unit. Belfast. Confidential Report.’

           Childs clicks on the laptop, manipulating the quality of 
           the recording. He seems distracted.
                                 FULTON 
                        The feck was James Bond doing in 
                        Gibraltar? Why didn’t you tell them we 
                        had it covered?

                                 CHILDS
                        Mi-6 can bugger off. Half their rank-and- 
                        file still don’t believe we exist.

                                 FULTON
                        I just don’t see why we never share 
                        intel. It doesn’t make any sense.

                                 CHILDS
                        This is an open market, Kevin. Top marks 
                        go to any agency that catches you boys 
                        with your trousers down.   

                                 FULTON
                        Ugh. Please don’t say ‘you boys’.

           EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS PROTESTANT NEIGHBORHOOD - TWILIGHT

           The van rolls on. The neighborhood slowly becomes nicer. 
           Less graffiti, garbage. Fewer flags. 

           INT. FRU VAN

           Fulton looks sheepish now, guilty. Childs keeps typing. 

                                 FULTON
                        I didn’t kill anyone, did I?

                                 CHILDS
                        The FRU pulled five people off that boat. 
                        You could’ve killed four of MI-6’s, we’d 
                        still be saving lives.

                                 FULTON
                        You didn’t answer me question. 

                                 CHILDS 
                                 (looking up)
                        Ballistics said you shot one fellow in 
                        the hip, alright? He’s in the hospital.

                                 FULTON
                                 (quiet)
                        The rifle raises a bit after the first 
                        shot.

                                 CHILDS
                                 (changing the subject)
                        By the way, I brought you a little 
                        something. Look under the seat. 
           Fulton pulls out a BLACK BRIEFCASE. Inside is IR£20,000 
           and an EP. Fulton pockets the money, unfazed. He eyes the 
           record. It’s a single off Bob Dylan’s ‘Empire Burlesque’.  

                                 FULTON
                                 (impressed)
                        How?--There are less than a hundred of 
                        these. Fiona’s gonna shit her cacks.

                                 CHILDS
                        I still don’t know how you listen to him. 
                        My cats make better music when they fancy a 
                        shag. 

           EXT. UPSCALE PROTESTANT NEIGHBORHOOD - TWILIGHT

           The van glides into the fanciest neighborhood in Belfast. 
           No graffiti, no flags. 

           INT. FRU VAN - TWILIGHT

           Fulton and Childs listen to the conversation we missed 
           earlier. The noise from the parade has vanished.

                                 DARCY’S VOICE (O.S.)
                                 (digital, distorted)
                        Something’s come up in New York. One of 
                        our investors ran into trouble. Someone 
                        nicked a lot of money from us, Kevin. Lot 
                        of money. We need him down a hole. 

                                 CHILDS 
                        Didn’t give you much in the way of names.

           Fulton ignores him. The tape continues.  

                                 DARCY’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        ...Freddie Scapa. You’ll love him.

                                 FULTON
                        Ever heard of this fella? Scap. 

                                 CHILDS
                        We kept tabs on him until about a year ago. 
                        Bit of a ghoulish history--church bombings, 
                        abductions--

                                 FULTON
                        What happened a year ago?

                                 CHILDS
                        It was the strangest thing. He was 
                        shouldering up through the ranks as fast as 
                        anyone we’ve ever seen--all of a sudden he 
                        just went silent. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHILDS (CONT'D)
                        Fell off our radar completely. This is the 
                        first we’ve heard since. I’ll be honest, big 
                        player like that, it worries me a little.

                                 FULTON 
                                 (scoffs)
                        If he’s anything like his brother, he 
                        should be a feckin’ pushover. 

           EXT. UPSCALE PROTESTANT HOME - NIGHT

           The van heads towards a LUXURY HOME of brown brick.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT 

           Pictures of an Irish family. A billiard table. Half-eaten 
           bowls of curry steam in front of the TV. The FRU clearly 
           just kicked out a family in the middle of supper. 

           DIGNAN, a balding agent with a broken arm, stares out the 
           window with binoculars. Childs and Fulton enter.

                                 CHILDS
                        Kevin, you remember agent Dignan. 

                                 AGENT DIGNAN
                        Street’s secure, sir. The Morleys are at 
                        granny’s till morning. 

                                 CHILDS
                                 (brushes Dignan off)
                        We can see ourselves out. 

           Dignan exits. Fulton picks up a pool cue.

                                 FULTON
                        Mind if I break?

           Childs sits in a chair. Tone changing, serious. 

                                 CHILDS
                        Why don’t you have a seat.

           Childs eyes the couch. Fulton sits, confused. A beat.

                                 CHILDS (CONT'D)
                        Do you recall the day we first tapped you 
                        on the shoulder?

                                 FULTON
                        Aye. Day after the funeral. Right clever 
                        that was. 
                                 CHILDS 
                        So you remember what I told you, yes? How 
                        you’d most likely see three or four years in 
                        the field before we’d transfer you to Kent. 
                                 (then)
                        I spoke to headquarters this morning.

           Fulton’s face falls. He’s heartbroken. 

                                 FULTON
                        Wait--you’re putting me behind a bleedin’ 
                        desk?

                                 CHILDS 
                        Kevin, the truth is nobody ever thought 
                        we’d see an agent rise to your level. 
                        Consider this a chance to quit while 
                        you’re leading the pack. 

                                 FULTON
                        No. Somethin’ else is goin’ on. You don’t 
                        transfer a fella at the top of his game.  

                                 CHILDS 
                                 (frustrated)
                        Read between the lines. You heard Darcy. 
                        Gibraltar threw us into suspicion.

                                 FULTON 
                                 (rising to his feet)
                        Because you didn’t tell MI-6 we had a man 
                        inside! Just ‘cause Darcy’s a bit vexed--

                                 CHILDS 
                        He didn’t name the target. We don’t even 
                        know what the bloody job is.  

           Fulton starts pacing. He picks up the pool cue, nervous. 

                                 FULTON 
                        So what, we’re just gonna let Scap carve up 
                        some poor sod in the states then? Or worse, 
                        some feckin’ family? Because that’s what 
                        happens if I get transferred. Not forgettin’ 
                        if he gets hold of that money, it means more 
                        arms and more feckin’ funerals I gotta go 
                        to. 

                                 CHILDS
                        Look, if this is some guilty-Catholic thing 
                        for you--we can’t save everyone, Kevin.   

                                 FULTON
                        Mate, come on. Fifteen years we been 
                        waitin’ to get these cunts on the run. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        Don’t throw me in some basement now, not 
                        with peace right around the corner.

                                 CHILDS
                        Kevin--

                                 FULTON 
                        Just let me save one more. 

           Fulton meets eyes with Childs, pleading. A beat. 

                                 CHILDS
                                 (sighs)
                        I’ll ring headquarters. But I can’t 
                        promise they’ll agree to anything. 

           EXT. LAND’S END RECORDS - NIGHT

           Back in the Catholic neighborhood, a record store closes 
           up for the night. 

           An old blue TOYOTA pulls up, stops. 

           INT. KITCHEN, SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

           Fulton opens cabinets until he finds the whiskey. He 
           pours himself a shot, throws them back, on edge. 

           Childs stands in the doorway, cell phone in hand. Fulton 
           looks at him expectantly. A long silence. 

                                 FULTON
                        Well?

           The corner of Childs’ mouth flickers into a half-smile. 
           Fulton breathes a sigh of relief.  

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        Jaysus. Ya feckin’ scared me there. 

           EXT. SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

           Fulton and Childs walk towards the van. The driver waits.

                                 CHILDS
                        As soon as you learn the identity of the 
                        target, you will tell me immediately. In 
                        the meantime, I’ll have headquarters 
                        start asking around about Scap.

           Fulton nods. He pulls a stack of bills from his pocket. 
           IR£10,000. He hands it to Childs, gets in the van.  

                                 FULTON 
                        For Fiona’s music school? Make it look 
                        anonymous?
                                 CHILDS
                                 (nods)
                        See you in New York. 

           Childs shuts the door, watches as the van drives away.

           INT. FULTON’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           Fulton’s pickup enters next to a blue Toyota. He steps 
           out, moves to the back of the garage.

                                 FULTON
                        Love?

           No answer. Fulton digs around, finds the PAINT CANS. He 
           pries one open. It’s full of bills. IR£150,000. Fulton 
           takes the remaining £10,000, hides it in the paint can.

           INT. FULTON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Fulton enters, holding the new Dylan record. Fiona lies 
           on her side, facing the other direction. Fulton whispers.

                                 FULTON
                        Love? I know I said I’d help out at the 
                        fundraiser. Real sorry. They’re sendin’ 
                        me back to London. You’ll never guess 
                        what I found at Land’s End though--

           Fiona turns around. She’s awake. Her makeup is running.

                                 FIONA 
                        I went to the record store, Kevin.

           Fulton looks at her dumbly, the record in his hand. 

                                 FIONA (CONT'D)
                        Just get out. 

                                 FULTON
                        Love, let me explain something to you-- 

           She stands, her sadness turns quickly to anger. 

                                 FIONA
                        Get out of me fecking bedroom, Kevin!

           INT. FULTON’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The bedroom door slams hard in his face.

                                 FULTON
                        I ain’t a bleedin’ terrorist, love. I 
                        swear to Christ. All I want is peace.
           No answer. Fulton sits on the couch, turns on the NEWS.

           EXT. PEACE WALL, BELFAST - NIGHT (NEWS BROADCAST)

           Yellow tape. Police. Body bags.  

                                 REPORTER
                        ...where two more suspected IRA-members 
                        have been found, both shot twice in the 
                        back of the head. Police have still found 
                        no suspects... 

           INT. FULTON’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Fulton changes the channel. 

                                                               FADE OUT.

           EXT. JFK, AIRSTRIP - DAY

           Raining. A 747 touches down. Tires squeak on concrete.

           INT. JFK, CUSTOMS - DAY

           It’s one week after the World Trade Center bombing, and 
           SECURITY AGENTS watch closely as the foreign passengers 
           deboard. 

           Fulton moves through a line, listening to music on 
           headphones. He looks around at all the security agents. 
           No one’s paying any attention to him. Instead, MIDDLE-
           EASTERN MEN are being searched, led into back rooms. 

           A CUSTOMS AGENT sees Fulton approach. He eyes the brown 
           hair, the light skin. He looks at Fulton’s passport.

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        What’s the purpose of your visit to the 
                        United States, Mr. Bard?

                                 FULTON
                        Business.

           THUD! Fulton’s passport is stamped. Approved.

           EXT. LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY - DAY

           Gray, industrial. A YELLOW CAB glides through the rain 
           towards Manhattan. 

           EXT. BEST WESTERN - DAY

           A dingy red brick hotel in Hell’s Kitchen, an old Irish 
           neighborhood now halfway gentrified. Fulton’s cab pulls 
           up. He steps out into the cold. 
           INT. FULTON’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY 

           Fulton enters his cramped room. He can hear the bustle of 
           the city outside, but all that’s visible through the 
           window is a wide billboard: a pair of Levi’s Jeans.  

           Fulton spots a slip of paper on the bed. A NOTE: 

           “Algonquin Hotel. Restaurant. 9:30. Clothes in closet. 

                                           - Scap” 

           Fulton’s temperature rises. Already he’s getting the 
           runaround. He checks his watch: 9:40am. He crumples up 
           the note.  

           Fulton opens the closet. A cheap navy blue blazer hangs 
           up. He begrudgingly puts it on. It’s ill-fitting, short 
           in the sleeves. One of the lapels won’t sit right. 

           INT. ALGONQUIN HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 

           Dark wood. A glitzy imitation of Old New York style.  
           Well-dressed families drag luggage. 

           Fulton walks in wearing the jacket, feeling out of place. 
           He passes a banquet hall, glances inside.  

           INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 

           OLD-MONEY CONSERVATIVES crowd the tables. A brunch 
           fundraiser. A thick businessman with blood-red cheeks 
           gives a speech up front. WILL CAVANAUGH (40’s). 

                                 CAVANAUGH
                        Let’s get down to brass tacks. It’s been 
                        made abundantly clear over the last 
                        several weeks that our homes, our places 
                        of business, are not as safe as we once 
                        imagined. Meanwhile defense spending has 
                        been steadily declining since ninety-one. 
                        With your generous donations, you’re 
                        helping Meyer Dynamics make our streets 
                        safer, our homes more secure... 

           Fulton moves on, amused that one failed bombing would 
           cause such paranoia. 

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Fulton spots Conor, Alastair, Liam, and Gracie sitting at 
           a far booth, away from the other diners. They’re with a 
           FIFTH MAN, his face obstructed by a pillar.

           Fulton approaches, finally sees FREDDIE SCAPA. 
           Hardly the sociopath who strung Fulton up in the meat 
           locker, here Scap’s tattoos are covered up by his jacket. 
           He’s placed his napkin in his lap. 

           Scap’s thick accent comes out in manic bursts. The rest 
           of the team listens, engaged. Nods, smiles. Though just 
           below the surface sits an unspoken tension, a fear of 
           imminent violence.

                                 SCAP
                        This whole war. It’s just history feckin’ 
                        repeating herself. Lookit the yanks during 
                        the revolution, right. They got English 
                        soldiers marching up the streets. 
                        Protestors gettin’ their heads blown off. 
                        And who’s Washington, Jefferson, any o’ 
                        these oul fellas? Just a buncha poor 
                        colonists, same as us. Tired of gettin’ 
                        fistfucked by the Crown, decidin’ to fight 
                        back. 
                                 (then)
                        And ye call us terrorists? All of 
                        Yankdom’s founded by feckin’ terrorists.

           Gracie smiles.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Sorry to interrupt. Scap, this is Kevin 
                        Fulton. Kevin, Freddie Scapa. 

                                 SCAP
                        Howyeh.

           Fulton nods, sits. Scap leans in, whispers.

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Alastair says ya been usin’ some shite 
                        camera triggers? That so?

                                 FULTON
                                 (annoyed)
                        I wouldn’t call ‘em shite. I built those 
                        triggers meself.

                                 SCAP
                        Sure. Listen. I know a shop. You’ll go 
                        down there tomorrow. They’ve somethin’ ya 
                        can’t find in Ulster. 

                                 FULTON 
                        Why don’t we send Conor? I’d like him to--

                                 SCAP
                        Don’t be a pain in me hole, mate. Just do 
                        as yer told.  
           Fulton’s anger flares up. Scap turns to Gracie, subtly 
           turning his back on Fulton. Fulton’s had enough.  

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Like I say. Only difference ‘tween us and 
                        the yanks is we ain’t won the war yet-- 

                                 FULTON 
                                 (interrupting)
                        Wait. Scapa. You ain’t related to Mikey 
                        Scapa, are ya?

           Scap stiffens visibly. A beat. 

                                 SCAP
                        Ya knew Mikey so?

           Fulton glances around to make sure none of the other 
           tables can hear him. 

                                 FULTON
                        Ran into him in prison. Bombmaker right?

           Scap nods.

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        I heard a funny story about Mikey. Not 
                        sure if I believe it or not. Actually, 
                        you could probably shed some light.

           Liam and Alastair exchange a nervous look. A beat. 

                                 SCAP
                        Reckon I could. 

           Everyone starts gradually LOOKING AWAY as Fulton talks. 
           Scap stares at Fulton, stone-faced.

                                 FULTON 
                        Heard back in eighty-one, Mikey’s in a 
                        barn with this other bomber. Young fella. 
                        Two days they’re in there, grinding down 
                        fertilizer. Reckon the smell must of got 
                        to ‘em or something, because right as 
                        they’re about finished, the two of ‘em 
                        start goin’ at it. Ya imagine? Two hard RA 
                        boys shagging in the middle of this barn? 
                        Now Mikey, he’s got a wife and kids at 
                        home. Guess he thinks shaggin’ this fella 
                        feels better than shaggin’ his wife. Up 
                        and leaves ‘em. Moves in with this fella. 
                        Meanwhile the bomb goes off, kills a few 
                        English. Poor Mikey, he tells this cunt 
                        everything. Who ordered the bomb, who did 
                        the planning. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FULTON  (CONT'D)
                        Long story short, turns out this other 
                        fella’s a feckin’ tout. So not only is 
                        poor Mikey going to prison for spilling 
                        his guts to a spy, now everybody in H-
                        Blocks knows he’s a poof.  
                                 (turns to Scap)
                        But like I say. Just something I heard.

           A pall has fallen over the table. Everyone looks away. 
           Scap has NO VISIBLE REACTION. He looks perfectly calm. 

           WAITERS appear. A server puts a plate of eggs in front of 
           Scap. Without a word, Scap puts his napkin back on the 
           table, and walks off. 

           Fulton glances at a menu, snaps to a waiter.

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        The feckin’ eggs Benedict. 

           INT. BATHROOM, RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Two stalls. Scap enters, locks the door. He stares in the 
           mirror, an odd look in his eye. Not anger exactly, just 
           intense focus. 

           He rolls up his sleeves, revealing muscular forearms 
           covered in tattoos. 

           Scap begins mechanically washing his hands.

           INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY, RESTAURANT - DAY

           Outside, a STIFF LAWYER knocks on the bathroom door. No 
           answer. He waits a moment, knocks again. 

                                 STIFF LAWYER
                        Hello?

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Fifteen minutes later. Waiters refill water. Fulton’s 
           carving up his eggs, chewing big bites. Hushed tones.  

                                 ALASTAIR
                        ...well maybe he’s got a point. The 
                        camera cost us the last two jobs. 

           Gracie eyes Scap’s meal, now cold. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Ya think he’s alright?

                                 FULTON 
                        Ask a question, the boy hides in the 
                        jacks. Feck we supposed to do with that? 
           Gracie looks nonplussed. Fulton leans in, whispers.

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        Alastair. Who’s the fella we’re sendin’ 
                        down a hole?

                                 ALASTAIR
                                 (whispers)
                        There’s a man in the ballroom. Cavanaugh. 
                        Runs some big defense contractor. 

                                 FULTON
                        Aye. When are we doin’ him? 

                                 ALASTAIR
                        No--Cavanaugh ain’t the target. He’s the 
                        one payin’ for breakfast.

           INT. BATHROOM, RESTAURANT - DAY 

           Scap pisses at the toilet. He’s MUTTERING something 
           indistinguishable to himself. Loud knocks on the door.   

                                 STIFF LAWYER (O.S.)
                        Sir, I saw you go in there. For 
                        Chrissake, there are two stalls! 

           Scap stares at the wall. He’s concentrating extremely 
           hard on something, like he’s deciding what to do with 
           Fulton.

           INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY

                                 STIFF LAWYER
                        Listen, asshole. I don’t know who you--

           The door swings open. Scap stands in the doorway with a 
           big SMILE on his face. The scowling lawyer looks down, 
           takes a step back. His anger deflates in an instant.

                                 LAWYER 
                        What the fuck--

           Scap, smiling wide, has his dick out and is freely 
           PISSING on the lawyer’s loafers. 

           INT. FOYER, RESTAURANT - DAY 

           Everyone puts on coats, confused as Scap appears beside 
           them like nothing’s happened. He walks calmly to the 
           door, refusing to look at Fulton. 

                                 GRACIE 
                        Everythin’ alright?
                                 SCAP
                        Grand. Conor, fetch the van. 

           Conor glances over his shoulder. Behind them, a group of 
           WAITERS all race towards the bathroom. 

           EXT. ALGONQUIN HOTEL - DAY

           A BLACK TOWNCAR parked across the street watches as well-
           dressed couples from the fundraiser mill about, waiting 
           for cars. Cavanaugh shakes hands with everyone, smiles.

           Scap and the team slip through the crowd. 

           INT. TOWNCAR - DAY 

           CHILDS dials a number on his phone. He watches Fulton 
           pull out his cell, check the caller ID, hang up. Childs 
           hits redial. Fulton doesn’t answer.

           EXT. BRYANT PARK - DAY 

           Dead trees covered in snow. A few scattered families. The 
           IRA van waits by a stone walkway. 

           A LIMO pulls up, the rear door opens. Scap and Fulton 
           step out of the van.

           INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY 

           Driving uptown. Scap and Fulton sit across from 
           Cavanaugh. Here, Cavanaugh’s accent subtly rolls up and 
           down like he’s trying to sound a bit more Irish. 

           Scap won’t acknowledge Fulton. Not even a glance. 

                                 CAVANAUGH
                        Will Cavanaugh. 
                                 (shakes Scap’s hand)
                        You must be Mr. Scapa. We’ve heard 
                        nothing but good things.

                                 SCAP
                        Fine to meet ya.  

           Fulton extends a hand. Cavanaugh shakes it, almost as an 
           afterthought. His eyes stay on Scap.

                                 CAVANAUGH
                        Darcy mentioned you’re from Enniskillen? 
                        I went to Holy Trinity.     

                                 SCAP
                        Yer jokin’ me. Where’d ya go to secondary? 
                                 CAVANAUGH
                                 (quickly becoming sheepish)
                        Actually, my old man moved us here when I 
                        was seven. Think he was sick of getting 
                        his balls shot off by the Proddies.

           Scap’s smile fades. Cavanaugh isn’t Irish enough to say 
           ‘Proddies’. 

                                 FULTON
                        Well, from the looks of it, ya haven’t done 
                        too poorly. Saw you in the ballroom, had 
                        that lot wrapped ‘round yer wee finger.

           Cavanaugh seems annoyed that Fulton is speaking to him.

                                 CAVANAUGH
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your name? 

                                 FULTON
                        Kevin Fulton.

                                 CAVANAUGH
                        Don’t get the wrong idea, Mr. Fulton. I 
                        meant what I said in there. The way I see 
                        it, you and I are fighting imperialism. 
                        Seems a far cry from some raghead 
                        strapping a bomb to his chest. 

                                 FULTON 
                                 (with a smile)
                        Aye. You and I’d rather find a nice 
                        Protestant boy. Strap it to him. 

           Cavanaugh chuckles, uncomfortable. Scap stares out the 
           window, unsmiling.

           INT. HALLWAYS, CAVANAUGH’S PENTHOUSE - DAY

           Sprawling but short on taste, the penthouse is a pantheon 
           to Cavanaugh’s Irish heritage. Walls lined with football 
           jerseys, photos.

           Cavanaugh leads them down the hall. Scap eyes a photo of 
           Cavanaugh on the golf course with George H.W. Bush. He 
           whistles, impressed.  

           They arrive at an oak door. Cavanaugh holds it open for 
           Scap, nervously steps in the way before Fulton can enter. 

                                 CAVANAUGH 
                        No disrespect. I was told I’d only be 
                        dealing with Mr. Scapa. 

           Fulton nods, uncomfortable. He waits outside. 
           INT. STUDY, PENTHOUSE - DAY 

           Lined with books. Oriental rugs, club chairs. Cavanaugh 
           notices Scap eyeing a mason jar behind the bar. 

                                 CAVANAUGH
                        You care for some Poteen? I’ve an aunt in 
                        Cork, makes it for me in an old 
                        chamberpot. Knock the piss outta you.  

                                 SCAP
                        I’ll have a gargle. Cheers.

           Cavanaugh pulls down the mason jar, pours a glass. 

                                 CAVANAUGH
                        You mind drinking alone? Little early for 
                        me.  

                                 SCAP
                        No.

           Scap takes his glass, drinks. 

                                 CAVANAUGH 
                        Sit. Sit. I don’t know how much Darcy 
                        told you about what I do... 

           Scap sits ramrod straight at the desk, finishes the 
           Poteen. Cavanaugh spins the combination on a wall safe. 

                                 SCAP
                        He said you did a bit o’ work for NORAID. 
                        Fundraisin’ and that.

           INT. HALLWAY, PENTHOUSE - DAY 

           Fulton can hear muffled voices. He’s missing everything. 
           His ears perk up at a sound: the FRONT DOOR opening. 

           INT. KITCHEN, PENTHOUSE - DAY 

           MRS. MOIRA CAVANAUGH scoops a bowl of ice cream for her 
           son CASEY (10). He’s playing a Game Boy. She’s lovely, 
           looks a bit like Fiona. 

                                 MOIRA CAVANAUGH 
                        I’ll see you Wednesday, sweetheart. Make 
                        sure daddy drops you off on time, okay?  

           The boy nods, not paying attention. Mrs. Cavanaugh looks 
           up, startled to see Fulton. 

                                 MOIRA CAVANAUGH (CONT'D)
                        Oh--excuse me. Moira Cavanaugh. 
                                 FULTON
                        Kevin Fulton. Lovely to meet ya.

           Fulton bends down to say hi to Casey. He doesn’t notice 
           Moira’s face screw up the moment she hears his accent. 

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        What’s that ya got there, son?

                                 MOIRA CAVANAUGH
                                 (sharp)
                        Casey. Go to the living room. 

           Casey runs off. Mrs. Cavanaugh produces a choleric smile. 

                                 MOIRA CAVANAUGH (CONT'D)
                        And I suppose you’re just another friend 
                        from out of town?

           Before Fulton can respond, she storms off, leaving the 
           ice cream carton sitting on the counter.  

           INT. STUDY, PENTHOUSE - DAY 

           Cavanaugh pulls a MANILA ENVELOPE out of the safe. 

                                 CAVANAUGH 
                        The problem is that a good chunk of your 
                        funding comes from passing the hat at 
                        O’Leary’s pub in Poughkeepsie or wherever 
                        the fuck. Means we have to keep the 
                        national office here, plus regional 
                        offices in Boston, Chicago...combine that 
                        with everything I skim off Meyer, it gets 
                        to be a helluva lot to keep track of. 

           He hands Scap the manila envelope.

                                 CAVANAUGH (CONT'D)
                        His name is Finch. 

           Scap opens the envelope. THREE PHOTOGRAPHS: A gaunt,      
           SALLOW-FACED MAN (40’s) skittering into a ratty MOTEL.

           INT. IRA VAN - DAY

           Conor drives. Scap sits shotgun, holds the envelope. 

                                 SCAP
                        All o’ yis know the drill. Liam, Alastair. 
                        You report to my room for first briefing. 

           Liam and Alastair nod. Fulton watches, frustrated, as 
           Scap puts away the manila envelope. 
           EXT. BEST WESTERN - DAY 

           The team walks in. Fulton takes Scap’s ear. Whispers. 

                                 FULTON 
                        Oi. Mate. Who’s the target? 

                                 SCAP
                        Easy now. I’ll brief ye after Gracie. 

           Fulton waits a moment until everyone else is inside. 

                                 FULTON
                        Look, I’m sorry for that shite about 
                        Mikey. Outta line, it was. You gotta 
                        understand I’m not used to takin’ orders.   

                                 SCAP 
                        I can see that. All ya need to know is 
                        his name is Finch. He’s some low-level 
                        bookkeeper workin’ for Cavanaugh, skimmed 
                        off almost five million intended for us.

                                 FULTON
                        Much appreciated.

           Scap turns around, walks back towards the street.

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        You’re not coming up? 

                                 SCAP
                        Left somethin’ in the van.

           INT. FULTON’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY 

           Fulton sits down on the bed in front of the mirror. He 
           pulls out his cell, starts dialing. Childs picks up.

                                 CHILDS (O.S.)
                        We need to talk. Scap’s not--  

           Click. Fulton instantly HANGS UP. An odd reflex. He keeps 
           staring at himself in the mirror. At the LAPEL on his 
           jacket. It’s still not sitting right. He stands. 

           Fulton starts patting down his jacket, staring at 
           himself. He whips off the jacket, pats the sleeves, hands 
           moving faster. He throws open the closet, reaches in his 
           suitcase, pulls out a pocket knife. 

           He starts SLASHING at the lining of the suit, shredding 
           it to ribbons. He yanks something out of the lining. 

           It’s a tiny microphone and wire. Scap’s bugged him. 
           Fulton stands in front of the mirror, barely able to 
           control his rage. He starts taking off his belt. 

           INT. IRA VAN - DAY

           Parked down the street. Scap crouches in the backseat, 
           cigarette to his lips. He casually scans a newspaper 
           while he listens to Fulton on large headphones. A small 
           TAPE RECORDER next to him. 

           THROUGH THE HEADPHONES: various SOUNDS. Fulton’s soft 
           footsteps. People talking, laughing. DING! An elevator 
           door opening. A long silence. Then loud noises, people 
           coming and going. Fulton’s in the lobby. 

           Scap puts down the newspaper, listens close. We see he 
           was looking at pictures of ratty women, escorts.

           From outside the van comes the sound of a CABBIE HONKING. 
           Scap listens, hears the honking through the headphones.  

           Fulton’s right outside. Scap looks up, confused. Suddenly 
           the van doors BURST OPEN. 

           FULTON stands in the doorway, eyes blazing. He holds his 
           belt in one hand, the wire in the other. 

                                 SCAP
                        The feck are ye--

           Fulton yanks Scap out of the van. The cigarette falls out 
           of Scap’s mouth as... 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           CRACK! Fulton PUNCHES Scap hard in the jaw, drops him.

           Instantly Fulton’s on top of him, WHIPPING Scap over and 
           over with the belt. Scap throws his hands up, but it’s no 
           use. Fulton’s possessed. 

                                 FULTON
                        Fecking gobshite! Fecking culchie! When 
                        Darcy finds out about this, he’ll send 
                        you back to Eniskillin so feckin’ fast--    

           PASSERSBY start turning their heads. Eventually Scap lies 
           still. 

           Adrenaline pumping, Fulton throws the microphone down, 
           crushes it with his heel. He starts walking away, 
           satisfied. He looks up, sees Conor and Alastair watching 
           by the hotel. 
                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        Aw shite. Boys, g’wan inside! This is 
                        ‘tween me and--

           IN THE NEXT INSTANT: 

           Scap lifts Fulton clean off his feet, slams his face 
           through the window of a parked car. The car alarm starts 
           BLARING. More heads turn. Blood starts pouring down 
           Fulton’s face in sheets.

           Scap yanks Fulton out through the car window and KICKS 
           him once, tremendously hard with the steel toe of his 
           boot, right in the groin. Fulton drops to the gutter, 
           clutches his stomach, and THROWS UP.

           Scap plucks his still-lit cigarette off the ground, rolls 
           Fulton over, kneels down on Fulton’s chest. Fulton looks 
           up at him, terrified.

                                 SCAP
                                 (whispers)
                        G’wan and tell Darcy whatever ya please. 
                        He’s the one gave me the order. But 
                        mention me family again, boyo--

           Scap takes a drag, stubs the butt out on Fulton’s cheek. 

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        And next time I’ll burst ya proper. 

           Fulton screams. The car alarm blares. Scap picks up his 
           newspaper and walks away. 

           Alastair and Conor can’t look at Fulton. They scurry back 
           inside the motel. 

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

           Industrial. Lower West Side. A van chugs up the ramp, 
           parks next to a black towncar.

           INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT

           Childs sits in the driver’s seat. A briefcase and laptop 
           next to him. Fulton opens the door, looks over his 
           shoulder, enters. He’s cleaned himself up. There’s a 
           bandage above his eye, a black burn on his cheek.  

           Childs lifts up Fulton’s bandage. The cut’s nasty.

                                 CHILDS
                        Christ. You’re going to need stitches.

           Fulton pushes his hand away. 
                                 FULTON
                        Childs, who is this guy? He’s a bleedin’ 
                        mentaller. 

                                 CHILDS 
                        Next time pick up your phone. I had  
                        headquarters do a bit of digging. 

           Child hands Fulton a laptop. A low-res IMAGE on the 
           screen. Fulton stares, color draining from his cheeks. 

                                 FULTON
                        Scap did this?  

           The image: naked bodies by the roadside. Faces splayed 
           open, arms bent backwards.

                                 CHILDS 
                        We’re still collecting data. So far we 
                        believe there are seven. 

           Fulton scrolls through the photos. Each picture is more 
           gruesome than the last. 

                                 FULTON
                        Jaysus. I knew this one. Sean O’Bannon.

                                 CHILDS
                        He was one of ours. They all were. 

                                 FULTON
                        You’re joking me. O’Bannon was a tout? 

                                 CHILDS
                        You didn’t hear that from me. 
                                 (then)
                        You’re familiar with the Nutting Squad?

                                 FULTON 
                        Aye. Internal security boys. 

                                 CHILDS
                        Headquarters believes Scapa joined their 
                        ranks sometime in the last year. He’s 
                        been assigned to work with you--

                                 FULTON 
                                 (grim)
                        Because Darcy knows I’m a tout. 

           Childs starts the car.

                                 CHILDS
                        He’s a bloody spyhunter, Kevin. Best in 
                        the game. 
           INT. SCAP’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Scap’s newspaper sits folded by the tv. 

           In bed, Scap fucks one of the ESCORTS. She’s whisper-
           thin, her back is splotched with acne. In contrast to 
           Fulton and Fiona’s tender lovemaking, the act here is 
           primal, ugly. 

           Scap’s standing behind her, pounding away silently, his 
           eyes joyless and flat. Her face is mashed down into the 
           pillow. She lets out muffled, guttural grunts.

           Scap doesn’t look at the girl. He doesn’t even seem to be 
           present in the room, instead he just stares at his 
           reflection in the mirror. 

                                 CHILDS (V.O.)
                        What’s bloody frightening is that out of 
                        the twelve he’s killed, only seven were 
                        actually spies. The other five confessed 
                        to spying just to stop the interrogation.  

           Notched with cuts from Fulton’s belt and covered in 
           tattoos, Scap looks like a demon.  

           INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT 

           Moving up through Chelsea. Childs hands Fulton a folder 
           from the briefcase. Fulton takes it, anxious as hell.

                                 CHILDS
                        I’ve prepped a file on him. Maybe there’s 
                        something we can use. You can bet Darcy 
                        sent him a file on you as well. 

                                 FULTON 
                        Is it too late to pull me out? 

                                 CHILDS
                        Run now, they’ll know you’re a spy. Best 
                        scenario, just do the job and walk away. 
                        The Army Council has no reason to suspect 
                        you.

                                 FULTON 
                        What about the target? This fella Finch. 

                                 CHILDS
                        Headquarters has granted you permission
                        to go ahead with the job.

           Fulton stares out the window, watches families walking up 
           and down the river. His eyes glaze over.
                                 CHILDS (CONT'D)
                        I know you don’t fancy it, Kevin. But a 
                        successful kill is the only way we can 
                        bolster your cover. 

           INT. SCAP’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT  

           Two glasses of Scotch on the nightstand.

           Scap stands in the doorway with the girl. We see now 
           she’s very young, unattractive. She eyes Scap’s tattooed 
           chest, a bit frightened. It’s clear she doesn’t want to 
           stick around. 

           Scap peels a fifty off a roll of bills, whispers 
           something in her ear. She hesitates, nods. He hands her 
           another fifty, and she exits. 

           Scap sits alone on the corner of the bed, slick with 
           sweat. He eyes the two glasses of Scotch for a moment.

           Then quickly downs them both.

           INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT

           Childs and Fulton keep driving uptown.  

                                 FULTON
                        Do me a favor? Poke around. Find out 
                        about Finch.

                                 CHILDS
                        You said he was just some bookkeeper. 

                                 FULTON
                        Just--tell me he doesn’t have a family. Tell 
                        me he’s a feckin’ murderer or something.

           INT. SCAP’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Scap stares at the closet, stands. He turns on the 
           television. A baseball game plays. 

           Scap keeps turning up the volume until the television is 
           deafening. He opens his suitcase, pulls out a small STEEL 
           CASE.   

           Inside: a microphone, wire, a hand-drill. He crouches 
           down in the closet and begins drilling through the wall. 

           The blaring baseball game covers up all the noise.

           After he’s finished, Scap takes out the wire and 
           microphone, slides it through the hole in the wall. 
           INT. CLOSET, FULTON’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           The mic pokes into fulton’s closet, nearly invisible. 

           INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT

           Parked in an alleyway. Fulton opens the door, starts to 
           get out. He looks desperate. 

                                 FULTON 
                        Please, mate. If I ain’t savin’ lives, 
                        I’m just some gobshite terrorist who lies 
                        to his wife.

           Fulton stuffs Scap’s file under his coat, trots off.

                                 CHILDS
                        Kevin. You’re saving your own.

           Fulton doesn’t respond. 

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           There’s a tremor in Fulton hand as he opens the door of 
           his room. He hears laughter down the hall, looks up. 

           He spots Scap’s escort leaving Conor’s room.  

           Conor has an embarrassed, boyish grin on his face. He 
           pecks the girl on the cheek. 

           Fulton quickly scurries back into his room. 

           INT. FULTON’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

           Fulton can hear Scap’s TV playing quietly through the 
           paper thin walls. 

           Fulton crouches against the far wall, flips through 
           SCAP’S FILE. It’s a sad, violent history, made up of 
           photos, clippings, intelligence briefings: 

           Old pictures of Scap with his brother, Mikey. They’re in 
           football jerseys, grinning. At church. 

           Clippings: ‘Terrorist Mikey Scapa Sentenced to Ten 
           Years’, ‘Inmate, Scapa Slain in Cell’.

           After that, the photos quickly turn violent. Scap in a 
           riot, a brick in his hand. Bricks become pistols, rifles. 
           Photos of bombed-out churches. Body bags. 

           Fulton finishes the file, throws the pages in a trashcan. 
           He eyes them for a moment. Paranoid, he pulls a lighter 
           from his suitcase, begins burning the pages. 
           Hands trembling, he picks up his cell, starts to dial. 

           INT. MUSIC SCHOOL, BELFAST - DAY 

           Fiona sits on a piano bench with a TEENAGE BOY. He’s 
           playing Bach. She closes her eyes, listens, happy.

           A knock. Another MUSIC TEACHER enters. The boy stops.

                                 MUSIC TEACHER
                        Phone for you. Says it’s an emergency. 

           INT. MUSIC SCHOOL, FIONA’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Messy stacks of CD’s, songbooks. Fiona answers the phone. 

                                 FIONA
                        ‘Lo?

           INTERCUT Fulton, crouched against the wall, frightened.

                                 FULTON
                        Hey, love.

           She doesn’t say anything. As Fulton talks, he comes 
           closer and closer to tears. 

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        I know. Ya don’t have to say nothing. I 
                        just--I just wanted you to know how much 
                        I love ya. And if I haven’t been straight 
                        about a few things...you gotta trust me 
                        that it’s for your own good. Will you do 
                        that, love? Will ya please just trust me 
                        on this? 

                                 FIONA
                                 (soft)
                        I just wanna know me husband, Kevin. 

           INT. SCAP’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Scap perches next to the closet, wearing headphones, 
           listening in on Fulton’s conversation. 

                                 FULTON (O.S.)
                        No. Ya don’t. 

           In Scap’s lap is a MANILA FOLDER, a file on Fulton. He 
           stares down impassive at an ancient photo, taken when 
           Fulton was still in his teens. 

           Fulton’s dressed in black, at a funeral. 

                                                               FADE OUT.
           EXT. SKYLINE MOTEL, BROOKLYN - SUNSET

           The squalid motel from Finch’s photo. Families bustle up 
           the street. A WHITE VAN parked down the way. 

           INT. ALASTAIR’S VAN - SUNSET

           Alastair sits with Liam, eyes the motel. Liam pisses into 
           an empty whiskey bottle. A photo of Finch on the dash. 

                                 ALASTAIR
                                 (hushed)
                        I’m just sayin’ it explains why the Brits 
                        have been three steps ahead lately.

                                 LIAM
                        What do they reckon he is then? MI-6? 

                                 ALASTAIR 
                        Not sure. All I know is he had a bleedin’ 
                        wire in his hand. 
                                 (a bit bitter)
                        If it’s true, it explains too him doin’    
                        feck-all to save Dean. 

           Liam finishes pissing, puts the whiskey bottle outside. 

                                 LIAM
                        I dunno. You and Gracie can think what 
                        ya like. I’ve seen Kevin do his share o’ 
                        nasty shite over the years. Not sure I 
                        buy him as a tout.  

           Alastair’s radio chirps. 

                                 SCAP (O.S.)
                        D’ya have a visual?

           Alastair eyes the motel. Still no sign of Finch. 

           EXT. O’BRADY AUTO BODY - SUNSET

           Industrial. Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn. An Irish-owned lot 
           full of chopped cars. MECHANICS in a garage. Gracie loads 
           a crate of EXPLOSIVES into a van. Conor loads ammo into 
           pistols. 

           Scap paces, a manic general, clutching a radio. 

                                 ALASTAIR (O.S.)
                        Still nothin’.

                                 SCAP
                        Keep an eye out. We’re nearly finished 
                        here. 
           Scap spots Fulton approach in another van. He motions to 
           Gracie, takes her ear.

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Gracie. Wanted ya to know, I heard what 
                        happened to your boyfriend.

           Gracie eyes Fulton scornfully as he exits the van. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Fiancé. 

                                 SCAP 
                        Aw Jaysus, love. Real sorry, I am. If 
                        there’s ever anything I can do for ya...

                                 GRACIE
                        Thank you. That means a lot.

           Scap notices Gracie watching Fulton approach.

                                 SCAP 
                                 (whispers)
                        Don’t worry. He won’t be around much 
                        longer.  

           Gracie nods, returns to her post. Glancing at the bandage 
           above Fulton’s eye, she hides a SMILE. 

           Fulton begrudgingly hands Scap two bags marked WINSTON 
           VIDEO. 

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Cheers.

           Scap moves to a table, opens the bags. They’re full of 
           VIDEO EQUIPMENT. Electronic receivers, remote controls. 
           He grabs Conor.

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Oi. Dirty Harry. Ever seen these before? 

           Conor shakes his head.

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Well then listen up. ‘Cause you got the 
                        most important job of all today. 

           Scap moves Conor into a corner, away from Fulton. He 
           takes shows Conor how to connect the trigger wires.  

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Infrared, these beauties. No more feckin’ 
                        about with cameras, radios that don’t 
                        work. Change the whole game, they will.     
                                 (MORE)
                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                                 (finishes attaching wires)
                        Do us a favor and load these into the 
                        van. Ye can ride with me today. 

                                 CONOR
                        Aye, sir. 

           Scap moves towards the van. 

                                 CONOR (CONT'D)
                        Wait. Sir. How much do I owe ya? For the 
                        bird last night. 

                                 SCAP 
                        Aw, don’t worry about that. Gotta make a 
                        man o’ ya somehow. 

           Scap stuffs a .357 under Conor’s belt, trots off towards 
           the van. He calls out over his shoulder. 

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        And stop calling me ‘sir’. Sounds like ya 
                        got a bug up yer arse. 

           Conor smiles. Fulton looks away, pissed. 

           INT. O’BRADY BODY SHOP, GARAGE - NIGHT

           Scap enters the garage. He’s holding a small brown 
           PACKAGE under one arm, speaks to a MECHANIC.  

                                 SCAP
                        Mate. Ya got a mailbox ‘round here? Gotta 
                        send me girl a wee something. 

           INT. ALASTAIR’S VAN - NIGHT

           The sun’s going down, the sky is turning black. Alastair 
           watches a few people exit the motel. 

           A rented black FORD EXPLORER pulls up. It looks just a 
           little out of place.   

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Hello, love. 

           A tall BLONDE MAN exits the SUV. He’s wide as an oak, 
           wears a white collared shirt. Clearly muscle. The 
           explorer idles. 

                                 LIAM
                                 (nervous)
                        Bit big, ain’t he?

           As the Blonde walks into the motel, Alastair reaches in 
           the backseat, starts unpacking his rifle from its case. 
           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Scap moves quickly down the street, towards a postal drop 
           box. He carries the small brown package in his hands. 

           It’s marked: ‘Aislin McCormick. 81 Ashgrove Rd. 
           Eniskillen. Ireland.’ There’s no return address.

           Scap opens the mailbox. He glances down at the package 
           briefly, deciding whether or not to send it. 

           For just a moment, an odd, almost sad look flits across 
           Scap’s face. As if sending the package is something he 
           cares deeply about. 

           His radio chirps.

                                 ALASTAIR (O.S.)
                        We’ve got movement here.

           Quickly he dumps the package into the mailbox, yanks up 
           his radio. He starts running back towards the body shop. 

                                 SCAP
                        Has he a bag, a briefcase with him? 

           EXT. SKYLINE MOTEL - NIGHT

           Alastair and Liam watch as the Blonde exits the motel 
           with FINCH in his shadow. The bookkeeper carries a TAN 
           DUFFEL BAG. 

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Aye. And he’s got company, too. The yank 
                        say anythin’ about security?

           INT. O'BRADY AUTO BODY - NIGHT

           Fulton stands with Conor and Gracie. A radio in his hand.

                                 FULTON
                        How many guys? 

           Scap comes out of the garage, cuts him off. 

                                 SCAP
                        D’ya have a clean shot?

           INT. ALASTAIR’S VAN - NIGHT 

           Alastair looks up and down the street, spots A POLICE CAR 
           at the end of the block.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Negative.
                                 SCAP (O.S.)
                        We’re on our way. 

           Alastair squints, eyes the Blonde entering the Explorer. 

                                 ALASTAIR 
                        That big fellah. He look familiar to ye? 

           EXT. O'BRADY AUTO BODY, LOADING DOCK - NIGHT

           Scap tosses his keys to Conor. 

                                 SCAP
                        Let’s go, son. 

           Fulton catches the keys, tosses them back to Scap. 

                                 FULTON
                        Conor rides with me. 

           A terse look from Scap. Fulton won’t back down. 

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        I’m not askin’ you for permission. 

           Fulton watches crestfallen as Conor looks to Scap for 
           confirmation. Scap nods. 

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 

           Perched seven stories above the IRA, Childs sits in his 
           towncar with binoculars. He watches the IRA load a crate 
           into Fulton’s van, flood out of the body shop.

           EXT. STREETS, BROOKLYN - NIGHT

           Finch’s Explorer weaves through traffic. He’s heading 
           east towards a greener neighborhood. 

           A WHITE VAN trails two car lengths behind.

                                 ALASTAIR (O.S.)
                        He’s headed East on Flushing.

           INT. SCAP’S VAN - NIGH

           Scap tears through lots. One hand on the wheel, one hand 
           clutching a radio. A crate of explosives in the back. 

                                 SCAP
                        Be there in five. 
           INT. FULTON’S VAN - NIGHT

           Conor follows Scap. Fulton sits shotgun, eyes Conor 
           anxiously biting his lower lip.

                                 FULTON
                        Pull over. 

           INT. SCAP’S VAN - NIGHT

           Scap eyes the REARVIEW MIRROR. 

                                 SCAP
                        What’s this shite?

           Behind him, Fulton’s van PEELS OFF into the alleyway. 

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - NIGHT

           Idling. Fulton reaches over, thrusts open Conor’s door. 

                                 FULTON
                        Listen to me. I want ya to walk away.

                                 CONOR
                        Wha’? Sir, if this is about Scap-- 

                                 FULTON
                        Scap’s only half of it. There’s something 
                        I been wantin’ to tell ya--I’m not--
                        everything we’re doin’ with the Army-- 

                                 CONOR
                        Sir?

           Fulton struggles to tell Conor he’s a spy. He can’t. 

                                 FULTON
                        You just ain’t cut out for this shite, 
                        lad. After seein’ ya in Gibraltar, I 
                        never shoulda let you take another job. 

                                 CONOR
                                 (crushed)
                        Why--Why are you telling me this now? 

                                 FULTON
                        I made a mistake. I’m sorry. Now get 
                        outta the feckin’ car. 

                                 CONOR
                        Reckon I made a mistake... 

           Conor closes his door, throws the van into drive.  
                                 CONOR (CONT'D)
                        I should of ridden with Scap. 
                                 (into radio)
                        Heading East to Flushing. 

           Fulton stares out the window, ashamed. 

           EXT. REDDING AIRFIELD - NIGHT 

           Finch’s SUV glides past a gate marked ‘REDDING AIRFIELD. 
           PRIVATE.’ It heads down a stretch of blacktop towards a 
           cluster of dimly lit aviation buildings. Beyond them are 
           hangars, a few private jets, a thin strip of tarmac. The 
           airfield is flanked by fields of weeds, fences. 

           Finch’s SUV disappears behind the buildings. 

           INT. ALASTAIR’S VAN - NIGHT

           Rolling up to a fence on one side of the airfield.

           ALASTAIR’S POV - RIFLE SCOPE

           Alastair can see a small TURBOPROP PLANE on the tarmac, 
           engine whirring. Finch’s SUV glides towards it. 

                                 ALASTAIR
                                 (into radio)
                        He’s goin’ for a plane. We gotta hit him 
                        now!

           INT. SCAP’S VAN - NIGHT

           Scap drives right through the gate towards the airfield. 

                                 SCAP
                                 (into radio)
                        Box him in. Conor, take the arse.

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           Fulton’s van screeches to a fence on the other side of 
           the airfield. Doors open. Fulton and Conor throw on 
           balaclavas, cock pistols. 

           They hop the fence, start racing through the tall weeds 
           towards the tarmac. 

           EXT. AVIATION BUILDINGS - NIGHT 

           Scap’s van stops behind the buildings. Scap hops out, 
           opens the trunk. He rips opens a crate of explosives, 
           sets up a receiver. A red light glows. 
           Scap pulls out a tiny black REMOTE, throws a balaclava 
           over his face. 

           EXT. TARMAC - NIGHT

           The WHIR of the turboprop engine drowns out all sound. 
           Finch’s Explorer pulls up, stops twenty yards away.  

           The door of the plane opens, SIX MEN filter out. They’re 
           clean cut, well-dressed. A nervous energy. Eyes peering 
           into the dark. Hands lingering inside coats. They can’t 
           see anything past the hangers and fields.

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           Fulton and Conor wait behind a hangar, masks on. Fulton 
           watches the tarmac through binoculars.  

           FULTON’S POV - BINOCULARS

           At last FINCH pokes his head out of the Explorer, duffel 
           bag in hand. The other men greet him, shake hands, talk. 

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 FULTON
                                 (into radio)
                        This doesn’t feel right. There’s too many 
                        of them.

                                 SCAP (O.S.)
                                 (ignoring him)
                        We’re running silent. Wait for my signal. 

           EXT. TARMAC - NIGHT 

           The plane’s engine whirs as Finch and his men begin to 
           move towards the plane in a slow procession. 

           INT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT 

           Twenty four leather seats. Finch boards the plane first, 
           anxious. Men filter in around him and sit wordlessly. 

           INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

           THE PILOT flips switches, eyes the blackness beyond the 
           tarmac. A VOICE through his headphones. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Two-oh-one, you’re clear for takeoff. 

           The pilot squints. He spots a small BLACK SHAPE moving by 
           one of the hangers. It’s nearly invisible. 
           INT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT

           Everyone’s inside. The last man shuts the door behind 
           them. Finch looks off into the darkness, starting at last 
           to relax. Fingers loosening on the duffel bag. 

           The tall Blonde walks to the cockpit door, knocks. 

                                 BLONDE OAK
                        Clear. 

           The Blond returns to his seat. A long beat. The plane 
           doesn’t move. 

           Finch’s man stands again, walks to the cockpit door, 
           knocks. No answer. 

           He slowly opens the cockpit door... 

           INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

                                 BLONDE OAK
                        What in--

           Blood all over the controls. A tiny hole in the window. 

           The pilot lies facedown in his seat, shot through the 
           eye. A frantic voice through his headphones.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        There’s someone on the tarmac! Repeat, 
                        there’s someone--

           Instantly a WHITE VAN squeals up to the nose of the 
           plane, stops. The doors burst open, TWO MEN IN BALACLAVAS 
           race out, attach a SMALL DEVICE to the nose of the plane. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           The Blonde backpedals out of the cockpit, horrified. 

                                 BLONDE OAK
                        Shooter! Everyone d--

           CRACK! The front of the plane explodes in a massive gust 
           of flame. 

           Everything turns sideways. 

           The plane’s nose rips off, metal shredding, a tin can. 
           Finch and his men are hurled about like ragdolls, limbs 
           hammer against sidewalls.  
           A sickening noise outside. The rattle of GUNFIRE 
           building, coming from all sides. Windows begin to 
           shatter, one after another. 

           Finch lies on the floor, dazed, bleeding. He looks around 
           in horror, sees seats on fire, men screaming, pushing for 
           the exit door. Blood everywhere. 

           Finch pulls a pistol from his belt, starts crawling for 
           the door.

           EXT. TARMAC - NIGHT

           Men rush out of the plane, guns drawn, firing blind into 
           the dark. They all race for the SUV, trying to save 
           themselves.

           Finch pokes his head out, sees MEN IN BALACLAVAS on all 
           sides, firing on them from hangers, fields. They’re 
           surrounded. 

           Finch watches in horror as one by one his men crumple, 
           collapsing onto the tarmac in a pile. 

           Without a word, Finch starts running as fast as he can in 
           the other direction, towards the aviation buildings. A 
           bullet sinks into his arm. He cries out. 

           INT. AVIATION BUILDING, TERMINAL - NIGHT

           Unlit. Finch rushes in as--CRACK! A shower of sparks by 
           his head. 

           A MAN IN A BALACLAVA races in behind him, gun drawn, 
           fires. Finch darts down a hallway.   

           EXT. TARMAC - NIGHT

           Finch’s remaining men fire from the cover of the downed 
           plane. Off in a hangar, one of the IRA men stumbles and 
           FALLS, shot through the chest.  

           Finch’s last man spins like a top and collapses. 

           A lone IRA SHOOTER rushes for the plane. Legs pumping, a 
           pistol in each hand. 

           INT. AVIATION BUILDING, TERMINAL - NIGHT

           Finch’s tail reaches the other end of the short terminal. 
           No sign of the bookkeeper. 

           The mask comes off. It’s Fulton.
           Fulton looks around, spots an open door. A dark stairwell 
           leading down to a basement. He darts down the stairs. 

           INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT 

           A labyrinth of grimy stone corridors. Fulton pedals down 
           the stairs. FOOTSTEPS echoing faintly in the dark.

           Fulton begins to follow them...

           INT. AVIATION BUILDING, TERMINAL - NIGHT 

           One of FULTON’S TEAMMATES rushes in after him. Mask on, 
           gun drawn.  

           INT. PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT

           The plane is a mess of squirming, broken bodies. 

           The IRA shooter steps into the flaming cabin, mask on, 
           pistols outstretched. Sickeningly calm, he moves 
           methodically from body to body, shooting each downed man 
           twice in the face. 

           The last living man on the plane lies twitching, face 
           charred, next to Finch’s duffel bag. It’s the Blonde. 

           The shooter points a pistol, pulls the trigger--CLICK. 
           He’s out of rounds. 

                                 BLONDE OAK
                                 (wheezing)
                        --wait--

           Without a word, the shooter begins STOMPING down on the 
           Blonde’s skull. The heel of his boot turns the man’s face 
           into pulp. 

           Satisfied, the shooter grabs Finch’s duffel bag. He tears 
           it open, looks inside.

                                 SCAP
                        Feck me.

           INT. BOILER ROOM, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Fulton pads silently forward. He hears the footsteps 
           STOP, right around the corner... 

           INT. BOILER ROOM, CENTRAL CHAMBER - NIGHT 

           Steel heating ducts, tubing. Fulton enters slowly... 

           FINCH huddles behind a table. Not even a breath. He can 
           see Fulton’s outline in the dim light. 
           Silently Finch draws his pistol. 

           ON FULTON

           Turning his back to Finch, blind...

           ON FINCH

           Slowly standing, reaching out with the pistol...

           SZZZZ! Suddenly all the lights hiss on. 

           Fulton spots Finch’s shadow behind him--

           BANG! A shot rings out, echoing off the walls. A miss. 

           Fulton whirls--BANG! He fires back, reflex. Finch yelps, 
           falls to his knees, shot in the thigh. 

           Lights flicker above. Fulton steps forward, aims the 
           pistol. Finch, on his knees, puts his hands up. 

           Finally he speaks. 

                                 FINCH
                                 (thick Irish accent)
                        Please, mate--I know ya-- 

           The accent momentarily throws Fulton off. 

                                 FULTON
                        What?

                                 FINCH 
                        You’re a British agent. 

           INT. BOILER ROOM, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           FULTON’S TEAMMATE, hand on the transformer, races through 
           the dimly lit corridors. He can hear Finch crying out.

           INT. BOILER ROOM, CENTRAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

           Fulton points the gun, confused.

                                 FINCH
                        Please--please, mate!

           FULTON’S TEAMMATE rushes inside, gun drawn. He sees 
           Fulton pointing the gun. Sees Finch on his knees. 

           Fulton looks to his teammate. Back to Finch.

                                 FINCH (CONT'D)
                        Stakeknife-- 
           BANG! Fulton shoots Finch in the cheek. Finch coughs 
           once. Then slouches to the ground, dead. 

           Fulton’s teammate pulls off his mask. It’s CONOR.

           A long beat. 

                                 CONOR
                        They got Liam, sir. 

           Fulton nods.

                                 FULTON
                        Go fetch the car. 

           Conor nods, rushes off. Fulton looks down at the man he 
           just shot, crosses himself.  

           EXT. STREETS, BROOKLYN - NIGHT 

           A white van speeds back towards the city. 

           INT. IRA VAN - NIGHT

           Scap drives, silent. Conor sits shotgun, opens the duffel 
           bag. He pours everything out. 

                                 CONOR
                        Jaysus.

           Inside is a change of clothes and $2,400.

           Fulton sits in the middle seat. In the backseat, Liam’s 
           massive frame is sprawled across Gracie and Alastair’s 
           laps. Blood pours out his chest. He’s hyperventilating.

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Keep the pressure on. 

           Everything is slippery. Liam’s getting delirious. 

                                 LIAM
                        Allie? You’ll--come up with somethin’--

                                 ALASTAIR
                        What’s that?

                                 LIAM
                        To tell me boy.

                                 ALASTAIR
                                 (soft)
                        I will, mate. 
           Liam’s breath starts coming in quick gasps, faster and 
           faster. Then abruptly it stops. Gracie looks away.  

           Silence. Up front, Scap stares off into the dark.  

                                 SCAP
                        Who was he? Finch.

                                 FULTON
                        He was Irish. Sounded like Galway maybe. 

                                 SCAP
                        Spoke to ya, did he?  

                                 FULTON
                        Aye. Asked me not to shoot. 

           POLICE CARS scream past, head in the opposite direction. 

                                 CONOR
                        I--I heard something. 

                                 SCAP
                        Eh?

                                 CONOR
                        The target said ‘Stakeknife’. Just before 
                        Fulton did him.

           Scap glances in the rearview at Fulton. A curious look 
           that vanishes quickly. 

                                 SCAP
                        That true, Kevin? 

           Fulton shakes his head, stares out the window.

                                 FULTON
                        He was saying all kinds of shite. 

                                 SCAP
                        Don’t anybody worry about anything. I’ll 
                        sort it all out. 

           INT. FULTON’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Fulton walks in, nerves frayed. He grabs his cell, starts 
           to dial. He eyes his reflection in the mirror. He looks 
           like death. Bandaged, bags under his eyes. 

           Again he starts patting down his coat, looking for some 
           invisible wire. He tears it off. He strips down to his 
           undershirt and boxers. He’s frantic, paranoid. 
           He begins TEARING APART the hotel room. Checking behind 
           the TV, ripping the covers off the bed.

           He doesn’t find Scap’s wire. 

           INT. SCAP’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT  

           Scap enters, phone to one ear. He looks haggard, 
           exhausted as well. 

                                 SCAP
                        Aye. See ya soon. 

           Scap hangs up. He pours himself a glass of Scotch, downs 
           it. He turns, notices something on the carpet. A faint 
           RED STAIN. 

           Scap lifts up his boot. Caked into the tread are nasty 
           red bits of blood and skull. Leftovers from the Blonde. 

           Scap takes off the boot, opens his suitcase, pulls out a 
           long knife. With one shoe on, he moves to the sink and  
           begins obsessively scraping at the tread of his boot, 
           washing it clean.  

           There’s a little red splotch that’s not coming off. Scap 
           keeps scrubbing, building in intensity until at last he 
           gives up. Disgusted, he throws the boot in the back of 
           the closet.

           He takes another long drink, finishing the bottle. Then 
           he moves to his tape recorder. 

           INT. BATHROOM, FULTON’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Fulton enters, clutching his cell. He turns on the sink, 
           the shower. He starts flushing the toilet repeatedly. 

           The room is a cacophony of running water. Quickly he 
           dials Childs’ number.  

           INTERCUT: INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT

           Childs sits behind the wheel, not far from the hotel. 

                                 CHILDS
                        Kevin?

           Fulton paces, water rushing all around him. 

                                 FULTON
                        He knew I’m a tout.

           Childs sits up, stiff. 
                                 CHILDS
                        Who, Scap?

                                 FULTON
                        Fecking Finch. The target. 

                                 CHILDS
                        That’s impossible.

           INT. SCAP’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Scap holds headphones up to one ear, listens to Fulton. 
           He can’t hear anything but running water. 

           His other hand holds a cell. He talks to Mr. Darcy. 

                                 SCAP
                        You on a secure line? 

           INTERCUT: INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - DAY 

           Mr. Darcy stands in front of a mirror. We can’t discern 
           his location. 

                                 DARCY
                        Aye. 

                                 SCAP
                        We hit Finch. No money. 

           Darcy is silent. 

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        I checked with one of me contacts at 
                        NORAID. He said the guy wasn’t even on 
                        the feckin’ payroll. 

                                 DARCY
                        All the details came from Cavanaugh. If 
                        that wormy cunt thinks he can use army 
                        men to sort his dirty laundry...  

                                 SCAP 
                        Understood. 

           INT. FULTON’S HOTEL BATHROOM / TOWNCAR - NIGHT

           Fulton’s pacing. The room feels small.

                                 FULTON
                        Childs, what the feck is going on? Who 
                        was this guy? 
                                 CHILDS
                        Try to calm down. Do you have any idea 
                        why you were sent to kill him? 

                                 FULTON
                        I don’t know. It looked like there was 
                        some kind of deal going down. 
                                 (then)
                        Finch said some queer word too. 
                        ‘Stakeknife’ I think.

                                 CHILDS 
                        Jesus Christ. 

           Fulton stops pacing. 

                                 FULTON 
                        D’ya know what it means?

                                 CHILDS
                        Kevin, Stakeknife is what British 
                        Intelligence calls you.  

                                 FULTON
                        Then who--

                                 CHILDS 
                        I have no bloody idea. Meet me at the 
                        church down the block. We’ll talk there. 

           INT. SCAP’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT / UNKNOWN ROOM - DAY

           Scap keeps talking to Darcy, listening to Fulton. 

                                 DARCY
                        What about Fulton. Do we still have 
                        reason to suspect him?

                                 SCAP
                        He shot the target himself. Conor vouched 
                        for it.

                                 DARCY
                        Oh?

                                 SCAP
                        Aye, but there’s something else. Reckon 
                        the boy heard the target say the word 
                        ‘Stakeknife’.

           A beat. 

                                 DARCY
                        You’ve heard this before, have you?
                                 SCAP
                        Aye.

           THROUGH THE HEADPHONES Scap hears the water shutting off 
           in Fulton’s room. 

           INT. FULTON’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Fulton changes quickly back into his clothes. 

           INT. SCAP’S HOTEL ROOM/ UNKNOWN ROOM - NIGHT

                                 SCAP
                        Few months ago I interrogated this tout 
                        out o’ Newry. All his intel was shite, so 
                        I never brought it up with the Council... 
                        but this fella said he heard from his 
                        handler, there was one tout at the very 
                        top of the pile. Workin’ his way right 
                        into the heart of the RA. 
                                 (then)
                        Said the Brits called him Stakeknife.

                                 DARCY
                        Jaysus. So the hit--any idea how 
                        Cavanaugh got mixed up in all this? 

                                 SCAP
                        Not yet. 

                                 DARCY
                        I’ll speak with the Army Council. In the 
                        meantime, up your surveillance on Fulton. 
                        If he’s this Stakeknife, we could be 
                        talking ‘bout the biggest spy in the 
                        history of the RA.

                                 SCAP 
                        Aye, sir. 

           THROUGH THE HEADPHONES: Scap hears the sound of Fulton’s 
           door opening. 

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Scap peeks out, watches as Fulton steps into the 
           elevator. Scap waits until the doors close, then hurries 
           back inside to put on a new pair of shoes.  

           He heads for the stairwell, following Fulton.

           INT. BATHROOM, FULTON’S HOUSE - DAY

           PULLING BACK from Darcy as he hangs up.   
           He’s in Fulton’s home in Belfast.

           INT. KITCHEN, FULTON’S HOUSE - DAY

           Fiona drinks tea at the breakfast table with MRS. DARCY. 
           Fiona glances towards the bathroom. 

                                 FIONA
                        He alright? Been in there awful long.

                                 MRS. DARCY
                        He’s probably just on a business call. 

                                 FIONA
                                 (leans in, whispers)
                        Can we not pretend anymore? I know Kevin 
                        works for them, too. 

           Mrs. Darcy gives her a blank look. 

                                 MRS. DARCY
                        Them, love?

           Fiona sits back, sips her tea. An awkward silence.

                                 MRS. DARCY (CONT'D)
                        So what’s new with you? Any luck with the 
                        wee one? 

           Fiona looks down, a little embarrassed. Mrs. Darcy reads 
           her instantly. 

                                 MRS. DARCY (CONT'D)
                        Love! Love, that’s so exciting! When did 
                        ya find out? 

                                 FIONA
                        Last night. I still have to go to the 
                        doctor, just to be sure. 

                                 MRS. DARCY 
                        Oh, Kevin must be jumpin’ out of his 
                        skin! 

                                 FIONA
                        Actually--last time we talked, we had a 
                        bit of a row. I haven’t told him yet.

           Mr. Darcy enters, wiping his hands on his jeans. 

                                 DARCY
                        I apologize. Bedlam down at the office.
                                 MRS. DARCY
                        Hon, Fiona has wonderful news. Tell him, 
                        love.

           Before Fiona can speak, the DOORBELL rings. 

                                 FIONA
                        Let me just fetch this. 

           Fiona goes to answer the door, looks out the front 
           window. A truck out front. It’s marked ‘Donovan & Son’.

           Fiona opens the door. A MAN in a WHITE UNIFORM stands in 
           the doorway. We only see the back of his head. 

                                 UNIFORMED MAN
                        Lookin’ for Kevin Fulton? 

           Fiona glances at the Darcys. They’re talking animatedly.

                                 FIONA
                        I’m Mrs. Fulton. Can I help ya?

           EXT. STREET, HELL’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Fulton walks cautiously away from the hotel, making his 
           way towards a CHURCH down the block. 

           EXT. BEST WESTERN - NIGHT

           Scap exits the hotel. He walks quickly, spots Fulton at 
           the end of the block. 

           Scap begins to follow him, a bit drunk now.

           EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

           A few people coming and going. Fulton spots a BLACK 
           TOWNCAR parked at a curb, starts moving towards it.  

           FIFTY YARDS BEHIND HIM

           SCAP follows. He watches as Fulton moves closer and 
           closer to the car. 

           ON FULTON about to open the door of the towncar when--

                                 TOURIST
                        You can leave us here. Thanks. 

           A YOUNG COUPLE steps out of the car. Fulton eyes the 
           DRIVER. 

           It’s not Childs. The towncar pulls away. 
                                 SCAP (O.S.)
                        Kevin!

           Fulton turns, sees Scap moving towards him. If Fulton’s 
           blood pressure rises, he doesn’t let on for an instant.

                                 FULTON
                        You talk to Darcy?

           Scap watches the towncar roll off, curious. 

                                 SCAP 
                        Aye. We’re goin’ after the yank tomorrow.  

                                 FULTON
                        Best to hit him at home. Keep it quiet.

                                 SCAP
                        Agreed. Darcy said somethin’ else too-- 
                                 (quiet)
                        Much as personally I think you’re a bit 
                        of a cunt, on account of your work 
                        tonight, he’s askin’ I take ya off watch.   

                                 FULTON
                                 (skeptical)
                        Is he now?

                                 SCAP 
                        Sends his apologies for wirin’ ya up. You 
                        understand we had to be sure.

           Fulton snorts, starts walking away. He doesn’t buy it. 

                                 FULTON
                        Alright. We’re done here.  

                                 SCAP
                        Kevin-- 

                                 FULTON
                        Ya think I’m some gasur? Fella says 
                        you’re off watch, really he just shoved 
                        the wire a wee bit further up your arse.

           Fulton keeps walking. Finally Scap calls out. 

                                 SCAP
                        Bang on, Kevin! No use lyin’ to ya. Yer 
                        absolutely feckin’ right.  

           Fulton turns. Scap eyes the church behind them. 
                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Now I got a few more tricks I can use, if 
                        ya like. But I’d rather we sit down like 
                        men. Chat this thing through.

                                 FULTON
                        Aye. Let’s have a feckin’ chat. 

           INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - NIGHT 

           Candles. A few parishioners. Fulton and Scap kneel in the 
           front pew. Whispers. 

                                 FULTON
                        If Darcy thinks I’m this big spy, why 
                        don’t ya just haul me in for questioning 
                        now? Get it over with. 

                                 SCAP
                        Honestly? Protocol. I gotta have proper 
                        evidence first. 

                                 FULTON
                        Smart. Reckon if ya dragged in everyone 
                        the Council suspected of snitchin’, we 
                        wouldn’t have much army left. 

                                 SCAP 
                        Bang on. 
                                 (then)
                        Ya know, I was lookin’ at your file 
                        yesterday. Wanted to ask about Mary Norrish. 

           Fulton keeps looking straight ahead.

                                 FULTON 
                        What d’ya wanna know about her now?  

                                 SCAP
                        Well, she was a teacher o’ yours, right? 
                        Walked into a pub on the wrong side of 
                        town. Caught a bit of friendly fire.   

                                 FULTON 
                        Aye. So? 

                                 SCAP 
                        So from what I understand, ya spent quite 
                        a bit o’ time with poor Mary. Even moved 
                        in with you and yer oul man, didn’t she? 

           Fulton’s getting a bit uncomfortable.
                                 FULTON
                        Me da fancied her for a minute there, 
                        after me mam died. To be honest, I always 
                        thought Mary was a bit ganky. 

                                 SCAP
                        Oh, aye. 
                                 (then)
                        Just out o’ curiosity, what kind of a 
                        teacher was she? 

           A beat. 

                                 FULTON
                        She was a music teacher. 

           Something resembling a smile flits across Scap’s face.

                                 SCAP 
                        Just seems a little queer, this bird’s 
                        fresh in the ground from some RA bomb, 
                        few months later you start showin’ up at 
                        pubs, rabbiting on about the Cause. 
                                 (then)
                        It’s funny, I hear a lot o’ these 
                        intelligence agencies, they rush in after 
                        funerals, do their recruiting while boys 
                        are still out for blood. 

                                 FULTON 
                                 (scoffs)
                        G’wan. There ain’t a single boy in Belfast 
                        hasn’t lost someone to the RA. Shit mate, 
                        look at you. Or was that a proddy snuck 
                        into Mikey’s cell there? All due respect. 

           Scap’s smile disappears. For a moment it looks like his 
           anger might flare up again. 

                                 SCAP
                                 (terse)
                        What Mikey got, ain’t nobody to blame but 
                        him. And ye can bet if I was in that 
                        cell, I’d o’ stuck him meself. 

           A beat. The two of them stare up at the cross. 

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Ya know what I don’t understand with all 
                        these touts? Why anyone would want the 
                        bleedin’ job in the first place. 

                                 FULTON
                        How d’ya mean?
                                 SCAP
                        Say you are workin’ for the Brits. Some of 
                        these jobs ya pulled, yer killin’ MI-6, 
                        English civilians. Must make ya feel like a 
                        right heel, killin’ yer own people so. 

                                 FULTON
                        Well, like I said, I ain’t working for 
                        the Brits. So these fellas, I dunno how 
                        they look themselves in the mirror.
                                 (then)
                        Bunch of mentallers probably. Think it’s 
                        for the greater good of stopping the war.

           Scap nods. A beat. 

                                  SCAP 
                        Ya know that story ya told, when ya’s 
                        blaggardin’ me at breakfast? Ya missed 
                        the best part. Mikey fessed up to that 
                        other fella, right, but it wasn’t after 
                        the bomb went off. It was before. The 
                        Brits knew exactly where that bomb was 
                        going, and still they let six people die. 
                        Women, wee kids. Just to protect this one 
                        fella. Reason I’m telling ya this is 
                        ‘cause all these snitches I been putting 
                        the screws to, just before I nut ‘em, I 
                        like to ask how they can do what they do. 
                        They all got different reasons, right, 
                        but sooner or later the same three words 
                        come out the mouths of every single one 
                        o’ these cunts. They’re the same three 
                        words that just came outta yours: the 
                        greater good. Now to me, that’s gas. 
                        ‘Cause at the end of the day, all you 
                        touts, you’re still just a bunch of 
                        murdering bastards, same as us. So 
                        where’s the feckin’ good in any o’ that?

           Scap crosses himself. He pats Fulton on the back, stands.

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        See ya back at the hotel. 

           Scap walks to the confessional. He knocks twice on the 
           priest’s side.  

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Ya decent, Father?

           Fulton sits alone in the front pew and stares up at the 
           cross. 
           EXT. CAVANAUGH’S PENTHOUSE - DAY

           Snow falls on the Central Park apartment tower. 

           INT. FOYER, PENTHOUSE - DAY

           A muffled MAN’S VOICE coming from Cavanaugh’s bedroom. 

           The DOORKNOB jiggles. A lockpick scratching. The door 
           opens. The IRA team floods in, silent. Pistols, no masks. 

           Scap motions with his hands. They fan out.  

           INT. KITCHEN, PENTHOUSE - DAY

           Fulton moves quickly through the kitchen. Something 
           catches his eye, he furrows his brow. The ICE CREAM still 
           sits on the table. It’s all melted.   

           INT. HALLWAY, PENTHOUSE - DAY

           Scap and Conor approach the bedroom. A MAN’S VOICE right 
           around the corner. 

           Pistols cock. Conor takes a deep breath. Quickly they 
           turns the corner...

           INT. BEDROOM, PENTHOUSE - DAY

           Empty. The voice comes from the ANSWERING MACHINE.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        ...at the office is asking about you. I 
                        did’t know if you’re planning to come in, 
                        so I cancelled tomorrow’s appointments... 

           The room is a mess. Closets are open, GUTTED. Loose 
           clothes on the floor. Fulton enters, surprised.

                                 FULTON
                        Took off in a hurry. 

                                 SCAP
                        There must be something we can use. Get to 
                        work.

           INT. STUDY, PENTHOUSE - DAY 

           Fulton tears through drawers, files. They’re all EMPTY. 

           Fulton spies one of the few pieces of paper left: an 
           EARNINGS REPORT from Cavanaugh’s defense contractor, 
           Meyer Dynamics. The numbers are all in the millions.  
           INT. LIVING ROOM, PENTHOUSE - DAY

           Scap and Alastair tear the room apart. 

           Eventually Alastair spots a picture on the wall. AN OLD 
           MAP. His eyes settle on Spain, wheels turning. 

           INT. KITCHEN, PENTHOUSE - DAY

           Conor flips through the mail on Cavanaugh’s counter. 
           Bills, take-out menus. He tosses them away. 

           At last he flips to a small YELLOW ENVELOPE, tears it 
           open. A grin creeps across his face.

                                 CONOR
                        Gotcha, ya slippery gobshite. 

           INT. STUDY, PENTHOUSE - DAY

           Fulton hears muffled VOICES from the bedroom. Scap and 
           Alastair. He peeks around the corner.

                                 ALASTAIR
                                 (muffled)
                        ...no, ‘twas only that big blonde fella I 
                        remember seein’.

                                 SCAP
                        And you’re sure it was in Gibraltar?

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Aye, he was MI-6. Swear on me mother.

           Fulton listens, curious.

                                 CONOR (O.S.)
                        Sir, you might want a look at this. 

           Fulton turns. Conor hands him the letter. It’s marked: 
           ‘St. Sebastian’s Elementary. Casey Cavanaugh. Grade 5.’

                                 CONOR (CONT'D)
                        He’s got a wee cub. 

           Conor looks up at Fulton for approval. Fulton grins. 

                                 FULTON
                        Good man. Go tell the others. 

           As Conor walks out, Fulton’s smile slowly turns sickly. 
           INT. ST. SEBASTIAN’S - DAY 

           After school. Uniformed BOYS AND GIRLS run down the hall. 
           Moira Cavanaugh walks with one of Casey’s TEACHERS. 

                                 MOIRA CAVANAUGH
                        Is he making any more friends? 

                                 TEACHER
                        A few. To be honest, he just doesn’t seem 
                        that interested in other people. 

           Mrs. Cavanaugh spots a cluster of boys, confused. 

                                 TEACHER (CONT'D)
                        Everything alright? 

                                 MOIRA CAVANAUGH 
                        He was here just a second ago. 

           EXT. ST. SEBASTIAN’S - DAY 

           By the Hudson River. Moira exits the school.

                                 MOIRA CAVANAUGH
                        Casey, honey?

           EXT. STREET - DAY 

           Moira moves farther down the block, starting to look a 
           little nervous. She peers down an alley... 

           Then she STOPS in her tracks. 

           Casey sits in the passenger seat of a WHITE VAN. Fulton 
           is in the driver’s seat. 

           Moira starts running towards the truck, horrified.

                                 MOIRA CAVANAUGH 
                        Casey! Casey, get out of there! 

           Casey’s paying attention to something inside, doesn’t 
           look up. 

           Scap steps out from behind the van, blocks Moira’s path. 

                                 MOIRA CAVANAUGH (CONT'D)
                        Get the fuck away from my son. 

                                 SCAP
                        Easy, love. Don’t do anything stupid. We 
                        just want to have a wee chat. 

           Moira looks over her shoulder. They’re all alone.
           INT. VAN - DAY 

           Casey watches as Fulton plays his GAME BOY. Super Mario. 
           Fulton clumsily presses buttons. Mario is quickly killed 
           by a turtle. Fulton puts down the game, frustrated. 

                                 FULTON
                        Those fellas are impossible! 

                                 CASEY
                        You have to jump on their heads.
                        Let me see it. 

           Casey takes the Game Boy, plays. Fulton watches impressed 
           as the boy jumps on a turtle’s head.

                                 FULTON 
                        Bleedin’ genius you are. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Mrs. Cavanaugh looks anxiously at her son. 

                                 SCAP
                        Your husband thought it’d be gas to send 
                        a few o’ his mates on a wee errand. 

                                 MOIRA CAVANAUGH
                        I don’t know anything about that. We--we 
                        divorced two years ago.

                                 SCAP 
                        When’s the last time you saw him? 

                                 MOIRA CAVANAUGH 
                        He dropped Casey off in the middle of the 
                        day. That was Monday. 

                                 SCAP
                        Say where he’s going, did he? 

           Moira shakes her head, no. 

                                 MOIRA CAVANAUGH
                        He--he was crying. Kept saying ‘I fucked 
                        up’ ‘I fucked up’. Then he said he 
                        couldn’t see me or Casey for a while. 

           Scap pulls out a photo of FINCH. 

                                 SCAP 
                        How ‘bout this fella? Ya ever seen him 
                        hangin’ about? 

           Mrs. Cavanaugh eyes the picture for a moment. 
                                 MOIRA CAVANAUGH 
                        No.

           INT. VAN - DAY 

           Fulton watches as Casey beats the level. 

                                 FULTON
                        Well done, boyo. 

           Casey looks out the window, sees Scap talking to his mom.

                                 CASEY
                        Are you guys looking for my dad?

           The question hits Fulton hard. Casey looks up at him, 
           expectant. A beat.

                                 FULTON
                        No, mate. We’re just havin’ a chat with-- 

                                 CASEY
                        He’s at the summer house. 

           Casey resumes his video game. Fulton feels something 
           caught in his throat. 

                                 FULTON
                        Told ya that, did he?

                                 CASEY
                        I heard him tell his friend on the phone. 

           Fulton doesn’t say anything. Casey glances up at him. 

                                 CASEY (CONT'D)
                        What’s the matter?

           Fulton’s eyes have started WATERING. He looks away, out 
           the window. 

           TAP! TAP! Two quick knocks on the door. It’s Scap. Fulton 
           quickly wipes his eyes, opens the door for Casey. 

                                 FULTON
                        G’wan back to your mam. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Casey runs to his mother. Mrs. Cavanaugh picks him up, 
           kisses his face, relieved. She watches as Scap and Fulton 
           pull away in the truck. 
           INT. VAN - DAY 

           Scap sits shotgun, stares straight ahead. 

                                 SCAP
                        Get anything off the cub?

                                 FULTON
                        No. 

           A long silence.

                                 SCAP
                        Wife said he’s got a place out in Long 
                        Island. Summer house. Reckon we check 
                        there next.  

                                 FULTON
                        Grand. 

           EXT. BEACH, MONTAUK - NIGHT

           No life for miles. A distant lighthouse throws 
           intermittent flashes of light on WILL CAVANAUGH. 

           He walks with a cell in one hand, a tumbler of his aunt’s 
           whiskey in the other. Winds blow sand off the bluffs. 

                                 CAVANAUGH
                        No, just put three million in Casey’s 
                        account. And he’s not to see any of it 
                        till he’s eighteen, understand? Thanks. 

           Cavanaugh hangs up. A gust of wind blows sand into his 
           face. Some lands in his whiskey.

                                 CAVANAUGH (CONT'D)
                        Shit.

           Cavanaugh turns, walks back towards a luxurious two-story 
           BEACH HOUSE carved into the bluff. Stilt supports, a 
           staircase leading down to the shore. A dock, a boathouse. 

           As Cavanaugh eyes the house, an odd LOOK crosses his 
           face. Surprise changing slowly to dread. 

           Flashlights flicker through the windows of his house. 

           Cavanaugh eyes his glass of whiskey. He drinks it, sand 
           and all, then starts walking quickly to the boathouse. 

           INT. HALLWAYS, BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

           Scap stalks through the house with a flashlight and a 
           rifle. No sign of Cavanaugh. 
                                 SCAP
                                 (into radio)
                        Reckon this is a dead end, boys. Let’s 
                        g’wan back. 

           INT. KITCHEN, BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

           Fulton stands at the back window watching Cavanaugh duck 
           into the boathouse. 

                                 FULTON
                                 (into radio)
                        Aye. Meet ya out front. 

           Fulton spots Alastair heading out the back door...

           EXT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

           Underneath the house. Alastair pads softly down the steps 
           towards the dock, rifle drawn. Fulton pokes his head out. 

                                 FULTON
                        Allie, we’re headin’ off, mate. 

           Alastair glances at the boathouse. A beat. He turns. 

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Aye, sir. 

           Alastair starts trudging back up the stairs. Just as he’s 
           about to enter the house... 

           The WHIR of an engine starting up. 

                                 FULTON
                                 (to self)
                        Feckin’ hell--

           Fulton watches as a MOTORBOAT lurches out of the 
           boathouse. 

           Alastair rushes towards the dock, raising his rifle. 
           Fulton darts out the house behind him. 

           The motorboat carves a white path out to sea... 

           EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

           Alastair perches on the edge of the dock. Aims his rifle. 
           Slowly following the boat...

                                 FULTON 
                        Allie--wait--

           BANG! A single shot echoes out over the ocean. 
           Cavanaugh crumples, splashes down into the water. The 
           boat continues for a moment, slows down, stops.

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        We needed him alive. 

           YELPS out on the water. Cavanaugh’s splashing around. 

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Cheers. 

           INT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Cold, black. Suddenly Cavanaugh’s horrified face breaks 
           through the surface. Bubbles spew from his mouth as his 
           head is thrust downward. 

           Finally he’s yanked up into... 

           INT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

           Scap throws Cavanaugh down onto the dock. Cavanaugh 
           chokes and sputters, clutching his bloody leg. His voice 
           is a hoarse whine. Fulton looks on.

                                 SCAP
                        Ya fancy us your errand boys now, ye 
                        plastic paddy?

                                 CAVANAUGH
                        Please--Mr. Scapa, I’m loyal! Ask Darcy! 
                        Ask the Army Council! 

           Scap leans on Cavanaugh’s leg. Cavanaugh SCREAMS.

                                 SCAP
                        Aye, you’re feckin’ Bobby Sands. 

                                 CAVANAUGH 
                        Wait--you don’t understand! A man came to 
                        my office! Guy with a northern accent.

           Scap glances at Fulton, eases up on Cavanaugh’s leg.

                                 CAVANAUGH (CONT'D)
                        He had records. Every dollar I’ve sent 
                        you boys since sixty nine. Even what I 
                        took from Meyer! He was going to drag my 
                        whole fucking family through the mud! 

           Scap bends down close to Cavanaugh.  

                                 SCAP 
                        Give me one good reason why I should 
                        listen to this shite.
                                 CAVANAUGH
                        On my mother. He gave me the pictures of 
                        Finch. Fed me every line. I’d never even 
                        seen the poor guy before that!

           Cavanaugh keeps groveling. Fulton takes Scap’s ear.

                                 FULTON
                        What d’ya think?

                                 SCAP
                        Go fetch Conor. 

                                 FULTON
                        What for?

                                 SCAP
                                 (a look)
                        ‘Cause I’m feckin’ ordering ya to. 

           Fulton exits, miffed. Scap turns back to Cavanaugh.

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        This fella from Ulster. He got a name? 

           EXT. DOCK - NIGHT 

           The IRA team hovers at the top of the stairs, listening. 

                                 FULTON
                        Conor, Scap wants to see you. Rest o’ ya 
                        wait by the van. 

           Conor walks slowly down the steps, enters the boathouse. 
           Just as Fulton’s about to enter behind him-- 

                                 SCAP (O.S.)
                        Shut the door. 

           The door shuts in his face. MUFFLED VOICES within. Fulton 
           cracks the door open. 

           He can see Scap put the PISTOL in Conor’s hand.  

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                                 (muffled)
                        Told ya we’d make a man out o’ ya.

           INT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT 

           Conor holds the gun. Cavanaugh starts scooting backwards, 
           horrified. Scap stands behind Conor, stone-faced. 
                                 CAVANAUGH
                        Wait--I answered your questions! I’ve 
                        been loyal twenty five years--

                                 SCAP
                        That don’t matter one way or another.

           Conor looks down at Cavanaugh, scared to pull the 
           trigger. Scap puts a hand on Conor’s arm.

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                                 (whispers)
                        G’wan, son. The next one’ll come easy.

           This frightens Conor even more. Hand trembling, he begins 
           to lift the gun...

                                 CAVANAUGH 
                        Mr. Scapa, can I have another glass of 
                        whiskey first? Please just get me one 
                        more glass of--

           BANG! Cavanaugh slumps down, shot through the heart. 
           Conor stands still, confused. 

           He didn’t fire a shot. 

           Scap turns. FULTON stands in the doorway, pistol in hand.

                                 FULTON
                        Reckon he’s man enough already.

           Scap scowls. Conor rushes out, ashamed and relieved. 
           Fulton follows.

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE, SIDE - NIGHT

           Conor walks quickly up the bluff.

                                 FULTON
                        Mate!

           Conor doesn’t turn around. Fulton catches up. Conor wipes 
           tears from his eyes, embarrassed. They whisper.

                                 CONOR
                        Sorry for hesitating. I just--kept thinkin’ 
                        how he kinda looked like me oul man.

           Fulton takes the gun away from him. 

                                 FULTON 
                        Jaysus. Conor, what can I do to get ya to 
                        quit this shite?
                                 CONOR 
                        I can’t. Mr. Darcy said as long as I kept 
                        working, he’d pay some of da’s bills.

           Fulton eyes Scap moving up the beach, wiping blood on his 
           bluejeans.  

                                 FULTON 
                        Feck Darcy. I’ll pay ‘em in full.  

                                 CONOR
                        What? No, that’s fifteen thousand quid. 

                                 FULTON
                        It’s done. Just promise me this is the 
                        last you do for the Army. 

                                 CONOR
                        Really, I can’t ask ya to--

           Fulton motions to Scap, heading up the hill. 

                                 FULTON 
                                 (urgent)
                        D’ya wanna end up like that one there, 
                        feckin’ ice in your veins? ‘Cause that’s 
                        where you’re headed. 
                                 (then)
                        Now I can get ya a job workin’ shipping 
                        too. Just promise me you’re through. 

           A long beat. Conor eyes Fulton, looking at him earnestly. 
           He eyes Scap walking up the hill, cold and impassive. 

                                 CONOR
                        Aye. Alright.

           Fulton’s eyes light up. 

                                 FULTON
                        Good man. Now g’wan back to the van. 

           Conor shuffles up the hill. He turns halfway.

                                 CONOR 
                        Sir? Thanks. 

           Fulton nods. He hangs back a moment, waits for Scap to 
           catch up. 

                                 FULTON 
                        Cavanaugh’s man. You get a name? 

           Scap keeps walking, pissed.
                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        Oi! I’m feckin’ talking to ya here. 

                                 SCAP
                        Just said it was some baldy fella with 
                        his arm in a sling. 

           PANIC flashes across Fulton’s face, quickly vanishes.

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Buncha bollix, if ya ask me.   

                                 FULTON
                        No doubt.

           INT. PLAZA HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           A luxury suite. Childs lies in bed, watching ‘Howard’s 
           End’. An empty room service tray next to him. 

           His cell rings. 

                                 CHILDS 
                        Morning.

           INTERCUT: EXT. DIGNAN’S HOME, BELFAST - DAY

           Child’s other field agent, Dignan, approaches his   
           middle-class home. His arm is still in a sling.

           Dignan checks over his shoulder, a reflex. 

                                 AGENT DIGNAN
                        They’re hittin’ the tube station at 
                        Queensway. Dunno the date yet. 

                                 CHILDS
                        Excellent. Stay on it. We’re making this 
                        top priority. 

                                 AGENT DIGNAN
                        Aye, sir. 

                                 CHILDS
                        Oh, by the way. I got you a little 
                        something. Check the Telegraph.

           INT. DIGNAN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Dignan takes a piece of junk mail off the table. A notice 
           from the Belfast Telegraph. He opens it. A pair of WORLD 
           CUP TICKETS fall out. Ireland vs. England. 
                                 AGENT DIGNAN 
                                 (grins)
                        Deadly. Thank you, sir. 

                                 CHILDS
                        Do me a favor. Don’t bet on the Irish 
                        this time.

           Childs’ call-waiting beeps. A RESTRICTED NUMBER. 

                                 CHILDS (CONT'D)
                        I’ll see you soon.
                                 (clicks over)
                        Hello?

           INT. VAN - NIGHT

           Fulton drives out of the hotel parking lot alone, cell to 
           one ear. His eyes are red. 

                                 FULTON
                        I want to meet up. 

           EXT. BRIDGE, CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

           Fulton waits under a bridge, shivering. A black towncar 
           pulls up. Fulton keeps his hands in his pockets, opens 
           the door. 

           INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT

           Childs watches confused as Fulton gets in the backseat.

                                 FULTON
                        Drive.

                                 CHILDS
                        What in God’s name--

           Fulton pulls out a PISTOL.

                                 FULTON
                        Let’s not, eh? 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK, BRIDGE - NIGHT

           The towncar glides off under the bridge.

           INT. TOWNCAR - NIGHT

           Fulton grab’s Childs’ BRIEFCASE. He keeps the pistol 
           trained on his handler.

                                 FULTON
                        What’s the combination?
                                 CHILDS
                        Kevin, you’re making a huge mistake--

                                 FULTON 
                        I know you and Dignan have been playin’ 
                        me. Now what’s the feckin’ combo!?

           Fulton digs the gun hard into the back of Childs’ skull. 

                                 CHILDS 
                        Enough! Five-two-five.

           Fulton opens the briefcase, digs through papers.

                                 CHILDS (CONT'D)
                        If you’d just let me explain--  

           Fulton pulls out a folder. Photos of Finch. Papers read: 
           ‘Agent Eamon Finch. Force Research Unit.’

                                 FULTON 
                        You sick old cunt. You sent me to kill 
                        one of ours.  

                                 CHILDS
                        He was a whistleblower, Kevin. He knew 
                        the identities of our top men, you 
                        included. He threatened to go to MI-6.

                                 FULTON
                        So what! You’re all feckin’ Brits, ain’t 
                        ya? 

                                 CHILDS 
                        Don’t be naive. If Six finds out we’ve let 
                        you kill English civilians, they’d shut 
                        down our whole unit.

           Fulton’s head is spinning, trying to follow the corrupt 
           logic.  

                                 FULTON
                        Why not keep me informed? Why all the 
                        cloak and dagger with Cavanaugh? 

                                 CHILDS
                        We knew Finch fled to the States. Setting 
                        up the yank was just a bonus, a way to 
                        cut out a chunk of RA funding. 
                                 (then)
                        Watch, in one minute Darcy’s going to 
                        call. He’ll suspect British intelligence, 
                        but he won’t be able to pin a thing on 
                        you. He’s going to bring you home. 
                                 FULTON 
                        This is bloody sick. I didn’t sign up for 
                        this. 

                                 CHILDS
                        You want to play James Bond, join MI-6. 
                        There’s a reason they can’t get half the 
                        intel we can.  

           The car reaches a stoplight. Fulton’s phone starts to 
           RING. He checks the caller ID. 

                                 FULTON 
                        Scap. 

           The cell keeps ringing. Fulton looks from the phone to 
           the handler. 

                                 CHILDS
                        Kevin, you have to understand. This is 
                        all for the greater good. 

           Fulton’s face screws up.

                                 FULTON
                        Aw, bollix to ya.

           He opens the door, steps outside. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Fulton answers the phone. 

                                 FULTON
                        ‘Lo? 

           INTERCUT: EXT. PADDY REILLY’S - NIGHT 

           A few drunks exit the Irish pub. Scap talks on a cell out 
           front. He’s walking quickly towards a mailbox down the 
           block. 

                                 SCAP
                        Gave Darcy the yank’s blackmail bit. He 
                        thinks likely the Brits are behind the 
                        whole feckin’ thing.

           Fulton speaks softly so Childs can’t hear him. It’s as if 
           he now trusts the IRA more than his own organization.

                                 FULTON
                        What’s our next play? 
                                 SCAP
                        He’s bringing us home, boyo. We’re havin’ 
                        a gargle down at Paddy Reilly’s if ya 
                        feel like joinin’ us. 

                                 FULTON
                        See ya soon.  

           Scap hangs up the phone. He pulls out another small brown 
           package. Again he gives it the same, sad glance. 

           It’s addressed to a different woman. ‘Regan Tuohy. 769 
           Woodbridge Rd. Newry. Ireland.’ No return address.

           He quickly drops it in the mail slot. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Fulton hangs up, eyes Childs. His handler was absolutely 
           right. 

                                 CHILDS
                        Kevin. Remember whose side you’re on. 

                                 FULTON
                        You’re all so fecking dirty, does it 
                        really matter anymore?  

           EXT. PADDY REILLY’S - NIGHT 

           A FEW DRUNKS arguing outside. A white van pulls up. 
           Fulton steps out into the cold, pulls up his collar. 

           He trudges slowly towards the bar. 

           INT. PADDY REILLY’S - NIGHT 

           Fulton opens the door. Instantly his FACE FALLS.    

                                 FULTON
                        Aw, Jaysus-- 

           The room is empty. No patrons, no bartender. Half-empty 
           beers sit on the counter. 

           A CREAKING behind him. Fulton starts turning his head...

           CRACK! The butt of a pistol connects with the back of 
           Fulton’s skull. 

           He crumples.

                                                           CUT TO BLACK.
           Ragged breathing. A VOICE in the dark. A familiar speech.

                                 SCAP (O.S.) 
                        ...but I reckon that’s why they call you 
                        Stakeknife, ain’t it? Because you stuck 
                        every last one of us right in the heart.

           Three GUNSHOTS, loud and incredibly close. Silence. Scap 
           rips the duct tape off Fulton’s eyes. We’re in:

           INT. MEAT LOCKER - DAY

           Fulton hangs upside-down amid the sides of beef. The room 
           is dark, disorienting. All Fulton can see is Scap’s 
           tattooed chest rising and falling. 

                                 FULTON 
                        I told you, me name ain’t Stake--

           BANG! The door bursts open behind them.

                                 GRACIE
                        We’re ready. 

           Scap nods. He turns back to Fulton, grim-faced.

                                 SCAP 
                        I’m gonna ask ya one last time. You never 
                        took money from British Intelligence?

                                 FULTON
                        No.

                                 SCAP 
                        Fair enough. You’ve a visitor to see you.  

           Fulton’s ears perk up. FAINT CRIES grow louder from the 
           other room.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        What are you doing! Let go o’ me! 

           Gracie drags a WOMAN inside. Her hands and feet are taped 
           to a steel chair. There’s a BLACK HOOD over her face. 

           Fulton realizes instantly who it is. 

           Fiona.

           Fulton starts screaming, squirming, a worm on a hook. 

                                 FULTON
                        No! NO! Gracie stop it! Gracie, what are 
                        ya doing?!
                                 GRACIE
                                 (smug)
                        Now we’re square, sir. 

           Gracie exits. Scap drags Fiona’s chair, sets her down 
           face to face with Fulton. Fiona can’t see anything. 

                                 FIONA
                        Kevin?! 

                                 FULTON 
                        Love, just do anything he says! He won’t 
                        hurt ya. 

           Scap rips off Fiona’s hood. Fulton looks in her eyes.

                                 FIONA
                        What--what’s going on?

           Scap presses ‘RECORD’ on the tape player. 

                                 FULTON 
                                 (whispers)
                        I’m so sorry.

           Scap quickly wraps duct tape over Fulton’s mouth. He 
           leans down next to Fiona. She squirms, a scared animal.

                                 SCAP 
                        Shh. Shh. It’s alright now, love. The 
                        Army’s just got a few questions for ye.

           Scap begins circling both of them. 

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        You can start by stating your name.

           She looks at Fulton. He nods. 

                                 FIONA
                        Fiona Fulton.

                                 SCAP
                        Good. Now, how long have ya been married 
                        to Kevin here? 

                                 FIONA
                        Three--three years.

           Fulton starts to speak, muffled. Scap talks over him. 

                                 SCAP 
                        And during that time, what did your 
                        husband tell you he did for a living? 
                                 FIONA
                        He said--he was in shipping.  

                                 SCAP
                        Meanin’, far as you knew, he was bringing 
                        home what? ‘Bout thirty thousand a year?  

                                 FIONA
                        Thir-thirty two.

           Fulton looks on, confused. 

           EXT. MEAT PACKING WAREHOUSE - DAY

           DUMBO, Brooklyn. The squat warehouse sits in an 
           industrial pit under the Manhattan Bridge overpass. 

           Alastair and Gracie wait by a van, smoking. Another van 
           pulls up. Conor steps out.  

                                 CONOR
                        Where’s Kevin?

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Son, you were told to wait at the hotel.

           Conor tries to move past, anxious.

                                 CONOR
                        What are ya doin’ to him in there?

           Alastair grabs his arm. 

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Lad, this is an order. G’wan back to the 
                        hotel. We’ll call ya tomorrow. 

           INT. MEAT LOCKER - DAY

           Scap keeps circling Fulton and Fiona.

                                 SCAP 
                        Now Fiona, I understand you found some 
                        money in the house the other day? 

                                 FIONA
                                 (nods)
                        The pa-painter found it. In the garage.

           Fulton speaks, muffled. In an instant--CRACK! Scap 
           strikes him hard in the face.

                                 SCAP 
                        You will shut your fecking mouth until I 
                        am finished with her! 
           Fulton swings back and forth by his ankles, goes silent. 

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        How much money was it, love?

                                 FIONA
                        Three hundred thousand quid. 

                                 SCAP
                        Sounds like a bit much for a fella 
                        driving a boat. Don’t it, Mrs. Fulton? 

           Fiona’s eyes start to water. She won’t look at Fulton.  

                                 FIONA
                        Y-yes.

           Scap crouches down next to her.

                                 SCAP
                                 (softly)
                        I’m sure you’ve no idea where that money 
                        came from. Let me explain. Spies like 
                        your husband, traitors working for the 
                        Brits, lot of ‘em are given these big 
                        cash bonuses after they do a job. Course, 
                        they can’t spend any of it. Raises too 
                        much suspicion. Before today, the most we 
                        ever recovered was two hundred thousand 
                        Punt. That was from some cunt been spying 
                        nearly ten years. 
                                 (puts his face close to hers)
                        So in the case of your husband, Fiona, I 
                        reckon he’s been lying to you every 
                        single minute, of every single day since 
                        first you two met. 

           Fiona looks at her husband. TEARS starts to rolling down 
           her cheeks. Satisfied, Scap moves on to Fulton. 

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Can you not see what you’re doing to her, 
                        boyo? All ya have to do is tell us where 
                        you got the money. She can go. 

           Fulton squirms. Scap leans in close to him.

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                                 (whispers)
                        I’m sure we’ll find some nice RA boy to 
                        raise your wee baby. 

           Fulton stops squirming. His eyes go dull.
                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Oh. Has she not told you yet? 

           TEARS begin to stream out of Fulton’s eyes and trickle 
           down into his hair. 

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        That’s just about the saddest thing I’ve 
                        ever heard.

           Fulton speaks, muffled. Scap rips the tape off his mouth.

                                 FULTON
                                 (softly)
                        I’m Stakeknife. 

           Grim satisfaction crosses Scap’s face. 

                                 SCAP
                        Louder.

                                 FULTON 
                        I’m Stakeknife.

           Fiona looks up at her husband, confused and humiliated. 
           The tape player keeps rolling.

           EXT. MEAT PACKING WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Conor’s truck rattles slowly away from the warehouse. 

           INT. VAN - DAY

           Conor looks guilty, conflicted. As he pulls past the side 
           of the building, he notices an OPEN GATE around back. 

           Conor looks over his shoulder, sees Alastair talking to 
           Gracie. Conor turns the wheel, starts heading around to 
           the back of the meat packing lot.

           INT. MEAT LOCKER - DAY

           Fulton can’t look at his wife. Scap stands over the two 
           of them, unmoved. 

                                 FULTON 
                        For the last fifteen years I’ve worked as 
                        the top field agent for a British 
                        Intelligence agency called the Force 
                        Research Unit.

                                 SCAP
                                 (businesslike)
                        Give me the name of your handler. 
                                 FULTON
                        Bill Childs.

                                 SCAP
                        Are there any other field agents you’re 
                        aware of?

                                 FULTON
                        No. Their identities are all kept secret.  

           Scap pulls out the pistol from the back of his jeans. 

                                 SCAP
                        You’re lying to me. I won’t be havin’ 
                        that... 

                                 FULTON
                        I swear to Christ I’m not. 

           Scap touches the gun to the back of Fulton’s head. Fiona 
           cries out. 

                                 SCAP 
                        Ya really wanna die for them, Kevin? 

           Silence from Fulton. Scap cocks the pistol.

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Last chance...

           Click. Another gun cocks behind Scap. 

           A long silence. Scap slowly turns around, keeps his gun 
           on Fulton. 

           CONOR stands in the doorway, pistol pointed.

                                 CONOR 
                        Drop--drop it.

                                 FULTON
                        Conor, get out of here!

           Scap looks confused, keeps the gun on Fulton.  

                                 SCAP
                        Lad, don’t kid me now. I know ya can’t 
                        pull th-- 

           BANG! Conor fires at Scap’s feet. Scap looks confused, 
           sad. Never breaking eye contact with Conor, Scap gently 
           places the pistol on the floor. 

                                 CONOR 
                        Slide it to me. Face the wall. 
           Scap kicks the gun AWAY from Conor. It disappears into a 
           dark corner. Conor starts breathing faster. 

                                 SCAP
                        Lad, do ya know what you’re doing...

                                 CONOR
                        Face the fecking wall!

           Scap puts his hands up, turns and faces the wall. He’s 
           right next to the tape player. 

           Conor plucks a knife off a rack, starts cutting the tape 
           around Fulton’s arms. He keeps the pistol on Scap. 

                                 CONOR (CONT'D)
                                 (quiet)
                        You alright, sir? If I cut ya down, you 
                        ain’t gonna hurt yourself? 

                                 FULTON
                        Please. Conor--this has nothing to do 
                        with you.

           Conor starts SAWING at the rope holding Fulton’s feet.

                                 SCAP
                        Right now you’re helping the biggest, 
                        juiciest tout in the history of the IRA. 
                        Do you have any idea-- 

                           CONOR
           Shut up!  
                                                         SCAP
                                             ...what they’ll do to you?

           BANG! Conor fires another shot. It sinks into a side of 
           beef. He’s almost through the rope at Fulton feet.

                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        Or to your poor mam. 

           SNAP! The rope holding Fulton breaks. Fulton falls onto 
           the floor, dizzy. 

           EXT. MEAT PACKING WAREHOUSE, SIDE - DAY

           Alastair pisses. Just as he zips up, he sees--

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Aw, no.

           CONOR’S WHITE VAN sitting behind the warehouse. Alastair 
           starts running towards the front.   
           INT. MEAT LOCKER - DAY

           Conor cuts the tape at Fiona’s feet. Fulton, dizzy, 
           clutches her face. 

                                 FULTON
                        Love, you alright?

           Fiona nods, frantic. Scap looks down at the tape player. 

                                 SCAP 
                        Son, on this tape player is Fulton’s 
                        confession. All I’m gonna do now is bend 
                        down and play it for ya. You can decide.

                                 FULTON 
                        Conor, give me the gun! 

           Scap’s fingers light down on the tape player. He presses 
           rewind, then play. VOICES. 

                                 SCAP’S VOICE (O.S.) 
                        Give me the name of your handler. 

                                 FULTON’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Bill Childs.

           SNAP! The last of Fiona’s bonds are cut. Fulton yanks her 
           out of the chair.  

                                 FULTON 
                        The feckin’ gun, lad!  

           CONFUSION creeps across Conor’s face. He takes a step 
           away from Fulton. The tape continues.

                                 SCAP’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Are there any other field agents that 
                        you’re aware of?

                                 FULTON’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        No. Their identities are all kept secret. 

           Conor turns slowly towards Fulton. 

                                 CONOR
                                 (confused)
                        Kev-Kevin?

                                 FULTON
                        He threatened me wife! He made me say it! 

           Conor starts pointing the gun at Fulton. Scap steps away 
           from the wall.
                                 SCAP
                        Give me the gun, Conor. 

           Conor whirls the pistol back to Scap. Fulton moves with 
           Fiona slowly towards the door. 

                                 FULTON 
                                 (desperate)
                        Conor, please. I care about you so much. 
                        I’d never do anything to hurt--

                                 GRACIE (O.S.)
                        Conor!

           BANG! TWO GUN BLASTS go off at once.

           IN THE NEXT INSTANT:

           1) CONOR sinks to the floor, shot through the neck. 
           2) SCAP falls to a knee, a bullet cuts into his leg. 
           3) GRACIE stands in the doorway, pistol smoking. 
           4) FULTON AND FIONA are gone. 

           EXT. MEAT PACKING WAREHOUSE, REAR - DAY

           Fulton tugs Fiona outside. He spies the chain and lock on 
           the double doors. Quickly he slams them shut, locks them--

           INT. HALLWAY, MEAT PACKING WAREHOUSE - DAY

           CRACK! Gracie hits the doors full force. They hold fast. 
           She watches through the cracked doorway as Fulton drags 
           Fiona towards CONOR’S VAN.

           INT. MEAT LOCKER - DAY

           Scap winces, down on one knee. 

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Don’t move, sir. Let me fetch a doctor.  

           Gracie bursts in. 

                                 GRACIE
                        They’re in the van. 

           Scap rises to his feet, pained. 

                                 SCAP
                                 (to Alastair)
                        You ride with Gracie. 
           INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY

           The engine grinds, catches. Fulton stomps on the gas, 
           launching them out of the lot towards a cluster of 
           dilapidated warehouses.

           EXT. MEAT PACKING WAREHOUSE, FRONT - DAY

           Gracie and Alastair jump into one van, Scap limps into 
           the other. The vehicles shudder to life, rattle out of 
           the parking lot. 

           EXT. WAREHOUSES - DAY

           Fulton’s van winds around corners, approaching a BUSY  
           STREET. He starts to slow down. 

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY

           Fulton looks at Fiona. She’s terrified. 

                                 FULTON
                        Love, you okay? 

           She’s too shaken to answer.

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        Are ya okay?!

           She nods. Fulton motions to the busy street. He reaches 
           over, opens her door.  

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        What I need you to do, I need you to get 
                        out the car, find a policema--

           CRACK! Out of nowhere Scap’s van slams into Fulton’s side 
           door. 

           Fulton’s van spins like a top, windows shattering. 
           Fulton’s AIRBAG EXPLODES, fills the van with white smoke. 
           Fiona jolts in her seat. 

           The van shudders to a stop.  

           INT. SCAP’S VAN - DAY

           Scap pounds on the brakes, the van screeches to a halt. 
           He looks over his shoulder, throws his van in reverse.  

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY

           Fiona sees the van backing towards them, gathering speed. 
           She slams her door shut.
                                 FIONA
                        Kevin, back up!

           Fulton looks over the top of his airbag, stunned. He hits 
           reverse, screeches backwards, unable to turn the wheel.

           EXT. STREETS, DUMBO - DAY

           Fulton’s truck hurtles backwards into the street, 
           narrowly missing oncoming traffic. Cars squeal, honk. The 
           van crashes backwards through a fence, stops in a 
           CONSTRUCTION SITE. 

           The IRA vans blast out into the street. A STATION WAGON 
           clips the back of Gracie’s van, smashes into a lightpole.

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY

           Fulton’s airbag slowly begins to deflate as Scap’s van 
           hurtles towards them. 

           Fulton stomps on the accelerator, launching them into 
           traffic as he fights with the wheel.

           EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE OVERPASS - DAY

           The three vans tear through the industrial neighborhood, 
           weaving around the columns of the Manhattan Bridge. 
           Fulton’s van scrapes dizzily up against other cars. 

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY

           Fulton looks in the REARVIEW MIRROR, sees Scap holding 
           the radio to his mouth. Fulton motions quick to Fiona. 

                                 FULTON
                        The radio! Give me the radio!

           Fiona hands him the radio. Fulton turns it on.

                                 SCAP (O.S.)
                        Do you have a shot?

                                 ALASTAIR (O.S.)
                        Thirty seconds.

           Horrified, Fulton looks left, catches flashes of GRACIE’S 
           VAN weaving through traffic. He can see Alastair taking 
           out his RIFLE. 

                                 FULTON
                        Put your head down!

           Just as Fulton grabs the back of Fiona’s neck--CRACK!
           INT. SCAP’S VAN - DAY 

           Scap leans down on the accelerator, smacking the back of 
           Fulton’s van. 

           INT. GRACIE’S VAN - DAY

           Running parallel to Fulton’s. Gracie’s speedometer needle 
           inches higher as Alastair loads a round into his rifle...

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY

           Fulton accelerates ahead of Scap, sees Alastair’s window 
           starting to ROLL DOWN... 

           INT. GRACIE’S VAN - DAY 

           Alastair aims the rifle...

           ALASTAIR’S POV - RIFLE SCOPE

           Following Fulton through the whirlwind of traffic...

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY

           Fulton SWERVES LEFT, smashing into Gracie’s van. Alastair 
           drops the rifle.

           EXT. ONRAMP, MANHATTAN BRIDGE - DAY 

           Fulton’s van screeches past a stopped POLICE MOTORCYCLE. 
           The siren roars to life as the cop squeals after Fulton, 
           onto the bridge. 

           EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - DAY 

           A massive four-lane suspension bridge with subway cars 
           running underneath. 

           The three IRA vans tear down the shoulder, motorcycle 
           caught in the middle. 

           INT. SCAP’S VAN - DAY 

           Scap watches as the cop yells into a walkie-talkie.

                                 SCAP
                                 (into radio)
                        Lose the cop.

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY

           Fulton eyes his rearview mirror, spots Gracie’s van 
           inching up behind the motorcycle. Fulton puts his head 
           out the window, taps his brake lights. 
                                 FULTON 
                        Mate, behind you! 

           Fulton watches in horror as Alastair points his rifle...

           EXT. MOTORCYCLE - DAY

           The MIDDLE-AGED COP speeds after Fulton, oblivious.

                                 COP
                                 (into radio)
                        Ten-eighty-eight, heading northbound on 
                        Manhattan--  

           CRACK! His helmet splits in two. 

           EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - DAY 

           The motorcycle FLIPS SIDEWAYS, spinning into other lanes 
           of traffic, under a TRUCK.

           Scap and Gracie’s vans batter through the pileup, grind 
           against the guardrail. They follow Fulton down the 
           offramp into Manhattan.

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY

           Fulton spins the wheel, doubles back. Gracie’s van is 
           right behind him. Fulton clutches the radio. 

                                 SCAP (O.S.)
                        Hit him again. 

                                 ALASTAIR (O.S.)
                        I’m out of rounds, sir.

           EXT. STREETS, MANHATTAN - DAY 

           The vans charge through narrow streets towards the FDR. 
           Fulton breaks off towards an ALLEY... 

           INT. SCAP’S VAN - DAY 

           Following close behind.

                                 SCAP
                                 (into radio)
                        Cut right! Box him in.

           INT. GRACIE’S VAN - DAY

           Gracie pounds on the gas, lurching around the alley...
           EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

           Fulton’s just about to break free when--

           GRACIE’S VAN screeches out in front, blocking him off. 
           Fulton brakes hard, skids to a stop. 

           SCAP’S VAN screeches up behind them. Fulton’s boxed in. 

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY

           Idling. Fulton watches as Alastair hops out, rifle 
           pointed. Fulton looks Fiona up and down. 

                                 FULTON
                        You hurt anywhere? 

                                 FIONA
                        I--I don’t think so. 

           Outside, Alastair motions with the rifle. 

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Outta the van!

           Fulton pokes his head out the window.

                                 FULTON
                        Promise you’ll leave me wife out of this! 
                        I’ll come along quietly. 

                                 SCAP (O.S.)
                        Ya know we can’t do that, Kevin.

           Fiona turns, sees Scap stepping out of his van. Fiona 
           squeezes Fulton’s hand. 

                                 FIONA
                        Please--don’t leave me alone with him. 

           Scap steps closer. Fulton looks at his wife. A tense 
           beat. Alastair cocks his rifle...

                                 ALASTAIR
                        Last chance, Kevin!

           Fulton pulls up the radio, looks at Alastair.

                                 FULTON
                                 (into radio)
                        How many bullets ya got, mate?

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

           Alastair goes white. 
           Scap watches in horror as Fulton’s van LURCHES FORWARD. 
           Alastair starts scrambling backwards into the van as... 

           INT. GRACIE’S VAN - DAY

           CRACK! Fulton’s van connects, starts PUSHING Gracie’s van 
           backwards into the street and towards a DITCH on the far 
           side. 

           Alastair and Gracie fall backwards, limbs flailing. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY 

           Fulton keeps pushing. Metal grinds metal as Gracie’s van 
           OVERTURNS, falls backwards into the ditch. 

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY

           Fulton hits reverse, guns it, takes off towards the FDR.

           EXT. STREET - DAY 

           Scap runs to the end of the alleyway, watches Fulton 
           disappear onto the freeway. 

           A few PASSERSBY gather across the street, eye the 
           wreckage of Gracie’s van. Alastair and Gracie are pulling 
           themselves out, limping. Gracie bleeds from one arm. 

           Scap starts running towards the ditch, pulls out a cell 
           phone. 

           EXT. STREET, UPTOWN - DAY

           Light snow beginning to fall. Fulton’s van exits the 
           freeway uptown, a safe distance away. It shudders to a 
           stop next to a coffee shop.  

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY

           Fulton takes one look at his wife, disheveled and 
           shivering. His eyes start watering.

                                 FULTON
                        Love, I’m just so fecking sorry.  

           Fiona doesn’t look at him. She stares straight ahead.

                                 FIONA
                                 (quiet)
                        So it’s true then? Everything ya said 
                        back there?

           A beat. 
                                 FULTON
                        Yes. 

           She opens her door and gets out. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Fiona walks towards a congested intersection. Fulton 
           steps out of the car, follows quickly behind her.  

                                 FULTON
                        Love, listen to me--I know after what I 
                        just put ya through, there isn’t anything 
                        I can do to make us right again. I know 
                        that. But let me be straight with ya now--
                                 (blocking her path)
                        Every lie I told, every single one was to 
                        keep you outta harm’s way.

           She starts walking around him.

                                 FIONA
                        Oh, and didn’t that work out just lovely? 

           He grabs her arm. 

                                 FIONA (CONT'D)
                        Let go o’ me.

                                 FULTON
                        Will ya just listen--

                                 FIONA 
                        I said get your feckin’ hands off me!

           Fiona bursts into tears, collapses onto the ground. 
           Fulton kneels down beside her. 

                                 FULTON
                        I know how ya must be feelin’--

                                 FIONA
                        Ya know feck-all, Kevin! I loved you so 
                        much. I would’ve given up me music, me 
                        church, anythin’ ya’d asked of me. And 
                        then to find out ya been lyin’ with every 
                        breath...have ya any idea how much that 
                        hurts? That kind of betrayal? Like havin’ 
                        the life ripped out of ya.   

           She rises to her feet, wipes the tears from her eyes. 

                                 FIONA (CONT'D)
                        You don’t deserve to see me feckin’ cry. 
           She runs across the street, hails a passing cab. The 
           driver slows down. Fulton hesitates a moment. 

                                 FULTON 
                                 (blurts out)
                        Fiona, they’ll find you. 

           She climbs into the back of the cab. 

           INT. CAB - DAY

           The CABBIE starts to take off.

                                 FIONA
                        The airport.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The cab enters traffic at a red light. Fulton runs up to 
           Fiona’s closed window. 

           INT. CAB - DAY 

           Fiona doesn’t roll down the window. 

                                 FULTON
                                 (muffled through glass)
                        I’m sorry, love. You can’t go home yet. 

           She doesn’t look at him.

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        Any place you could go--ma’s, Aunt  
                        Cora’s--they’ll be waiting. They’ll drag 
                        you back over and over to get to me. It’s 
                        either that or, or I turn meself in. 

                                 FIONA 
                        Don’t you even put that responsibility on me!

           EXT. CAB - DAY

           Fulton looks ahead. The light changes green. Cars start 
           moving forward. He has thirty seconds to change her mind.  

           INT. CAB - DAY

           Fulton speaks quickly through the glass.

                                 FULTON
                                 (muffled)
                        Love, while I was working for the RA, the 
                        only reason I never put a bullet in me own 
                        head is ‘cause I knew when I came home at 
                        night, I’d get to be near ya. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        And the one thing I never lied about, from 
                        the day we met to this very moment here, 
                        is that I love ya with every inch o’ me. 
                        Right now, all I’m askin’ is that ya let 
                        me protect you. Least until I see this 
                        thing through. Then, time comes and we’re 
                        in the clear, fine. We’ll split up if 
                        that’s what you want. But I’m askin’ ya to 
                        stay with me now because, love, I’d sooner 
                        serve meself up to those boys on a platter 
                        before I ever put ya in danger again.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The cab takes off. Fulton watches, stricken with guilt as 
           it glides away. A long beat. 

           Then the BRAKE LIGHTS turn on. Fulton’s face lights up. 
           He starts running towards the cab. 

           INT. BALLROOM, BELFAST - DAY

           A wedding reception. Young couples dancing. Mrs. Darcy 
           dances with a YOUNG BOY.  

           Mr. Darcy stands off in one corner talking into a cell.

                                 DARCY
                        Is it done? 

           INTERCUT: EXT. O'BRADY’S AUTO BODY - DAY

           Bustling with activity. A tow-truck pulls Scap’s mangled 
           van into the yard. Scap sits at a table. A bandage around 
           his leg.

                                 SCAP
                        Slipped away.

           Darcy scowls.

                                 DARCY
                        This isn’t like you, Freddie.

                                 SCAP 
                        I already called some boys. He so much as 
                        steps off a plane in Ireland, he’s takin’ 
                        the long dive. 

           Darcy hangs up on him, pissed. 

           Scap cracks a knuckle, moves to Alastair and Gracie. They 
           sit at a table, Alastair wraps a bandage around Gracie’s 
           arm. 
                                 SCAP (CONT'D)
                        You two did fine work today. I’m seeing 
                        ‘bout some plane tickets now. 

                                 GRACIE
                        If it’s all the same to you, sir, we’d 
                        rather stay on. Finish this properly. 

                                 SCAP
                        Ye sure about that? Reckon you can do 
                        more to help the Cause back in Ulster.

           Alastair finishes bandaging Gracie’s arm, stands.  

                                 ALASTAIR
                        The Cause ain’t got nothin’ to do with 
                        it, sir. 

           EXT. INTERSTATE 495 - DAY

           Snow’s falling harder. Fulton’s van speeds out of the 
           city towards Long Island. 

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY 

           Fiona stares out the window, ambivalent. 

                                 FULTON 
                                 (soft)
                        Love? I need ya to tell me everything 
                        that happened back home.

           A beat.

                                 FIONA
                        I was havin’ tea with the Darcys when 
                        your painter showed up. I let him poke 
                        around in the garage, next thing I know 
                        he’s flashing a stack of bills. 

                                 FULTON
                        And Mr. Darcy, how did he react?

                                 FIONA 
                        He didn’t say much of anything. Just had 
                        this sly little grin. 

                                 FULTON
                                 (fuming)
                        Of course.

           Fiona keeps staring out the window.
                                 FIONA 
                        That night two boys came ‘round, handed 
                        me a plane ticket. Told me not to ask 
                        questions. 
                                 (then)
                        Why’s all this important? 

                                 FULTON
                        Because I didn’t hire any painter.

                                 FIONA
                                 (turns, confused)
                        Then who was that fella with the busted 
                        arm? 

           Fulton’s knuckles clench on the wheel. 

                                 FIONA (CONT'D)
                        Kevin, look out!

           The car in front of them has STOPPED. Fulton slams on the 
           brakes, screeches to a halt. A beat. 

                                 FIONA (CONT'D)
                        Who--

                                 FULTON 
                        He’s from me agency. Reckon they knew 
                        Darcy’d be at the house, used that to cut 
                        me loose.

                                 FIONA
                        Why would they do that? I thought--didn’t 
                        you say you were their top agent?

                                 FULTON
                        I thought I was. 

           EXT. INTERSTATE 495 - DAY 

           Fulton’s van rattles away from the city. 

           EXT. LONG ISLAND BEACH - DAY 

           A two-lane road by the shore. Rustic cottages. Not a soul 
           in sight. Fulton’s van glides along, finally arrives at a 
           run-down old MOTEL. The lights are on. 

           EXT. MOTEL - DAY 

           Fulton steps out of the van, sees the CLERK behind a 
           desk. He opens Fiona’s door. She steps out into the cold.

                                 FIONA
                        Where are we?
                                 FULTON 
                        Just somewhere you can sit tight for a 
                        few hours. That alright?

           Fiona nods. Fulton starts handing her his cell phone, 
           credit cards, all the money in his pockets.

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        If I don’t call by midnight, then you’re 
                        safe. G’wan and buy a ticket home. 

           He brushes her hair back, kisses her face. 

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        I love you. I’ll be with ya soon. 

           Fulton starts moving back to the van. 

                                 FIONA
                        Wait--I thought you said it wasn’t safe 
                        to go back?

                                 FULTON
                        Not while I’m alive, I said. 

           Fulton gets into the driver’s seat. Fiona realizes what 
           he’s planning to do, moves to the window.

                                 FIONA
                        Kevin. You don’t have to do this.

                                 FULTON 
                        These boys’ve been fighting twenty-five 
                        years, love. They ain’t lettin’ up now.   

           Fulton starts the car. 

           EXT. O'BRADY’S AUTO BODY - DAY

           Scap looks at Fulton’s file, talks on his cell. 

                                 SCAP
                        His sister lives in Sligo, put a few boys 
                        outside her house too.

                                 VOICE ON PHONE (O.S.)
                        What about the wife?

           Scap eyes Gracie, lowers his voice. 

                                 SCAP
                        I don’t reckon she knows anything. You 
                        just concentrate on Fulton.

           Gracie’s phone rings. She checks caller ID, confused. 
                                 GRACIE
                        Sir, think you want to take this. 

           Scap covers the receiver. 

                                 SCAP
                        Not now, Gracie.
                                 (into phone)
                        He’s got an aunt living in Dublin as 
                        well. Why don’t ya--

           Gracie thrusts the buzzing phone at Scap. 

                                 GRACIE
                        Sir. It’s Fulton. 

           Scap takes Gracie’s phone, incredulous. 

                                 SCAP
                        Kevin.

           INTERCUT: INT. FULTON’S VAN - DAY

           Fulton drives fast along the deserted beach.

                                 FULTON
                        Listen up, boyo. I got a proposition for 
                        ya. 

                                 SCAP
                        Aye? 

                                 FULTON 
                        I’m headin’ out to the yank’s place now. 
                        If ya don’t wanna show, grand. You can 
                        feck-off back to Ulster, I won’t mail ya 
                        home in wee bits and pieces. How’s that 
                        suit ya, ya feck? 

           Scap shakes his head, amused. 

                                 SCAP 
                        You got some big hairy bollix, mate. I 
                        give ya that.

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE, MONTAUK - DAY

           Snowing hard. 

           Fulton’s mangled van pulls up the long driveway. He steps 
           out into the cold, looks around. The only building for 
           miles is the lighthouse. The beam glitters through the 
           snow.   
           Fulton reaches into the trunk of the van, pulls out the 
           box of EXPLOSIVES and DETONATORS. 

           INT. SCAP’S VAN - DAY

           Scap drives the new van down I-495. Gracie sits next to 
           him, silent. Alastair sits in the backseat, nervous. 

           INT. KITCHEN, BEACH HOUSE - DAY 

           Fulton rolls the plastic explosives into strips. He takes 
           the infrared triggers, pries them opens, examines them. 
           He starts setting them at different frequencies. 

           His eyes settle on the OVEN.

           EXT. STREET, MONTAUK - TWILIGHT

           The sun’s beginning to set. Cottage windows are shuttered 
           up, covered in frost. The whole town is shut down for the  
           off-season.

           A RUMBLE. A lone VAN glides past a deserted church.

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY

           The only sign of life is Fulton’s mangled van parked at 
           the end of the long driveway. 

           SCAP’S VAN approaches, stops. 

           Scap, Gracie, and Alastair step out. They open the trunk, 
           grab radios. Alastair and Gracie load ammo into Armalite 
           rifles. Scap pulls out a shotgun. 

           Scap eyes the two-story beach house. All the lights are 
           on. 

           There’s a LOW HUM filtering out from inside.

           The three of them approach the house slowly, guns drawn. 
           Scap motions left. Alastair and Gracie trot around to the 
           side of the house. 

           As Scap moves towards the front door, the LOW HUM keeps 
           getting louder and louder, rising in pitch until...

           INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           A head-splitting cacophony of electrical WHIRRING and 
           GRINDING. 

           Fulton has turned everything on. 
           TV’s blare news. Music screams over multiple stereos, 
           creating an unintelligible cloud of discord. Smoke alarms 
           whine. 

           Scap enters slowly, shotgun pointed. He yells into his 
           radio. It’s worthless, he’s completely drowned out by the 
           din.

                                 SCAP
                        --Gracie---he--?

           An inaudible response. Scap moves to the TV. Just as he 
           reaches out to shut it off...

           REALIZATION hits him. Scap darts for the hallway as--

           ANGLE ON: the TRIGGER nestled behind the TV. 

           It BLINKS.

           CRACK! The TV EXPLODES, launching shards of glass all 
           over the room.

           INT. HALLWAY, BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           Scap crouches against the wall, breathing hard. Fulton’s 
           nowhere in sight. The house keeps screaming. 

           Gracie enters, gun drawn. Scap shakes his head, yells.

                                 SCAP
                        --touch--anything!

           Gracie nods. Scap motions towards the kitchen, moves 
           slowly upstairs.

           INT. KITCHEN, BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           All the kitchen appliances rattle. Radios blare. An ocean 
           of noise. Thick smoke fills the room, emanating from the 
           oven. 

           Gracie enters slowly through a swinging door. 

           EXT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM, BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           Scap pads silently into the master bedroom, shotgun 
           pointed. No sign of Fulton. 

           The house keeps shrieking...

           INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           The front door opens. TWO BLACK BOOTS step over the 
           broken TV. They’re totally silent under all the noise. 
           INT. KITCHEN, BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           Gracie peers around a corner. She opens a window, coughs 
           smoke. She eyes the basement door, throws it open. 

           No sign of Fulton. 

           Gracie begins to pedal down the stairs, rifle trained on 
           the darkness.  

           Suddenly Gracie FREEZES. 

           Through the swinging kitchen door, she catches flashes of 
           FULTON. His pistol is pointed right at her heart. 

           There’s a sad look on Fulton’s face. He doesn’t want to 
           pull the trigger. 

           A beat. 

           The door swings between them. Music blares. Smoke alarms 
           scream. 

           Gracie yanks up her rifle...

           INT. HALLWAY, BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           Alastair moves tentatively down the hall, rifle drawn as--

           Two muffled THUMPS in the next room. Barely audible. 
           Alastair races around the corner.

           EXT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM, BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT  

           Upstairs, Scap can’t hear the gunshots. 

           Fulton’s nowhere in sight. Confused, Scap enters the 
           bathroom and shuts the door, blocking out the din. 

                                 SCAP
                                 (yells, muffled into radio)
                        Gracie? Alastair? Can ye hear me?! 
                        Fulton’s not here! Ye gotta get the feck 
                        out o’ the house!

           INT. KITCHEN, BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           The room shrieks. BULLET HOLES in the kitchen door. 

           Alastair can’t hear Scap screaming through the radio. He 
           rushes through the smoke, finds Gracie lying on the floor 
           with blood dribbling out of her chest. Fulton’s taken her 
           rifle. 
           Alastair spots BLOOD on the floor, the tread of a BOOT 
           stamped into it. He starts moving slowly out the back 
           door...

           INT. HALLWAY, BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT 

           Scap rushes back towards the kitchen, shotgun pointed 
           as...

           EXT. STAIRCASE, BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           Outside, Alastair pads softly down the crooked staircase 
           under the house.

           INT. KITCHEN, BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           Scap bursts in, sees Gracie lying dead on the floor. His 
           face falls. 

           The house keeps screaming...

           EXT. STAIRCASE, BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           Underneath the house, Alastair STOPS in his tracks, 
           confused. 

           He spies FULTON standing far out on the beach, in plain 
           sight. He’s holding a hand out. 

           Alastair raises the RIFLE to his eye, aims. 

           ALASTAIR’S POV - RIFLE SCOPE

           Fulton’s out of focus, too far away for a shot. Alastair 
           adjusts the sight. 

           Gradually Fulton comes into focus:

           Fulton’s looking straight back at Alastair. In his 
           outstretched hand is a small black REMOTE. 

           BACK TO SCENE

           Alastair looks up at the underside of the house. 

           Strapped to the stilt supports are four EXPLOSIVE CHARGES 
           with little red lights on them.

           One by one, they all begin to BLINK.  

                                 ALASTAIR
                                 (nods)
                        Aye.
           EXT. BEACH - TWILIGHT

           Fulton watches as--

           CRACK! a MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks the foundation of the 
           house. Instantly it COLLAPSES, tumbling over Alastair in 
           great chunks and cascading down the sandy bluff onto the 
           beach. 

           A long beat as the house settles.

           EXT. BLUFFS, WRECKAGE - TWILIGHT

           A smoking pile of charred wood, steel, and glass running 
           up and down the bluffs. 

           FULTON steps over the rubble, rifle pointed, kicking up 
           chunks of sidewall to make sure he’s finished the job. He 
           spots Gracie’s body lying sprawled near the top of the 
           hill. 

           Fulton keeps digging. Off in one corner, a charred FIST 
           sticks out from under a sheet of metal. Fulton slowly 
           pries it up, points the rifle. 

           It’s ALASTAIR, a mess of blood and broken bones. 

           Fulton keeps digging carefully through the rubble, rifle 
           pointed. 

           There’s no sign of Scap’s body. 

           Confused, Fulton pulls the phone out of Gracie’s pocket, 
           trudges slowly up the hill, rifle in hand. 

           INT. SCAP’S VAN - TWILIGHT

           Fulton climbs inside Scap’s van, puts the rifle down in 
           his lap. The keys are still in the ignition.

           He pulls out his phone, hands shaky, dials. It picks up 
           on the first ring. 

                                 FIONA (O.S.)
                                 (anxious)
                        Kevin? 

           Relief washes over Fulton’s face. 

                                 FULTON
                        Hey love.

                                 FIONA (O.S.)
                        Are ya alright? 
                                 FULTON
                        Aye. I’m fine. 

           Fulton eyes a pack of Scap’s cigarettes on the floor. He 
           bends down, picks them up, pops one in his mouth. 

                                 FULTON (CONT'D)
                        Just hold tight, I’ll be there in twenty 
                        minutes. 

                                 FIONA (O.S.)
                        Will we be able to go back home? 

           Fulton sits back up, doesn’t respond. He STARES out 
           through the windshield.  

           OUTSIDE 

           the door of the other van is open. 

           Scap stands directly in front of Fulton, shotgun pointed 
           at Fulton’s face. 

           A beat. 

                                 FIONA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Kevin? 

                                 FULTON
                        I love y--

           INT. FIONA’S MOTEL ROOM - TWILIGHT

           Fiona sits on the edge of the bed, clutching the cell. 

           THROUGH THE PHONE: CRACK! A gunshot. Then the low whine 
           of a CAR HORN. 

                                 FIONA
                        Kevin? 
                                 (no answer)
                        Kevin?!

           No answer. The car horn keeps blaring. 

           Then the line goes dead. 

           INT. FULTON’S VAN - TWILIGHT

           Blood, broken glass. Fulton’s body lies sprawled across 
           the wheel.  

           Scap pockets Fulton’s phone. The horn dies as Scap peels 
           Fulton off the wheel and drags him out of the van.  
           Scap climbs into the driver’s seat, starts the car. He 
           lights up a cigarette and drives off. 

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           Fulton lies dead on the ground. The falling snow begins 
           to form little piles on top of him. 

                                                               FADE OUT.

           EXT. CHURCH, MONTAUK - NIGHT

           A tiny Catholic church. An empty parking lot. A light on 
           inside. Scap’s van pulls up, stops. 

           INT. CHURCH, MONTAUK - TWILIGHT

           Empty pews. The oak door cracks open. Scap enters 
           silently, his palms sticky with blood.

           He eyes the CONFESSIONAL, walks slowly towards it. His 
           footsteps play off the stone walls.

           Scap reaches the booth. As before, he knocks twice, then 
           enters.

           INT. CONFESSIONAL - TWILIGHT

           Scap shuts the door behind him, exhausted. 

           He reaches under the seat, pulls out a BLACK BRIEFCASE. 

           An obscured FACE moves behind the wooden screen. A 
           muffled voice, a familiar BRITISH ACCENT.  

                                 CHILDS (O.S.)
                        Agent Stakeknife?

           Scap opens the briefcase. Inside:

           1) A fat stack of bills. 
           2) A bottle of Scotch.
           3) A manila folder.  

                                 SCAP
                                 (distant)
                        Aye. 

                                 CHILDS (O.S.) 
                        Is Fulton dead? 

                                 SCAP
                        Aye. 
                                 CHILDS (O.S.)
                        Outstanding. 
                                 (then)
                        I’ve spoken to headquarters. If we 
                        continue like this, they see no reason 
                        why we couldn’t have you on the Army 
                        Council within the next year. If you’re 
                        up to it, of course.

           Scap’s eyes are focused somewhere else. 

                                 SCAP 
                        Where are ya gonna bury him?

           A beat. 

                                 CHILDS (O.S.)
                        Excuse me?

                                 SCAP
                        It can’t be in Milltown, right? Cause the 
                        Catholics think he’s a traitor. And it 
                        can’t be with the proddies, cause he’s 
                        killed a dozen o’ theirs. And I know ya 
                        ain’t takin’ him back to England, right, 
                        cause what Brit wants to be buried next 
                        to some feckin’ terrorist? 
                                 (then)
                        So I guess we’ll just leave him out there 
                        by the sea.

           A beat. 

                                 CHILDS (O.S.)
                        Is something bothering you, Freddie? 

                                 SCAP
                        Reckon I’m just wondering how long it’s 
                        gonna take before what happens to Fulton, 
                        happens to me. 
                                 (then)
                        And then where it is exactly ya plan on 
                        burying me. 

                                 CHILDS (O.S.)
                        Freddie, relax. You’ve nothing to worry 
                        about. Fulton never had the stomach for 
                        this work. His guilt, his remorse had 
                        been an issue for years. To be perfectly 
                        blunt, we’ve never had that problem with 
                        you. 

           Scap stares down at the money in the briefcase.
                                 SCAP
                        Aye. 

                                 CHILDS (O.S.)
                                 (miffed)
                        I’ll see you back at home. 

           Childs exits the booth. 

           Scap reaches into the briefcase and opens the manila 
           folder. 

           Inside is a picture of Agent Dignan.   

           Scap twists opens the bottle of Scotch and begins to 
           drink. 

                                                               FADE OUT.

           EXT. FULTON’S HOUSE, BELFAST - DAY 

           A van outside. It’s loaded up with boxes, clothes. All of 
           Fulton’s possessions.  

           INT. FULTON’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           A plane ticket to Barcelona sits on top of a stack of 
           cardboard boxes. Everything’s been packed away. 

           Fiona seals shut a box of records. Her priest, now in 
           plainclothes, stands in the kitchen doorway, sipping tea. 

                                 PRIEST
                        Thanks again for the donations. 
                        You sure there’s nothin’ I can do to 
                        convince you to stay now? 

                                 FIONA 
                        Really, Father. I’ll be alright. I just 
                        need to go someplace a bit sunnier for 
                        awhile. Clear me head. 

                                 PRIEST
                                 (sadly)
                        I understand. Do ya some good, that will. 

           The doorbell rings. Fiona looks up.

                                 PRIEST (CONT'D)
                        Expectin’ someone? 

                                 FIONA
                        Probably the movers.
           EXT. FULTON’S HOUSE, BELFAST - DAY 

           Fiona opens the door. There’s no one outside. 

           A SMALL BROWN PACKAGE sits on the doorstep. It’s marked 
           ‘Fiona Fulton’. 

           There’s no return address. 

           Fiona looks up and down the street. It’s entirely empty 
           except for a TRUCK rattling away in the distance. 

           Fiona picks up the package. Slowly she begins opens it. 

           It’s stuffed with cash. Thousands and thousands of Irish 
           Pounds.

           Fiona looks up, watches the truck as it turns a corner 
           and disappears. 

           INT. SCAP’S TRUCK - DAY

           Scap drives away in silence. 

           As he stares out at the road, very slowly his expression 
           starts to CHANGE. 

           Gradually Scap’s cold stare falls away. 

           Dread and remorse begin to crawl silently across his 
           face.  

                                                               FADE OUT.

                                 END

           THE INFILTRATOR
