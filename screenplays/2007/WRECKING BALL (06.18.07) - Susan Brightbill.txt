                      “Now, I know I’ve got a heart because it’s breaking.” 

                                                      - The Tin Man 
                                                                FADE IN

           ON A LITTLE GIRL

           CORINNE CORKE (5).  Beautiful, but with the devil in her.  
           Rambunctious like a boy.  Cunning like a girl.  She slams 
           every door.  Breaks every heirloom.  Trips on every rug.   

           She’s in the kitchen of an upscale home wearing a pink parka, 
           snow pants, boots, goggles and mittens.  She sings -- 

                                 CORINNE
                        You are my sunshine.  My only 
                        sunshine.   

           She pauses briefly at the ADVENT CALENDAR, then takes off her 
           mitten, opens the remaining three doors and shoves the 
           chocolates into her mouth.    

           She waddles to the cupboard, undoes the security latch, and 
           takes out a COOKIE SHEET.  

                                 CORINNE
                        You make me happy when skies are 
                        gray. 

           She lumbers into the living room, brushing the CHRISTMAS 
           TREE.  It rocks back and forth, but doesn’t tip over.  It’s 
           strapped to the wall.  Look closely.  There are safety straps 
           and pads on every possible hazard.  

           Corinne climbs the steps.  One at time -- managing the cookie 
           sheet and the cumbersome winter attire.  She trips, then 
           regains her footing.  Keeps climbing.  Fourteen steps up.

                                 CORINNE
                        You’ll never know, dear.  How much 
                        I love you.

           At the top of the stairs, she turns around and sits on the 
           cookie sheet.  It is a sled and this is her mountain.  She 
           lowers the goggles.  Prepares to launch.  

           REVERSE ANGLE on the piano at the bottom of the steps.  The 
           brass pedals.  No safety pads around them.  

           Back at the top, Corinne scoots toward the ledge.

                                 CORINNE
                        Please don’t take my sunshine away.  

           And Corinne hurls herself down the stairs.  She’s flying.  
           Squealing with joy.  Barreling toward the piano.  Oblivious 
           to any sort of danger.  
           At the bottom, just inches before crashing into the steel 
           pedals, a hand reaches in and snatches her from the sled.  
           The cookie sheet CLANGS into the piano.

                                 LAURA
                        Corinne!  What are you doing?!

           Corinne’s mother, LAURA CORKE (39), is a structured woman.  
           Elegant in appearance, steadfast in beliefs.  The sort of 
           person you don’t pick a fight with because you’ll lose.  

                                 CORINNE
                        I was sledding.

                                 LAURA
                        We don’t sled in Southern 
                        California.

                                 CORINNE
                        But Mom, I need to practice for 
                        Grandma and Grandpa’s house.  

                                 LAURA
                        The only thing you need to practice 
                        for Grandma and Grandpa’s house is 
                        manners.  And patience.
                            (under her breath)
                        And how to endure pain.  Listen, no 
                        more sledding.  You could get hurt.  
                        And what’s Mommy’s job?

                                 CORINNE
                        Architect.

                                 LAURA
                        No, that’s my work.  But, what’s my 
                        most important job in the whole 
                        wide world?  

                                 CORINNE
                        Keep me safe.

                                 LAURA
                        That’s right.  My job is to keep  
                        you safe.  So, stop trying to get 
                        me fired. 

           Corinne lights up and runs into the kitchen.

                                 CORINNE (O.S.)
                        Mom!  Come on.  I think it’s time!
           KITCHEN

           Laura enters and finds Corinne jumping up and down next to 
           the pantry.    

                                 CORINNE
                        Can I have my fruit snacks now?

                                 LAURA
                        You know the rule.     

                                 LAURA
                        But, Mom!  Pleeaase?

                                 LAURA
                        What time is it?

           Corinne looks at the digital clock above the microwave.

                                 CORINNE
                        One oh one eight. 

                                 LAURA
                        Then I don’t want to hear about it 
                        for another twelve minutes. 

           Laura unplugs the toaster and the coffee pot.  Then, wipes 
           the already spotless counter. 

                                 CORINNE
                        Now is it time?  

                                 LAURA
                        Have you seen your brother?

           INT. LOFT - MORNING

           A giant playroom that’s covered in toys.  Model airplanes.  
           Board games.  An Etch-A-Sketch.  Light Brites.  A fish mural 
           on the wall and cartoon sketches everywhere.

           Laura opens the door and sticks her head in.

                                 LAURA
                        The car will be here soon and our 
                        plane is on time.  So you need to 
                        come finish packing.

           SPIN AROUND to find Laura’s husband, CHARLIE (40).  Happy, 
           innocent, predictable.  Like a golden retriever.  This is his 
           office.  He’s tosses a Nerfball to Laura.
                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll just wrap up a few things.  

                                 LAURA
                            (catching the ball)
                        Says the man who’s missed a hundred 
                        planes.  

           She walks the Nerfball back to him.  He pulls her to his lap.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know, Santa says you’ve been 
                        way too nice this year.   

                                 LAURA
                        Well, we can’t both be naughty 
                        because nothing would get done.

           She gives him a quick kiss.  After eleven years of marriage, 
           these two are still a good fit.

                                 LAURA
                        Twenty five minutes until the car 
                        gets here.  Get moving.

           On her way out, something about the crown moulding catches 
           her eye.  She runs her finger across it -- upset.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s starting to come apart.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Laura, it’s fine.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s that glue.  I told Carlos not 
                        to use it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s one tiny crack.

                                 LAURA
                            (beat)
                        That’s how it all starts.

           On her way out --

                                 LAURA
                        Hey, have you seen Oscar?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Last I knew he was ironing.  
           EXT. HOUSE - FRONT STEP

           OSCAR CORKE (9) is sitting on the front step next to his 
           suitcase, wearing a tie and khakis.  Laura opens the door.

                                 LAURA
                        There you are.  Whatcha doing?

                                 OSCAR
                        Waiting for the car.  

                                 LAURA
                        You’re a little early.

                                 OSCAR
                        Better early than late.  Hey, guess 
                        what?  I have a loose tooth. 

                                 LAURA
                        You do?  Let’s see.  

           She sits down next to him.

                                 OSCAR
                        My lateral incisor. 

           Laura wiggles it.  It’s just a tad loose.

                                 LAURA
                        Well, I’ll be.  

                                 OSCAR
                        If I lose it in West Virginia, do 
                        you think the tooth fairy will 
                        still find me?  

                                 LAURA
                        I think the tooth fairy’s pretty 
                        connected.  I mean, with the 
                        internet and all. 

                                 CORINNE (O.S.)
                        Mom, it’s time!!

           Laura checks her watch.  Ten thirty on the dot.  

                                 OSCAR
                        I just don’t get it.  Fruit snacks 
                        don’t have any nutritional value 
                        and they get stuck in your teeth.  
                        What’s the big deal?  
           Corinne throws open the door and jumps up and down -- out of 
           her mind with excitement.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Fruit snacks!  Fruit snacks! 

                                 LAURA
                            (to Oscar)
                        I think she likes the hippo shapes. 

           INT. TOWN CAR - LATER

           Laura, Charlie, Oscar and the DRIVER are waiting in the car.  

                                 LAURA
                        Corinne, come on.  Right now.  

           Outside, Corinne is petting the neighborhood DACHSHUND. 

                                 CORINNE
                        You’re so cute.  Wanna come on the 
                        plane with us?    

                                 LAURA
                        Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m on it.

           Charlie gets out, swoops up Corinne and climbs back in.  The 
           driver starts the car.  Pulls away from the curb.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        All right.  Let’s get this vacation 
                        started.  

                                 LAURA
                        Vacation?  A vacation is daily yoga 
                        classes and grain alcohol served in 
                        coconuts.  Not Christmas with my 
                        father and his new wife. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Laura, they’ve been married for 
                        seventeen years.  Stop calling 
                        Alice his new wife. 

                                 CORINNE
                        Can we get a dog?

                                 LAURA
                        No.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        But, Grandma has a kitty.

                                 CORINNE
                        She does?  What’s kitty’s name?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sugar.  

                                 LAURA
                        Did you at least pack the grain 
                        alcohol?

           Laura looks out the window -- filled with dread.  

           INT. AIRPLANE - LATER

           Charlie and Corinne are in the same row, with Laura and Oscar 
           in the row in front of them.   

           Charlie is reading to Corinne from the book “Germs.”

                                 CHARLIE
                        “Later that morning the bubonic bus 
                        arrived to take Pox and the other 
                        cadets to Germ Academy - where 
                        minor infections are turned into 
                        real germs.”  

           Corinne is kicking Laura’s seat. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        “Once Pox had passed his physical 
                        to prove that he was unhealthy, he 
                        was shown to the dorm where he met

                        Pus.  And Scab.  And Rash.

                                 CORINNE
                        What about that one?

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s Snot.  “After lights out the 
                        other germs gathered about Pox to

                        terrible outbreak which a relative 
                        had started.  

           Laura turns around and pops her head over the seat.  
                                 LAURA
                        Hey, I have an idea.  Why don’t we 
                        read the letter Grandma Alice sent.

                                 OSCAR
                        What letter?

           Laura pulls A LETTER out of her pocket.  

                                 LAURA
                        The dreaded annual Christmas 
                        letter.

                                 CHARLIE
                        When did that come?

                                 LAURA
                        Last week.  It always puts me in a 
                        bad mood, so I saved it for the 
                        flight.

                                 CHARLIE

           While they disembark from the plane, WE continue to hear the 
           Christmas letter, but now in a older, saccharine voice.  With 
           a hint of a southern lilt --

                        The renovation on our house is 
                        finally complete.  After a year of 
                        work, we have gotten rid of the 
                        moldy, old house that was here and 
                        replaced it with a real winner.  

           The family makes their way to baggage claim.

                        Hope Memorial Hospital.  I remain 
                        active in the church and remind you 
                        it’s never to late to accept Jesus 
                        into your life.  And last June, my

           spot starting to form on her chin.

                        This year we are blessed to have 
                        our family with us over the 
                        holiday.  Grandkids Oscar and 
                        Corinne are absolute delights who 
                        seem to grow by the minute.  We’re 
                        so proud of their father, Charlie, 
                        a successful animator in Hollywood.

                        Saturday mornings.  And Pierce’s 
                        daughter, Laura, has finally traded 
                        in her architectural career to be a 
                        stay-at-home mom.  Good for her!

                        It’s a pimple.  I can’t remember 
                        the last time I had one.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Actually, I think it was the last 
                        time we were here.

                        Charlie!  Laura! 

           ALICE ATKINS (63) is at the curb.  She’s cheery.  Excited.  
           Big, warm smile.  Cross around her neck.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh my god.

           Corinne runs and hugs her.  Alice smothers her in kisses.

                        Oh, let me look at you.  Look how 
                        big you’ve gotten.

                        Alice.  What are you doing?  I told 
                        you we’d meet you at the house. 

                                 ALICE
                        I know, but we’re so excited.  
                        Besides, a car service isn’t 
                        family!  Gimme a squeeze.

           Alice opens her arms.  Laura gives a fake smile and walks 
           into the embrace.

                                 ALICE
                        Don’t you look pretty. 

                                 LAURA
                        You sound surprised.

                        Thanks for finally bringing your 
                        family out this way.  Corinne.  
                        Come here and give me another

                        And a pogo stick.  And Spiderman

                        He’s circling.  They charge three 
                        dollars to park, so he likes to 
                        circle. He’s so excited to see you.

                            (quietly, to Charlie)
                        Please.  My father hasn’t had an

           PIERCE ATKINS (69) pulls up in his spotless BMW SUV.  An 
           exceedingly intelligent man.  Unemotional.  The alpha male in

                                 PIERCE
                        I hate flying.  I always get stuck 
                        by the john -- between the hippie 
                        motormouth who’s opposed to 
                        deodorant and the overweight slouch 
                        who needs to have his adenoids 
                        taken out.  Then I pay six dollars 
                        for some Craisins, watch a movie 
                        about talking chickens and correct 
                        the crossword puzzle that five 
                        people before me answered

                        brownies. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know, Laura’s actually going 
                        back to work in the new year.

                                 ALICE
                        You are?

                                 LAURA
                        That was always the plan.  It’s 
                        just taken longer than expected.

                                 OSCAR
                        She has to work.  She was voted 
                        best architect in southern 
                        California.  

                                 PIERCE
                        That was five years ago.

                                 ALICE
                        Boy, if I had these children, you 
                        wouldn’t be able to tear me away 
                        from them.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Daddy sit in the back!
                                 LAURA
                        Just ignore her.  

                                 PIERCE
                            (disapproving)
                        Doesn’t she get a time out?  You 
                        said if she mentioned it one more 
                        time...

                                 LAURA
                        I can handle it, thank you.

                                 ALICE
                        I read that children need 
                        discipline and --

                                 LAURA
                        Please don’t second guess me, 
                        Alice.  If you wanted to be a 
                        parent, you should have had kids.

           Awkward silence.  Then, Pierce nods at Laura’s pimple.

                                 PIERCE
                        I see you’ve got a little spot 
                        there on your chin.  

           Laura freezes.  In the rear view mirror -- 

                                 PIERCE
                        No nervous breakdowns on the ride 
                        home.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Can Daddy sit in the back now?

           INT./EXT CAR - DUSK

           As they turn down the lane, Laura takes in the old 
           neighborhood.

                                 OSCAR
                        Hey, look.  Arbor Lane.  That’s the 
                        street Mom grew up on.

                                 LAURA
                        It sure is.  

           Laura sees a CONSTRUCTION CREW bulldozing a vacant lot.
                                 LAURA
                        Dad, what happened to the Wollers’s 
                        house?

                                 PIERCE
                        An oncologist bought it and tore it 
                        down.  He’s building a mansion.

                                 ALICE
                        An eyesore, if you ask me.  

                                 LAURA
                        What a waste.  The Wollers built 
                        that house by hand.  It took years 
                        to put up.

                                 PIERCE
                        And one day to come down.

           At the end of a cul-de-sac, Pierce turns into a driveway.  A 
           Victorian home surrounded by sugar maples and white pines.  
           Weathered, but elegant.   

           INT. HOUSE - DUSK

           They file in and take in the newly remodeled house.  It’s 
           definitely a grandma’s house.  Doilies.  Lace curtains.  
           Candy bowls.  And cluttered like it’s been there a thousand 
           years.  Plenty of crosses, too.

                                 LAURA
                            (yuck)
                        Wow.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s nice.

                                 PIERCE
                        Alice did it herself.  

                                 LAURA
                        I can tell.   

                                 ALICE
                        Oscar, you’re in your mom’s old 
                        room, which is now my workout area.  
                        And Corinne, dear, you’re in the 
                        old sewing room.  At the top of the 
                        stairs.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll get the kids settled.  
           As the kids head upstairs, Corinne calls out --

                                 CORINNE (O.S.)
                        Sugar?  Sugar!  

                                 ALICE
                        Oh, Sugar’s...

                                 LAURA
                        We know.  We haven’t told her yet. 

                                 ALICE
                        So, Laura, what do you think?

                                 LAURA
                        I think you’ve made a lot of 
                        changes.

                                 ALICE
                        That was the point.  It was time 
                        for an update.  Don’t you think?   

                                 LAURA
                        I don’t know, Alice.  What happens 
                        under this roof has nothing to do 
                        with me anymore.  

           Alice picks up a nearby plate of BROWNIES.

                                 ALICE
                        Brownie?  

                                 LAURA
                        No, thank you.  I try to stay away 
                        from sweets. 

           Alice blanches -- couldn’t be more offended.

                                 ALICE
                        I’m sure the kids will have some.

           Alice takes the plate and heads upstairs.   

           Alone, Laura looks around the room.  

           This used to be her house.  Her home.  Her world.  But, 
           nothing is familiar now.  Certainly not the people. 

           She picks up a PHOTOGRAPH of a dark-haired WOMAN whose smile 
           could light the world.  She’s laughing.  Wearing a cowboy 
           hat.  The face of someone you wish you knew.    

           Pierce enters.
                                 PIERCE
                        I put your bags in the guest room.  
                        You need anything?      

                                 LAURA
                        What happened to the china hutch?

                                 PIERCE
                        It’s in storage.

                                 LAURA
                        And the dining room table?

                                 PIERCE
                        It’s all there.  All her stuff.  
                        You might want it someday.  

                                 LAURA
                        Don’t you?

                                 PIERCE
                        Alice and I have new things. 

                                 LAURA
                            (re the photo)
                        I’m surprised you’re allowed to 
                        have this up.  Did you have to get 
                        permission?  

                                 PIERCE
                        You will be respectful of Alice 
                        while you’re in her house.  

                                 LAURA
                        Her house?

                                 PIERCE
                        Don’t start, Laura.  I didn’t put 
                        that picture there.  Alice did.  
                        This morning.  

           Pierce turns to walk away.  

           Laura puts the photo back on the shelf. 

                                 LAURA
                        How come we didn’t take more 
                        photos?

           Pierce stops.  Without turning back --
                                 PIERCE
                        Because we thought we’d have more 
                        opportunities to do so.  

           INT. WORKOUT ROOM - A BIT LATER

           Laura peeks her head in and finds Oscar meticulously 
           unpacking and making the room his own.

                                 LAURA
                        Hey.

           Laura looks around.  A treadmill, recumbent bike, hand 
           weights and a scale.  The wallpaper is an overbearing floral 
           pattern.  

                                 OSCAR
                        Grandma said this used to be your 
                        room.

                                 LAURA
                        Yeah, before it became a Curves.

                                 OSCAR
                        What was it like?

                                 LAURA
                        I had a canopy bed, Pat Benatar 
                        posters everywhere and really cool 
                        rainbow wallpaper.  And my mom used 
                        to say I was the pot of gold.  

           Oscar smiles.  He likes hearing his mom’s stories.  

                                 LAURA
                        Actually...

           Laura walks over to the corner.  She examines the new 
           wallpaper.  Then takes her fingernail and behind a curtain, 
           so no one will see, Laura peels back the floral wallpaper, 
           revealing a slight bit of the OLD RAINBOW PAPER.

                                 LAURA
                        Come here, Oscar.  Look.

                                 OSCAR
                        Cool.  Why’s it still there?  

                                 LAURA
                        Lazy workers.  They papered right 
                        over the old stuff. 
                                 OSCAR
                        I’m glad they left it up.  It’s 
                        proof you were here. 

           A wave of nostalgia washes over Laura.    

                                 LAURA
                        Yeah.  I guess so. 

                                 OSCAR
                        Like a fossil!

                                 LAURA
                        Watch it.

           Charlie sticks his head in the door.  He’s got Corinne on his 
           back, piggy back-style.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Happy hour and touch football down 
                        at the stream in five minutes.  All 
                        in favor say “team” on three.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        One, two...

                                 ALL
                        Team on three!

           EXT. BACK YARD - DUSK - LATER

           Behind the house is a greenbelt that bellies up against a 
           simple stream.   

           Oscar and Charlie are tossing a FOOTBALL back and forth. 

                                 LAURA
                        Grandma says dinner’s in five 
                        minutes!

           Laura walks over to Pierce, who’s watching Corinne throw 
           rocks into the water. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Any chance we’ll get a white 
                        Christmas?

                                 PIERCE
                        Hell, I don’t know.  This is the 
                        warmest December in years.

           Laura looks at the landscape. 
                                 LAURA
                        That willow’s getting old.  She’s 
                        weeping more than I remember.

                                 PIERCE
                        She spent her entire tree life 
                        sobbing.  What do you expect?
                        Hey, what’s that thing on Corinne’s 
                        neck?

                                 LAURA
                        Huh?  

                                 PIERCE
                        She’s got a -- thing.  A bump.

                                 LAURA
                        What bump?  

                                 PIERCE
                        Hey, Corinne.  Come here.

                                 CORINNE
                        I’m not hungry!

                                 LAURA
                        Corinne, you have to the count of 
                        three to get over here.  One.

           Corinne doesn’t budge.

                                 LAURA
                        Two.

           Still not moving.

                                 LAURA
                        Three.

           Corinne runs over.  Her pants soaking wet.  Hands, muddy.    

                                 CORINNE
                        I don’t know how my socks got wet. 

                                 LAURA
                        Corinne, let me see something.  

           Laura squats down and takes a look.

           On the side of her neck, next to the jugular vein, is a LUMP 
           about the size of a quarter.
                                 PIERCE
                        See it?

                                 LAURA
                        Yeah.  What is that?  

           Pierce touches it. 

                                 CORINNE
                        Stop!

                                 PIERCE
                        Does that hurt?  

           Corinne squirms away and runs off.  

                                 PIERCE
                        How long has it been there?

                                 LAURA
                        I don’t know.  That’s the first 
                        time I’ve seen it.  

           Charlie walks up.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Seen what?

                                 LAURA
                        Corinne has a thing on her neck.  

                                 PIERCE
                        It’s a lump.

                                 CHARLIE
                        She fell off her bike last week.   

                                 PIERCE
                        No, it’s not a bruise.  Has she 
                        been sick?

           Laura shakes her head.  

                                 PIERCE
                        Fever?  Anything?

                                 LAURA
                        No.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why?
                                 PIERCE
                        That’s where the lymph nodes are.  
                        If she’s been sick, that would 
                        explain why it’s swollen.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do we need to do something, Pierce?

                                 PIERCE
                        We’ll just keep an eye on it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m sure it’s nothing.  Hey, Oscar!  
                        Go deep!  

           He chucks the football -- a bomb if ever there was one.

           INT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - NEXT DAY

           Corinne’s on the table, in her clothes. While Alice dotes on 
           her, Pierce is showing Oscar how to use a STETHOSCOPE.  Laura 
           and Charlie spring to their feet when the door opens.

           DR. TOM LANCASTER (58).  Seasoned.  Head of the department.

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        Pierce.

                                 PIERCE
                        Tom.  Thanks for coming in on such 
                        short notice.

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        Please.  You saved my mother’s 
                        life.  It’s the least I could do.

                                 PIERCE
                        This is my daughter, Laura, and her 
                        husband, Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE/LAURA
                        Hi. / Nice to meet you.

           Turning his attention to Corinne --

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        And you must be Corinne.  Can I 
                        take a look at your neck?

                                 CORINNE
                        No.  Everyone’s been poking it.  
                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        Please?  I’ll be gentle.  

                                 CORINNE
                        No.

                                 LAURA
                        I’ll get you a something from the 
                        vending machine.

                                 CORINNE
                        Okay.

           Pierce glances at her -- disapprovingly.

                                 LAURA
                        Yes, I use bribes.  I also use the 
                        TV as a babysitter and Happy Meals 
                        as a bargaining tool.  Got a 
                        problem with it?

           Pierce turns his attention back to Dr. Lancaster, who’s 
           looking at Corinne’s neck.

                                 PIERCE
                        There’s no fever.  No recent 
                        history of the flu, a cold, 
                        anything.  And --

           His voice trails off.

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        And?

                                 PIERCE
                        It was half that size yesterday.

           All business now --

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        I’ll order the blood test.  And 
                        let’s schedule a biopsy for this 
                        afternoon, just in case.

                                 LAURA
                        Biopsy?  Wait.  For what?  

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        We just need to get more 
                        information.  That’s all.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        But it’s almost Christmas.
                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        And I want to do it before the 
                        holiday.

                                 LAURA
                        What do you think it --

                                 PIERCE
                        There’s really no point speculating 
                        until we have the blood work back.

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        That’s exactly right.

                                 PIERCE
                        Tom, I’ll walk you out.

           And they leave.  Laura looks at Charlie -- shell-shocked.

           INT. OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

           Dr. Lancaster talks to Laura, Charlie and Pierce.  Laura 
           drums her fingers on her leg.  

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        The blood work wasn’t what I was 
                        hoping for.  

           Laura’s face drops.  She grabs Charlie’s hand.  

                                 PIERCE
                        Okay.

                                 LAURA
                        Okay?  What does that mean?

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        Corinne’s lymph node is reacting to 
                        something and we don’t know what.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, what could it be?

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        A viral or bacterial infection.  
                        There’s a chance it could be 
                        something called Cat Scratch Fever.  
                        Maybe mumps.  Mono.  Or --

           He doesn’t want to say it.  Pierce says it for him.  
                                 PIERCE
                        Lymphoma.

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        I’m afraid so. 

                                 LAURA
                        Lymphoma.  That’s --

                                 PIERCE
                        Cancer.

           The color drains from Laura’s face. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        She doesn’t have cancer.

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        Is there a history in the family?

           The brief pause means yes.  

                         PIERCE
                                                         LAURA
           My wife.
                                             My mother.

                                 PIERCE
                        She had a brain tumor.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is ridiculous.  Corinne’s 
                        perfectly healthy.  We’d know if 
                        something was wrong with her. 

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        That’s what we need to find out.  I 
                        moved my schedule around.  I’ll do 
                        the surgery this afternoon.  

                                 LAURA
                        This afternoon?!  Just wait a 
                        goddamn minute.  Shouldn’t we get a 
                        second opinion or something?  

                                 PIERCE
                        I’m the second opinion.  And we’re 
                        wasting time here.  

                                 LAURA
                        No!  You’re not making decisions 
                        for me.  Not anymore. 
                                 PIERCE
                        Fine.  Bring in someone else.  
                        They’ll tell you the same thing.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Corinne’s been admitted.  Laura holds a HOSPITAL GOWN in 
           front of Corinne.  Charlie watches from the corner.  

                                 CORINNE
                        I don’t want to!

                                 LAURA
                        Corinne, you have to wear it.  The  
                        nurse said so.    

                                 CORINNE
                        Noooo!  It’s yucky.  

           A NURSE pokes her head in the door.

                                 NURSE
                        All set?

                                 LAURA
                        Not quite.     

                                 CHARLIE
                        Just give us a few more minutes.  

           The nurse leaves.  Charlie takes over.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know, I wouldn’t want to wear 
                        this, either.  It’s just a boring 
                        old hospital gown.  But what if it 
                        was a princess dress?

                                 CORINNE
                        Huh?

           He takes a magic marker out of his back pocket and he starts 
           to draw on it, putting his animating skills to work.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Like you’re going to the ball.  It 
                        should have big, poofy sleeves, 
                        don’t you think?

           She smiles and nods.  He draws sleeves on it.
                                 CHARLIE
                        And what else?

                                 CORINNE
                        Lace.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Lace.  Of course.

           He draws a V-neck, lace bodice down the front.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        And you gotta have a fluffy skirt. 

           Charlie continues to draw -- transforming the gown into 
           something magical. 

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           Laura, Charlie and Corinne (now in the gown) walk down the 
           hallway, hand in hand. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        And it’ll be just like Snow White.  
                        You lie very still.  And before you 
                        know it, you’ll be sleeping and 
                        dreaming. 

                                 CORINNE
                        I’m gonna dream about Santa!

                                 LAURA
                        Okay.  Santa, it is.

           A nurse awaits.  She takes Corinne’s hand.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Hey, Daddy.  You wanna come with 
                        me?

           ON Charlie’s face.  All the things he can’t say.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I can’t.  I got my own dreams.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Like what?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Like your wedding.  
                                 CORINNE
                            (laughing)
                        You’re silly.

           Laura gives Corinne a kiss.  Trying to hide her concern.

                                 LAURA
                        Want to say “team” on three?

                                 CORINNE
                        But, Oscar’s not here.  We’re not a 
                        team unless we’re all together.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s right.  Now, Corinne, you go 
                        with...
                            (to the nurse)
                        What’s your name?

                                 NURSE
                        I’m Claire.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, Claire.  This is the fairest 
                        princess in all the land.  You take 
                        good care of her.

                                 NURSE
                        I sure will.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey.  What rhymes with Claire?  

                                 CORINNE
                        Bear!

                                 NURSE
                        That’s right.  What else?  

           The nurse takes Corinne hand, walking her down the hall.  
           Away from Charlie.  Away from Laura.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Chair.

                                 NURSE
                        Yep.  

           To the operating room.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Hair.
           They round a corner and she’s out of sight. 

           Charlie turns to Laura.  He rubs the wrinkle between her 
           brow.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Come on now.  We spent a lot of 
                        money to have that removed.

           -- and she falls into his arms, crying.    

           INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - LATER

           Laura’s arranging the magazines in alphabetical order.  

           Charlie and Oscar do a crossword puzzle.  

           Alice sits off to the side, reading “The Daily Prayer.”   

           INT. OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME

           Pierce watches the surgery.  Not bothered at all.  May as 
           well be a stranger on the table.

           INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - HOURS LATER

           Dr. Lancaster comes down the hall, removes his surgical cap.

           Laura, Charlie, Pierce, Alice and Oscar spring to their feet.

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        Okay.  She did great.  Everything 
                        went exactly according to plan.  

                                 LAURA
                        Why did it take so long? 

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        The tumor was larger than I 
                        expected.  

                                 PIERCE
                        How much larger?

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        About the size of a golf ball.  

                                 LAURA
                        But, she’s so tiny.
                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        Her body’s definitely reacting to 
                        something.  She’s got ten stitches 
                        that I put right along the jawline.
                        I had to put a drain in, but if 
                        it’s looking good in a few hours, 
                        she can go home tonight.  

                                 LAURA
                        Okay.  So, what happens now?

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        Now we wait.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        We wait?

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        I sent the tissue to the lab.  
                        Unfortunately, everyone’s gone for 
                        the holiday.  So we won’t have the 
                        results until the 26th.  

                                 LAURA
                        And it’s either cancer or it’s not?

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        Basically.  

                                 LAURA
                        If you had to guess --

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        I can’t tell.  Like I said, the 
                        tumor was much larger than I 
                        expected.  And the white blood cell 
                        count was off.  But I don’t like to 
                        jump to conclusions.  

                                 PIERCE
                        I’ll stop by the lab and see if we 
                        can get those results sooner.

                                 DR. LANCASTER
                        I already checked.  They’re gone.  
                        But, I’ll call the house on the 
                        26th.  Let’s hope for the best.  
                        Merry Christmas.  

                                 LAURA
                        Yeah, right.
           INT. BARNES & NOBLE - LATER

           Laura is going up and down the aisles -- a bit frantic.  She 
           stops in front of the Health section.  Scans the titles.  
           Then grabs every book on the topic.    

           ANGLE ON the titles.  “Conquering Kids’ Cancer,” “When 
           Someone You Love Has Cancer,” “Malignant Lymphomas,” 
           “Hodgkin's Lymphoma.”  

           REGISTER LINE - JUST LATER

           Laura’s impatiently waiting in line with the last minute 
           Christmas crowd.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Laura?

           She turns around.  Behind her is MATT MERRIMAN (39).  Tall.  
           Receding hairline.  A kind, but weathered face.

                                 LAURA
                            (no clue)
                        Yes?

                                 MATT
                        Matt Merriman.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh my god.  Matt.  Hi.  

           She goes to shake his hand, but as she does, a book drops 
           from her stack to the floor.

           Matt picks it up.  Glances at the title.  “Treatment for 
           Hodgkin's Lymphoma.”  Hands it back to her.

                                 LAURA
                        Last minute Christmas shopping.  

                                 MATT
                        I heard you were coming to town.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh?

                                 MATT
                        My mom gets the Christmas letter.

                                 LAURA
                        Great.
                                 CASHIER (O.S.)
                        Next customer in line.  

                                 LAURA
                        Well, nice to see you.  Merry 
                        Christmas.

                                 MATT
                        You, too.  

           Laura walks up to the cashier.  Hands her the book --

                                 LAURA
                            (loudly, for Matt)
                        And I need a gift receipt for all 
                        of those.  Thank you.  

                                 CASHIER #2 (O.S.)
                        I can help the next person in line.

           Matt walks up to the register next to Laura.  She flashes him 
           an uncomfortable smile.  

                                 MATT
                        So, you and your husband live in 
                        California.  

                                 LAURA
                        Yep.

                                 MATT
                        You like it?

                                 LAURA
                        It’s great.  Very sunny.  How’s 
                        Janie?

           He’s used to telling this story --

                                 MATT
                        Lost her three years ago.  Drunk 
                        driver.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh god, Matt.  I’m so sorry.

           He holds up his book.  “Slow Cooking Secrets.”

                                 MATT
                        It’s okay.  Me and my Crock-pot 
                        have never been closer.  
                                 LAURA
                        I was so jealous of you guys in 
                        high school.  You were the perfect 
                        couple.

                                 MATT
                        Well, you only get perfect for so 
                        long, right?  

           ON LAURA -- thinking of Corinne.  

           They take their bags and walk to the front door.

                                 MATT
                        The strangest thing is -- the world 
                        just keeps spinning.  I see people 
                        in line at Starbucks.  And I get 
                        invited to weddings and poker 
                        parties.  Turns out the world 
                        didn’t stop after all.  Just mine.   

           An uncomfortable beat.  Then, to lighten the mood --

                                 MATT
                        And apparently I got really bad at 
                        small talk.  I’m sorry.  

                                 LAURA
                        No.  It’s okay.

                                 MATT
                        Hey, are you coming to the Santa 
                        Switcheroo? 

                                 LAURA
                        The what?

                                 MATT
                        It’s a gift exchange with an evil 
                        twist.  Your dad and Alice come 
                        every Christmas.   

                                 LAURA
                        I don’t think so. 

                                 MATT
                        Oh, come on.

                                 LAURA
                        You shouldn’t count on us.
                                 MATT
                        I don’t count on anything these 
                        days.  You look great, by the way.

                                 LAURA
                            (just being polite)
                        Thank you.  So do you.

                                 MATT
                        For a bald guy.

                                 LAURA
                        Come on.  You’re not bald.

                                 MATT
                        I might be by Christmas.

           A quick wave and he’s off.

           INT. HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Corinne and Alice sit in a large sunken tub filled with 
           bubbles.  Alice is in her BATHING SUIT and SHOWER CAP.  
           Corinne plays with dolls, splashing her.

                                 ALICE
                        Okay.  Try not to splash Grandma.

           -- which only encourages her. 

                                 ALICE
                        I’m so glad you came to visit.  I 
                        used to spend the summers with my 
                        Grandma Alma and those are some of 
                        my best memories.

                                 CORINNE
                        You have boogies.  

                                 ALICE
                        Excuse me?

                                 CORINNE
                        You have boogies.

           Alice wipes her nose.  

                                 CORINNE
                        No.  BOOGIES.

           She doesn’t get it. 
                                 CORINNE
                            (poking her boobs)
                        One.  Two.  

                                 ALICE
                            (totally embarrassed)
                        Oh!  Goodness.  

                                 CORINNE
                        It’s okay.  My mom has ‘em, too.  
                        They’re for feeding babies.

                                 ALICE
                        That’s right.

                                 CORINNE
                        Who are your babies?

           Alice looks shocked.  Stammers a bit.  

                                 ALICE
                        Ah, well, I -- I don’t have any of 
                        my own.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Why not?

                                 ALICE
                        Because I didn’t have any.

                                 CORINNE
                        You didn’t want babies?

                                 ALICE
                        No.  I didn’t.    

           Corinne takes one of her dolls and offers it to Alice.

                                 CORINNE
                        Here.  You can have one of mine.  

           She looks at Corinne -- touched.  The bubbles on her chin.  
           The bandage on her neck.  Alice gets choked up.  

                                 ALICE
                        Thank you, dear.  I love you, 
                        Corinne.  And you’re going to be 
                        just fine.  I know it.  The Lord 
                        would never do this to me.  Never. 

           She grabs her and pulls her into a tight embrace.
           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Pierce, Charlie and Oscar are at the kitchen table when Laura 
           comes in from the book store.  

                                 LAURA
                        Where’s Corinne?  Is she awake?

                                 CHARLIE
                        She’s taking a bath with Alice.

                                 LAURA
                        What?

                                 OSCAR
                        I thought it was gross, too.    

                                 CHARLIE
                        You want dinner?  Alice saved you a 
                        plate.

                                 LAURA
                        No.  I can’t eat.  
                            (to Pierce)
                        Is it okay for her to take a bath?  

                                 PIERCE
                        As long as she doesn’t get the 
                        bandage wet.  Say, Oscar, I have 
                        rounds at the hospital tomorrow.  
                        Would you like to go?

                                 OSCAR
                        Cool.  Can I see an operation?

                                 LAURA
                        No.

           Pierce gives Oscar a wink.  

                                 LAURA
                        I saw that.

           Oscar dumps a JIGSAW PUZZLE out of its box.  Pierce, Charlie 
           and Laura all stare.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wow.  That’s a little daunting.

                                 OSCAR
                        A thousand pieces.  Will you help?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Sure, buddy.  Let me see that.

           Oscar hands him THE BOX the puzzle came in.

           It’s a scene from “The Wizard of Oz.”  Dorothy, Toto, 
           Scarecrow, Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, Wicked Witch of the West, 
           the Wizard, the rainbow and even the tornado. 

                                 LAURA
                        I can’t believe this is still here.  
                        Alice must have overlooked it when 
                        she was throwing away everything 
                        from my childhood.

                                 OSCAR
                        Grandpa, will you help?

                                 PIERCE
                        Those things give me a headache.

                                 OSCAR
                        Mom?

                                 LAURA
                        No, honey.  Not now.  

           Corinne streaks through the room.  Alice chases after her.

                                 ALICE
                        She slipped away before I could get 
                        her pajamas on.  

                                 LAURA
                        Corinne!  Slow down!  Alice, she 
                        shouldn’t be running around after 
                        what she’s been through today.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’d never know she had surgery.  

                                 LAURA
                        That’s good right?

                                 PIERCE
                        On the 26th we’ll know what’s good.  

           INT. OSCAR’S ROOM - LATER

           Oscar’s in bed.  Laura walks in and takes his book away.
                                 LAURA
                        Rumor has it, it’s past your 
                        bedtime, young man.  

           She kisses him.

                                 LAURA
                        Good night.

                                 OSCAR
                        Night.

           She’s at the door.  About to turn off the light.

                                 OSCAR
                        Mom.  Will you lay down with me for 
                        a little while?  

                                 LAURA
                        No, sweetie.  I’m going to tuck 
                        Corinne in.

                                 OSCAR
                        But Dad always does that.

                                 LAURA
                        Not tonight.  See you in the 
                        morning.  

           ON Oscar’s face.  Hurt.  The light goes off.  All is dark.  

           INT. CORINNE’S BEDROOM - JUST LATER

           Laura is curled up in bed next to Corinne.

                                 CORINNE
                        How will Santa get a trampoline 
                        down the chimney?

                                 LAURA
                        Ah -- well, you know how Mommy’s 
                        job is to keep you safe?  Well, if 
                        Santa doesn’t think a trampoline is 
                        safe, he might not bring it.  

                                 CORINNE
                        But I asked for it.
                                 LAURA
                        Well, sometimes we get things we 
                        ask for and other times we get 
                        things we don’t ask for but 
                        actually need.  

           Corinne looks around the room.

                                 CORINNE
                        Sugar!  Here, Sugar!  How come 
                        Sugar won’t come out?  Grandma 
                        Alice said she’s hiding.

                                 LAURA
                        She’s not hiding, sweetie.  She was 
                        very old and now she’s in heaven.

                                 CORINNE
                        She is?

                                 LAURA
                        Yes. 

                                 CORINNE
                        With Grandma Corinne?

                                 LAURA
                        That’s right.

                                 CORINNE
                        I’m named after her you know.

                                 LAURA
                        You look like her, too.    

                                 CORINNE
                        We have the same color hair.  And 
                        the same eyes.  I saw a picture.  

           Laura’s touched.  She brushes Corinne’s bangs to the side.    

                                 CORINNE
                        I want to go to heaven.

                                 LAURA
                            (alarmed)
                        What?  No, you don’t.

                                 CORINNE
                        I do. 

                                 LAURA
                        Corinne.  You don’t.
                                 CORINNE
                        My Grandma’s there.  And so is 
                        Sugar.  Why can’t I go?

                                 LAURA
                        Because I want you here with me.  
                        Now get some sleep.  

           Laura kisses her and gets up.

                                 CORINNE
                        Daddy’s turn.  

                                 LAURA
                        You already said good night to him.

                                 CORINNE
                        I’m thirsty.

                                 LAURA
                        There’s water right there.

                                 CORINNE
                        Can I have a snack?

                                 LAURA
                        Not after eight.

                                 CORINNE
                            (pouty)
                        When I get to heaven, I’m gonna 
                        have snacks all day long!

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Laura and Charlie are in bed.  She’s in his arms, snuggled 
           against his chest.  He’s drifting off. 

                                 LAURA
                        Are you awake?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.

                                 LAURA
                        How can you sleep?  I keep thinking 
                        about Corinne.  Charlie, what if --

                                 CHARLIE
                        She’s fine.  There’s nothing to 
                        worry about.
                                 LAURA
                        You don’t know that.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes, I do.  

           Laura sits up.  Leans against the headboard.  

                                 LAURA
                        Do you remember two years ago on 
                        Easter when I told you the upstairs 
                        toilet was making a funny noise?  
                        And you said “I’m sure there’s 
                        nothing to worry about.”  And the 
                        next day I was sweeping poop out of 
                        the basement.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That wasn’t my fault.     

                                 LAURA
                        What about the dunk tank?  You said 
                        everything would be fine and --

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who knew a five year old could 
                        throw a fastball?!

                                 LAURA
                        And the oil cap on the Jeep?

                                 CHARLIE
                        What’s your point?  

                                 LAURA
                        My point is -- I don’t take any 
                        consolation in you saying there’s 
                        nothing to worry about.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know what you need?

                                 LAURA
                        Medication...

                                 CHARLIE
                        You need to relax.  

                                 LAURA
                        ...it’s true.  Everyone says I 
                        should be on anti-anxiety drugs.  
                        Gail swears by Lexapro.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        You don’t need that stuff.

                                 LAURA
                        I know.  I need to be sharp.  
                        Especially now.  But, a Valium 
                        would be nice.  Or Klonopin.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I can help you relax.  

           Charlie rolls over and fiddles with her nightgown.

                                 LAURA
                        You’ve got to be kidding.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?

                                 LAURA
                        You’re horny? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why do you sound surprised?  

                                 LAURA
                        Our daughter might be dying!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay.  Not horny anymore.  

                                 LAURA
                        It must be nice to be a man.  Life 
                        would be so much easier if all of 
                        my problems could be solved just by 
                        getting off!

           Laura throws the covers off and gets out of bed.  

           Charlie watches her go -- frustrated.  

           INT. DINING ROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Laura sits at the table working on the jigsaw puzzle. 

           Pierce shuffles in.  Apparently, he can’t sleep, either.  

                                 LAURA
                        You, too?
                                 PIERCE
                        Indigestion.  I can’t eat a goddamn 
                        thing anymore. 

           He pulls up a chair.

                                 LAURA
                        I hate this puzzle.  I’ve been here 
                        for an hour and I’ve only found 
                        three pieces that fit.   

           He picks up a piece and puts it exactly where it belongs. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Look at that.

                                 LAURA
                            (with contempt)
                        I have a system here!  Start with 
                        the outer edge and work your way 
                        in.  You can do the Tin Man.  I’m 
                        in charge of Dorothy.

           They work on the puzzle in silence for a few minutes. 

                                 LAURA
                        If it’s cancer, what are the odds? 

                                 PIERCE
                        Odds are good.  If we caught it 
                        early, eighty percent survival.

                                 LAURA
                        And twenty percent death.  What 
                        about treatment?  

                                 PIERCE
                        Immediate radiation and 
                        chemotherapy.  Probably six weeks 
                        at a time.  Hair loss.  Vomiting.  
                        It’ll damn near kill her.  But, 
                        it’s better to be aggressive.  

           The reality overwhelms her.  She breaks down.

                                 LAURA
                            (sobbing)
                        How can you just say that?  How can 
                        you be so matter of fact?  Because, 
                        honest to god, this is killing me.  
                        I don’t know what I’ll do if 
                        something’s wrong with her.   
                                 PIERCE
                            (stone cold)
                        You’ll survive.  It’s what we do.

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING 

           A high-pitched SCREAM comes from downstairs.  The sort of 
           scream that implies something is seriously wrong.  

                                 CORINNE (O.S.)
                        AAAHHH!  No!  No!  No! 

           Laura bolts up from a dead sleep and runs to the --  

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM

           -- where she finds Pierce and Corinne in the corner. 

                                 CORINNE
                            (hysterical)
                        No!  No!  

           Laura, still hazy, runs to Corinne’s side.

                                 LAURA
                        What’s going on?

                                 CORINNE
                        Mommy -- NO!!

                                 PIERCE
                        I need to change the dressing.  

                                 CORINNE
                        NO!

           Pierce grabs Corinne and puts her on the counter.  

                                 PIERCE
                        It’s going to get infected.  Hold 
                        her down. 

           Corinne kicks her legs, trying to get away.  

                                 LAURA
                        Corinne, honey, Grandpa just needs 
                        to --

                                 CORINNE
                        NOOOO!!
           She flails about, kicking Pierce in the stomach.

                                 PIERCE
                        Goddammit.  Just hold her already. 

           Together, they pin her down.  Corinne SOBS.

                                 CORINNE
                        Ow.  Mommy, stop!  It’s hurting.  

           Pierce removes the old bandage, revealing a bright red SCAR 
           with ten black stitches holding it together.   

                                 CORINNE
                        STOP!  STOP!  

           He rubs ointment on the scar, then puts on the fresh bandage.  

           Corinne’s choking on tears in the back of her throat.  Her 
           face -- red with fury.

           Pierce steps back.

                                 PIERCE
                        There.  All finished.  See?  

                                 LAURA
                            (opening her arms)
                        Come here, sweetie.

           But, Corinne’s not that forgiving.

                                 CORINNE
                            (screaming)
                        YOU HURT ME!  

           Corinne hits her, beating Laura with her fists.  Corinne runs 
           out of the room, WAILING.  

           Pierce is calmly picking up the band-aid wrappers and putting 
           the ointment away. 

                                 PIERCE
                        We’ll have to do it again Monday.  
                        Remind me to wear a cup.

                                 LAURA
                            (shaken up)
                        Dad.  You shouldn’t have done that!

                                 PIERCE
                        I didn’t hurt her. 
                                 LAURA
                        You should have waited for me.  I 
                        could have talked to her.

                                 PIERCE
                        You mean reason with her?  That kid 
                        doesn’t listen to you.  Besides, 
                        talk is overrated and it doesn’t 
                        change a damn thing.   

           He slams the medicine cabinet and storms out.  

           INT. KITCHEN - JUST LATER

           Alice gently rocks Corinne in her arms.  

                                 ALICE
                        Ssh.  It’s okay, dear.  I won’t let 
                        it happen again.  I promise.  

           Laura comes in, sees Alice comforting her daughter.   

                                 CORINNE
                        Can I have my fruit snacks now?

                                 ALICE
                        Of course.

           Laura looks at the clock.  8:24 AM.  It’s hard for her, but 
           she stays the course.

                                 LAURA
                        No.

                                 CORINNE
                        Mom!!

                                 ALICE
                        Laura.  

                                 LAURA
                        I’m sorry, Alice.  We have rules.  
                        We’re on a schedule and Corinne 
                        knows that.  

                                 CORINNE
                        I hate you!

           -- and Corinne runs out of the room in tears.  
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Pierce is with a patient, TONY FIORE (56).  TONY’S WIFE sits 
           in the corner flipping through People magazine.  

           Oscar watches quietly from the corner.  Proud.  In awe.

                                 PIERCE
                            (reading the chart)
                        How’s the pain today, Mr. Fiore?

                                 TONY
                        Better.  Like a dull throb now.

                                 PIERCE
                        Good.

           Pierce takes out a stethoscope and listens to Tony’s heart.  
           THUMP, THUMP.  THUMP, THUMP.  When he removes it, you can see 
           the stitches across Tony’s chest.  Eighty or more.  

                                 TONY
                        How’s it sound, doc?

                                 PIERCE
                        A lot better than the last one, 
                        that’s for sure.  

                                 TONY’S WIFE
                        When can he come home?

                                 PIERCE
                        Maybe a week.  I just want to make 
                        sure his body doesn’t reject the 
                        new heart. 

           Pierce gestures to Oscar.

                                 PIERCE
                        Come here.  I want you to listen.   

           Pierce puts the stethoscope on Tony’s heart and lets Oscar 
           listen.  

                                 PIERCE
                        How does it sound?

           Echoing his grandfather --

                                 OSCAR
                        A lot better than the last one, 
                        that’s for sure.
           Everyone smiles -- amused.

           HOSPITAL HALLWAY - JUST LATER

           Oscar and Pierce walk down the corridor.  Oscar wiggles his 
           tooth with his tongue.  

                                 PIERCE
                            (re the tooth)
                        How’s that coming?

                                 OSCAR
                        Getting closer.

                                 PIERCE
                        I’ll pull it out for you.

                                 OSCAR
                        That’s okay.  It’s almost out.

           They turn a corner.  Oscar tries to keep up.

                                 OSCAR
                        Where did his new heart come from?

                                 PIERCE
                        Connecticut.  

                                 OSCAR
                        Huh?

           INT. WALK-IN COOLER - DAY

           Pierce slides open the door and they step inside.  Tubes, 
           temperature gauges and monitoring devices everywhere.  Oscar 
           rubs his arms to keep warm.

                                 PIERCE
                        Close the door behind you.

           He does.

                                 PIERCE
                        There was a car accident in 
                        Connecticut and a man died.  His 
                        heart was a perfect match for Mr. 
                        Fiore, so I had it flown up here 
                        and I put it in him three days ago.  
                        This is where we store the organs 
                        until they’re ready to be 
                        implanted.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PIERCE (cont'd)
                            (pointing)
                        That’s a pancreas right there.  And 
                        a liver.  

           Realizing this is a storage facility for human parts, Oscar 
           goes pale. 

                                 OSCAR
                        These are all from dead people?

                                 PIERCE
                        That’s right.

           Pierce picks up a CHART.  Reads from it.

                                 PIERCE
                        Stroke.  Suicide.  Drowning.  A lot 
                        of car accidents.  Doesn’t matter 
                        how we get it. If the organ works 
                        and it’s a match -- we use it.  

           Oscar looks a little shaky.  Needs to get out.

                                 OSCAR
                        I -- I just need a sip of water.  

           And he runs out.  

           HALLWAY - JUST LATER

           Pierce finds Oscar on a bench, wiping tears. 

                                 PIERCE
                        What’s the trouble?

                                 OSCAR
                        Nothing.

                                 PIERCE
                        You know, if you want to be a 
                        doctor, you’re going to have to 
                        grow a set of balls.  You have to 
                        switch off your emotions.  Take 
                        your heart out of it.  You think 
                        you’re capable of that?

                                 OSCAR
                        Yes, sir.

                                 PIERCE
                        We’ll see about that.
           Pierce turns and walks down the hall.  Oscar follows two 
           steps behind.  Pierce stops briefly outside a door.

           THE LABORATORY

           -- where they’re running Corinne’s test.  Clearly closed for 
           the weekend.  Pierce stops a beat, then keeps walking.  

           INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

           Alice and Charlie are braving the malls, doing their last 
           minute Christmas shopping.  As they window shop --

                                 ALICE
                        I can’t believe how organized Laura 
                        is.  I mean, she shipped me the 
                        kid’s presents back in October.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I, on the other hand, prefer to go 
                        out on December 24th and buy her 
                        whatever’s left on the shelves.  

           As they pass Game Master, Charlie picks up the BOARD GAME  
           “Pass-Out The Adult Drinking Game.”

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes?

           Alice shakes her head.  Definitely no.  They keep walking.    

                                 ALICE
                        Does it bother you?

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?

                                 ALICE
                        The way Laura has to control every 
                        little detail.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nah.  It’s who she is.

           They stop outside Wet Seal.  Charlie picks up a pink, leopard-
           print BUSTIER.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Va-va-voom.

                                 ALICE
                        No. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        Not for Laura.  For me.  

           Alice puts it back.  They keep walking.  

                                 ALICE
                        You know why she’s that way, right?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Alice, I don’t like talking about 
                        her when she’s not here. 

                                 ALICE
                        But, we’re the outsiders.

           Charlie looks confused.  

                                 ALICE
                        We married into this family.  As 
                        outsiders, it’s our duty to 
                        complain about the insiders.  
                        Personally, all that stuff was 
                        twenty years ago.  You’d think 
                        she’d just get over it already. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Pierce, too.  

                                 ALICE
                        Fat chance.

           Charlie stops in his tracks.  He sees something up ahead.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh my god.  

                                 ALICE
                        What?

           Alice follows his gaze.  She GASPS in awe.

           Outside Kaybee Toys, there’s a large, round TRAMPOLINE.  
           Fourteen feet in diameter.  The Power Bounce.  Holds ten 
           people at once.  The mother of all trampolines.  

                                 ALICE
                        We couldn’t.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Of course not.  

           But slowly, deviously, they turn and look at one another.  
           INT/EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           Laura opens the door and smiles.

                                 LAURA
                        Hi.  Thanks for coming over.

           It’s Matt Merriman and his daughter, NATALIE (9).

                                 MATT
                        I’m just glad you called.  

                                 LAURA
                        You’re not going to believe the 
                        stuff I found.  Yearbooks, senior 
                        photos, old test.  Everything.

                                 MATT
                        Natalie, this is Laura.  She knew 
                        me back when I was cool.    

                                 NATALIE
                        Doubt it.  

                                 MATT
                        Hey, now.  

                                 LAURA
                        Come in.  Corinne’s excited to have 
                        someone to play with.   

           INT. BASEMENT - LATER

           Laura’s digging through a box of high school memorabilia.  

                                 MATT
                        I brought you a little something 
                        for old time’s sake.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh?

           He takes two COLT 45’s out of his bag.  

                                 LAURA
                        Ohmygod.  We used to drink that, 
                        didn’t we?

                                 MATT
                        All the time.  Here.  
           He cracks one open and offers it to her.  

                                 LAURA
                        Seriously?  No.  I can’t.  The 
                        sun’s still up.

                                 MATT
                        Just like high school.

                                 LAURA
                        I never have more than one drink a 
                        day and I’ll probably have wine 
                        with dinner.  Thank you, anyway.

           Matt stares at her in disbelief.  OFF his look --

                                 LAURA
                        What?  

                                 MATT
                        Are you kidding?  You’re were the 
                        most reckless person I’ve ever 
                        known.    

                                 LAURA
                        I was?

                                 MATT
                        You were drunk through all of high 
                        school, you never studied, dumped 
                        every hot guy and still graduated 
                        with honors.  Bitch.  Come on. 

           She takes it.  They toast and throw it back.  Blech.  

           They hear the girls RUNNING above them.

                                 LAURA
                        Ohmygod.  She’s got to stop running 
                        around.  Corinne!

                                 MATT
                        They’re fine.  Natalie’s in charge.   

                                 LAURA
                        Natalie’s nine.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah, but she grew up fast when 
                        Janie died. 

           Matt takes a swig.  
                                 MATT
                        Hey, what’s with the bandage on 
                        Corinne’s neck?

           A beat, then Laura starts digging through the box. 

                                 LAURA
                        Um...

                                 MATT
                        I’m sorry.  It’s none of my 
                        business.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s okay.  She had some surgery 
                        yesterday.  We found a lump...  

                                 MATT
                        Oh god.  Laura.

                                 LAURA
                        ...and we’re waiting to get the 
                        test results back.  So, I’m trying 
                        to stay busy and act normal.  How 
                        am I doing? 

           He takes her hand in his.  

                                 MATT
                        Whatever the results are, I wish 
                        you didn’t have to go through this.  
                        You’ve been through enough in your 
                        life.

                                 LAURA
                        Thank you for saying the perfect 
                        thing. 

                                 MATT
                        What can I do?

                                 LAURA
                            (holds up her beer)
                        This is a good start.

                                 MATT
                        And Charlie?

           She shakes her head.  
                                 LAURA
                        He doesn’t get it.  It’s like he 
                        doesn’t think anything bad could 
                        ever happen. 

                                 MATT
                        It just hasn’t happened, yet.  But, 
                        everyone gets that moment when 
                        their life is demolished.  Mine was 
                        when Janie died.

                                 LAURA
                        When my Mom died.  

                                 MATT
                        I remember.  You came back from 
                        school and I saw you at the funeral 
                        and you were --

                                 LAURA
                            (interrupting)
                        Let’s not talk about death.  Okay?  
                        It’s the one conversation I can 
                        carry on by myself.

           Their eyes lock.  A moment.  A connection over shared 
           experience.  Then --

                                 MATT
                        Hey, do you remember when I tried 
                        to feel you up at Junior Prom?

           They LAUGH.  A loud CRASH comes from upstairs.

           INT. KITCHEN - JUST LATER

           Laura and Matt run up from the basement and find Corinne and 
           Natalie out of breath and LAUGHING.

                                 LAURA
                        Hey.  What’s going on up here?

                                 CORINNE
                        We’re trying to catch Sugar.

                                 LAURA
                        What?

                                 NATALIE
                        The cat is crazy!  
                                 LAURA
                        Corinne, I told you, Sugar’s in 
                        heaven.

                                 CORINNE
                        She came back!

           And just then, a CAT darts through the room.  The girls 
           SQUEAL and chase after her.  

           Laura looks at Matt.  No clue what’s going on.  

           And Alice rounds the corner, looking very guilty.  

                                 LAURA
                        Alice?

                                 ALICE
                            (whispering)
                        A bit too much catnip.  Isn’t the 
                        resemblance remarkable?

           Laura looks at Matt and rolls her eyes.

                                 ALICE
                        Hi, Matt.  Would you like to stay 
                        for dinner?  

                                 MATT
                        Sorry.  I promised my parents I’d 
                        help them set up for the Santa 
                        Switcheroo.  You’re coming, right?

                          ALICE
                                                         LAURA
           Absolutely.
                                             Probably not.

                                 MATT
                            (game show host voice)
                        Ding.  Ding.  Ding.  And Alice is 
                        on the board with the correct 
                        answer. 

           He grabs his jacket and goes in search of Natalie.  

           INT. GARAGE - LATER

           Pierce has unfolded the PING PONG TABLE.  Everyone is 
           gathered around;  Laura, Charlie, Alice, Oscar and Corinne.  

                                 PIERCE
                        I’m glad you’re all up for a little 
                        friendly competition.
                                 LAURA
                        Like we have a choice.  

                                 PIERCE
                        As always, we’ll play rounders-
                        style.  You hit the ball and run 
                        around the table.  If you miss the 
                        shot, you’re out.  Last man 
                        standing wins.

                                 ALICE
                        It’s just for fun, right?

           The look on Pierce’s face says otherwise.

                                 LAURA
                        I don’t want Corinne running.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know what?  We’ll be a team.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Everybody say team on three.  
                        One...two...

                                 LAURA/OSCAR/CHARLIE/CORINNE
                        Team on three!

                                 PIERCE
                        Team?  Are you kidding?  This is 
                        one on one.  Each man for himself.

           Laura shoots him a look.

                                 PIERCE
                        I’ll start.

           Pierce serves the PING PONG BALL to Alice, then runs around 
           the table to the other side.   

                                 ALICE
                        Oh dear.

           Alice gently hits it back.  Her shot is meek, but good.  She 
           runs around the table.  

           Charlie carries Corinne.  Both holding the paddle, they hit 
           Alice’s ball.  It’s a good shot.  Corinne SQUEALS with 
           delight as Charlie runs around the table.

           Laura’s turn.  She returns the ball with ease.  She’s a pro.  
           Learned from the best.
           Oscar’s up.  He hits the ball, but it goes into the net.  

                                 PIERCE
                        Take a seat, Oscar.

                                 OSCAR
                        But, I didn’t even get to warm up.

                                 PIERCE
                        None of us did.    

                                 LAURA
                        It’s okay, Oscar.  I’ll beat 
                        Grandpa for you.   

           Oscar sulks as he sits on a nearby bench.

           The game resumes.  It’s high-energy.  With one less person, 
           there’s more running.  They go through the line up again.  

           Alice is the next to miss.  

                                 ALICE
                        That’s okay.  I’d rather sit next 
                        to my grandson, anyway.

           Alice sits next to Oscar, who is still reeling from being the 
           first one out.  

           The game continues.  More running.  It’s a frenzied pace.  
           PING.  PONG.  PING.  PONG.  

           Charlie and Corinne are the next to miss.  

           It’s down to Pierce and Laura.  They take a minute to catch 
           their breath.  

                                 PIERCE
                        Ready?

                                 LAURA
                        Bring it on.

           And they play.  This isn’t ping pong for fun.  This is for 
           vengeance.  For the past.  For wallpaper.  For the passive-
           aggressive comments.  For people who can’t communicate.  

           Pierce SMASHES it past her.  She lunges, but misses it. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Yes!  Good game.  Play again?
                                 LAURA
                            (with venom)
                        Absolutely.  

                                 ALICE
                        I should put the ham in the oven.

           Alice starts to leave, but Pierce stops her.  

                                 PIERCE
                        Not yet.  We’re playing again.

           They all get up.  Assume the positions.  

                                 PIERCE
                        Loser serves.

           Pierce hands the ball to Oscar.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Come on, Pierce.  Go easy.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE OF THE GAME

           Again, Oscar is the first to sit down.  

           Laura and Pierce are the last two standing.  Pierce wins.

                                 LAURA
                        Again.

           They roll their eyes.  Pierce hands the ball to Oscar. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Put some umph behind it this time.

           Oscar serves.  Into the net.  He sits down.

           Laura and Pierce are still going at it.  Laura is furious.  
           Pierce wins again.

                                 LAURA
                        Again.

                                 PIERCE
                        Fine.

                                 ALICE
                        I quit.  I’ve got dinner to make.
           Pierce hands the ball to Oscar, still the loser.

                                 PIERCE
                        Why don’t you get it over the net 
                        for once.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay, Pierce.  Give him a break. 

                                 LAURA
                        You can do it, sweetie.

           Oscar serves and misses again.

                                 LAURA
                        Let him do it again.  

                                 PIERCE
                        That’s not how we play.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, that’s how we play.  Try 
                        again, Oscar.  

                                 LAURA
                        Keep your eye on the ball, honey, 
                        and just hit it a little harder.  

           Oscar winds up... pauses... and puts everything he has into 
           the serve.  He SMASHES it!  It clears the net and goes 
           straight into Corinne’s eye.

                                 CORINNE
                        Aaahh!

           Corinne grabs her eye and SCREAMS.  Everyone runs to her.

                                 LAURA
                        Ohmygod!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Corinne.  

                                 LAURA
                        Oscar!  What’s wrong with you?!  

                                 OSCAR
                        She was in the way!  

                                 PIERCE
                        At least you got it over the net.
           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

           Christmas eve dinner.  Tension all around.  Corinne’s eye is 
           swollen and she’s milking it.  

                                 ALICE
                        Laura, dear, would you pass the 
                        mashed potatoes?

           Just the sound of forks SCRAPING.  

                                 ALICE
                        I have an announcement.  

                                 LAURA
                        Bake sale prices went up?

                                 ALICE
                        I would like us all to go to church 
                        tonight.

           Everyone’s got an excuse.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I have last minute Christmas 
                        wrapping to do.

                                 PIERCE
                        I have charts to work up. 

                                 LAURA
                        I didn’t bring anything dressy.   

                                 CORINNE
                        I don’t like church.

                                 OSCAR
                        Everyone knows the Catholic church 
                        is corrupted.  

           All heads turn to Oscar.  

                                 OSCAR
                        What?

                                 ALICE
                        Where did you hear that?

           Oscar looks at Laura, who smiles sheepishly.   
                                 ALICE
                        There’s a candlelight service at 
                        seven and I’d like everyone to go.  
                        Especially during this trying time. 

           There’s no getting out of it.  

           INT. OSCAR’S ROOM

           Oscar is getting dressed for church.  He’s wearing a CANDY 
           CANE TIE and is combing his hair in the full-length mirror. 

           Laura comes in.

                                 LAURA
                        Hey.

           Oscar’s still pouting from the ping pong incident.  

                                 LAURA
                        Your sister’s eye is going to be 
                        just fine.  I know you didn’t mean 
                        to do it.  You’re a good boy and it 
                        was an accident.  

           Oscar keeps combing his hair in the mirror.  

           Laura looks at her own reflection.  She points to the bags 
           under her eyes.

                                 LAURA
                        You see these?  That’s what you 
                        call bags.  You know why they call 
                        them that?

           Oscar shakes his head.

                                 LAURA
                        Because I carry a lot of stuff in 
                        there.  Sleep-deprivation, sodium, 
                        worry.  I haven’t slept well since 
                        we got here.  And I know that’s not 
                        a very good excuse, but that’s why 
                        I snapped at you.   

                                 OSCAR
                        It’s okay, Mom.  I know you’re 
                        worried about Corinne.  What’s 
                        wrong with her?    

                                 LAURA
                        We won’t know until Monday.  
                                 OSCAR
                        My tooth might be out by then.

                                 LAURA
                        Do you have any questions for me?  
                        I’ll give you the most honest 
                        answers I can.  

           Oscar takes a pensive beat.  Something on his mind.

                                 OSCAR
                        Do you think I need to grow a set 
                        of balls?

                                 LAURA
                        What?!

                                 OSCAR
                        Grandpa said if I want to be a 
                        doctor, I have to have balls.

                                 LAURA
                        I think the most important thing a 
                        doctor can have is heart.  God 
                        knows it’s what your grandpa lacks.  
                        You, on the other hand, are all 
                        heart.  And that’s a good thing.  
                        You hear me?

                                 OSCAR
                        Yes.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re perfect exactly as you are.  
                        Loose tooth and all.  

                                 OSCAR
                        Just like you.  Bags and all.  

                                 LAURA
                        Watch it.    

           INT. CHURCH - DUSK

           The family, now all dressed up, sits in a church pew.

                                 PRIEST
                        A joyous welcome to all who have 
                        come to celebrate the birth of our 
                        Lord, Jesus Christ. 

           The organist PLAYS a brief prelude into --
                                 CONGREGATION
                        Oh come, all ye faithful, joyful 
                        and triumphant...

           MOVE ALONG the six of them in the pew. 

           Charlie is holding a cold compress on Corinne’s swollen eye.

           Oscar is working on his loose tooth.

           Alice is hanging on every word.

           Pierce looks annoyed.

           And Laura is nodding off.  

           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - JUST LATER

           Laura is getting a drink of water from the fountain.  The 
           priest’s SERMON can still be heard in the background.  On her 
           way back, she sees the confessional.  

           INT. CONFESSIONAL

           Laura sits inside.  It’s dark.  Quiet.  

                                 LAURA
                        Hello?  Excuse me?  Anyone home?

           Long beat.  Then the window slides open.

                                 LAURA
                            (startled)
                        Aah!

                                 PRIEST
                        Sorry.  I didn’t mean to scare you.  
                        Are you here for confession?

                                 LAURA
                        No.  Yes.  I mean, I don’t know. 

                                 PRIEST
                        Well, is there something you’d like 
                        to get off your chest?

                                 LAURA
                        Yes.
                                 PRIEST
                        Okay.  How long has it been since 
                        your last confession?

                                 LAURA
                        Jesus, who the hell knows.

                                 PRIEST
                        Language.

                                 LAURA
                        Sorry.  See, I’ve been having these 
                        thoughts.  Terrible thoughts.  And 
                        I just need to tell someone.  To 
                        get them out of my head.  

                                 PRIEST
                        What kind of thoughts?

                                 LAURA
                        Guilt.

                                 PRIEST
                        For?

                                 LAURA
                        For something I feel.  See, there’s 
                        a chance my daughter might be sick.  
                        Really sick.

                                 PRIEST
                        I’m sorry.

                                 LAURA
                        And I want to believe she’s going 
                        to be okay.  But if she’s not --

           Her voice trails off.

                                 PRIEST
                        You’ll get through it.  

                                 LAURA
                        I don’t want to get through it.  
                        This is supposed to be my time.   
                        After all the breast feeding and 
                        bedtime stories and play dates, I’m 
                        finally going back to work.  It’s 
                        just -- it’s not fair. 

           She covers her face with her hands.  Ashamed.  
                                 LAURA
                        Besides, I’ve done my job.  I kept 
                        her out of harm’s way.  I taught 
                        her discipline and put structure in 
                        her life so she’ll make smart 
                        decisions.  I’ve done everything to 
                        keep her safe and this happens.

                                 PRIEST
                        They’re kids.  You can’t protect 
                        them from everything.

                                 LAURA
                        Bullshit!  I’m sorry, but that’s my 
                        job.  And do you have any idea how 
                        hard it is?  Do you know how many 
                        decisions I make everyday?  What’s 
                        the best toy for my daughter?  
                        What’s the safest street to live 
                        on?  What’s the best way to teach 
                        her compassion?  What’s the best 
                        example I can set in every single 
                        situation?  It’s exhausting!

                                 PRIEST
                        You can’t control everything in 
                        life.

                                 LAURA
                        Yes, I can.  I have to.  

                                 PRIEST
                        Why do you have to?  

           Long beat.  This goes to her very core.  

                                 LAURA
                        Because the one time I didn’t make 
                        my own decision, the one time I let 
                        someone else control my life -- 
                        something -- 

                                 PRIEST
                        What?   

                                 LAURA
                            (long beat)
                        I’m sorry.  I can’t.    

           She gets up and leaves.
           INT. BMW - NIGHT

           Pierce drives while Alice beams.

                                 ALICE
                        Wasn’t that beautiful?  I just love 
                        a candlelight service.  

           They all GRUMBLE.

                                 ALICE
                        And because you all did something 
                        for me, I have a little surprise 
                        for you.  Oscar, honey, do me a 
                        favor.  Reach in the back and look 
                        under the blanket.

           Oscar turns around and pulls a blanket off to reveal a 
           CHRISTMAS WREATH.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Whatcha got there, buddy?

                                 OSCAR
                        It’s a wreath.  

                                 ALICE
                        A grave wreath!  I thought we’d go 
                        by the graveyard and say hello to 
                        someone you all loved very much.

           ON Laura’s face -- in miserable disbelief.

           EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

           They are all huddled around the grave.  The wind whips in 
           their faces and attempts to carry the wreath away.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Boy, Pierce, it’s gotten cold.  You 
                        think we’ll get some snow tonight? 

                                 PIERCE
                        Why does everyone keep asking me 
                        that?  What do I look like -- a 
                        freaking meteorologist?!

           ANGLE ON the headstone.  
                                  CORINNE DIXIE ATKINS
                                       1939 - 1987
                                Beloved wife and mother  

                                 ALICE
                        Does anyone have something they’d 
                        like to say?

           Long, awkward silence.

                                 ALICE
                        Well, I’ll start.  Corinne, I never 
                        met you, but I like to think we 
                        have similar hearts.  You’ve given 
                        me these wonderful grandchildren 
                        and I try to love them the way you 
                        would.  And give them encouragement 
                        and support and I spoil them 
                        rotten.  And every time I hug them, 
                        I’m doing it for both of us.  
                        Wherever you are, Merry Christmas.

                                 CORINNE
                        She’s in heaven.  Do you think they 
                        have birthday parties in heaven?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Of course, sweetie.  

           Alice looks at Laura -- who is about to boil over.  

                                 ALICE
                        Laura.  Why don’t you say 
                        something.  

           That’s a bad idea.  And Charlie knows it.   

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know what?  We can just stand 
                        here and not say anything.  

                                 LAURA
                        Alice, here’s what I’d like to say.  
                        WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!

                                 ALICE
                            (blanches)
                        I beg your pardon.

                                 LAURA
                        What are you doing at my mother’s 
                        grave?  Why are you here?  
                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s all calm down.  

                                 ALICE
                        I -- I just thought...

                                 LAURA
                        Go back to the car!

                                 ALICE
                        Pierce?  It’s Christmas eve and I 
                        just thought it would be nice to...

                                 PIERCE
                        Go on, Alice.  Go wait in the car.

           Her bottom lip quivering, Alice runs back to the car.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Mommy.  You said “fuck.”

                                 LAURA
                        I sure did.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay, maybe we’ll go wait in the 
                        car with Grandma Alice.

           Charlie takes Oscar and Corinne and walks away.  Before he 
           leaves, Oscar leans down and kisses the grave.

                                 OSCAR
                        Hi, Grandma.  Wish you were here.  

                                 CORINNE 
                        Don’t be sad, Oscar.  Grandma can 
                        come back and visit us anytime.  
                        Just like Sugar.  

           Charlie leads the kids back to the car.  Just Laura and 
           Pierce now.  Pierce shakes his head.  

                                 LAURA
                        Did you know about this?

                                 PIERCE
                        Of course not.  Why would I want to 
                        come here?  I hate it here.  

                                 LAURA
                        Why do you hate it?  
                                 PIERCE
                        Because it’s a waste of time.  
                        She’s not here.  It’s just dirt and 
                        a headstone.  

                                 LAURA
                        Where do you think she is?

                                 PIERCE
                        What are you talking about?  She’s 
                        dead.  Gone.  Nowhere.

                                 LAURA
                        But, that energy.  That light.  It 
                        had to go somewhere. 

                                 PIERCE
                        That’s why people invented religion 
                        -- because they can’t stand the 
                        thought of it all just going away 
                        without a moment’s notice.

                                 LAURA
                        Does Alice know you feel that way?

                                 PIERCE
                        I try not to rain on her Jesus 
                        parade.  Now, can we go?  It’s cold 
                        out here and this isn’t exactly my 
                        idea of a good time.  If you have 
                        something to say, spit it out. 

                                 LAURA
                        Let’s see.  Do I have something to 
                        say?  Well, I wish I could have 
                        said goodbye to my mother when she 
                        was dying.  

                                 PIERCE
                        Aw shit.  Here we go.  

                                 LAURA
                        You robbed me.    

                                 PIERCE
                        We thought she had more time.

                                 LAURA
                        You should have told me.  

                                 PIERCE
                        You had classes!  A freshman can’t 
                        just pick up and leave!
                                 LAURA
                        Mom was dying and I asked you if I 
                        should come home.  I trusted you to 
                        make the decision for me and you 
                        said, “No.  She’ll pull through.  
                        You’ll see her this summer.”   

           Laura’s face cracks.  Tears she can’t hold back any longer.

                                 LAURA
                        How could you?!  How could you deny 
                        me the right to see her one last 
                        time?  To hold her hand.  To hear 
                        her voice.

                                 PIERCE
                        I didn’t want you to see her like 
                        that.

                                 LAURA
                        It wasn’t your decision to make!

                                 PIERCE
                        Don’t pretend for a minute you know 
                        how I feel or what I went through, 
                        because you don’t!

           And he turns and heads back to the car.  

           INT. HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Charlie and Laura are mid-argument.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I just think you’re being a little 
                        hard on Alice.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re going to take her side?!

                                 CHARLIE
                        This isn’t about sides.  You just 
                        seem irrational and that’s not good 
                        for anyone right now.  You need to 
                        eat something and get eight hours 
                        of sleep and just put all of this 
                        behind you.  

                                 LAURA
                        Ohmygod.  You are clueless!  Put 
                        this behind me?  I don’t even know 
                        what this is yet.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAURA (cont'd)
                        And I think I’m doing a pretty good 
                        job keeping it together considering 
                        what we might find out Monday. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I told you, everything’s going to 
                        be fine.

           She explodes.

                                 LAURA
                        OH FOR FUCK’S SAKE, CHARLIE!  I 
                        dare you to say that one more time!  
                        Go ahead.  Say it again.  Don’t you 
                        get it?!  Everything’s fine until 
                        it’s not.  And just for once I’d 
                        like to have a partner in this 
                        marriage, instead of someone who 
                        lives in denial!! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What am I denying? 

                                 LAURA
                        You’re denying me the right to be 
                        afraid.  That something might 
                        actually be wrong.  Just tell me 
                        this.  When something does go 
                        wrong, when your life doesn’t go 
                        exactly according to plan -- how 
                        are you going to handle it?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        How the hell do I know.  

           Getting an idea --

                                 LAURA
                        You know what?   

           She opens the door.

                                 LAURA
                        Let’s find out.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Laura.  Wait.  Where are you going?

           EXT. HOUSE - DRIVEWAY 

           The tires SQUEAL as Laura backs out of the driveway and 
           speeds down the street.
           REVERSE ANGLE on Oscar looking out his bedroom window.

                                 OSCAR
                        Mom?

           INT/EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

           The front door opens.  This is Matt Merriman’s house.  

                                 MATT
                            (surprised)
                        Hi.  

                                 LAURA
                        I know it’s Christmas eve and you 
                        and Natalie are probably singing 
                        carols or roasting chestnuts or 
                        whatever, but --

           She holds up a BOTTLE OF WINE.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m about to break the drinking 
                        rule and I didn’t want to do it 
                        alone.  

                                 MATT
                            (smiling)
                        The rebel returns.

           INT. HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

           Pierce and Alice sit on the love seat in his office.  

                                 ALICE
                        When the kids have gone to sleep, 
                        you’ll have to help me get the 
                        boxes down from the attic.  All of 
                        Santa’s elves have scattered off to 
                        god knows where.  

                                 PIERCE
                        Typical.

           Oscar enters.  He looks a bit off.  Disturbed.  

                                 OSCAR
                        Excuse me.

                                 ALICE
                        What is it, dear?  
                                 OSCAR
                        Do you have a tool kit?

                                 PIERCE
                        Why?

                                 OSCAR
                        There’s -- there’s a screw in the 
                        bathroom that fell off the cabinet.

                                 PIERCE
                            (standing)
                        I’ll get it.

                                 OSCAR
                        No!  I want to.  I need to learn to 
                        do things on my own.

           Pierce looks at him.  Sizes him up.  

                                 PIERCE
                        In the back hall closet.

           INT. MATT’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Laura and Matt sit on the floor in front of the fireplace. 
           Her shoes are off.  Drinking.  Laughing.  Forgetting.  

                                 LAURA
                        Do you stay in touch with Randy?  

                                 MATT
                        Mm hm.  He and his partner, Jim, 
                        live in Florida.

                                 LAURA
                        His partner?! 

                                 MATT
                        Yep.  Gay as a french horn.    

           Laura’s cell phone RINGS.  She checks the number.  Ignores 
           it, then turns her phone off.  OFF Matt’s look --

                                 LAURA
                        I don’t want to talk about it.

           She grabs the wine.  Pours another glass.

                                 MATT
                        Laura. 
                                 LAURA
                        What?  We’re different, that’s all.  
                        Charlie’s very simple.  He doesn’t 
                        have the emotional depth to deal 
                        with anything.  I mean, he’s never 
                        even lost someone.

                                 MATT
                        Really?  What about grandparents?

                                 LAURA
                        Alive.  All four.  

                                 MATT
                        Bastard.  

                                 LAURA
                        Tell me about it.   

                                 MATT
                        So he’s had an easy life.  But,  
                        tragedy will find him.  And that’s 
                        when he’ll need you.  

                                 LAURA
                        But, what if it comes Monday in the 
                        form of a phone call?  

                                 MATT
                        Then you’ll deal with it.  

                                 LAURA
                        I can’t.  Not again. 

                                 MATT
                        You will and you’ll come out better 
                        for it.  Because when you know 
                        pain, the world goes from black and 
                        white to technicolor.  You see all 
                        the shades.  You learn to 
                        appreciate a thunderstorm.  A 
                        decent cup of coffee.  A good 
                        conversation.  Because, fuck, 
                        they’re hard to come by.  And one 
                        day, Charlie will understand that.

                                 LAURA
                        Stop saying his name.  I didn’t 
                        come here to talk about Charlie.

                                 MATT
                            (beat, softly)
                        Why did you come here?  
           She looks at him.  His eyes.  His lips.  And in the moment, 
           this one single moment, she kisses him.  He doesn’t pull 
           away.  He’s not even surprised.  It’s one, long, sensual 
           kiss.  And then she stops.  Sits up straight.    

                                 MATT
                        God, you don’t know how long I’ve 
                        wanted to do that.  

           He goes to kiss her again, more impassioned.  

                                 LAURA
                        Stop.

           Still trying to kiss her --

                                 LAURA
                        Matt.  Stop it!  

           She pushes him off and gets up.  He’s totally confused.

                                 MATT
                        What?

                                 LAURA
                        I’m sorry.  This was wrong.     

           -- and she grabs her shoes and leaves. 

           INT. GUEST ROOM - SAME TIME

           Oscar stands in front of the full-length mirror.  He’s pale. 

           PAN DOWN to his hand.  He holds a PLIERS.  

           He raises the tool to his mouth.  His expression -- 
           unwavering.  He opens his mouth and reaches in with the 
           pliers.  His loose tooth.  The lateral incisor.   

           He grabs it with the pliers.  It slips off a few times.  He 
           readjusts.  When he gets a good, solid grasp -- he yanks it 
           out.  He WHIMPERS and drops to the floor.  A small pool of 
           blood forming on the carpet.

           PUSH IN on the tooth.  On the floor.  Finally free.  

           INT. HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Laura tip-toes in the front door.  She sees all the presents 
           under the Christmas tree.  The stockings are full.  Santa has 
           been hard at work.  
           INT. GUEST ROOM - JUST LATER

           Laura tosses the THROW PILLOWS on the floor and slips into 
           bed next to Charlie.  He stirs.  Rolls over.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I was worried.  I went looking for 
                        you.  Where did you go?  

           She’s silent.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Laura?  

           She starts crying.  Guilty tears.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, now.  Come here.

           He opens his arms and she curls into them.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s okay.  Whatever happens.  Our 
                        family is perfect, because we have 
                        each other.  

           He kisses the tears.  Her eyelids.  Her cheeks.  And then his 
           mouth finds hers.  It’s raw, passionate, real.  As Charlie 
           unbuttons her blouse and pulls her in tighter --

           PAN DOWN to a NOTE on the floor.  Hidden amongst the 
           discarded pillows.  

           “Mom.  Dad.  My tooth came out!  It’s under my pillow for the 
           tooth fairy.  I love you. Oscar” 

           EXT. CORINNE’S BEDROOM - CHRISTMAS MORNING

           The door opens and Corinne, in her nightgown, peeks her head 
           out.  Her eyes, wide with excitement.  A devilish grin on her 
           face.  She walks over to the banister and looks down. 

                                 CORINNE
                            (in awe)
                        Santa came.
           INT. GUEST ROOM

           Corinne throws open the door and runs to the side on the bed.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Mom!  Santa was here!

                                 LAURA
                            (groggy)
                        He was? 

           Laura stirs.  Smiles.  Stretches.

                                 LAURA
                        I slept!  Oh, thank god.

           Laura rolls over to wake Charlie.

                                 LAURA
                        Merry Christmas, Char --

           No Charlie. 

                                 CORINNE
                        Daddy’s downstairs.  He said I 
                        should wake you and Oscar.  

                                 LAURA
                        I’ll get your brother and we’ll be 
                        down in a minute.  

           OSCAR’S ROOM - JUST LATER

           Laura opens the door.  

                                 LAURA
                        Merry Christmas, Oscar.  

           Oscar’s in the middle of the room.  All of the floral 
           wallpaper has been torn down, leaving the old rainbow 
           pattern.  Oscar sits amongst the SCRAPS of wallpaper.  He’s 
           destroyed the entire room.  

                                 LAURA
                        What the hell happened in here?!

                                 OSCAR
                            (bitter, changed)
                        Merry Christmas, Mom. 
                                 LAURA
                        Oscar, what’s going on?  Why did 
                        you do this? 

                                 OSCAR
                        Because I hate it here!  No one 
                        bothers with me.  Not even the 
                        tooth fairy.  

           He opens his palm.  Shows her THE TOOTH.  A wave of guilt.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh Oscar, that’s not true.  It’s 
                        just, I think maybe the tooth fairy 
                        got caught in really bad traffic.  
                        I mean, there were a lot of people 
                        flying around last night.  Rudolph 
                        and all his friends.  And Santa.  
                        And who knows, maybe a million 
                        other little boys lost their teeth 
                        last night.  You can’t hold it 
                        against her, can you?

           He looks off.  Of course he can.

                                 LAURA
                        Maybe she deserves another chance.

                                 OSCAR
                        That’s not the way it works.

           She tries another angle.  

                                 LAURA
                        Well, Santa didn’t forget you.

           Oscar looks up.  A hint of interest in his eyes.

                                 LAURA
                        That’s right.  I think you’ve been 
                        a very good boy this year.

                                 OSCAR
                        I have.  

                                 LAURA
                        Do you want to go see what Santa 
                        brought you?

           Oscar shrugs his shoulders.  Slightly tempted.

                                 LAURA
                        Come on.  Let’s just peek.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - JUST LATER

           Alice, Pierce, Corinne and Oscar survey the presents Santa 
           left behind.  

                                 ALICE
                        Good morning, everybody.  Merry 
                        Christmas!

           Charlie enters and hands Laura a cup of coffee.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Merry Christmas, my love.

           Guilt.  Guilt.  Guilt.  

                                 PIERCE
                        Let’s get this shit over with.

           MONTAGE OF CHRISTMAS MORNING

           - Corinne opens a PRINCESS COSTUME and SQUEALS with delight.

           - Charlie opens a CASHMERE SWEATER.  Not the most personal 
           gift, but he’s happy with anything.  He kisses Laura.  

           - Alice opens a KITCHEN-AID MIXER and gushes.  

           - Oscar opens LEGOS.  The Construction Site Kit.  A gift from 
           his mother.  He immediately starts putting it together.

           - Pierce holds up a homemade TREE ORNAMENT Corinne made out 
           of pipe cleaners.  He forces a smile to Corinne, then rolls 
           his eyes to the rest of the room.

           - Corinne opens another PRINCESS COSTUME.  More SQUEALING.

           - Laura opens A LEATHER BRIEFCASE with her initials on it.  
           The perfect gift.  She smothers Charlie in kisses.    

           - Oscar and Pierce open matching TIES.

           - Oscar has put together the entire construction site.  As 
           the WRECKING BALL crashes in and tears down the house...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - HOURS LATER

           All the presents have been opened.  Paper is strewn about and 
           Alice is gathering the bows for next year.
                                 CORINNE
                        Is that all?

                                 PIERCE
                        Is that all?!  You just opened five 
                        hundred presents.

                                 LAURA
                        Yes, sweetie.  I think that’s all.

           Charlie and Alice trade devious looks.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Actually, there might be one more.

                                 CORINNE
                        Really?

                                 LAURA
                            (worried)
                        Really?

           Alice is so excited she can barely contain herself.  

                                 ALICE
                        Santa left me a note saying there 
                        was something for Oscar and Corinne 
                        he couldn’t fit down the chimney, 
                        so he had to leave it in the back.

           Corinne SCREAMS with anticipation.  She and Oscar take off 
           toward the backyard.  Laura’s really hoping it’s not what she 
           thinks it is.

           EXT. HOUSE - BACKYARD - MORNING

           Corinne and Oscar find the TRAMPOLINE.  Red bow and all.

                                 CORINNE
                        I knew it!  I knew it!  I knew it!

                                 OSCAR
                        Oh, wow!  

           Charlie and Alice are beaming.  

           Laura’s livid.  She looks at Pierce.

                                 PIERCE
                        I had nothing to do with it.  

           Laura takes a deep breath and prepares for battle.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t do this, Laura.  

           But she does.  

                                 LAURA
                        Kids, I’m sorry.  Santa made a 
                        mistake.

                                 OSCAR
                        What?

                                 CORINNE
                        No!

                                 LAURA
                        This isn’t for you.  Santa dropped 
                        it off at the wrong house.

                                 ALICE
                        Laura.

                                 LAURA
                        Stay out of this, Alice.  They’re 
                        my children, not yours!  

           Charlie steps up. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        They’re our children.  You seem to 
                        forget I’m a parent in this family, 
                        too.

                                 LAURA
                        Then start acting like one!  Do you 
                        know how many kids get hurt on 
                        these?  We’re not keeping it.  End 
                        of story. 

            Maybe for the first time ever, he challenges her.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes, we are.  

                                 LAURA
                        Everyone inside right now!

           Corinne starts CRYING.

                                 CORINNE
                        Mom, no!  I want it.  It’s mine.   
                                 LAURA
                        What’s Mommy’s job?

                                 CORINNE
                        I don’t care!

                                 LAURA
                        Go inside!  You, too, Oscar.

           Oscar shoots her a nasty look and they go in the house. 

           Alice, Pierce, Charlie and Laura remain.

                                 PIERCE
                            (dripping with sarcasm)
                        Everybody say team on three.  
                        One...two...

                                 ALICE
                        Fuck you, Pierce.  

           They all look to Alice in disbelief.  

                                 ALICE
                        And that goes for you, too, Laura.  
                        You should be ashamed of yourself.  
                        You’re so busy trying to control 
                        the world, you’ve forgotten what 
                        it’s like to be a kid.  Well, this 
                        is my house and you’re not 
                        controlling me.  I’m in charge!  I 
                        say what goes.  You will apologize 
                        right this instant.  

           Like a tennis match, all heads turn to Laura.  

                                 LAURA
                        I’m sorry you exercised bad 
                        judgement in buying a trampoline 
                        that my children will never set 
                        foot on! 

                                 ALICE
                        You’re trying to ruin Christmas to 
                        spite me. 

                                 LAURA
                        For the first time, Alice, you’re 
                        overestimating me.  It’s not my 
                        intention to ruin Christmas.  I’m 
                        just trying to protect my kids.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAURA (cont'd)
                        Now, aside from letting them commit 
                        suicide on your so-called toy, is 
                        there anything else I can do to 
                        salvage your precious day?    

           A long, tense beat.  Then --

                                 ALICE
                        Actually...

           INT/EXT. - THE MERRIMAN’S HOUSE - LATER CHRISTMAS DAY

           The door opens and an uber-chipper couple BERT and HAZEL 
           MERRIMAN (70’s) greet them in Santa hats.

                                 THE MERRIMANS
                        Merry Christmas!

           ON Laura, Charlie, Pierce, Alice, Oscar and Corinne -- all 
           miserable.  Can’t even fake it at this point. 

                                 HAZEL
                        Come in.  We’re just about to get 
                        started with the Santa Switcheroo.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh joy.  

                                 BERT
                        Any snow out there yet, Pierce?

           If looks could kill.  

           INT. THE MERRIMAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           About twenty chairs are set up in a circle.  In the center is 
           a pile of wrapped PRESENTS.  Guests are taking their seats.

           Laura sees Matt waving at her from across the room.  She 
           ducks to avoid him.    

                                 CHARLIE
                        That guy’s waving at you.

                                 LAURA
                        What guy?  

           Matt comes over.  

                                 MATT
                        Hi.  
                                 LAURA
                            (awkward)
                        Hi.  Hey.  Matt, this is my 
                        husband, Charlie.    

                                 MATT
                        Hey.    

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nice to meet you.  

           A solid handshake.   

                                 MATT
                        Can I get you something to drink?  
                        Eggnog?  Hot cider?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ah -- I’m good for now.  

                                 MATT
                        Laura?

                                 LAURA
                        You know what?  I’ll come with you.

           She heads off to the kitchen with Matt.  

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Once she’s out of Charlie’s view --

                                 LAURA
                        Look, you need forget about last 
                        night.  I didn’t mean it.  I just 
                        thought --

                                 MATT
                        You don’t have to explain.  

                                 LAURA
                        Yes, I do.  See, I was trying to 
                        prove a point to Charlie, but it 
                        was a mistake.  And I’m sorry. 

                                 MATT
                        Laura.  You kissed me.  It was 
                        beautiful.  Why would you deny 
                        that?  

                                 LAURA
                        Because I actually love my husband.  
           Speak of the devil...

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        Laura.

           She jumps at the sound of Charlie’s voice.  

                                 LAURA
                        Aah.  Oh hey.  Hi.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        What’s going on?

                                 LAURA/MATT
                            (too quickly)
                        Nothing.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Alrighty then.  

           Charlie grabs a SODA and turns to leave.

                                 LAURA
                        Does it bother you that I’m talking 
                        to Matt?  

           Charlie turns back.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Of course not.  You haven’t seen 
                        each other in years.  

                                 LAURA
                        Actually, that’s not true.  Last 
                        night after our fight, I went over 
                        to Matt’s house.    

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh.  Whatever.  

           Charlie starts walking away.

                                 LAURA
                            (to Matt)
                        We had a such nice time, didn’t we? 

                                 MATT
                        Ah -- yeah.  

           Charlie keeps walking.    
                                 LAURA
                        We talked.  And reminisced.  And we 
                        even had that little intimate 
                        moment when we kissed.  

           Charlie finally stops.  Spins back around.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m sorry.  You what?

                                 LAURA
                        You heard me.    

                                 MATT
                        Oh god.

                                 LAURA
                        See?  Everything’s not always fine, 
                        is it, Charlie.  Sometimes life is 
                        messy.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        You used him to hurt me.

                                 LAURA
                        Maybe I have feelings for him.

                                 MATT
                        You do?

                                 CHARLIE
                        She doesn’t.

                                 LAURA
                        Maybe I liked kissing him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re lying.  I bet you were drunk 
                        and it was terrible!

                                 LAURA
                        So what?  It still happened!  

           Matt blanches -- totally offended.  

                                 LAURA
                        It bothers you.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Does not.  

                                 LAURA
                        Liar.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m fine with it.  

                                 LAURA
                        I kissed another man!

                                 CHARLIE
                        To get a rise out of me.  And to 
                        what end?  So I can be like you and 
                        overreact to everything?  So I can 
                        worry and agonize and plan for the 
                        worst in life?  Think about it, 
                        Laura.  Do you really want me to be 
                        more like you?  Because one of you 
                        is more than we can handle!

           Charlie heads into the living room. 

           INT. THE MERRIMAN’S LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Bert Merriman goes over the rules of the game.

                                 BERT
                        Just to recap, you can either open 
                        a new present or steal someone 
                        else’s.  But you can only steal a 
                        present once.  The game ends when 
                        the last present has been opened.  
                        Let’s play.  Who drew the ace?

                                 OSCAR
                        I did.

                                 BERT
                        Then, you’re up.

           Oscar opens a present.  It’s a bottle of GREY GOOSE VODKA.  
           Everyone LAUGHS.  Well, except Charlie, Laura and Matt.  

                                 OSCAR
                        Yuck.

                                 HAZEL
                        Don’t worry, Oscar.  I’m sure you 
                        won’t get stuck with that for long.  
                        Not with this group.

                                 BERT
                        So, we continue clockwise.  Pierce.

           Pierce looks at the vodka, considering it.  
                                 PIERCE
                        Sorry, kid.  I’m more of a single 
                        malt guy.  

           He takes a present from the pile and opens it.  REINDEER 
           COFFEE MUGS.  

                                 PIERCE
                        Great.  Something I can use all 
                        year long.  

                                 HAZEL
                        I think they’re cute.

                                 PIERCE
                        Take ‘em.  Because I’ll be really 
                        pissed if I end up going home with 
                        these.

                                 BERT
                        Alice.  You’re up.

           Alice looks at the pile of presents and then decides to take 
           the VODKA from Oscar.

                                 ALICE
                        I think I’ll take this.

                                 PIERCE
                        You don’t even drink.

                                 ALICE
                        Well, neither does Oscar, but this 
                        way he can keep playing.

                                 PIERCE
                        Yeah, but you’re stuck with 
                        something you don’t want!

                                 ALICE
                            (snapping)
                        Par for the course these days!  Now 
                        Oscar, Grandma wants that vodka.  

                                 OSCAR
                        You’re not my real grandma.  My 
                        real grandma’s dead.

           The entire room just got uncomfortable.

                                 LAURA
                        Oscar!  That’s an awful thing to 
                        say.
                                 OSCAR
                        Well, it’s true.

           Oscar opens another present.  It’s a bottle of PERFUME.  He 
           can’t catch a break.

                                 HAZEL
                        Natalie, sweetie.  Your turn.    

           Natalie walks to the pile.

                                 PIERCE
                        Take these stupid mugs from me.

                                 NATALIE
                        I don’t want the mugs.

                                 PIERCE
                        I’ll give you five dollars.

                                 MATT
                        Pierce.  She doesn’t want the mugs. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why don’t you stay out of it.

                                 HAZEL
                        I think they’re adorable.

                                 PIERCE
                        Well, now we know who brought ‘em.

           Natalie opens a new gift.  A BARBIE.  Her face lights up.  

                                 NATALIE
                        Awesome.  I don’t have this one. 

           Matt’s turn.  He considers taking the vodka, but opts to open 
           a new present instead.  It’s a GIFT CERTIFICATE.

                                 MATT
                        Thirty dollars at Morelli’s.

                                 ALICE
                        Ooh.  That’s the little Italian 
                        restaurant over on State.  I hear 
                        it’s excellent.

                                 MATT
                        One less meal I have to cook.    

           It’s Corinne’s turn.  
                                 LAURA
                        You’re up, sweetie.

           Corinne shrugs off her mother’s touch.  Still livid about the 
           trampoline.  Corinne marches over and snatches the BARBIE 
           from Natalie’s grip.

                                 CORINNE
                        I want this.

                                 NATALIE
                        But, it’s mine.  

                                 BERT
                        Natalie.  I’m afraid those are the 
                        rules.  If Corinne wants it, you 
                        have to give it to her.

                                 NATALIE
                        Can I take it back?

                                 BERT
                        No.  But someone else can.  

                                 MATT
                        Maybe if you ask nicely, Grandma 
                        Hazel will get it for you.  

                                 PIERCE
                        No, no, no.  Grandma Hazel’s taking 
                        the reindeer mugs.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nice.  Teaching her to steal, Matt.

                                 MATT
                        Excuse me?  

                                 HAZEL
                        Actually, sorry, Corinne.

           Hazel takes the Barbie from Corinne.  

                                 CORINNE/PIERCE
                        No!

           But Charlie’s already got a plan to sabotage Matt.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s okay, Corinne.  I’ll make you 
                        a deal.  You get the gift 
                        certificate for Daddy and I’ll get 
                        the Barbie back for you.
                                 MATT
                        Like hell you will.  

           Corinne grabs the Morelli’s gift certificate from Matt.

           Bert and Hazel look worried.  The game is quickly losing the 
           Christmas spirit.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You took something of mine.  I took 
                        something of yours.    

                                 LAURA
                        I thought you weren’t bothered by 
                        it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        This isn’t about you, Laura.  

           Charlie takes the Barbie from Hazel and all hell erupts.

                                 CHARLIE
                        There you go, Corinne.

                                 NATALIE
                        IT’S MY TURN!

                                 MATT
                        What’s your problem?  You want to 
                        take it outside?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Absolutely!

                                 LAURA
                        Really?   

                                 MATT
                        Come on, then!

           They all watch in horror as Matt and Charlie get in each 
           other’s faces -- about to fight.

                                 BERT
                            (separating them)
                        Stop it.  Right now.  

                                 ALICE
                        What’s gotten into you two?

                                 PIERCE
                        Actually, I’m kind of enjoying it.
                                 NATALIE
                        Can I have the Barbie?

                                 CORINNE
                        No!

           They tug-o-war it back and forth.

                                 OSCAR
                        Does anyone want some perfume?   

                                 PIERCE
                            (holding up the mugs)
                        They’d make a nice pencil holder.  

                                 LAURA
                        Someone pass the vodka.

           EXT. THE MERRIMAN’S HOUSE - JUST LATER

           The door is slammed.  They’ve officially been thrown out of 
           the Santa Switcheroo.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jerks.

                                 OSCAR
                        Your party stinks!

                                 PIERCE
                        And I get to go home with the 
                        goddamn reindeer mugs.  

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Laura’s sitting at the dining room table -- working on the 
           puzzle.  Alice enters and puts on the TEA KETTLE.  

                                 ALICE
                        Did Charlie go to bed?

                                 LAURA
                        Without saying good night.

           Alice sits at the table.  Laura’s annoyed at the company.

                                 ALICE
                        About tomorrow.  Your father said 
                        good news will come in the morning.  
                        If it’s bad news, they’ll want to 
                        run a few more tests and --
                                 LAURA
                        Alice.  

                                 ALICE
                        I’m sorry.  I’m sure you don’t want 
                        to think about it right now, but...

                                 LAURA
                        Don’t want to think about it?  It’s 
                        all I think about.  Every minute of 
                        every day!  I’d give anything to be 
                        able to turn off my brain for a 
                        minute.  Just one minute of peace 
                        and quiet.  

           Alice looks at her -- getting an idea.  

           EXT. HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT - LATER

           Alice and Laura sit on the back steps, facing the stream.  
           Alice is holding a FOLGERS COFFEE CAN.

                                 LAURA
                        Where exactly did you get this?

                                 ALICE
                        When my friend, Ester, died, a 
                        bunch of ladies from church went 
                        over to clean out the house.  I 
                        found this in the freezer.  

           Alice opens the can and pulls out a BAG OF WEED.  

                                 ALICE
                        She had glaucoma.  

                                 LAURA
                        Or a marijuana habit.  Do you have 
                        a pipe or something?

                                 ALICE
                        Don’t be silly.  

                                 LAURA
                        So, I suppose a bong would be out 
                        of the question?  

           Long pause while Laura channels her youth.  Then --

                                 LAURA
                        Oh!  Springdale baking contest!
           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           PULL BACK from a pan of award-winning, half eaten BROWNIES.  

           Laura and Alice are sitting on the kitchen floor in 
           hysterics.  Chocolate on their hands and mouths.

                                 ALICE
                        ...this was your yoga instructor?

                                 LAURA
                        Yes.  And it wasn’t a big fart.  It 
                        was what Corinne calls a fluffy.  
                        And he said “It never quite comes 
                        out how you expect it to.”  

           -- and they HOWL with laughter.  

                                 ALICE
                        How long does this stuff take to 
                        kick in?  I don’t feel anything. 

                                 LAURA
                        Me, either.  Let’s have one more. 

           They cut two more brownies.

                                 ALICE
                        I can’t believe I’m eating 
                        marijuana.

                                 LAURA
                        I can’t believe I’m eating carbs!

           They LAUGH.  Once the laughter dies down --

                                 ALICE
                        This is fun.  How come we don’t do 
                        this more often?

                                 LAURA
                        Recreational drugs?

                                 ALICE
                        No.  Spend time together.

                                 LAURA
                        Because I don’t like you.  

           After a stunned beat, they roar with laughter at the honesty.
                                 LAURA
                        It’s true.  You’re a total Jesus 
                        freak... 

           Alice is hysterical with laughter.  

                                 LAURA
                        ...you have some weird co-dependent 
                        relationship with my daughter...

           Holding the stitch in her side --

                                 LAURA
                        ...and I just don’t understand how 
                        anyone can tolerate my father.

           Both laughing now.

                                 ALICE
                        Stop it.  You’re killing me.  

                                 LAURA
                        He’s such an asshole.

                                 ALICE
                        I know.

                                 LAURA
                        An emotionally unavailable 
                        cocksucker!

           Peels of laughter.  Alice wipes the tears from her eyes.

           They let the words settle.  Calm down.  Laura takes a swig of 
           milk straight from the carton, then passes it to Alice.    

                                 LAURA
                        What was your first husband like?

                                 ALICE
                        He was fine until he left me.

           They both crack up again. 

                                 ALICE
                        I guess four miscarriages was one 
                        too many for him.

           Alice laughs, making light of it.  Laura straightens up.  

                                 LAURA
                        You -- you had four miscarriages?
                                 ALICE
                        Yeah.

                                 LAURA
                        That’s not funny, Alice.  

                                 ALICE
                        I know.  

           Alice looks down.  Avoids her eyes.  

                                 ALICE
                        The last one was a girl.  I always 
                        wanted a girl.  

           Laura is frozen.  Alice’s cards are finally on the table. 

                                 ALICE
                        No matter what happens tomorrow, 
                        you’ve had a beautiful little girl 
                        for five years.  That’s more than 
                        some people ever get.  

           Sitting side by side, with their legs stretched out in front 
           of them, Laura rests her head on Alice’s shoulder.  Finally, 
           a moment of compassion.    

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MONDAY MORNING

           Laura’s asleep on the couch and Sugar’s asleep on Laura’s 
           head.  Corinne nudges her mom.

                                 CORINNE
                        Mommy, are you awake?

           Laura shoos Sugar away.  

                                 CORINNE
                        I am now.

                                 CORINNE
                        Can I have my fruit snacks?

           Laura can’t help but laugh.     

                                 LAURA
                        I don’t believe you.  Come here.

           Laura opens up the blanket and makes room for Corinne to 
           crawl inside.
                                 LAURA
                        Tell me, what exactly is it about 
                        fruit snacks that you find so 
                        irresistible?

                                 CORINNE
                        They make me happy.  

                                 LAURA
                        Don’t other things make you happy?

                                 CORINNE
                        Not as happy as fruit snacks.  Can 
                        I?  Just this once?  

                                 LAURA
                        What time is it?

                                 CORINNE
                        But, Mom, why can’t I just have 
                        them if they make me happy?

                                 LAURA
                        Well, sweetie, because...

           Laura has to think about it.  

                                 LAURA
                        ...because, you need to eat food 
                        that will help you grow big and 
                        strong someday.

                                 CORINNE
                        Why do I need to be big and strong 
                        someday if I can be happy today?  

           Laura looks at her daughter.  Good question.    

           INT. HOUSE - OSCAR’S ROOM - MORNING

           Laura goes in to say good morning to Oscar.  She looks around 
           at the torn wallpaper.

                                 LAURA
                        Has Grandma seen this room yet?

                                 OSCAR
                        I don’t think so.

                                 LAURA
                        Let’s keep it that way.   
           She climbs in bed next to him.  

                                 LAURA
                        Do you mind if I just lay down for 
                        a bit?  Sugar pretty much slept on 
                        my head all night.  

                                 OSCAR
                        Sure.  

           As she fluffs the pillow --

                                 LAURA
                        Hey.  What’s this?

                                 OSCAR
                        What?

           She pulls out a GOLDEN DOLLAR.  

                                 LAURA
                        Look.  

           He looks at the coin.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s from the tooth fairy.    

           He shakes his head.  

                                 OSCAR
                        No, it’s not.  It’s from you.

                                 LAURA
                            (beat, then softly)
                        Well, who do you think the tooth 
                        fairy is?

           He looks at her.  Huh? 

                                 LAURA
                        I was going to tell you when you 
                        were ten.  I’m also the Easter 
                        Bunny.  And Santa Claus.  

           He takes a minute to digest it.  Then --

                                 OSCAR
                        So, you forgot.

                                 LAURA
                        I have a lot of things on my mind 
                        right now.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAURA (cont'd)
                        But, I’ve been thinking.  There are 
                        all these pretend things.  Things 
                        we make up.  And then there’s what 
                        real -- like family.  And maybe 
                        it’s time to appreciate the real 
                        things.

                                 OSCAR
                        I do.

                                 LAURA
                        Well, you were pretty mean to 
                        Grandma Alice yesterday.

                                 OSCAR
                        She’s not my real grandma.

                                 LAURA
                        She’s the only one you’ve ever 
                        known.  She’s never missed a 
                        birthday or a Christmas.  And she 
                        would never, never miss a tooth. 

                                 OSCAR
                        But you always say --

                                 LAURA
                        Stop.  I don’t want you to fight my 
                        battles for me anymore, okay?

           He nods a reluctant okay.    

                                 LAURA
                        Hell, I don’t even want to fight my 
                        battles, anymore.  

           KITCHEN - LATER

           Pierce finds Laura, Corinne and Oscar are at the table having 
           breakfast.

                                 PIERCE
                        Good morning.
                            (to Corinne)
                        We need to change that bandage 
                        today.

                                 CORINNE
                        NO!

                                 PIERCE
                        Yes.
                                 LAURA
                        Not now, okay?  

           Alice staggers in wearing oversized SUNGLASSES.  Gingerly 
           holding her head.  Clearly hungover.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Grandma!

                                 ALICE
                            (wincing)
                        Too loud. 

           Alice and Laura trade glances.  Their secret.

           The phone RINGS.  

           Pierce, Laura and Alice all snap to attention. 

           Charlie comes sprinting in from another room.  

           RING.

                                 LAURA
                            (excited)
                        Good news comes early.

           She pops up and answers it.

                                 LAURA
                        Hello?

           She listens for a long, strenuous beat.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m sorry.  They already get the 
                        paper.

           She hangs up.  Stressed out.  She looks at Charlie.

                                 LAURA
                        Good morning.

           Charlie ignores her.  Addresses the kids --

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who wants to play outside?

                                 OSCAR/CORINNE
                        I do!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay.  Get your jackets on.  
                                 LAURA
                        Hey, you guys?  

           Both kids look at her.

                                 LAURA
                        Not on the trampoline.

                                 OSCAR
                            (pouting)
                        We know.  

           Charlie shakes his head and leaves. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - HOURS LATER

           The CLOCK reads eleven forty five.  Laura and Pierce are at 
           the table, working on the PUZZLE.  It’s almost finished.

                                 LAURA
                        You know what I think?  I think 
                        “The Wizard of Oz” was a crock of 
                        shit.

           Pierce puts another piece of the puzzle in.

                                 LAURA
                        You want to know why?

                                 PIERCE
                        Do I have a choice?

                                 LAURA
                        Dorothy spends the whole movie 
                        trying to get home.  “There’s no 
                        place like home.  There’s no place 
                        like home.”  And then when she gets 
                        home, everything’s perfect.  When 
                        in reality, there really isn’t 
                        anyplace like home.  Not even home 
                        is like home.  

           Pierce pushes his chair back and walks out. 

           INT. GUEST BATHROOM - LATER

           Oscar and Corinne are alone in the bathroom.  He’s wearing 
           one of Charlie’s WHITE OXFORDS with a belt at the waist.  
           Corinne’s sitting on the toilet.
                                 OSCAR
                            (in an adult voice)
                        So, Miss.  Tell me where it hurts.

                                 CORINNE
                            (pointing to her neck)
                        Right there.  

                                 OSCAR
                        What happened?

                                 CORINNE
                        I fell off my bed.  Do you think 
                        I’ll die?  

                                 OSCAR
                        Well, I’ll have to take a look at 
                        it.

           Oscar starts to remove the BANDAGE.

                                 CORINNE
                        No!

                                 OSCAR
                        Corinne, how am I supposed to learn 
                        to be a doctor if I don’t practice?

           She thinks about it, then reluctantly takes her hand away.  
           Puts her trust in her brother.

                                 CORINNE
                        Be gentle.

                                 OSCAR
                        I promise.

           Oscar slowly removes the bandage.  Corinne winces but doesn’t 
           make a sound.  

           Pierce is quietly observing them from the doorway.  Watching 
           and learning from Oscar’s bedside manner.  

                                 CORINNE
                        How does it look, doctor?

                                 OSCAR
                        Really bad.  That must have been 
                        some fall.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Can you fix it?
                                 OSCAR
                        Yes.  The good news is I don’t 
                        think you’ll die.  But the bad news 
                        is, I’m going to have to operate 
                        for a really long time.

                                 CORINNE
                        Cool.  

           The door CREAKS.  They both look up and see Pierce. 

                                 PIERCE
                        Good work, Doctor.  When you’re 
                        finished there’s a patient waiting 
                        for a consult in the X-ray room.  

           Beaming from the morsel of respect --

                                 OSCAR
                        Be right there.

           INT. STUDY - LATER

           Charlie and Alice are watching a movie.  

           ON the TV.  “The Outsiders.”  

           Together, they share a bowl of popcorn and watch Matt Dillon 
           in his younger days.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           The CLOCK reads two fifteen. 

           Laura puts in the last piece of the puzzle.  Finally 
           complete, although missing a few pieces.  She runs her 
           fingers over the holes.  

                                 LAURA
                        I just don’t understand what 
                        happened to these pieces?

           Laura looks under the table.  Not there.  

                                 LAURA
                        Check the box.

           Pierce opens the box.  Empty.

                                 PIERCE
                        Nope.  
                                 LAURA
                        How could we lose them?

                                 PIERCE
                        What do you want, Laura,  
                        perfection?

                                 LAURA
                        Why not.

                                 PIERCE
                        Because you’ll be disappointed 
                        every time.

                                 LAURA
                        We had it for a little while.
                        Every piece.  All fitting perfectly 
                        together.

           Laura grabs the empty box -- 

                                 LAURA
                        And then it was gone.

           -- and shoves the puzzle into it.  Destroying it.

                                 LAURA
                         Just like that. 

           She sweeps another handful into the box.

                                 LAURA
                        You know what I hate?  Mother’s 
                        Day.  I hate the jerks at Hallmark, 
                        and the TV commercials and the fact 
                        that I can’t go to brunch on a 
                        Sunday in May because it’s all 
                        daughters who still have mothers.  

           She dumps the last of the puzzle into the box.

                                 LAURA
                        Don’t you miss her?

           Pierce avoids her eyes.  Hardens. 

                                 LAURA
                        Do you feel anything?  Guilt?  
                        Remorse?  Sorrow?  Lonesome?  

                                 PIERCE
                        I’m not going to do this with you.
                                 LAURA
                        Why not?!

                                 PIERCE
                        Because it was twenty years ago!

                                 LAURA
                        And yet it’s right here.  

                                 PIERCE
                        Let it go.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re a selfish man.

                                 PIERCE
                        You’re a selfish brat.  Just like 
                        your daughter.

           She SLAPS him!

                                 LAURA
                        DON’T YOU SAY ONE THING ABOUT HER!

                                 PIERCE
                        WHY?  BECAUSE I’M RIGHT?!

           The phone RINGS.  

           They both wait a beat, then jump up in unison and run to the 
           phone.  Pierce blocks her from picking it up.

                                 PIERCE
                        You want to know why I didn’t tell 
                        you to come home?

           RING.

                                 LAURA
                        Dad -- the phone!

                                 PIERCE
                        It was because she was waiting to 
                        see you.  She was only holding on 
                        for you.    

           RING.

                                 PIERCE
                        I knew the minute you got there, 
                        she’d be gone.  It was selfish.  It 
                        was wrong.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PIERCE (cont'd)
                        But I got two more weeks out of 
                        her.  Two weeks that I never would 
                        have had.  

           RING.

                                 PIERCE
                        I’m sorry you didn’t get to say 
                        goodbye, but I wasn’t ready.  I 
                        couldn’t let go.     

           ON LAURA.  Finally understanding.

                                 PIERCE
                        And if you think I don’t miss her 
                        every moment of every day, then you 
                        don’t know me.  I’ll never love 
                        anyone the way I loved your mother.  
                        Never.  I know it.  Alice knows it.  
                        It’s about goddamn time you knew 
                        it.  

           RING.

           Laura looks at him.  Her eyes full of tears that don’t fall.   
           Twenty years of resentment fading.  She picks up the phone.

                                 LAURA
                        Hello?

           She looks at Pierce.  Nods.  This is the call.  

                                 LAURA
                            (listens, then)
                        Yes.  Okay.  

           Long beat of listening.  She gives no indication.   

                                 LAURA
                        I understand.  Thank you.  Yes, 
                        he’s right here.  I’ll put him on. 

           In a daze, Laura hands the phone to Pierce.

                                 LAURA
                        Doctor Lancaster would like to 
                        speak to you.

           INT. OSCAR’S ROOM 

           Laura throws the door open.  Oscar and Corinne are playing. 
                                 LAURA
                            (excited)
                        Hey.  I need you guys to come with 
                        me.  I have a surprise.

           They light up and follow her downstairs.

           INT. STUDY

           Laura, Oscar and Corinne find Alice and Charlie watching the 
           end of the movie.  The credits are rolling.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?  Is there news?  

           Laura smiles -- happy, content.    

                                 OSCAR
                        Hey, Dad.  Come on.

                                 CORINNE
                        Grandma, you too!

                                 ALICE
                        Where are we going?

                                 LAURA
                        Outside.

           EXT. HOUSE - BACKYARD

           Corinne’s eyes are sparkling. 

                                 CORINNE
                        Really?!

           They’re standing around the trampoline.  

                                 LAURA
                        Go on.  

           Alice and Charlie look at Laura in disbelief.  

                                 OSCAR
                        Are you sure, Mom?

                                 LAURA
                        I’m sure.  Let me give you a boost.  

           Laura helps Oscar up.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        Why now?

           Laura smiles and shrugs her shoulders.

                                 LAURA
                        Because I was wrong.  Go on, 
                        Corinne.  

           Charlie lifts Corinne up.  

                                 LAURA
                        Oscar, help your sister.

           Oscar takes Corinne’s hand.  They start to bounce.  Slowly at 
           first.  In perfect unison.  

           INT. KITCHEN

           Pierce is still on the phone.

                                 DR. LANCASTER (O.S.)
                        ...go back in and make sure we got 
                        it all.  And I want to start 
                        chemotherapy right away.  Probably 
                        fifteen sessions.  I’m so sorry, 
                        Pierce.  I can’t imagine how hard 
                        this must be for your family.  I’ve 
                        got grandkids and I don’t know what 
                        I’d do.  

           Barely keeping it together --

                                 PIERCE
                        Thank you.

           He hangs up and breaks down in SOBS.  Every emotion, every 
           fear, everything he’s kept inside for years comes out now.  
           He can’t catch his breath.  

           Then, just like that -- he stops.  Gets control.

           Out the window, he sees --

           -- Oscar and Corinne jumping on the trampoline.  

           EXT. HOUSE - BACKYARD

           Pierce comes out, holding a cup of tea.   
                                 CORINNE
                        Mommy, this is fun!

           Pierce walks up to Laura.  They look at each other.  No words 
           needed.  Another hardship they’ll somehow get through.  

                                 OSCAR
                        Grandma, come on.

                                 ALICE
                        Oh no.  I couldn’t.

                                 OSCAR
                        Sure you can.  I’ll help you.  Just 
                        like you always help me.   

           Oscar offers his hand to Alice.  A peace offering.  Alice 
           smiles and gingerly climbs up on the trampoline.  

                                 ALICE
                        Oh my, it’s bouncier than it looks.  

                                 CORINNE
                        Daddy, come on!  You, too.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, if I get up there, we’re 
                        going to have to see who can jump 
                        the highest.  

                                 CORINNE
                        I can!

                                 OSCAR
                        I’m older.  I can.

           Charlie does a somersault onto the trampoline.  

           Corinne, Oscar, Alice and Charlie are all bouncing.

           Pierce puts his arm around Laura.  It turns into a hug.  He 
           whispers in her ear --

                                 PIERCE
                        Let’s be kind this time.  

           She nods and drops her head against his chest.  And for the 
           first time, she can hear the THUMP THUMP of his heart.

           Alice sees it.

           Charlie sees it.
           They both know the phone call was bad news.

           Charlie rushes to the side.  Leans over.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Laura?

           But he already knows.  A simple nod confirms it.    

           And after a lifetime of joy, a wave of terror washes over 
           Charlie.  Pure, nauseating fear.  Buried alive.  His face 
           cracks as he fights to suppress the SOBS. 

           In the background, Corinne bounces up and down.    

           Laura takes his face in her hands.  Now the strong one --

                                 LAURA
                        Listen to me.  You were right.  
                        We’re going to be just fine.

           He shakes his head.  No.  No.  No.  

                                 LAURA
                        Yes.  We are.  Now, come on.  Are 
                        you going to help me up or not?

           She smiles.  Content.  Free.  

           He offers his hand.  She puts her hand in his and they commit 
           to this journey.  He pulls her up and now everyone’s bouncing 
           but Pierce.  

                                 ALICE
                        Pierce?

                                 PIERCE
                        No way.  Not on your goddamn life!  

                                 OSCAR
                        Come on, Grandpa.  You can do it.  

                                 PIERCE
                        Someone’s going to break their neck 
                        and it’s not going to be me.

                                 OSCAR
                        Why don’t you grow a set, already?

           They all look to Pierce.  Pierce is either going to pummel 
           Oscar, or he’s going to -- 

           -- LAUGH.  The first time he’s truly laughed in ages.  
                                 PIERCE
                        Atta boy.  That’s more like it. 

                                 LAURA
                        Hey, after this it’s time for fruit 
                        snacks.

                                 CORINNE
                        But, I already had mine today.  

                                 LAURA
                        Who says you can’t have more than 
                        one a day?

                                 OSCAR
                        You do.

                                 LAURA
                        Well, it seems like a good day to 
                        break the rules.  

           Pierce takes a sip of tea from his reindeer mug.  And then he  
           looks up to the sky.

                                 PIERCE
                        Would you look at that?

           They all look up.

           It’s snowing! 

                                 LAURA
                        Better late than never.

                                 CORINNE
                        Hey, Mommy, look!  

           And Corinne takes a bounce that sends her flying off the 
           trampoline.  Out of frame.

                                 LAURA
                        Ohmygod!  

                                 PIERCE
                        Told you.  

                                 ALICE
                        Corinne!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sweetheart?  

           FROM OUT OF FRAME --
                                 CORINNE (O.S.)
                        I’m okay!

           And she is.  They all are.    

           For now, anyway.  

                                                              FADE OUT.
