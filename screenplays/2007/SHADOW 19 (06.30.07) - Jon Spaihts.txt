           EXT. SATURN ORBIT - FAR FUTURE

           Saturn swims against the stars, its rings slicing the night. 
           DIONE, a pale moon, looms in the foreground.

           SUPER: DIONE, MOON OF SATURN

           A battleship crosses the moon’s disk. On its hull: the name 
           HIGHLINE - and the symbol of a red hawk.

           INT. BATTLESHIP HIGHLINE (IN FLIGHT)

           CAPTAIN CONRAD VANCE of the Offworld Marine Corps prepares 
           for combat. He is a rugged man of 40, calm and focused. In 
           his massive ARMORED SPACE SUIT he looks superhuman: a half-
           ton war machine. His rifle is big as a cannon.

           Technicians swarm around him, checking systems.

           Nearby, more technicians tend to ELEVEN OTHER MARINES: elite 
           soldiers in their late 20s and early 30s.

           Vance is first on his feet. He steps free of his prep station 
           and walks the line, inspecting his men.

           Motors hum as he walks. His footfalls shake the deck.

           One of Vance's men catches his eye - MOX, a seasoned soldier.

                                 MOX
                        What do you think, Cap?

           Vance shrugs - a massive movement of armored shoulders.

                                 VANCE
                        The ammo load is armor-piercing, so 
                        whatever we're fighting, it's big.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        That's right.

           Silence in the room. The Marines turn to the man who stands 
           on a raised deck above them: their commander, COLONEL COBURN.

           Coburn wears an ordinary uniform and a headset. He frowns in 
           concentration, listening and talking at once.

                                 COBURN
                        The Hegemony has heavy tanks  
                        advancing on the Dione Colony.
                                 VANCE
                        The Colony has anti-ship guns. How 
                        did they land tanks?

                                 COBURN
                        They dropped 'em weeks ago on the 
                        far side of the moon. They crawled 
                        all the way around, right under the 
                        radar.

                                 MOX
                        What crawled all the way around?

                                 COBURN
                        Four D-Class tanks. And a mystery 
                        target. Something bigger.

                                 VANCE
                        Bigger than a D-Class?

                                 COBURN
                        Something new. Target's designated 
                        “Colossus”. We've got destroyers 
                        inbound, but they’re six hours 
                        away. Right now you’re all we have.

           The Marines become grim. This is a desperate action.

                                 COBURN (CONT'D)
                        Six thousand people live and work 
                        in the Dalton Mining Colony. Maybe 
                        they’ll be rotting in prison ships 
                        tonight. Maybe they’ll be free. You 
                        decide it now. Lock in.

           The Marines step into metal drop capsules. The capsules close 
           and sink into their launch tubes.

           EXT. DIONE

           The DIONE COLONY, an industrial city, sits rooted to the 
           rock. The red hawk symbol is painted on its walls.

           Around the city, the mines lie silent: digging machines 
           abandoned in their trenches.

           MISSILES swarm over the horizon toward the colony. The 
           colony’s GUNS blast some from the sky. Other missiles 
           detonate against the city walls.

           A digging machine EXPLODES in a weird airless fireball.
           Smoke clears. Across the valley, four D-CLASS TANKS climb 
           over the ridgeline. They are three stories high, painted with 
           the blue interlocking circles of the Hegemony.

           The colony goes turtle: withdrawing its towers, it closes up 
           and hunkers down against the rock.

           EXT. BATTLESHIP HIGHLINE (IN ORBIT)

           The Battleship's guns begin to fire in a cycle of terrible 
           violence: pounding at their targets on the moon below.

           Twelve DROP-CAPSULES launch. Rocket toward the surface of 
           Dione.

           EXT. DIONE - DALTON COLONY BATTLEFIELD

           The battleship’s bombardment hammers the tanks. Near-misses 
           and hits. Their armor is damaged but withstands the assault.

           The tanks launch flares and interceptor missiles.

           A drop-capsule rockets down and shatters, revealing Vance in 
           full armor. He vaults from the impact crater - as a missile 
           explodes where he just landed.

           Other drop capsules hurtle down, OTHER MARINES emerge. They 
           take cover in rocky terrain chaotic with explosions.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        All troops down safe.

                                 VANCE
                        Marines! Give me a battle line, 
                        twenty meter spacing. Athena. 
                        Tactical.

           The electronic voice of his armor's battle computer answers 
           him - feminine, calming.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Tactical.

           Vance’s visor lights up, painting the terrain around him with 
           data: enemies, friendlies, ranges and velocities.

           Each Marine is tagged in Vance's display with his name and 
           status. Vance watches his men move into a battle line.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Four D-Class tanks incoming. Target 
                        “Colossus” out of range.
           The four tanks loom closer. Behind them, Vance’s visor 
           display indicates the Colossus, hidden behind the ridge.

                                 VANCE
                        Advance on me. Fire as you go.

           Vance moves toward the D-Class Tank at a run through the 
           broken terrain. The other Marines join in seconds later, 
           their rifles blazing.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Incoming fire.

           From the tanks, energy beams flash toward the Marines. Vance 
           cartwheels off the ground, JUMP-JETS flaring from his boots. 
           He arcs through space, firing all the while.

           Behind him Marines take evasive action on their jets.

                                 VANCE
                        We're not breaching the armor. 
                        Let's get close and do some 
                        demolition.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Fatality. Sergeant Holder.

           Vance charges a tank. Enemy fire rakes the ground around him.

           INT. BATTLESHIP HIGHLINE - COMMAND COCKPIT (IN ORBIT)

           Onscreen, Colonel Coburn watches the battle unfold below.

           A fatality marker throbs where Sergeant Holder fell. The 
           eleven remaining Marines charge toward the enemy.

           EXT. DIONE - BATTLEFIELD

           Vance reaches a tank: gets in under its guns and keeps going, 
           right between its gnashing treads and under its armored body.

           From a pod on his thigh he pulls a series of powerful mines. 
           Plants them on the belly of the tank.

                                 VANCE
                        Athena. Detonate on my mark.

           On the underside of the tank, belly hatches open. ARMED 
           TROOPERS drop out. Their gunfire ricochets off his armor.

           Vance hurls a mine into an open hatch. Fires his jump-jets. 
           Cannonballs through the troopers into the clear.
                                 VANCE
                        Now!

           Behind him the tank EXPLODES spectacularly.

           Vance scans the battlefield - two of the D-Class Tanks burn 
           furiously. Marines concentrate fire on the other two.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Fatality. Lieutenant Carver.

           Vance looks up, and gapes in awe. The COLOSSUS climbs over 
           the ridge: a tank twice as big as the D-Class machines. A 
           fortress on the move.

                                 VANCE
                        I see the Colossus. It’s a monster.

                                 COBURN (V.O.)
                        We are hitting it now.

           A barrage of shells from the orbiting Battleship. Explosions 
           march across the lunar surface and pound the Colossus.

           When the smoke clears, the Colossus is battered but intact: 
           still coming.

           Its mammoth guns rise to point toward the stars.

                                 VANCE
                        Heads up, Command! Colossus is 
                        returning fire...

           A thunderous concussion shakes the ground. Flames leap as the 
           Tank's heavy guns all fire at once.

           EXT. BATTLESHIP HIGHLINE (IN ORBIT)

           Gunfire from the Colossus far below tears into the 
           Battleship, triggering a chain of EXPLOSIONS.

           INT. BATTLESHIP HIGHLINE - COMMAND COCKPIT

           Colonel Coburn, shaken badly, watches damage reports stream 
           in from the Battleship’s burning sections.

                                 COBURN
                        Marines. We are hit. Highline is 
                        disengaging.
           EXT. BATTLESHIP HIGHLINE (IN ORBIT)

           The Battleship veers away from Dione.

           EXT. DIONE - DALTON COLONY BATTLEFIELD

           All four of the D-Class Tanks are burning hulks. Marines 
           emerge from the smoking wreckage to advance on the Colossus.

           Vance watches in horror as the mighty guns of the Colossus 
           lower to engage in the surface battle.

                                 VANCE
                        Rapid advance! Move! Move!

           The battle line breaks into a run: the Marines sprint toward 
           the Colossus, rifles flashing...

           The HEAVY GUNS of the Colossus open fire. The Marines take 
           evasive action - but one by one soldiers are BLASTED into 
           oblivion.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Fatality. Sergeant Markhart. 
                        Fatality. Sergeant Chan. Casualty. 
                        Lieutenant Drake.

           Vance roars in rage.

                                 VANCE
                        Cover! Take cover!

                             (under his breath)
                        Too many. Too many.

           He stares at the Colossus, scanning the giant war machine 
           with telescopic vision.

           His gaze settles on the anti-personnel gun turrets that 
           protrude like steel barrels from the tank's hull.

                                 VANCE
                        McGrath! Get to Drake. Run a med-
                        check. Everybody else, fire from 
                        cover on my order. Target the 
                        sensors. Eyes and ears. I want that 
                        monster blind. Ready...
                             (gathers himself, poised 
                              to sprint)
                        Fire!
           Vance explodes from cover, racing toward the Colossus. Around 
           him, the Marines blast away at the Colossus's sensors with 
           precision rifle fire.

           Vance is half running and half flying, his jump-jets blazing. 
           The Colossus pounds the battlefield with haphazard firepower, 
           but Vance weaves and leaps and the gunfire doesn’t touch him.

           He gets in past the guns. Leaps onto the Colossus. Clings 
           magnetically beside a gun turret.

           A plasma torch extends from his forearm. He aims at the seam 
           where the turret meets the hull and lights up.

           Blinding light from the contact point. His visor darkens. 
           White-hot liquid metal gouts down the side of the tank.

           He plants his feet, wraps his arms around the gun and heaves.

           The motors of his battle-suit WHINE.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Warning. Critical strain.

                             (through clenched teeth)
                        Override!

           With a SCREECH, the entire turret tears out of the tank. A 
           GUNNER spins to the rock below. A BLAST of escaping air.

           Vance swings into the hole.

           INT. COLOSSUS

           Vance bulls down a passageway. He barely fits. The shoulders 
           of his armored suit scrape the walls.

           His visor’s heads-up display streams with data as ATHENA maps 
           the inside of the tank.

                                 VANCE
                        Hold your fire. I’m inside the

                        Inside?!

           A TANK CREWMAN rakes Vance with bullets that bounce off his 
           armor. Vance blows him away with a single shot.

           Vance reaches a ladder-well leading upward. He starts up - 
           and his shoulders CLANG against the well rim. He doesn’t fit.
           Vance heaves. The ladder rungs bend under his hands. With a 
           shriek of metal, the walls of the ladder-well give way.

           COLOSSUS - BRIDGE

           The COMMAND CREW does damage control: drivers wrestle with 
           controls...gunnery officers search for targets. They wear 
           light vacuum suits.

           Behind them, the ladder-well emerges from the deck plates.

           A ROAR. The bridge is shaken by an unseen force.

           Vance BLASTS out of the ladder-well on his jets, SMASHES into 
           the ceiling. Lands on his feet in a shower of scrap metal.

           The deck crew spins in alarm. Two crewmen pull pistols and 
           fire. Bullets ricochet wildly.

           Vance’s rifle comes up.

           EXT. COLOSSAL TANK

           An explosion blows out the Colossus’s command bridge. Jets of 
           flame billow into space.

           The Colossus goes dark. Churns to a stop. A hailstorm of 
           shrapnel pelts the battlefield.

           Vance lands on his feet in the dust - armor dark with soot.

           INT. BATTLESHIP HIGHLINE (ON DIONE)

           The Marines gather again in their ready room. They are 
           transformed: armor pitted and blackened, faces smeared with 
           sweat and blood. Only seven men remain.

           Technicians lift their helmets off, open up their armor. Two 
           men are wounded: medics rush to help them.

           The Marines gather around Vance, slap his shoulders in grim 
           celebration: they are mindful of their losses.

                                 MARINE #1
                        This was all you, Cap.

                        We won’t be seeing the inside of 
                        Dione Colony.

           The men turn. Coburn stands above them on his command deck.

                                 COBURN
                        We lift as soon as our casualties 
                        are aboard.

           The Marines murmur in protest.

                        Back to Mars already?

                        Earth. Special orders.

           Sudden silence.

                                 MARINE #3
                        What’s it about, sir?

                                 COBURN
                        I don't know. Captain Vance has 
                        been called home. We’re just along 
                        for the ride.

           The men’s eyes turn to Vance in surprise.

                                 COBURN
                             (to all the men)
                        I wish I could grant you some shore 
                        leave. You've earned it. But I have 
                        orders.
                             (points at Vance)
                        You. In my stateroom.

           INT. BATTLESHIP HIGHLINE (IN FLIGHT) - COBURN’S STATEROOM

           A luxurious cabin by spacefaring standards but still cramped. 
           Colonel Coburn sits reading an electronic slate.

           The engines rumble. Saturn’s rings slide past the porthole.

           Vance enters in regular uniform, hair damp. He looks wary.
                                 COBURN
                        Vance, you've done more combat 
                        tours than any man in the division. 
                        I've done all I can to keep you 
                        where you want to be. But it looks 
                        like I'm losing you.
                             (reads slate)
                        “Transport Captain Conrad Vance to 
                        Earth ASAP. Run silent. Avoid 
                        hazard of combat. Vance to report 
                        on arrival to the State Science 
                        Agency for special duty.”

           Vance looks stunned. This makes no sense to him.

                        What it says. A battleship diverted 
                        to take one man home!

                        Who knows what they do? But the 
                        Secretary of Defense signed the 
                        order himself. It’s for real.

                                 COBURN

                        Maybe it's time you got out of the 
                        field. You ought to have my job by 
                        now. Hell, you ought to be senior 
                        to me. How long can you keep 
                        refusing promotions?

                        I don't know. I'll stay in armor as 
                        long as they let me.
                             (he laughs)
                        Maybe that's what the Science guys 
                        want. To have my head examined.
           INT. BATTLESHIP HIGHLINE - BARRACKS - NIGHT

           Vance and the other Marines lie in their bunks watching video 
           on electronic slates as light as magazines. One soldier dozes 
           off in front of a news broadcast:

                                 NEWS ANNOUNCER #1
                        The Allied States and the Hegemony 
                        broke off arms-control talks after 
                        weeks of deadlock. Stockpiles of 
                        fusion and gravity weapons continue 
                        to grow.

           Another soldier munches bright blue chips from a bag and 
           watches a different channel:

                                 NEWS ANNOUNCER #2
                        Prices rose again as the population 
                        outgrew the food supply for the 
                        sixth year running...

           And a third soldier watches a video letter from home.

                                 MARINE'S WIFE
                        ...somebody tapped into the

                        prices I guess you can't be 
                        surprised. But imagine, stealing 
                        water!

           Vance watches a broadcast with particular interest:

                                 NEWS ANNOUNCER #3
                        ...more than half of the federal

                        popular outcry against this secret 
                        spending, the so-called "black 
                        funds" continue to grow.

           Five bunks are empty. Folded flags commemorate the dead.

           EXT. BATTLESHIP HIGHLINE (IN FLIGHT) - EARTH APPROACH

           The scarred Battleship passes an Allied States defensive 
           space station: a huge manned satellite bristling with guns.

           The satellite SCANS the Battleship with a laser beam as it 
           passes.

           Earth shines below, half in light and half in shadow. On the 
           planet's night side, cities shine in the darkness: far larger 
           than today's cities, and connected by arteries of light.
           The Battleship descends toward the eastern seaboard of North 
           America - where dawn is fast approaching.

           EXT. NEW WASHINGTON SPACEPORT (EARTH)- MORNING 

           A vast landing ground surrounds the spaceport terminal. 
           Military spacecraft lie at harbor. The distant towers of New 
           Washington shine in the sunrise.

           The Battleship Highline settles into a landing bay. A gangway 
           tube extends from the spaceport to the battleship.

           INT. GANGWAY

           Vance debarks alone, in dress uniform: his chest crowded with 
           medals. Walks the long transparent tube toward the terminal.

           His men watch him go, dressed in common fatigues.

           SPACEPORT TERMINAL

           Vance emerges from the gangway into a busy concourse.

           An officer in a military uniform stands waiting: JOHN 
           RANDALL, 50, a good-natured bear of a man with a barrel chest 
           and a crew cut.

                                 OFFICER
                        Captain Vance.

                        Major John Randall. Department of 
                        Defense. Welcome home.

           SPACEPORT CONCOURSE

           Vance and Randall walk together.

                                 RANDALL
                        It's an honor to meet you, Captain. 
                        I know what you did on Dione.

           He shakes his head, speechless. Vance nods his thanks.

                                 RANDALL
                        I'm here to make the handoff to 
                        your new command.

                        Who’s my C.O. now?
           Randall's forehead wrinkles in perplexity.

                                 RANDALL
                        The lawyers are looking at that. 
                        The whole arrangement's unusual. 
                        Technically, it looks like your 
                        C.O. is Jarod Marbeck. Director of 
                        the State Science Agency.

                             (amazed)
                        The Director of the SSA. And what 
                        does he want with me?

                                 RANDALL
                             (shrugging)
                        Secretary of Defense signed your 
                        orders. He didn’t tell me why.

                                 VANCE
                        Speak of the devil.

           He nods over Randall’s shoulder at...

           A PUBLIC MEDIA TERMINAL

           The news. A pretty ANCHORWOMAN speaks. In an inset image, the 
           SECRETARY OF DEFENSE gives a press conference.

                                 ANCHORWOMAN (ONSCREEN)
                        Secretary of Defense Gideon Dain 
                        today announced the end of 
                        hostilities over the Dalton Colony 
                        on Dione.

           The image cuts to the press conference. DEFENSE SECRETARY 
           GIDEON DAIN speaks: a chiseled man with salt-and-pepper hair 
           and the brick-solid build of a career soldier.

                                 SECRETARY DAIN (ONSCREEN)
                        Today the Hegemony surrendered its 
                        claim to our mining colonies on 
                        Dione, after last month’s defensive 
                        action by the Offworld Marines.

           Vance grins in satisfaction.

                                 SECRETARY DAIN (ONSCREEN)
                        The action was exemplary. Our 
                        losses, acceptable...

           Vance’s smile fades.
                                 SECRETARY DAIN (ONSCREEN)
                        ...and the Dalton Colonists remain 
                        free people.

           The news cuts to a piece on overpopulation.

                                 RANDALL
                        Nobody minds losing some soldiers, 
                        as long we win. I was in the

                              trouser leg. His right

                        Then I tangled with a neutron gun 
                        and landed me a desk job.

           Vance gives the artificial leg an expert glance.

                                 VANCE
                        That's a good leg. I have friends 
                        with that leg.

           SECURITY BARRIERS

           Vance and Randall exit the spaceport’s secure zone through a 
           humming gauntlet of sensors and scanning beams.

           Beyond the barriers, a SCIENTIST waits: Vance’s age, 
           athletically built. He wears a long black coat, styled like a 
           lab coat, and a black skullcap. His face shows no feeling.

                                 RANDALL
                        You must be...

                                 SCIENTIST
                        Rune Banneker, Scientist.

                             (ignoring the hand)
                        Yes. Come with me.

           Banneker turns to leave. Randall scowls in indignation.

                                 RANDALL
                        That's a war hero you're talking 
                        to. You take care of our man.

           Banneker replies with a supercilious smile.
                                 BANNEKER
                        He’s our man now.

           The Scientists strides off. Vance shoots a troubled look at 
           Randall, and hurries after the Scientist.

           INT. LIMOUSINE (IN FLIGHT) - DAY

           Vance and Banneker soar into New Washington. They are alone: 
           the limousine pilots itself.

           New Washington is shining and beautiful: an architectural 
           homage to the 20th-Century American city.

           Everywhere, signs of militarization: Soldiers on street 
           corners. Propaganda posters. On billboards, military style is 
           evident in civilian fashions. The red hawk banner of the 
           Allied States flies from every building.

                                 VANCE
                        I haven’t been here in years. It’s 
                        beautiful.

                                 BANNEKER
                        City population is forty-six 
                        million. Growth rate is five 
                        percent plus a year. It's 
                        unsustainable.

           Vance stares at Banneker in distaste.

                                 VANCE
                        I’ve been off-world for two years. 
                        It’s beautiful.

           The limousine settles in front of an imposing classical 
           skyscraper: The headquarters of the State Science Agency.

           INT. STATE SCIENCE AGENCY - DAY

           The cavernous lobby bustles with people. They wear stylized 
           lab coats in white, gray, or black. The youngest wear white 
           coats, the oldest black.

           Heavily armed Agency Guards stand post at every door.

           Banneker strides through the vast front doors, Vance in tow.

                                 BANNEKER
                        Welcome to the State Science 
                        Agency.

           Vance looks like he’s just stepped through the looking glass.
           Banneker heads for a distant bank of elevators. As they 
           approach, he stares at an elevator: it opens.

           ELEVATOR

           The doors close. Vance and Banneker are alone.

           Banneker gazes intently at the elevator’s control panel. 
           Lights flash to life, and the elevator descends.

           The floor indicator reaches the lowest basement level - but 
           the elevator KEEPS SINKING.

                                 VANCE
                        We’re still descending.

                                 BANNEKER
                        Yes.

           Vance stares. Banneker ignores him. The elevator plummets 
           deep underground.

           After an endless time the elevator sighs to a halt. The doors 
           don’t open. Banneker hands Vance an electronic slate.

                                 BANNEKER
                        Before entering this facility, you 
                        must sign this writ of secrecy.

           Frowning, Vance scrolls through the dense legalese.

                                 VANCE
                        "Penalties for violation of secrecy 
                        may include revocation of 
                        citizenship, imprisonment, or 
                        execution." Execution?

                                 BANNEKER
                        You can easily avoid the penalties 
                        by obeying the writ.

           The men stare at each other. Finally Vance presses his 
           thumbprint in the signature box. Banneker takes the slate.

           The elevator doors open.

           INT. UNDERGROUND COMPLEX

           Vance and Banneker emerge into a bright vestibule. A cannon 
           on the ceiling rotates and aims its muzzle at Vance.

           Vance takes an experimental sidestep; the cannon ignores 
           Banneker and tracks Vance like a hunting dog.
                                 BANNEKER
                        Security’s tight down here.

           UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR

           Banneker and Vance walk abreast at a brisk clip.

                                 BANNEKER
                        Why do you think we selected you, 
                        out of a hundred thousand Marines?

           A Scientist in a grey coat walks by, shepherding a mysterious 
           mechanism on a motorized cart. Vance watches it pass.

                        any trooper in the Offworld Corps.

           They pass another security cannon. Vance watches the weapon 
           unhappily as it tracks him.

           GRAND CONCOURSE

           A huge subterranean space, gleaming and supermodern. Walkways 
           above walkways, all bustling with movement as Scientists 
           hurry to and fro.

           In the center of the Concourse stands a great GLOBE OF EARTH: 
           it shows the world divided into two super-nations that cover 
           every speck of land on the planet - the Allied States marked 
           in red, the Hegemony in blue.

           Beside the globe stands JAROD MARBECK, 65, DIRECTOR OF THE 
           STATE SCIENCE AGENCY. Magisterial and severe in an ornate 
           black coat and cap.

           GOVERNING COUNCIL CHAMBER

           Marbeck and Banneker lead Vance into an immaculate white 
           conference room.

           Around the table: SCIENTIST WALTER LARSON, 60, slender and 
           folksy; SCIENTIST MARTIN CAUL, 70, a bearded man with fierce 
           eyes; and SCIENTIST CORDELIA RHAY, 65, keen and severe.

           All the Scientists wear black coats and skullcaps. Behind 
           each Scientist stands a gray-coated Apprentice.

           Vance's eyes are drawn to Martin Caul's Apprentice: ADA 
           KILDARE, 30, a beauty whose hair falls to her shoulders. She 
           watches Vance with open curiosity.

           Marbeck and Banneker sit, leaving a chair at the foot of the 
           table. After an awkward moment Vance takes the empty chair. 

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        Colleagues, this is Captain Conrad 
                        Vance of the Offworld Marine Corps.

           The Scientists inspect him. Vance looks back, his eyes 
           lingering boldly on Ada. Flustered, she looks away.

           Marbeck points at Vance.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        I was your age when I became 
                        Director. You see, I was a prodigy 
                        too: but where you excel at 
                        killing, I had other talents. I 
                        enlarged the Astronomy division and 
                        began a search of the heavens. And 
                        in just five years I found what I 
                        was looking for.

           He raises his hand, and a STAR swells into existence in the 
           air above the conference table - which is also a holograph 
           generator. Vance is startled, which amuses the Scientists.

                        You want me to go to Erix.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        Yes.

                                 VANCE
                        You want me to repair Crawler 
                        Three.

           Marbeck smiles like a teacher pleased with a clever student.

           CORRIDOR

           Marbeck leads Vance and the other Scientist along at a brisk 
           clip. Security cannons continue to pick Vance out of the 
           crowd and track him as he passes.

           Vance, shell-shocked by all he's learned, is trying to get 
           his head around it.

                                 VANCE
                        I thought I was pretty well-
                        informed. You know, I read the 
                        news.

           Marbeck chuckles.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        The events that truly shape the 
                        world rarely make the news. 
                        Especially in this day and age.

           PROMETHEUS PROJECT - TRANSPORT FACILITY

           A cavern of staggering dimensions, its floor lost in shadow 
           far below. A futuristic reactor looms in the darkness. At the 
           center of its coils: a chamber not much bigger than a coffin.
           A catwalk stretches across empty space to the chamber. 
           Marbeck leads Vance out onto the bridge. His voice echoes.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        The Lang Transporter. The only 
                        device of its kind. Humanity’s 
                        greatest invention, if humanity 
                        only knew it. That doorway there, 
                        that chamber...a gateway to another 
                        world. You will be the first to 
                        pass through, Captain. The first.

           PROMETHEUS PROJECT - STAGING ROOM

           A huge industrial space connected to the Transport Facility.

           Heavy machines hulk in the corners. Massive cranes hang 
           overhead. The floor is a mosaic of conveyor belts and moving 
           platforms.

           Banneker leads Vance in.

                                 BANNEKER
                        We have everything you should need. 
                        If we don’t have it, we can 
                        probably get it. If we can’t get it 
                        we’ll make it for you.

           Banneker points to a door at the top of a metal staircase.

                                 BANNEKER
                        Your quarters. Close to the work.

           A klaxon sounds: a massive locker descends into the Staging 
           Room on an elevator. The crate is marked with Marine insignia 
           and Vance’s name.

           Banneker gazes at a heavy crane: it leaps into motion. Lifts 
           the locker from the elevator. Sets it down and withdraws.

                                 VANCE
                        You keep doing that.

                                 BANNEKER
                        Doing what?

                                 VANCE
                        Controlling machines with your 
                        eyes. Elevators, doors, the crane. 
                        How's it work?

                                 BANNEKER
                        In the Agency, rank has its 
                        privileges.
           He removes his cap. He is bald: a sleek metal crown clings to 
           his scalp. Its terminals pass through the skin into his head.

                                 VANCE
                        Ouch.

                                 BANNEKER
                        When there are secrets to be kept, 
                        machines make the best servants. We 
                        don’t need many human helpers here.

           Vance keys his ID code into the massive locker. Thumbs the 
           print reader. The case opens.

           Inside: Vance’s armor - and an arsenal of weapons and tools.

           Banneker peers into the locker. Inspects a rack of something 
           like wet-suits. He fingers one curiously. It's marked with 
           Vance's name and Captain's rank insignia.

                                 BANNEKER
                        What is this?

                                 VANCE
                        Skinsuit. You wear it under the 
                        armor. Soaks up sweat, keeps your 
                        skin clean, heals wounds. It even 
                        scratches where you itch. Best of 
                        all, on a long mission it 
                        catheterizes you.

                                 BANNEKER
                        Ouch.

                                 VANCE
                        Yeah. You tend to have a love-hate 
                        relationship with your skinsuit.

           MINUTES LATER

           Vance, wearing a skinsuit, stands in front of his armor.

                                 VANCE
                        Athena, wake up.

           Athena’s electronic voice speaks from the battle suit.

                        Captain Vance.

                        Open.
           The battle-suit SPLITS OPEN like some strange mollusk - the 
           helmet swings back, the body opens wide.

           Vance slips easily into the armor, and it closes around him. 
           He stands up wearing half a ton of metal.

                                 VANCE
                        Offworld Marine, ready for duty.

                                 BANNEKER
                        Very impressive. Come and see the 
                        repair job. We have a mock-up.

                                 VANCE
                        Hang on.

           Vance reaches into the locker and clamps a bulky apparatus 
           onto his left forearm. He points it at Banneker.

           Its muzzle belches a blur of motion that makes Banneker 
           flinch violently - but it’s only a rapid rotation of tools: 
           socket-wrench, chisel, hammer, pincers.

                                 VANCE
                             (grinning)
                        Field engineer’s toolkit. Can’t 
                        hurt you.

           Behind Vance, unknown to him, the Staging Room machines turn 
           on him: the heavy crane hangs overhead, its quivering jaws 
           ready to crush him. A pit opens at his heels. Security 
           cannons awaken and take aim.

           Banneker relaxes, and the machines withdraw silently into the 
           shadows.

           TRAINING FACILITY

           Vance, in full armor, enters on Banneker’s heels. Apprentices 
           gape at the giant in their midst.

           A house-sized machine dominates the room. It’s shaped like a 
           beetle’s head: two eye-like domes, a shell of armor plate.

           One armored dome is torn raggedly open.

                                 BANNEKER
                        This is a replica of Crawler 
                        Three’s comm array. We reproduced 
                        the damage from diagnostics.

           Vance takes in the complex machine. Shoots Banneker a look.
                                 VANCE
                        Look, why am I here? You've got to 
                        have hundreds of engineers who 
                        could do this.

                                 BANNEKER
                        The Offworld Marine battle suit is 
                        the toughest spacesuit there is. 
                        And it takes months of training to 
                        wear it. A skilled Marine was our 
                        best option.

           Vance walks up the module’s hull and inspects the damage. He 
           casually peels back the thick metal and peers inside. 
           Banneker’s eyes widen at this feat of strength.

                                 VANCE
                        What did this?

                                 BANNEKER
                        Unknown. Probably collision damage. 
                        Erix isn’t flat.

                                 VANCE
                        It's not pretty. But it looks like 
                        the only real damage is this cable. 
                        It's an easy fix.

                                 BANNEKER
                             (skeptically)
                        There are components you have to 
                        move. Systems to shut down and 
                        restart in a certain order.

           and intricate mechanisms.

           Larson, Banneker, and Vance survey a huge scale model of 
           Prometheus and its Crawlers.

           They cluster around the model of Crawler Three.

                        right that second it’ll launch its 
                        rockets, bound for the seas of

           Larson frowns. Four hatch-covers flip open on top of the 
           model of Crawler Three. Four model rockets emerge. Larson 
           lifts one with obvious pleasure.

                        The oceans are the foundation of

           Vance and Banneker lock eyes. They’re not going to get along.

           STAGING ROOM

           The Staging Room is deserted. Vance and Banneker enter.

                        The auto-what?

           VANCE’S QUARTERS

           A simple room with a desk, a holography table, and an 
           industrial metal bed. A door opens onto a compact bathroom.

           A panel in the wall stands open: the AUTOVALET, a delivery 
           system. A dinner tray, demolished, sits on the desk.

           At the holograph table, Vance flips through data: maps of 
           Erix...diagrams of Prometheus...diagrams of Crawler Three.

           Under the table, his knee jumps with nervous tension.

           CORRIDOR

           Deserted. Vance strolls restlessly, hands in his pockets. The 
           security cannons track him as he passes.

           VESTIBULE

           Vance palms the elevator switch: ACCESS DENIED.

           TRANSPORTER FACILITY

           Vance stands outside the door. Stares into the transporter 
           cavern. Electricity flickers over the vast machinery.
           In his face in this solitary moment, we see something 
           extraordinary: fear.

           She leads them through a tantalizing laboratory. Apprentices 
           work at display screens filled with weather systems, 
           satellite maps, complex data displays.

                        everything.

           She hustles them through the lab too fast to allow Vance a 
           good look around.

           MARTIN CAUL’S OFFICE

           The den of a university professor: actual books on shelves, a 
           holography table, huge display screens for data.

           Scientist Caul and Ada sit with Vance and Banneker. Caul 
           scowls at Vance and strokes his beard.

                                 CAUL
                        You'll have to tell me how I can 
                        help you, son. I'm no military man.

           Vance looks impatient.

                        I have to travel a hundred

                        the ground made of? Does it rain? 
                        What’s the rain made of? What about

           Caul glances nervously at Banneker.

                                 CAUL

                        life on Erix could be dangerous to 
                        you. And we simply have no idea.

           TRAINING FACILITY

           Vance, in armor, practices the repair. Larson and a crew of 
           APPRENTICES look on. Vance’s right hand is tucked behind his 
           back; he works with his left.

           Vance finishes the repair, lifts his hand with a flourish. 
           Diagnostic lights flash to life.

           Vance lets Ada in. She moves into the room, a little shy, 
           looking around. Vance, suddenly self-conscious, gives the 
           place a quick scan, but there's nothing to tidy up: the room 
           is immaculate.

           She peeks into his tiny bedroom: Vance's personal effects are 
           stashed meticulously; his bedsheets are taut as a drumhead.

                                 ADA

           A map of Erix rises from the table. Vance looks it over.

           Vance toggles the map through different overlays: temperature 
           data, precipitation, geology...he stops at a display he 
           doesn't understand.

           VANCE'S QUARTERS - LATER

           Alone, Vance studies the map. He's been at it for a while. He 
           pulls a REMOTE from his pocket and speaks into it.

           Vance’s stylus floats over the map: across ridges and 
           valleys, canyons and rivers. A long way. Touches again.

           INT. VANCE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Vance does push-ups, ticking them off like a metronome. 

           He rises, breathing hard. The map of his mission glows on his 
           holography table: he circles the table, studying the map, 
           focused and deadly serious.

           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - STAGING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Vance, in full armor, is checked over by a team of 
           Apprentices. Banneker looks on.

           Vance’s breathing is slow and steady, his eyes far away.
           At the last moment the Apprentices replace his “VANCE” ID 
           plates with plates reading “VANCE 1.” Vance takes no notice.

           TRANSPORT FACILITY

           Vance enters, hulking in his armor.

           Ada stands beside the door. Vance musters a smile.

           Vance crosses the catwalk to the transport chamber. The 
           Scientists watch from the Control Room window.

           All eyes on Vance. Tension palpable in the room.

           The transport chamber opens, spilling light into the cavern.

                        Enter the chamber.

           TRANSPORT CHAMBER

           Vance steps inside. The door closes. He stands cramped in the 
           small, bright chamber. Breathing faster now.

           New Washington stands pale against the dawn. A rolling 
           BROWNOUT darkens the city’s lights.
           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - TRANSPORTER CONTROL ROOM

           The Scientists watch as electrical arcs spatter across the 
           Transporter. The noise is incredible.

           Ada joins the other Scientists in the control room. They 
           watch in fascination.

           TRANSPORT CHAMBER

           Vance closes his eyes against the light and noise. Sweat runs 
           down his cheek.

           The dynamos reach a SCREAMING PITCH and hang there.

           BOOM. Blinding light.

           Pure energy hammers through the transport chamber: for a 
           split second Vance is a human lightning rod, a negative 
           image, his mouth wide in an inaudible scream.

           Silence.

           Vance stands trembling, wisps of smoke rising from his armor. 
           He takes a shuddering breath. Opens his eyes.

           The chamber door grinds open - not the slim door he expected, 
           but a massive slab of armor plate.

           He looks out at...

           THE PLANET ERIX

           Smoky clouds race across a blood-red sky. Lightning flashes, 
           and where it strikes a ribbon of fire twists and fades.

           The landscape is a jungle out of a child’s nightmare. 
           Everything is moving. There’s no clear division between plant 
           and animal. It howls and rages and feeds on itself.

           Vance stares, transfixed with horror.

                                 VANCE
                        My God.
           EXT. PROMETHEUS GROUND STATION

           Prometheus towers out of the jungle, its vast ribs curving 
           into the sky like the bones of a giant.

           The ship’s descent has blasted a clearing in the jungle. The 
           tracks of the huge Crawlers lead away in all directions, 
           highways of crushed vegetation and ruin.

           Vance steps out. The ground crunches under his boots.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Satellite system online.

                        Athena. Show me Crawler Three.

           A blue marker on his visor display points down the path to 
           his left. Crawler Three is out of sight over the horizon. A 
           readout gives the distance: 124 KILOMETERS.

           Vance moves out into the clearing. VINES wriggle toward him 
           across the ground. Vance, wide-eyed, skips back from them.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Multiple targets incoming.

           PREDATORS burst from the jungle and head for Vance - big and 
           terrifyingly fast. Gleaming tusks jut from their shoulders.

           Vance pulls his rifle - but the weapon is tangled in vines.

           He pulls it free - too late. They’re on him. Tusks punch 
           through his armor. Horrific wounds.

           His rifle fires convulsively.

           He dies.

           The gunfire shocks the jungle into motion. Winged things 
           explode into flight, trees claw at the air. A vision of Hell.

           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - TRANSPORT FACILITY (EARTH)

           The transport chamber’s door opens. Vance steps out onto the 
           catwalk. He’s untouched, his armor unmarked.

           A few thin wisps of smoke rise from his shoulders. He doesn't 
           look like a man who's just seen his own death.

           In the Control Room the Scientists stand watching.
                                 VANCE

           Vance looks up at the Control Room. The Scientists look down 
           at him...all but Ada Kildare, who turns and vanishes.

                        Perfectly safe in theory. It takes 
                        a week to recharge the transporter. 
                        One week. Until then - continue 
                        training.

           TRAINING FACILITY

           Vance, in armor, stands in front of the repair mock-up. 
           Plainly sick of doing this. He sighs heavily.

           He gestures, and the toolkit extrudes from his armored 
           gauntlet. He starts the repair.

           INT. VANCE’S QUARTERS - DAY (A WEEK LATER)

           Vance sits wearily at his small holography table. His 
           tactical map of Erix glows in the darkened room. A KNOCK.

                                 VANCE
                        Come in.

           Banneker steps in, all business.

                        The transporter’s ready. You go in

           PROMETHEUS PROJECT - TRANSPORT FACILITY - MORNING

           Vance, in armor, steps into the chamber for the second time. 
           His ID tags read VANCE 2. The door closes behind him.
           TRANSPORT CHAMBER

           Vance stands cramped in the tiny chamber.

                                 RHAY (V.O.)
                        Stand by...on your signal.

           Again the dynamos howl in leashed fury.

                        Go.

           A BOOM and a blinding FLASH.

           Energy slams through him - and then Vance stands shuddering 
           in the transport chamber.

           The door opens. Vance steps out into the...

           TRANSPORT FACILITY

           Vance looks up at the Control Room window where the 
           Scientists stand.

                                 VANCE
                        What now?

           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - STAGING ROOM - NIGHT

           Vance, wearing a headset, tinkers with his armor.

                                 VANCE

           Vance looks up. In the corridor outside, Scientist Banneker 
           and Ada Kildare are arguing. Vance lifts a headphone away 
           from his ear, listens. The thick window muffles their voices.

                                 VANCE

                        the problem you want him to solve.

           They move away down the hall, and the conversation is lost. 
           Vance pulls his headset off, pondering.

           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - VANCE’S MISSION ROOM - NIGHT

           Vance lies on his bed, the room lit by the shifting light of 
           a holograph: bloody Erix orbiting its pale sun.

           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - TRANSPORT FACILITY - MORNING

           Vance, in full armor, steps once more into the

           TRANSPORT CHAMBER

           The door closes over him as the dynamos howl. The tags on his 
           armor read VANCE 3.

           BOOM. Lightning strikes inside the chamber.

           EXT. ERIX - PROMETHEUS GROUND STATION - DAY

           Electricity crackles over the immense terraforming ship.

           The transporter door opens. Vance emerges, trailing wisps of 
           smoke. Gapes again at the alien wilderness.

           Two CASUALTY MARKERS hover in his visor display. He inspects 
           the fallen shapes with telescopic vision. Sees the shattered 
           armor, reads the ID tags: VANCE 1, VANCE 2.

                                 VANCE

           Vance scans the jungle. Nothing to see. He notices a fallen 
           RIFLE beside one of the fallen Marines. Sprints for it.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Incoming. Multiple targets.

           Vance gets the rifle. Three PREDATORS are closing on him.

           He BLASTS them, a rifle in each hand.

           The gunfire tears into the predators. They stagger, raging 
           against their injuries, and go down.

           Vance relaxes - and his visor LIGHTS UP with warning markers.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Incoming. Incoming. Incoming.

           PREDATORS erupt from the jungle. The leaders pounce and Vance 
           jumps away on jets, rifles blazing mid-air.

           He lands running. They stay with him, flanking him.

           Vance leaps over a SABER TREE and the tree snatches him out 
           of the air, piercing his armor with curved blades. He dies.

           INT. TRANSPORT FACILITY (EARTH) - MORNING

           The transport chamber door slides open. Vance, unhurt, steps 
           out into the laboratory, visibly angry.

           From the Control Room the Scientists look down at him.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK (V.O.)
                        Apologies, Captain. It looks like 
                        we’re not quite there yet.

           Vance stares suspiciously. He zooms in telescopically on the 
           Director’s face. Marbeck is smiling.

                                 VANCE
                        Athena. Open up.

           CONTROL ROOM ACCESS CORRIDOR

           Vance emerges from the elevator in his black skinsuit. He’s 
           got something hidden in his hand.

           Banneker stands at the Control Room door. Vance brushes past 
           him and palms the door switch. Nothing happens.

           Banneker slides between Vance and the door.

                                 BANNEKER
                        The Control Room is a restricted...

           Vance applies an armlock. Plants Banneker’s hand on the door 
           switch. The door slides open.

           CONTROL ROOM

           Director Marbeck stands waiting. Around him, technicians sit 
           at elaborate consoles.

           Vance enters. Banneker follows, rubbing his twisted arm.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        Captain.

           Vance takes in the monitors and controls. He scans the faces 
           of the technicians.

                                 VANCE
                        You’re not disappointed.

                        They’re not trying to figure out 
                        what’s wrong. They’re just sitting 
                        there. Job's done.

           He holds up an ID tag from his armor. It reads VANCE 3.

                             (to Vance)
                        Captain, you won't get what you

                        noted. Banneker, if you will.

           Banneker reaches for Vance’s arm as if to escort him out. 
           Vance stops him cold with an admonishing finger.

                                 VANCE
                        Not on your best day.

           He flings the ID plate at Marbeck’s feet.

                                 VANCE
                        Do you know what battle readiness 
                        is, Director? It’s the vital thing 
                        that bleeds away when you keep 
                        soldiers in the trenches too long. 
                        When you tell them every day that 
                        battle is coming, and it never 
                        comes. I'm in the dark here. I 
                        don't know what we're doing. And at 
                        this rate, when something finally 
                        happens, I won't be ready.

           Marbeck struggles visibly with his temper, and wins. He takes 
           a deep breath.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        You're right. The Lang Transporter

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        You said it yourself. Faster-than-
                        light travel is not possible. The 
                        Transporter works by another 
                        principle.

                        Conrad, the Lang Transporter has

                        Just give me the bottom line.

                                 RHAY
                        Sorry. The Lang Transporter doesn’t 
                        “transport” things. It duplicates 
                        them. It samples whatever’s in one 
                        chamber and creates a perfect copy 
                        in the other chamber. We’ve created 
                        copies of you on Erix three times.

           A moment of silence rolls by. Vance stares at the Scientists.

                                 VANCE
                        Copies of me. On Erix.

                        The Transporter allows you to stand 
                        on Earth and cast your shadow on 
                        another world. The men we sent to 
                        Erix were you, in a sense, with 
                        your abilities, your memories, your 
                        intentions...but you remain.

                        And you didn’t feel the need to 
                        tell me this. What are you doing? 
                        Building an army over there?

           He stares out at the Transporter brooding in its cavern.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        There’s no army. Your first two 
                        duplicates, your shadows on Erix, 
                        died within minutes. Your third

           A fantastic electrical display erupts from the Station,

           SHADOW FOUR steps out in heavy armor, railgun in one hand, 
           missile launcher in the other.

           He stares in grim determination at the jungle reflected in

           Ada peers into the map table. Vance leans over her shoulder. 
           He stands close; they’ve grown comfortable with one another.

           Ada leads Vance down an unfamiliar industrial passage. She 
           can’t quite suppress a smile. Vance is perplexed.

           Ada palms a door open, revealing a freight elevator. He 
           follows her in.

           FREIGHT ELEVATOR

           The doors close. Vance looks up. The elevator is an open 
           platform: the concrete shaft seems to go up forever.

           Ada palms the switch. Nothing happens. Ada scowls.

           Then the elevator ROCKETS upward. The walls hurtle past. They 
           grab for the railings. Ada grins from ear to ear.

           EXT. SSA HEADQUARTERS - ROOF - DAY

           A trap door in the roof slides open. The elevator rises into 
           view and locks into place. Vance is astonished. 

           They step onto the roof.

           The sun drenches New Washington in golden light. Traffic 
           sparkles. Buildings shine. Clouds scud overhead.

           Time accelerates. The sun hurtles across the sky.

           The raptors fly off, revealing broken armor, a ravaged body.

           Night and day flicker past. Alien vermin swarm over the

           withers to a bare skull.

           Seven days pass. Time slows. Resumes its normal pace.

           The computer traces their complex paths. Equations appear in

           around him, skipping off tree-trunks.

           He emerges into a clearing...and stops short. SCORPIONS wait 
           for him there: monstrosities whose tails hurl deadly spines.

           Pursuing Scorpions burst from the jungle behind him. Caught 
           in the middle, he leaps to the top of a round rock.

           Scorpions swarm out of the jungle, surrounding him. He pivots 
           in place, guns raised. Hope drains from his face.

                        I know that sounds strange.

                                 GARVEY
                        Sounds like you took a few hits to 
                        the helmet.

           ARMORY

           Garvey leads Vance past a fantastic gallery of armor 
           prototypes: slim black stealth suits; five-ton demolition 
           suits; suits with massive specialized weapons.

           They pass a rack of massive axes and machetes too heavy to 
           lift without armor.

           They stop beside a gorgeous silver armor with fluid lines. 
           Vance takes to it immediately.
                                 GARVEY
                        Here’s the crown jewel. Diamond 
                        fiber plate. Hardest thing going. 
                        And lighter, so we can bulk up the 
                        chassis, the power plant, the 
                        motors. Stronger and faster than 
                        current models.

                        This is what I need.

           Vance is already headed for the exit. Garvey follows, 
           protesting.

                                 GARVEY
                        I knew you’d say that. It’s the 
                        only suit of its kind.

           They pass the rack of massive machetes. Vance points.

           WEAPONS LAB

           Garvey shows Vance a rack of identical supermodern rifles. 
           They are bulky and ponderous: designed for powered armor.

                                 GARVEY
                        The Milburn M20 railgun. Next 
                        generation rifle.

           Vance heaves a railgun out of the rack. With a speed that 
           belies the weapons weight, he checks the safety; cracks the 
           magazine open, checks the load, closes it; cocks the weapon 
           loudly, chambering a round.

           Nearby technicians look up as the weapon goes live.

           Vance hauls the rifle to his shoulder - arms trembling under 
           the burden. He flicks the gunsight on. The scope paints light 
           across his eyes.

           Vance shuts the rifle down and drops it into the rack.

                        A handheld energy weapon? There's 
                        no such thing.

           Vance looks her steadily in the eye.

           The Valkyrie hangs behind shatterproof glass: a sleek energy 
           rifle. It's polished to perfection, but toolmarks and welds 
           betray its handmade origin.

           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - CAUL'S OFFICE (NEW WASHINGTON)

           Scientist Ada Kildare arrives at Scientist Caul's office, and 
           is shocked to find the door flanked by SSA guards.

           She enters to find Scientist Caul and Director Marbeck 
           waiting for her.

           Marbeck has a cold and malevolent air. Scientist Caul looks 
           both furious and frightened; his hands are fists.

           Ada picks up the vibe in the room. Looks warily from Marbeck 
           to Caul.

                                 ADA

                        your duty.

           Ada frowns at Caul, sensing deeper meaning in the words but 
           unable to grasp it.

           Caul turns and leaves the office. The SSA guards outside the 
           door fall into step and escort him away.

           Three dignitaries sit behind a long table: a distinguished 
           MAN IN A SUIT flanked by two GENERALS, a man and a woman. The 
           generals' chests are buried in decorations.

           Vance follows Garvey in and snaps to attention, eyes wide 
           with surprise.

           He stares at the man in the suit: Defense Secretary Gideon

           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - VESTIBULE - NIGHT (NEW WASHINGTON)

           Vance emerges from the elevators in his dress uniform. The 
           security cannon takes aim at him.

           VANCE’S QUARTERS

           Vance hangs up his uniform. Steps to his comm terminal. 
           Punches Ada’s name. The response flashes: UNAVAILABLE.

           VANCE’S QUARTERS - HOURS LATER

           Vance lies in bed, staring at the door. No one comes. Rising, 
           he dials Ada again: UNAVAILABLE.

           Sighing, he rolls back into bed.

           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - TRANSPORTER FACILITY - DAY

           Vance approaches the transport chamber in his gleaming new 
           armor and weaponry: laser rifle, grenade launcher, giant 
           machete.
           This is his first attempt at Erix in his experimental gear. 
           His ID tag reads VANCE 14. 

           In the Control Room, the Scientists look on - Ada among them.

           Vance vanishes into the transport chamber. The transporter 
           howls as it charges. A BLINDING FLASH.

           Vance emerges, a veil of smoke rising from his armor. He 
           stalks away without so much as a glance at the Control Room.

                                 VANCE
                        Now we’ll see.

           STAGING ROOM

           Vance tinkers his new battle suit, still in the skinsuit he 
           wears beneath his armor.

           ATHENA answers in Ada's voice. The sound is more resonant in 
           the new armor.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE

           O.S. Voices in the corridor.
           Banneker enters, talking to a couple of Apprentices. Seeing 
           Vance and Ada talking, he stares in their direction.

           Ada shies away from Vance.

                                 ADA
                        I need some distance for a while.

                        I have to talk to you.

           But Ada’s already drifting away, brow furrowed with anxiety.

                        I can't. I'm sorry.

           Vance watches her go.

           DIRECTOR MARBECK’S OFFICE - DAY

           An immense, aristocratic room. Director Marbeck sits behind 
           his massive desk, staring into a data terminal.

           Vance enters unannounced. He has a serious air.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        Captain! An unexpected pleasure.

           Vance ignores the false pleasantry. Pulls up a chair and 
           sits.  A moment passes before he speaks.

                                 VANCE
                        Back when I was still new to the 
                        Corps, my platoon was called up for 
                        a secret op. We did a night drop 
                        with two other platoons on a 
                        Hegemony base on Venus. My platoon 
                        secured the perimeter. Second 
                        platoon cut the comm lines and 
                        jammed radio. The third platoon 
                        went inside. We heard a lot of 
                        shooting. When we dusted off, the 
                        third platoon looked shaky. They 
                        said they'd just killed a bunch of 
                        civilians. Combat report said we 
                        hit a hard target, but it wasn't 
                        true. It was a research station. I 
                        don't know why we hit it.

                             (impatiently)
                        What lesson am I supposed to...

                        A few weeks later it all blew up. 
                        There was a top-secret shitstorm. 
                        Our base commander resigned. They 
                        broke up my platoon and sent us to 
                        other units. They broke up the 
                        second platoon the same way. But 
                        the third platoon, the guys who did 
                        the shooting, they went up on 
                        charges. War crimes. That was ten 
                        years ago and they're still locked 
                        up. And you know, it nothing but 
                        luck that it wasn't my platoon 
                        pulling the trigger.

           Marbeck can see where this is going, and he doesn't like it.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK

           Vance and the Scientists of the Governing Council surround 
           the holography table.

           Ada joins them. Vance catches her eye, but she looks away.

           Vance sits at his holography table. A battle on Erix plays 
           itself out in front of him like a fireworks display.

           A fatality marker pops up: SHADOW 15.
           INT. PLANETOLOGY CENTER - ADA KILDARE'S OFFICE - DAY

           Ada sits in what was Scientist Caul's office - now hers.

           She is looking at Scientist Caul's work: his equations, his 
           diagrams...trying to understand. Lacking a cybernetic crown, 
           she must use a stylus and keyboard where Caul could use his 
           mind alone.

           She browses a menu titled "SEMANTIC STUDIES." Selects a file.

           An error message comes back: FILE DELETED.

           She tries the next file, and the next. The result is always 
           the same: FILE DELETED.

           Ada paces around her office, scowling in troubled thought.

           INT. STAGING ROOM - DUSK

           Vance bolts a new ID plate to the Staging Room wall. It reads 
           SHADOW 16. He steps back, looks at the array of names. 
           Sixteen dead men.

           A movement catches his eye. He turns his head to find Ada 
           watching him from the corridor, ghostly in her gray coat.

           When he catches her eye, she hurries away.

           VANCE’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Vance sits at his holography table. The map of Erix lies 
           before him. He traces the paths of his Shadows...past the 
           fatality markers of Shadows 16...17...18.

           Shadow 18 died just half a kilometer from Crawler Three.

           Vance stares thoughtfully at the map. Taps it with his 
           stylus, zooming out. The outlines of continents and finally 
           the curvature of the planet become visible.

           He rotates the planet, studying it: rust-colored land, dark 
           rivers draining into darker seas...pale deserts, mountain 
           ranges, polar icecaps. All wreathed in smoky clouds.

           The doorbell chimes. Vance switches the map back to his 
           tactical view. Opens the door to find Ada.

                        to stay away from you, and I did.

           She steps into the room, and into his arms. Their kiss gains 
           momentum fast.

           He presses her back onto the holography table, laying her 
           body across the crags and valleys of Erix. The landscape 
           crackles and sparks beneath her as he opens her gray coat.

           VANCE’S QUARTERS - BEDROOM 

           Vance and Ada lie entangled, sweat shining on their skin. Ada 
           pillows her head on Vance's shoulder.

           Vance pulls Ada down the stairs from his quarters. They've 
           thrown clothes on but they're still mussed from bed. Vance

           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - STAGING ROOM - MORNING

           Vance suits up for a transition to Erix.

           He wears the gleaming prototype weaponry. The badges on his 
           helmet and shoulders read VANCE 19.

           TRANSPORT FACILITY

           Vance crosses the catwalk to the transport chamber. From the 
           Control Room, Director Marbeck watches him.

                                 MARBECK

           TRANSPORT CHAMBER

           The chamber door closes, sealing Vance inside. Dynamos throb 
           and howl.

           A BOOM. Lightning strikes inside the tiny chamber.

           The chamber door opens, revealing:

           THE JUNGLE OF ERIX

           Reflected in Shadow Nineteen’s visor. His eyes widen in 
           horror and astonishment.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN

           Shadow Nineteen stands in the open chamber, staring out at 
           Erix. Like a sleepwalker he presses the door switch.

           The chamber closes. Seals him once more in a bright cocoon, 
           too small to move in. He closes his eyes. Swallows hard.

           Reaches for the door switch. Hesitates. Lets his hand fall.

           He leans his head on the door.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        I don’t want to die.

           It's Ada's voice. He’s still for a long moment, his eyes 
           squeezed shut.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN

           He stands straight. Squares his shoulders. Opens the door.

           EXT. PROMETHEUS GROUND STATION - MORNING

           The battles of eighteen Shadows have transformed the terrain: 
           A cratered field strewn with broken armor and alien bones.

                        Marines down.

                        I know, I know.

           The tracks beaten into the jungle by the Crawlers are 
           narrower than before - overgrown.

           Shadow Nineteen steps out of the chamber. All around 
           Prometheus, predators forage among the bones.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Multiple targets incoming.
           Shadow Nineteen explodes into movement, running for high 
           ground. Predators give chase.

           He strafes them with his laser rifle: CRACKLING BEAMS of 
           white light. Predators fall dead. Trees topple in the jungle. 
           It's a hell of a gun.

           EXT. WOODS (ERIX) - DAY

           Shadow Nineteen is on the run, hounded by SPIDERS that slash 
           at him with curved blades.

           His armor shows damage: shallow notches and cuts. He’s 
           exhausted, panting, drenched in sweat.

           He turns and faces the spiders. Raises his grenade launcher.

           BOOM. BOOM. The antimatter explosions are blinding.

           Two blasts tear holes in the jungle, annihilating spiders. 
           But more keep coming...their numbers are incredible.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Targets inside minimum range.

                        God damn.

           He strafes the nearest spiders with his rifle and runs.

           He splashes into a STREAM: the SPIDERS REAR BACK, HISSING, 
           and will not enter the liquid.

           Shadow Nineteen looks down. The stream is full of TRANSLUCENT 
           WORMS, big as rattlesnakes. They suck at his armor.

           He lifts a worm in his hand, experimentally. It bites 
           harmlessly at his armor. After a moment he drops it.

           Spiders leap over his head to the opposite bank. They slash 
           at him from both banks, nearly reaching him.

           He SUBMERGES HIMSELF in the stream. Under the surface, he 
           watches the spiders search for him and straggle away.

           Shadow Nineteen’s breathing slows. He settles into a more 
           comfortable position on the stream bottom. The eerie worms 
           slide silently past, ignoring him.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Athena. Mission time.

           Shadow Nineteen closes his eyes.

           Vance, sleeping in his narrow bed, wakes beside Ada. She 
           caresses him, her bare arm gleaming in the half-light.

           A faraway look comes into Ada’s eyes.  Her voice takes on an 
           electronic tone.

           Ada slides her arms around him. Her legs lock around his 
           thigh. Her expression is inhuman, intense. She kisses him 
           violently - it’s the act of a predator.

           EXT. STREAM (ERIX) - DAY

           Shadow Nineteen slams awake in the alien waters.
           A SPINED SERPENT coils around him in a grotesque parody of 
           Ada’s embrace. It bites at his visor, etching the glass.

           Shadow Nineteen, freeing his machete, hacks through the 
           serpent’s coils. Worms swarm over the serpent’s corpse.

           Shadow Nineteen struggles out of the stream.

           CLIFFS - DUSK

           Shadow Nineteen reaches the base of the cliffs. The body of 
           SHADOW TEN lies on the rocks, broken by a devastating fall.

           He stands staring at the shattered body, haunted.

           Shakes it off. Looks up at the towering wall, a thousand 
           meters of sheer rock.

           CLIFF FACE - DUSK

           He ascends in a series of climbs and rocket-assisted jumps.

           A STORM begins: fierce wind and a viscous black rain. He 
           climbs on as darkness falls. 

           Exhausted, he comes to a ledge in the cliff face where 
           previous Shadows have burned their signatures into the rock: 
           SHADOW 7...SHADOW 11...SHADOW 15.

           EXT. CLIFF FACE - MORNING

           Shadow Nineteen wakes on the ledge. His eyes open on the 
           awesome sight of the churning jungle far below.

           He’s about to resume climbing when he turns back, burns his 
           name on the stone: SHADOW 19.

           EXT. CLIFFTOP - DAY

           Shadow Nineteen climbs into view, panting, to find a...

           HIGHLAND PLAIN

           Covered with pale green waving grasses: serene and beautiful. 
           Winged creatures wheel gracefully overhead.

           He pauses there and catches his breath: a moment of peace.
           Then he takes a step forward - and the GRASS itself clutches 
           at him, scratching his armor. He leaps back, tearing himself 
           loose. He spots a MESSAGE burned into the rocks:

                              GRASS KILLS. BURN IT.

                                             SHADOW 8

           Shadow Nineteen turns his flamethrower on the grass. It 
           withdraws into the ground, baring a circle of earth that 
           expands across the plain like ripples in a pond, revealing:

           A litter of alien bones and a SUIT OF RAVAGED ARMOR whose ID 
           plates read VANCE 6.

           Suddenly the grass sprouts anew. Doubling its height. 
           Tripling it. The long blades beat at Shadow Nineteen. He 
           flees along the cliffs.

           ROCKY WASTE - NIGHT

           A wasteland of cracked clay studded with stone outcrops. 
           Lightning flickers overhead.

           Shadow Nineteen crosses the waste at a run, his armor’s 
           floodlights feeble in the vast darkness. He carries his rifle 
           and grenade launcher. Breathing hard. Dripping sweat.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Bogeys incoming, five o’clock.

           Shadow Nineteen spins, fires a grenade high. It EXPLODES, a 
           white sunburst. Winged creatures fall away in flames.

           For a moment the wasteland is illuminated. Strange shapes 
           moving closer through the darkness.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Seven grenades remaining.

           Shadow Nineteen runs on. Passing a rock formation, he slides 
           into a long, skidding stop. Turns his light on the rock.

           A message is burned above a crevice: SHELTER.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Bogeys incoming, eight o’clock. Ten 
                        o’clock. Four o’clock...

           Shadow Nineteen scrambles for the crevice.
           CAVE UNDER THE ROCK

           Shadow Nineteen squirms inside: a tight fit.

           Turning to survey the tiny cave, Shadow Nineteen gasps in 
           shock: a DEAD MARINE sits in his floodlight beams. The ID 
           tags on the battered armor read VANCE 9.

           Shadow Nine’s eyes stare through a broken visor. Vermin 
           scuttle inside his helmet. Dried blood paints the cave floor.

           O.S. A SCRABBLING NOISE.

           Something outside tries to get in. Scimitar CLAWS probe the 
           cave entrance and withdraw.

           Shadow Nineteen sits, keeping his rifle on the cave mouth and 
           eyeing Shadow Nine. The corpse stares back.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN

                        ask him.

           CAVE UNDER THE ROCK - HOURS LATER

           Still leaning against the cave wall, Shadow Nineteen sleeps. 
           He’s turned his armor’s floodlights off: only dim instrument 
           lights illuminate his face.

           A SCRAPE of metal. Movement in the darkness. An armored hand 
           slides up Shadow Nineteen’s chest.

           He wakes with a start.

           SHADOW NINE leans over him, dead eyes leering, mouth agape: 
           clutching at his armor. Their faces are inches apart. Shadow 
           Nineteen is paralyzed by terror.

           The dead man breathes raggedly. Wheezing, gripped by a 
           hideous need to communicate. He speaks in a ruined voice.

                                 SHADOW NINE
                        This world will kill you, and you 
                        will kill the world.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                             (a desperate whisper)
                        I'm not going to die here.

                                 SHADOW NINE
                        You are a circle of death.

           CAVE UNDER THE ROCK

           Shadow Nineteen wakes with a shout. His armor’s floodlights 
           snap on. His rifle whips up, aims at Shadow Nine. Shaking.

           Shadow Nine slumps against the wall, lifeless and inert.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Athena. Has that guy moved?

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        No, Captain. That guy is dead.
           EXT. HIGHLAND WOODS - DAY (DAYS LATER)

           Shadow Nineteen stalks at high alert through the undergrowth. 
           He is gaunt, weary, whiskered. His armor carries new scars.

           His battle-suit motors grind and whine.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Athena. Mission time.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Six days, fifteen hours.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Stimulant.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        You have exceeded recommended 
                        dosages...

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Override.

           There’s a HISS. His pupils dilate sharply. He takes a ragged 
           breath and stands up straighter.

           HIGHLAND MAZE

           The red sun beats down on a valley of fissured stone.

           The report of Shadow Nineteen’s rifle echoes distantly. Far 
           off a flock of WINGED RAPTORS bursts into the air, screaming. 

           A sudden EXPLOSION as an antimatter grenade detonates in the 
           distance. Stones wheel airborne through the smoke. Another 
           BLAST. And ANOTHER.

           Shadow Nineteen, barely seen, works his way through the rocky 
           maze, his movement betrayed by a trail of smoke and ruin.

           An explosion resounds. The echoes reverberate and fade, and 
           silence falls on the valley.

           ROCKY HOLLOW

           Shadow Nineteen, moving stealthily, rounds a rock outcrop and 
           disturbs a giant WORM feeding on its kill.

           An armored Worm, with no eyes and a complex mouth full of 
           blades. Its blind head whips around, questing. Shadow 
           Nineteen freezes.
           The Worm doesn’t budge. A long moment passes. Shadow Nineteen 
           takes a slow step toward the shelter of the rock outcrop. The 
           Worm slithers toward him - frighteningly fast.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Oh, hell.

           He raises the grenade launcher.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Too close.

           Shadow Nineteen fires PAST the Worm. The grenade arcs over 
           its head and DESTROYS its kill in a grotesque explosion.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Grenades depleted.

           The blast batters the Worm, but it gathers itself at once. 
           Sniffs at the ruin of its dinner. Charges Shadow Nineteen.

           Shadow Nineteen drops the empty grenade launcher and 
           shoulders his rifle: Fires.

           Hits the Worm twice, inflicting terrible wounds, but it 
           doesn’t slow down. 

           Its jaws close on the rifle: the rifle CRACKS loudly. Spews 
           white plasma. The Worm, scorched, leaps back SCREAMING: a 
           hideous, unearthly sound.

           Shadow Nineteen hastily flings the rifle away. It spins 
           through the air and EXPLODES in a sunburst of white light.

           Shadow Nineteen turns to face the Worm, drawing his machete - 
           too late. The Worm SLAMS into him. They tumble over the 
           ground, grappling. The machete goes flying.

           With his armored hands, Shadow Nineteen strains to prevent 
           the Worm's mandibles from closing on him.

           Pinned under the Worm, Shadow Nineteen plants his feet 
           against its body and fires his JUMP JETS. Flames ROAR from 
           his boots. The Worm recoils, shrieking.

           Shadow Nineteen rolls to his feet.

           Unarmed, howling in rage, he meets the Worm head-on and deals 
           BLOW after BLOW with his armored fists until black blood 
           coats his gauntlets and the Worm lies slain.

           EXT. CLIFFTOP

           Shadow Nineteen stands combing through data, scanning maps.
                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Athena. Show me the bodies of other 
                        Shadows. I need a weapon.

           In Shadow Nineteen’s visor, glowing markers spring up across 
           the landscape, each marking the death-site of a Shadow.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Who’s closest?

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Shadow Thirteen.

           A single death marker shines in the highlands. Beside it, a 
           distance indicator reads 3.6 KILOMETERS.

           SHADOW THIRTEEN’S LAST STAND

           Shadow Nineteen sneaks up on the site.

           He holds his machete in one hand. His flamethrower nozzle 
           juts from his other wrist - his only remaining weapons.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Athena. Stimulant.

           A HISS. He shudders and steps out into the open.

           In a clearing, SHADOW THIRTEEN lies slumped against a stone. 
           His body bristles with spines sunk deep in his armor.

           Around him lie hundreds of alien corpses: spiny Scorpions 
           dead and broken. They crunch under Shadow Nineteen’s feet.

           Shadow Thirteen’s armor and rifle are covered with strange 
           crystals. Shielding his head, Shadow Nineteen test-fires the 
           corroded weapon. It EXPLODES in his hand.

           Shadow Nineteen screams in frustration.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Damage to right glove. Repairing.

           EXT. WITHERED PLAIN - DUSK

           Shadow Nineteen, crossing hard dried clay and sparse plant 
           life, warily approaches a huddled shape. His visor display 
           labels the shape: SHADOW 15.

           As he gets closer, Shadow Nineteen discerns a fantastic 
           sight: a MENAGERIE OF ALIEN CREATURES sitting around a hidden 
           light. Most appear dead. A few breathe but do not move.
           Still closer. He sees an ARMORED MARINE squatting among the 
           beasts: SHADOW FIFTEEN. A rifle discarded at his feet.

           Thin NEEDLE TENDRILS have emerged from the ground at Shadow 
           Fifteen’s feet, crept up his legs, and found entrance through 
           his armor’s chestplate. A skull stares out of the helmet.

           All the creatures are snared and pierced by these tendrils.

           Shadow Nineteen shields his eyes from the light. He gropes 
           toward the fallen rifle.

           Getting close, he glances up at the dead marine - and sees 
           LIGHT reflected in the dead man’s visor.

           Entranced by the reflection, he lowers his hand. A BRIGHTER 
           light tugs at the corner of his eye, and he looks at the true 
           source. A BEAUTIFUL GLOWING ORB atop a vegetable stalk.

           Shadow Nineteen approaches it. Steps into the ring of 
           creatures, staring, hypnotized.

           He drops into a crouch, just like Shadow Fifteen. Fine needle-
           tips grow from the soil around his boots.

           EXT. WITHERED PLAIN - NIGHT

           Shadow Nineteen hasn’t moved.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Captain. You’re dehydrated.

           His drinking tube nudges his lips inside his helmet. Shadow 
           Nineteen doesn’t drink. Water drips down his chin.

                                 ATHENA
                        You are suffering muscle cramps, 
                        Captain. Injecting muscle relaxant.

           A hiss. His lips move, faintly, but he doesn’t speak.

           He stares into the light.

           Fine tendrils wind around Shadow Nineteen’s legs and quest 
           upward. Their needle-tips search for weak points.

           Across from Shadow Nineteen, an alien corpse collapses, 
           gutted by vampiric tendrils.

           And over the alien corpse...

                                        ...an impossible APPARITION stands: 
           A black-cloaked figure - as if the Angel of Death itself has 
           come to watch Shadow Nineteen die.

           EXT. SSA HEADQUARTERS - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Ada and Vance stand huddled against the wind in the corner of 
           the roof. They wear overcoats: winter has come to New 
           Washington.

                                 ADA
                        Three thousand dead!

                                 VANCE
                        That's what Larson said. The whole 
                        construction crew.

           Ada's outrage hardens into determination.

                                 ADA
                        I'm going to find out what Martin 
                        discovered.

                                 VANCE
                        I don't think that's smart.

                                 ADA
                        It doesn't matter. I need to know.

           EXT. WITHERED PLAIN - DAY (ERIX)

           Shadow Nineteen crouches in the ring of aliens. His lips are 
           cracked, his eyes bloodshot. He breathes in shallow gasps.

           There is no sign of the mysterious cloaked figure who stood 
           watching before.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Captain. You must wake up. Captain. 
                        Captain Vance. Injecting stimulant.

           A HISS. Shadow Nineteen’s pupils dilate. His breath catches, 
           but resumes its shallow rhythm.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Captain...You must...

           Athena trails off - as if even she is surrendering hope.

           The tendrils entangling Shadow Nineteen grope at the 
           chestplate of his armor.
           Suddenly SHADOW FIFTEEN collapses: the tendrils have stripped 
           his skeleton and gutted his armor. He falls apart with a 
           horrible CLATTER of metal and bone.

           Shadow Nineteen’s eyes flicker to the fallen figure. He reads 
           his own name on the armor. A precious moment of lucidity.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                             (huskily)
                        Athena. Blackout.

           His visor goes OPAQUE. Shadow Nineteen falls to the ground. 
           Slowly tears free of the tendrils, his limbs in agony.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Athena, you see the light?

                                 ATHENA
                        Yes, Captain.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Don’t let me see that light. Tell 
                        me when I’m facing away.

           He turns on hands and knees.

                                 ATHENA
                        The light is behind you now.

           Shadow Nineteen crawls a few feet, attempts to get to his 
           feet. He’s too weak.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Help me stand up.

           His armor’s motors whine. Mechanically, like a puppet, Shadow 
           Nineteen stands.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Let’s walk.

           Shadow Nineteen trudges away, his steps stiff and robotic.

           ROCK OUTCROP

           Shadow Nineteen sits shaking in the shelter of stones.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Food. Water.

           An arm inside his helmet presses a food pellet to his lips. 
           He eats it. His water tube extends, and he drinks.
                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Stimulant.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        It’s dangerous to...

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Override. Stimulant.

           HISS. Shadow Nineteen gulps air. His teeth chatter.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Show me the next Shadow’s location. 
                        I need a weapon.

           A pointer appears on his visor display: the distance 
           indicator reads 14.1 KILOMETERS.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Shadow Fourteen.

           HIGHLAND JUNGLE

           Shadow Nineteen, still shaky, prowls into a stand of trees. 
           He carries his machete and flamethrower at the ready - the 
           only weapons he has left.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Stimulant.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        You have no more combat stimulant.

           He almost bursts into tears.

           An ALIEN WOLF lunges from the woods in front of him. Shadow 
           Nineteen chases it off with a billow of flame.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Flamethrower fuel low.

           More wolves approach behind him. Shadow Nineteen throws fire 
           their way. They keep their distance.

           Shadow Nineteen fights a retreating action through the woods, 
           keeping the pursuing wolf-pack at bay with his flamethrower.

           He backs into a...

           CLEARING

           The wolf-pack stops in its tracks, wailing and keening.
           Shadow Nineteen turns. A giant THORN TREE towers here, its 
           bladed branches filled with skewered creatures. Among these 
           monsters, crucified on thorns, hangs an ARMORED MARINE.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Shadow Fourteen.

           SHADOW FOURTEEN’S rifle is still in his hand.

           Shadow Nineteen steps warily forward. Branches slash at him. 
           He fends them off with the machete and steps back, panting.

           He aims his flamethrower and tries to burn the tree. Fire 
           licks weakly from the nozzle and flickers out.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Flamethrower fuel depleted.

           The wolf-pack mills at the edge of the clearing, watching.

           Shadow Nineteen tries to reach Shadow Fourteen by hacking and 
           slashing with the machete. The branches are too many and too 
           strong. He retreats, his armor gashed and sparking.

           No gun. No flamethrower. He needs a weapon.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Athena. What’s the power reading on 
                        Shadow Fourteen’s armor?

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Power at eighty-seven percent.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        What’s my power cell reading?

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Eighty-nine percent.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        If I pull my power cell, how long 
                        will my backup power last?

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Thirty seconds.

           He stares at Shadow Fourteen’s body, gauging distances.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        When I pull my power cell, give me 
                        a countdown to power out.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Warning: when backup power...
                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        No warnings. Just count down.

           He pulls the power cell from its slot in his chest. Red 
           warning lights flash on.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Thirty seconds of power remaining.

           Shadow Nineteen squeezes the power cell in his hands until it 
           CRACKS. White light shines from the fissure. He hurls the 
           leaking cell into the heart of the tree.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Come on...

           The cell EXPLODES. The tree, engulfed in flame, flails and 
           screams. Shadow Nineteen shrinks away from the deadly limbs.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Twenty seconds remaining.

           The tree’s thrashing weakens. Shadow Nineteen wades into the 
           branches, hacking with the machete.

           The dying tree rakes at his armor. Shadow Nineteen grabs 
           Shadow Fourteen’s ankle. Drags the body down.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Ten seconds remaining.

           Shadow Nineteen pulls the dead man’s POWER CELL - as a BRANCH 
           lifts him off his feet. The power cell falls to the ground.

           He fights desperately, chopping with his massive machete.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Five seconds.

           Shadow Nineteen hacks through the branch. FALLS heavily to 
           the ground. He searches frantically for the power cell.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Four...three...

           He sees it! Lunges though the burning branches.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Two...one...

           His hand closes around the power cell - just as his power 
           dies. He crashes to the ground, his armor suddenly a crushing 
           iron maiden he cannot lift.
           The outside world is muffled, his breathing loud in his own 
           ears. His breath fogs his visor. Shadow Nineteen roars in 
           frustration inside his helmet.

           The WOLF-PACK pushes into the branches.

           Screaming with effort, Shadow Nineteen rolls onto his back.

           An ALIEN WOLF sniffs at his helmet, drooling onto the glass.

           Shadow Nineteen’s right arm fights the weight of his armor. 
           Pushes the power cell toward the slot in his chestplate.

           The wolf gnaws at Shadow Nineteen’s armored throat.

           Involuntarily, Shadow Nineteen turns his face away from the 
           horrible jaws. A stunning sight greets him:

                                             ...the APPARITION has returned.

           The CLOAKED FIGURE stands outside the tree, watching him. And 
           this time Shadow Nineteen sees it. 

           For a split second he stares in astonishment. Then he closes 
           his eyes. Clenches his teeth in concentration:

           The power cell skids toward the slot...misses...hangs...and 
           SLIDES HOME.

           His armor HUMS BACK TO LIFE. He reaches up. Takes the wolf’s 
           head in his hands and twists. There’s a horrible CRACK, and 
           it falls limp.

           Shadow Nineteen seizes Shadow Fourteen’s rifle and rakes the 
           wolf-pack with energy bolts. They scatter into the jungle.

           He looks around. No sign of the cloaked figure he glimpsed 
           during his struggle.

           Quickly he scavenges Shadow Fourteen’s jump-jet fuel... 
           ammunition...food pellets...water and oxygen tanks.

           EXT. LUMINOUS GROVE - NIGHT

           Shadow Nineteen enters an orchard of GLOWING TREES. Insects 
           flutter around them, feeding and hunting one another.

           The scene is beautiful and calm. Shadow Nineteen looks around 
           cautiously, his rifle sweeping with his eyes.

           Nothing dangerous appears.

           He sits against a rock in the middle of the clearing, 
           watching the dancing lights.
           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - ARCHIVE - NIGHT (EARTH)

           Ada leads Vance through a dimly lit storage facility. They 
           pass a tall rack of massive glassy discs.

           They speak in undertones.

                                 VANCE
                        What are these?

                                 ADA
                        Prometheus uses the Transporter to 
                        send copies of its memory home. 
                        That's how we get data from Erix. 
                        We're looking for smaller ones... 
                        here.

           A second rack of glassy discs seems to extend for miles.

                                 ADA
                        Backups of the core computer.

           She drifts down the rack, scanning serial numbers. Stops.

                                 ADA
                        This is the one. I thought it might 
                        not be here.

           FOOTSTEPS down the aisle.

           Vance pulls Ada around the corner, behind a rack of shelves. 
           They hold their breaths. An ARCHIVIST passes, yawning.

           When he's gone they emerge again. Ada takes the data disc off 
           the shelf. 

                                 ADA
                        The files Martin worked on in his

                        But the files should still be here 
                        on the backups. It's holographic 
                        storage - impossible to edit.

                                 VANCE
                        So how do we read it without 
                        setting off any alarms?

                                 ADA
                        We need a mainframe that's not 
                        connected to the network. And I 
                        know where to find one.
           EXT. LUMINOUS GROVE - MORNING (ERIX)

           Leaning against the rock, Shadow Nineteen wakes. The insects 
           are gone. The trees have withdrawn their luminous fronds.

           He rises and stretches, showing some of his former vigor. 
           Burns a message on the rock he slept against: SAFE.

           CLIFFS

           Shadow Nineteen reaches the clifftop: a sweeping vista of the 
           jungle below. For the first time he sees CRAWLER THREE.

           His visor magnifies the image: a metal monstrosity squatting 
           in the jungle. Winged creatures circle it like crows. His 
           visor gives the distance: 18.1 KILOMETERS.

           CLIFF FACE

           Shadow Nineteen climbs down. Losing his grip, he slides down 
           a sheer face. Fires his jets. Lands safely on a lower ledge.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Jump jet fuel low.

           LOWLAND JUNGLE

           Shadow Nineteen runs through the wilderness, rifle raised. A 
           TENTACLE reaches down from the jungle canopy. He SEVERS it 
           with a blast of gunfire and runs on.

           A massive ANIMAL rears up in his path. He guns it down 
           without waiting to see its intentions. Runs on.

           THE GREEN ROAD

           Lungs heaving, Shadow Nineteen stumbles out of the jungle 
           into the wide track left by Crawler Three.

           In the beaten track, GREEN EARTH-LIFE GROWS, a mossy highway 
           through the alien forest. Nothing moves on the green road. He 
           follows the trail toward the Crawler in peace.

           He passes alien creatures dead at the green road’s edge, 
           their skins overgrown with green patches like a plague.
           THE GREEN ROAD - HILLTOP

           Cresting a rise, Shadow Nineteen sees CRAWLER THREE, two 
           kilometers away. The giant machine is frozen in its tracks, 
           halfway up a hill.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Athena. Display last locations of 
                        Shadows Seventeen and Eighteen.

           His visor displays two MARKERS on the road in front of him.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                             (musing)
                        Something between here and there.

           GREEN ROAD - SITE OF SHADOW SEVENTEEN’S DEATH

           Shadow Nineteen, at high alert, approaches the spot where 
           Shadow Seventeen’s death marker hovers in his visor display. 
           There’s nothing to see on the ground.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Seventeen died here. Athena, scan 
                        for hardware.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        No hardware detected.

           Shadow Nineteen looks around, bewildered.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Where’d he go?

           GREEN ROAD - SITE OF SHADOW EIGHTEEN’S DEATH

           Following the green road, Shadow Nineteen makes an 
           astonishing discovery:

           A line of poles marches across the landscape. Mounted atop 
           the poles are the skulls of various bizarre creatures. The 
           skulls are inscribed with symbols and alien characters.

           Where the green road crosses this border, several poles lie 
           crushed and flattened in Crawler Three's tracks.

           Shadow Nineteen inspects one of the skulls, but can make no 
           sense of the writing there. His eyes are wide with 
           astonishment and confusion.

           Breathing hard, he walks across the border.
                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Marines down.

           A marker appears on his visor display. Shadow Nineteen 
           approaches a dark shape on the ground.

           Side by side, SHADOW SEVENTEEN and SHADOW EIGHTEEN lie dead 
           in the green muck. Arms and legs outstretched. Their weapons 
           lie beside them, broken to pieces.

           The dead men’s armor is riddled with neat TRIANGULAR 
           PUNCTURES. Bare skulls inside the helmets.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Target, twelve-o’clock.

           He looks up. A BLACK-CLOAKED FIGURE stands in the green road. 
           Barring his way. Shadow Nineteen freezes in terror. It’s an 
           impossible sight.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                             (with superstitious dread)
                        Who’s there?

           The Cloaked Figure cocks its head at him. With its foot - 
           hidden under its cloak - it draws a LINE across the ground.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        What are you?

           It SPEAKS. A guttural clatter of sound.

           Shadow Nineteen stares. At the line in the earth. At the 
           figure. He POINTS down the green road toward Crawler Three.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        I’m going to the Crawler. I'm going 
                        past you.

           The Cloaked Figure trembles. Speaks again: inhuman sounds. It 
           redraws its line in the earth, cutting a deeper furrow.

           Shadow Nineteen taps his own chest and points down the road.

           And the cloaked figure OPENS ITS WINGS: revealing a PREYING-
           MANTIS shape with sickled limbs. It's an alien being, not a 
           supernatural one.

           Its slim body is armored in metallic scales. Its claws are 
           adorned with ornaments of twisted wire, glinting with jewels.

           Its large eyes are strangely beautiful: iridescent like opal, 
           colors playing across them.
           The Mantis raises its arms and beats the air - as if to say, 
           stay back.

           With a gasp, Shadow Nineteen raises his gun, his hands 
           shaking.

           The Mantis takes flight, too fast to hit.

           It lands beside the road. Furls its wings. Once more takes on 
           the appearance of a cloaked figure: a cosmic coincidence.

           It CHITTERS. From its cowl a TRIANGULAR TUSK juts and 
           withdraws.

           Shadow Nineteen glances at the triangular punctures in the 
           armor of Shadow Seventeen and Shadow Eighteen.

           He RUNS toward Crawler Three. The Mantis pursues him.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Incoming, six-o’clock.

           Shadow Nineteen spins and fires. The Mantis veers away.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Incoming.

           Shadow Nineteen bounds off the ground on his jump jets. The 
           Mantis barely misses him. He fires mid-air. It spirals around 
           him, impossible to hit.

           He lands and runs on.

           He reaches Crawler Three. ROCKETS up the side of the Crawler.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Incoming, five-o’clock.

           He twists in the air, firing.

           And his jets SPUTTER OUT.

           Straining for the top of the Crawler, Shadow Nineteen falls 
           short. Clings with one hand to the Crawler’s side.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Jet fuel depleted.

           He slaps his rifle into its clamps. With both hands, he 
           climbs desperately.

           The Mantis is shouting at him - strange syllables carried on 
           the wind.
           ATOP THE CRAWLER

           Shadow Nineteen reaches the top. Scrambles onto the deck.

           The top of the Crawler is covered with alien writing: 
           unreadable pictograms scratched into the armor plate.

           Shadow Nineteen has no time to take this 

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Incoming.

           Shadow Nineteen spins to face the Mantis. Too late. He draws 
           his machete -

           - but the Mantis SLAMS INTO HIM like a living missile, and 
           the machete clatters away.

           They struggle.

           The Mantis locks its barbed legs around him. THRUSTS its tusk 
           through his helmet into his neck.

           Shadow Nineteen SCREAMS. Pushes at the thin powerful body.

           Slowly he forces the tusk out of his neck. Blood spatters his 
           visor from the inside. 

           Unable to free himself from the Mantis's serrated arms, 
           Shadow Nineteen locks his arms around the creature's thin 
           powerful body - and SQUEEZES with all his might.

           His armor's motor's WHINE. There is a ghastly CRACK, and the 
           Mantis falls dead.

           Shadow Nineteen struggles to his knees, choking on blood.

           He swings his helmet back in the toxic atmosphere. Slaps a 
           field bandage on his neck. Applies an emergency patch to his 
           helmet. He puts his helmet back on.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Purge.

           Jets of white gas HISS from the suit. Wind whips his hair 
           inside the helmet. Shadow Nineteen inhales greedily.

           For the first time he sees the writing on the Crawler. He 
           stares with bloodshot eyes and can't make sense of it.

           The beetle-like communications module looms above him.
           Instead of the ragged tear from the mock-up on Earth, the 
           armored dome carries a row of triangular punctures, 
           surrounded by hex signs and inscriptions. The Mantis's work.

           He pulls back the punctured dome to reveal the familiar 
           repair job.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Multiple targets incoming.

           He turns.

           Winged MANTISES are circling: ragged black phantoms against 
           the fiery sky.

           Three of them land atop the Crawler. They shout at him in 
           their strange tongue: jarring sounds.

           Shadow Nineteen snatches up his fallen machete. Brandishes 
           the blade.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                             (hoarsely)
                        Get away from me!

           His amplified voice thunders. The aliens stand their ground. 
           They flicker closer.

           Shadow Nineteen sees the Mantises are standing atop the hatch-
           covers of the Crawler’s MISSILE WELLS.

           He gestures: his toolkit extends from his armor. Turning his 
           back on the Angels, he begins the repair.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Athena. Running range to nearest 
                        target.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Four meters.

           Shadow Nineteen works feverishly. Panting. His hands shake.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Three meters.

           He clenches his hands, shakes them loose. Keeps working.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Two meters. One meter. Contact.

           He pulls his machete and slashes behind him. Mantises burst 
           away from him like a flock of crows - and dive back, claws 
           raking at him.
           With one hand he hacks and slashes at the aliens, keeping 
           them at bay. With the other he works at the repair.

           Sparks fly from his battered armor. His blade, streaked with 
           black blood, never stops slashing.

           He COMPLETES THE REPAIR.

           Crawler Three RUMBLES INTO MOTION, resuming its slow crawl up 
           the hill. Trees sway and topple under its treads.

           The Mantises SCREAM in protest.

           The hatch-covers of the missile wells SLAM open. FOUR GIANT 
           ROCKETS LAUNCH, immersing the Crawler in fire.

           The Mantises shrivel and burn. Shadow Nineteen curls into a 
           ball, his armor bathed in flame. When the fire passes, Shadow 
           Nineteen remains, smoking but safe in his blackened armor.

           He rises shakily. Watches the rockets arc away across the sky 
           in four different directions.

           A pall of smoke hangs over the hill.

           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - STORAGE FACILITY - DAY (EARTH)

           A dark cavernous space filled with mothballed equipment.

           Ada pulls a dust-cover off a massive computer. Vance stands 
           beside her, a coiled power cord slung over his shoulder.

                                 ADA
                        This is the old bio-simulator. Too 
                        valuable to throw away, too 
                        classified to let anyone use it. 
                        There's power over there.

           Vance plugs the machine in. Ada inserts the disc, taps at the 
           terminal. In a moment the display fills with light.

           Ada navigates a dense directory: thousands of files.

                                 ADA
                        In his last days here, Martin did 
                        almost all of his work in this 
                        program. "Semantic Survey 3.1".

           She touches controls.

           IN HOLOGRAM: The globe of Erix appears. The view shifts from 
           one spot on the planet to another. Sparks of light swarm over 
           the surface in rapidly changing patterns.
           Graphs and data readouts surround the planet.

                        What is it?

                             (fascinated)
                        It's a program based on the work I 
                        did for you. But much more 
                        sophisticated. See, if you watch 
                        animals move around long enough, 
                        you can figure out how much 
                        information they’re exchanging. You 
                        watch fish swim in a school, they 
                        do a small amount of coordination. 
                        You watch a beehive, and you can 
                        tell the bees have a crude 
                        language. Then you watch people 
                        move around a city, and over time 
                        their movement implies complex 
                        language. Higher intelligence.

           Ada sorts through species rapidly. Each one has a different 
           fingerprint on the planet’s surface - different readings on 
           the semantic indexes: all low numbers.

           Suddenly the numbers jump, high up the scale. The new 
           movement pattern on Erix is stunning: a complex web of light 
           embracing the whole planet. Ada gasps in amazement.

                                 ADA

           EXT. JUNGLE - ATOP CRAWLER THREE - DAY (ERIX)

           Crests the hilltop, tree-trunks snapping like cannon shots. 
           The smoke clears. Trees fall away.

           Atop the Crawler, Shadow Nineteen looks down in shock at...

           A MANTIS CITY

           Under the jungle canopy, twisted TOWERS of dark plaster rise 
           out of the ground like smokestacks. Irregular windows glow 
           with a pale red light.
           TUNNELS snake between the towers: a maze on the forest floor. 
           An organic city. A hive.

           Mantises look out from the towers. Hooded figures row on row. 

           They wheel and soar over the city: darting into tunnels, 
           erupting from the towers' mouths.

           The Crawler churns down the hill toward the city. Huge trees 
           topple under its treads.

           Branches scrape at Shadow Nineteen as the Crawler descends 
           among the towering trees. Alien inscriptions cover the 
           mammoth trunks.

           A BARRICADE surrounds the Mantis city - a spiky thicket of 
           alien teeth and bones.

           The Crawler GRINDS OVER THE BARRICADE.

           A great lamentation rises from the city: A cacophony of 
           shrieks and beating wings.

           Mantises swarm from the city and fling themselves at Crawler 
           Three.

           By the hundreds they STRAIN to hold the Crawler back with the 
           strength of their bodies - and the Crawler drives them back 
           and crushes them under its treads.

           Shadow Nineteen looks down in horror.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        What am I doing?
                             (shouting)
                        Athena! Guidance control. Stop the 
                        Crawler! Stop it now!

           He looks up. The rockets’ contrails arch away across the sky: 
           the rockets hurtling toward the horizon.

           Shadow Nineteen scrambles to the top of the comm module. He 
           lifts his rifle and sights on a rocket.

           SHADOW NINETEEN’S POV: A targeting reticle appears over the 
           rocket in his visor display. Range, velocity, windage.

           He FIRES. And AGAIN. And AGAIN.

           A moment passes. The rocket EXPLODES in a distant fireball.

           He sights on another rocket and fires three rounds. It 
           DETONATES: the fireball hangs in the sky.
           He aims at a third rocket...too late. The remaining two 
           rockets have vanished over the horizon.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Damn it!

           With a vast SIGH of machinery, the Crawler stops. Silence 
           falls on the forest.

           A ROAR OF WINGS. Mantises rise from the city like a cyclone. 
           They fill the branches - thousands of watching figures.

           A Mantis shouts from within the city. The haunting cry echoes 
           eerily among the silent towers. Another voice joins the 
           outcry, and another.

           Soon a thousand voices are raised in tumult. A riot of sound.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                             (shaken)
                        Athena. Show me navigation. We're 
                        turning this thing around.

           Prometheus’s antennas pivot to receive a message.

           A BOOM like a thunderclap inside the giant ship. Lightning 
           stabs upward into the turbulent clouds.

           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - CONTROL ROOM - DAY (EARTH)

           As they approach the Staging Room, Vance quickens his steps.

           The guards' pistols come up. Vance and Ada freeze.

           Across the Staging Room, Vance's armor locker sinks out of 
           sight on an elevator. He watches it go in dismay.

           The guards part to let Director Marbeck and Banneker through.

           The guards seize Vance and drag him out under Banneker's

           INT. STORAGE CELL

           Guards shove Vance into an empty steel-walled room. Turning 
           back, Vance confronts Banneker in the doorway.

           Banneker smiles. The door begins to close.

           Like lightning, Vance reaches out, grabs Banneker’s coat. 
           Yanks the Scientist into the sliding door’s path. The door 
           bounces open again.

           Vance charges out. Hammers Banneker into the wall. Banneker 
           drops, limp.

           Three guards in the hallway draw their pistols hastily.

           Vance is a demon among them. A quick flurry of blows and 
           close-quarters gunfire.

           INT. MEDICAL COMPLEX

           A sterile facility: white enamel and cold steel.

           Ada lies strapped into a terrifying apparatus: a CORONATION 
           MACHINE. She wears a flimsy hospital gown. Her head is 
           secured in a metal clamp. Above her hangs the cybernetic 
           crown she will soon wear forever.

           She twists at her restraints in vain. An old PHYSICIAN in a 
           scarlet coat begins to shave her head.

           The Physician winces but stays the course. Ada’s beautiful 
           locks drop to the floor.

                                 PHYSICIAN
                        Shhh.

           A sudden COMMOTION.

           An Agency Guard staggers into the room, slams into the wall 
           and collapses. Vance charges in.

           He rushes to Ada. Shoving the Physician aside, he works at 
           the straps that hold her down.

                                 VANCE

                        Conrad! Oh, hurry. Look out!

           The old Physician presses an instrument to Vance’s neck. It 
           HISSES. Vance jumps as if bitten.

                                 PHYSICIAN
                        You’ll be no more trouble.

           Vance knocks the Physician out with one punch. But already he 
           looks woozy.

           Vance’s legs buckle. He drops to his knees, fumbling at Ada’s 
           restraints. His face is inches from hers.

                                 ADA
                        Stay awake. Conrad. Please...

                                 VANCE
                        Ada...

           He collapses.

           EXT. PROMETHEUS GROUND STATION - DAWN (ERIX)

           Prometheus towers over the jungle. A deep rumble. Foliage 
           crashes down. Crawler Three rolls into the clearing.

           It churns to a stop beside its mother ship.

           ATOP THE CRAWLER

           Armor plates have been warped into a crude bunker. The welded 
           metal tears open. Shadow Nineteen climbs out.

           EXT. PROMETHEUS GROUND STATION - TRANSPORTER

           The transporter’s massive door rumbles open to reveal the 
           small bright chamber. Shadow Nineteen steps in.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Athena. Overlay tech specs.

           In his visor’s heads-up display, a wireframe circuit diagram 
           is superimposed on the chamber walls.

           He opens a panel, revealing complex controls.
           INT. PROMETHEUS PROJECT - TRANSPORT FACILITY - DAY (EARTH)

           Scientist Banneker talks to grey-coated technicians in the 
           vast transporter cavern.

           Suddenly, electricity CRACKLES over the transporter. Klaxons 
           howl. The technicians flee. Banneker stands his ground.

           A resounding BOOM.

           The transport chamber opens. Shadow Nineteen steps out. His 
           rifle rests in its clamps on his thigh.

                                 BANNEKER
                        Vance!

           Shadow Nineteen opens his visor, breathes clean air. He 
           approaches Banneker across the catwalk.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        I had to come back.

           Banneker concentrates. The catwalk withdraws, separating 
           Shadow Nineteen and Banneker from the Transporter. The heavy 
           steel doors of the Transport Facility slam shut.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Listen to me.

           Banneker sweeps the room with furious eyes. In unison, four 
           security cannons aim at Shadow Nineteen.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                             (shouting)
                        Wait!

           The cannons FIRE.

           Bullets tear at him, throwing showers of sparks from his 
           armor, leaving gouges in the metal. His visor slams shut.

           Staggering under the onslaught, he pulls his rifle and fires, 
           destroying one cannon. Another.

           Banneker flees. The Staging Room door opens for him.

           Shadow Nineteen pounds after him.

           STAGING ROOM

           Banneker glances at the Staging Room door. It slams shut.
           Shadow Nineteen slides into the closing door. The steel slab 
           pins him against the frame. On the far side, the security 
           cannons rake at his armor, throwing sparks.

           He strains. The door grinds back. He slides through.

           Banneker gestures. Two security cannons drop from the Staging 
           Room ceiling. Shadow Nineteen blasts them into shrapnel. 

           Banneker is caught in the open, at gunpoint. He freezes.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        There are cities on Erix. It's 
                        inhabited.

           Banneker rolls his eyes in contempt.

                                 BANNEKER
                        Not for long.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN 
                             (astounded)
                        You knew!

                                 BANNEKER
                        You idiot. 

           A FLOOR HATCH opens beside Shadow Nineteen. The floor beneath 
           him slam into motion - it's a conveyor belt - and flings him 
           into the pit.

           As Shadow Nineteen climbs out, the hatch cover closes on him, 
           clamping him in place.

           Banneker gloats nearby - until Shadow Nineteen's rifle swings 
           that way.

           A PLATFORM rises between them: Shadow Nineteen's rifle fire 
           tears into the platform as Banneker ducks for cover.

           Shadow Nineteen wrenches himself free of the floor hatch. 
           Racing around the platform, he draws a bead on Banneker...

           But the Staging Room CRANE swoops out of the shadows. Seizes 
           him in its claw, pinning his gun arm to his side.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Critical strains on suit.

           Unable to break free, Shadow Nineteen sees heavy bolts on the 
           hinge of the claw. With his free arm he extrudes his toolkit.

           Banneker grins wickedly. The heavy crane smashes Shadow 
           Nineteen against the wall. Shadow Nineteen works desperately.
           A bolt spins out of the crane’s hinge. One finger of the claw 
           falls off, freeing Shadow Nineteen’s gun hand. He shoots into 
           the crane’s hydraulics, and the metal arm goes limp.

           Freed, Shadow Nineteen lands on his feet.

           A FREIGHT PLATFORM tips, burying him in massive metal crates.

           Banneker smiles in triumph...but Shadow Nineteen rises from 
           the wreckage, a crate held overhead. He HURLS the crate at 
           Banneker with a roar of animal rage.

           The crate crushes Banneker against the wall.

           The room falls silent. 

           Shadow Nineteen rolls the heavy crate away from Banneker’s 
           body. Banneker, broken and dying, gasps for air.

                                 BANNEKER
                             (a whisper)
                        You’re not even supposed to exist.

           Banneker’s breath stops. His eyes stare at nothing.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        But I do.

           He turns, makes his way painfully across the room. His 
           armor's motors whine as he moves.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Athena. Mayday beacon.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Mayday beacon on.

           A red light begins to flash on his armor's chestplate.

           CORRIDOR

           Scientist Larson looks up in alarm as red emergency lights 
           begin to flash all along the hallway.

           The security cannon at the corner EXPLODES. Larson cringes.

           Shadow Nineteen steps out of the smoke in his battered armor. 
           He recognizes Larson and his rage subsides.

                                 LARSON
                        Conrad! How did you...

           He sees the haggard face behind the visor. Whiskered, 
           spattered with dried blood. He understands.
                                 LARSON
                             (in wonder)
                        You were on Erix. What did you see? 
                        No, there’s no time. You have to 
                        run. They’ll kill you.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        They’re trying.

                                 LARSON
                        They’ve locked you up, here. They 
                        mean to make you disappear. And 
                        there’s something else.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        What else?

                                 LARSON
                        Ada.

           MEDICAL COMPLEX - HOSPITAL ROOM

           Ada lies in bed, in a hospital gown. Her head is shaven. A 
           cybernetic crown gleams against her scalp. Beside the bed 
           hang a Master’s black coat and cap. She stares at the coat.

           SCREAMS outside the door. Running feet.

           The door jumps in its frame. Ada shrinks back in her bed. A 
           powerful force tears the door open.

           Shadow Nineteen enters, a metal giant. She rushes to him.

                                 ADA
                        Conrad!

           She sees the dried blood on his face, the beard. Stops short.

                                 ADA
                        You’re the Shadow. You’re Nineteen.

           He stares at her bald head: the crown embedded in the flesh.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        What have they done to you?

           She makes a futile attempt to cover her head with her hands.

                                 ADA
                        Why did you come back?

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        To set things right. Ada.
                             (he steps closer)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHADOW NINETEEN (cont'd)
                        I never dreamed they’d do this. Are 
                        you all right?

           Tears shine in her eyes.

                                 ADA
                        It doesn’t matter, does it? What’s 
                        done is done.

           Shadow Nineteen’s face is wracked with guilt. He looks 
           anxiously out into the deserted medical facility.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        We can’t stay here. I’ve been 
                        welding doors shut, but the guards 
                        will come soon. I’m going to break 
                        myself out. The real me. Can you 
                        hide until I...

           Ada sheds her hospital gown. Puts on the black coat.

                                 ADA
                        I’m going with you.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        It won’t be safe.

                                 ADA
                        I know where he is. And I can help 
                        you now.

           She places the black skullcap over her crown.

           CORRIDOR

           Shadow Nineteen advances down a corridor, rifle raised.

           One by one, security cannons take aim at them - and one by 
           one, Shadow Nineteen blows them to shrapnel.

           They reach an intersection. BULLETS whine off of Shadow 
           Nineteen’s armor: Guards approach down the crossing corridor. 
           Shadow Nineteen fires back, his rifle barking.

           Ada GESTURES: Doors SLAM SHUT between them and the guards.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        How long can you keep that up 
                        before they revoke your privileges?

                                 ADA
                        They already have. I’m using 
                        Director Marbeck’s ID.
                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                             (grinning)
                        Nice.

           STORAGE ROOM

           Red alarm lights throb. Vance paces in his bare metal cell. 

           O.S. GUNFIRE outside the door. Heavy footfalls approach.

           The door slides open. Ada enters.

                                 VANCE
                        Ada!

           They embrace fiercely. Troubled, Vance reaches for her black 
           skullcap. She shrinks away.

                                 ADA
                        Don’t. Please. Listen. There’s 
                        someone outside the door. He’s 
                        going to help us.

           CORRIDOR

           Shadow Nineteen stands watch in the corridor. A guard lies 
           unconscious at his feet.

           Ada emerges from the cell. Vance follows warily.

           Vance and Shadow Nineteen stand face to face, staring at each 
           other: Vance in perfect health, lightly dressed - Shadow 
           Nineteen haggard and wounded, in armor. Vance is speechless.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Hello, Vance.

                                 VANCE
                             (cautiously)
                        Hello, Vance. What’s happening?

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        I’m getting the two of you out.

                                 VANCE
                        And you?

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Don’t worry about me. I’m not even 
                        supposed to exist.

           Ada looks sharply away down the hallway.
                                 ADA
                        Someone's opening the doors I 
                        locked. I'm sorry. I'm new at this.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Let’s head for the roof. Can you 
                        get us to your freight elevator?

                                 ADA
                        I think so.

           Vance crouches and takes fallen guard’s pistol.

                                 VANCE
                        Let’s go.

           SERVICE CORRIDOR

           A deserted hallway. The freight elevator door is closed.

           Shadow Nineteen, Ada, and Vance arrive at the elevator door. 
           Turning, Ada concentrates and closes a corridor door behind 
           them.

           Ada palms the elevator switch. The floor indicator shows the 
           elevator descending from the roof. They wait.

                                 VANCE
                        What happened on Erix?

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        I saw the Angel of Death.

           Vance and Ada stare at Shadow Nineteen, mystified.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        We fought. And I killed it. But it 
                        was just...a creature. A living 
                        thing. And then I found a city. A 
                        city of these things.

                                 ADA
                        You saw them!

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        They're terrifying. But they're 
                        ...people. I thought Erix was Hell. 
                        But it's just somebody else's 
                        world.

           Ada looks at corridor door in fright.
                                 ADA
                        Someone’s opening the door. I can't 
                        hold it.

           Shadow Nineteen takes aim at the door. They watch the 
           elevator's floor indicator nervously.

           Suddenly a SIREN sounds. A heavy steel SECURITY GATE begins 
           to close in front of the elevator, sealing it off.

           Shadow Nineteen throws himself at the descending gate and 
           heaves. The gate stops in his tracks, its motors whining.

           Very rapidly: the corridor door slides open. SSA GUARDS wait 
           on the other side.

           Vance pulls Ada behind him. His pistol snaps up: he fires 
           several rounds. Two guards fall. Others return fire.

           A BULLET slams into Vance's ribs. He SCREAMS.

           Shadow Nineteen, still holding off the security gate, twists 
           in place and FIRES his laser rifle. It tears a glowing furrow 
           in the wall. The guards fall back, shouting.

           The elevator opens. Vance struggles in, leaning on Ada. 

           Shadow Nineteen dives into the elevator. The security gate 
           SLAMS down. The elevator doors close.

           ELEVATOR SHAFT

           Concrete walls rush past as the freight elevator rises. Sound 
           echoes in the confined space. Vance sinks to the deck.

                                 VANCE
                        I’m hit.

           Shadow Nineteen rolls Vance over. The wound is severe, a 
           bloody puncture between the left ribs. Shadow Nineteen 
           presses a battlefield dressing over the injury.

                                 VANCE
                        It’s bad.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Yeah.

           Vance fumbles blindly for Ada. She takes his hand.

                                 ADA
                        Hang on, Conrad. We’ll get help.
           She weeps. Vance is fading fast. A shudder racks his body, 
           and a look of amazement crosses his face.

                                 VANCE
                        I’m not going to make it.

           Shadow Nineteen leans close.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        You keep breathing. I’ve seen you 
                        dead too many times.

           Vance looks at Shadow Nineteen. His lips barely move.

                                 VANCE
                        It’s only fair. I’m the only one 
                        who never paid a price.
                             (weaker still)
                        It’s all yours now.

           The life drains out of him.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                             (urgently)
                        Athena. Medical.

                                 ATHENA’S VOICE
                        Medical.

           He places two fingertips on Vance’s chest. A muddy MURMUR.

           He tears open the shirt. Lays his gloves on Vance’s ribs.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Clear!

           Ada jerks her hands back. A THUMP as voltage pours through 
           Vance’s body. He arches and lies still.

           EXT. SSA HEADQUARTERS - ROOF - DAY

           A glorious SUNSET drenches the city in light.

           The freight elevator rises into view and locks into place. 
           Shadow Nineteen kneels over Vance. Ada beside him.

           Vance isn’t breathing. Shadow Nineteen stands. He seems 
           stunned - he can't take his eyes off his own dead body.

                                 ADA
                        What are you doing?
                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                             (hollowly)
                        He’s gone.

           Ada cries, clutches at Vance. Shadow Nineteen stirs. Gently 
           pulls her away.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Ada. He’s gone. We have to move.

           She looks at him, paralyzed. She’s just watched her lover 
           die, but here he stands in front of her.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK (O.S.)
                        Captain Vance.

           They turn. Director Marbeck stares down at Vance’s body.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        You make this difficult. You dirty 
                        my hands.

           Shadow Nineteen aims his rifle at Marbeck.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        You shouldn't have come alone.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        I don't need help to deal with you.

           He waves contemptuously at Shadow Nineteen. Shadow Nineteen’s 
           armor POWERS DOWN. He collapses like a marionette with cut 
           strings. He sprawls on his back, unable to move.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Athena. Athena!

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        I had your armor modified, Captain. 
                        A precaution. I reserve myself 
                        certain privileges. I’ll tolerate 
                        no more...

                                 ADA
                        Damn you!

           She launches herself at Marbeck in a two-handed shove that 
           sends him staggering. She follows, poised to shove him again.

           Enraged, he grapples with her . Flings her to the pavement. 
           She strikes her head cries out.

           Marbeck turns back to Shadow Nineteen - but his armor lies 
           open and empty. Shadow Nineteen steps free in his skinsuit.
                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Enough.

           He HAMMERS Marbeck across the face with his massive rifle. 
           Marbeck staggers and cries out.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        Guards! Guards!

           Shadow Nineteen backs Marbeck up against a pillar. His arms 
           tremble under the weight of a rifle meant for powered armor.

           GUARDS swarm onto the rooftop.

           Ada darts to Shadow Nineteen’s side. Marbeck glares at 
           gunpoint, his mouth bleeding freely.

           The guards surround them in a thicket of pistols.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        If you shoot me, they’ll kill you. 
                        Lay down the gun and live.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        You won’t let us live. We know what 
                        you've done.

           Marbeck glances at Shadow Nineteen’s trembling arms.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        How long can you bear that weight?

           O.S. A RUMBLE.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                             (grinning in triumph)
                        Long enough.

           A shadow falls over them all.

                                 MARINE (O.S.)
                        Stand down!

           A MARINE AIRSHIP hovers over the rooftop.

           Six ARMORED MARINES leap from the airship on jump-jets. They 
           encircle Marbeck and his guards, rifles raised.

           The SSA Guards, so menacing a moment ago, suddenly look like 
           children. They drop their weapons.

           Exhausted, Shadow Nineteen lays his massive rifle down.
                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        You're trespassing! This is a 
                        secure facility! You have no right!

           The Marines' PLATOON LEADER steps forward. He scans the 
           rooftop: takes in Vance's body; the battered armor lying 
           open; Shadow Nineteen in his military skinsuit.

                                 PLATOON LEADER
                        There's a Marine distress beacon 
                        coming from this rooftop, sir. I'm 
                        required to respond.
                             (to Shadow Nineteen)
                        Do you need assistance, sir?

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Yes. Captain Conrad Vance, Third 
                        Offworld Division. I need evac 
                        right now. Me, this woman, and...
                             (he hesitates, looking at 
                              Vance lying dead)
                        ...that Marine.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        These people are in my custody!

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                             (to Marbeck)
                        Not any more.
                             (to the Platoon Leader)
                        Call the police. Get them here. And 
                        call the office of the Secretary of 
                        Defense. Tell them Conrad Vance has 
                        a story to tell.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        No!

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Let's get airborne. Too many 
                        surprises here.

           The Marines collect Vance’s body, the crippled armor. Shadow 
           Nineteen pulls Ada toward the airship.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                             (to Ada, desperately)
                        Scientist. You are not released!

           Ada shoots him a cold look. Moves closer to Shadow Nineteen. 
           Marbeck is unravelling, almost snarling.

                                 DIRECTOR MARBECK
                        Captain! Remember your writ of 
                        secrecy!
                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        You killed the man who signed it.

           INT. MARINE AIRSHIP (IN FLIGHT) - DUSK

           Shadow Nineteen and Ada sit huddled against a bulkhead. 
           Armored Marines sit around them.

           Outside, the skyscrapers of New Washington slide by.

           Shadow Nineteen and Ada cling to each other, their eyes 
           haunted.

           He lifts a finger. Traces the line of her crown.

                                 ADA
                        I know I’m not what I used to be.

           He pulls her closer.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        Neither am I.

                                 ADA
                        Don’t think about it now. For now 
                        let’s just be. You’re Conrad Vance. 
                        You came home.

           He stares across a vast distance. Shakes his head.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        I’m still there.

           Ada looks at him, questioning.

                                 SHADOW NINETEEN
                        You can’t come home. You can only 
                        send your shadow home.

           EXT. PROMETHEUS GROUND STATION (ERIX) - SUNSET

           The lurid sky bathes Prometheus in red light.

           The door opens. An armored Marine, his armor blackened by 
           fire, looks out in despair at the jungles of Erix.

           The ID plate on his armor reads VANCE 19.

           Predators slink from the undergrowth at the sound of the 
           door, watching him, circling.

                                                              FADE OUT.
