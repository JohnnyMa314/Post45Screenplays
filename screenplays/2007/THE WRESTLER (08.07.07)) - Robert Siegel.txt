                                                               FADE IN:

           Over OPENING CREDITS, a montage of WRESTLING-MAGAZINE PHOTOS. 
           Action shots of RANDY “THE RAM” ROBINSON from his ‘80s WWF 
           heyday. Bodyslamming opponents. Taking a boot to the face. 
           Headbutting a folding chair held by a front-row fan. Raising 
           his arms in glorious, exhausted triumph.

           The sounds of a SCREAMING, CHEERING CROWD overwhelm us. Over 
           the images, RINGSIDE ANNOUNCERS boom commentary:

           ——”Oh, my! A devastating piledriver from the Ram!”

           ——”I’ve never seen a guy get fired into a buckle that hard!”

           ——”Ram taking it to Mr. Magnificent outside the ring!”

           ——”He’s getting up! I don’t know how he can keep going!”

           The last five or six photos in the montage are from a match 
           against a keffiyeh-wearing heel named THE AYATOLLAH before 
           70,000 screaming fans in the Hoosier Dome...

           ——”Ohh! Powerbomb!”

           ——”Ram absorbing tremendous punishment from The Ayatollah!”

           ——”Randy ‘The Ram’ Robinson giving absolutely everything he’s 
           got! This is the very definition of heart!”

           ——”Just listen to this crowd! The entire Hoosier Dome, 70,000 
           people, are on their feet!”

           ——”Ram climbing to the top rope... The crowd going absolutely 
           wild... They know what’s coming...”

           A PHOTO of Randy standing on the top rope, his bent arms 
           pressed against the sides of his head like RAM’S HORNS.

           ——”Uh-oh, the horns are out... Here it comes...”

           We FREEZE on a final image of Randy FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE 
           CANVAS, horns out, poised to crash down on The Ayatollah.

           ——”Ram Jam! Lights out!!”

           Over this, the sound of the crowd GOING CRAZY.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           INT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           Present day. Post-match. Randy, pushing 50, still with the 
           same long, dyed-blond mane, sits on a bench in the boys 
           locker room of a high school in Wilmington, Del.

           He pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights. Lime-green 
           ram’s horns run up the sides. They’re the same kind of tights 
           as in the ‘80s pics... and may well be the actual same pair.

           Naked except for a jockstrap, Randy takes a breath. Achy, 
           sweaty, saggy, exhausted. A battered warrior. Scars all over 
           his body. Despite the rough shape he’s in, it’s clear he’s 
           just given it his all in the ring. He swigs down a few 
           Vicodins with a beer.

           Show promoter SCOTT BRUMBERG, a heavyset man in a Mets jersey 
           with BRUMBERG - 44 on the back, approaches.

                                 BRUMBERG
                        Great show, Ram. Ya turned it out.
                             (a little sad)
                        As always.

           He hands Randy some cash. Randy counts it. It’s not much.

                                 BRUMBERG (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, man. I was sure the gate’d 
                        be bigger.

           Randy just shrugs resignedly.

           EXT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, changed into his street clothes, limps out of the 
           school, each step labored and painful. Waiting near the 
           entrance are TWO FANS, both men in their 30s.

                                 FAN #1
                        Yo, Ram. Think you could...?

           Fan #1 holds out a SHARPIE and an old WRESTLING PROGRAM from 
           the ‘80s. On the cover is a shot of Randy wrestling CORPORAL 
           PUNISHMENT, a heel in a drill instructor get-up.

           Randy takes the program, happy to oblige.

                                 FAN #1 (CONT’D)
                        I was there.

           Randy hands back the program. 
           FAN #2 hands him a MINI-POSTER. The faded, mid-’80s poster 
           features Randy, biceps bulging, crushing a head of broccoli 
           between his fists. Across the top, it says “EAT YOUR 
           VEGETABLES, PUNK!”

                                 FAN #2
                             (as Randy signs)
                        My first match ever was you versus 
                        Davey Diamond at the Spectrum. 
                             (nostalgic)

           Randy smiles to himself. He remembers, too. He hands back the 
           poster. Fan #2 looks fondly at Randy, a part of his boyhood.

                                 FAN #2 (CONT’D)
                             (vaguely sad)
                        You were awesome.

           Randy nods, a bit uncomfortably, embarrassed by how far he’s 
           fallen. The two fans, muttering thanks, drift off into the 
           Delaware night.

           Randy is left standing alone, still holding Fan #1’s pen.

           EXT. EAST WILMINGTON H.S. - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy limps through the parking lot. He comes to a beat-up 
           old CONVERSION VAN.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is driving. On the van’s dashboard is an old ACTION 
           FIGURE OF HIMSELF from his WWF days.

           Randy pulls into the PARKING LOT of a DAYS INN.

           EXT. DAYS INN - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy gets out of the van. He walks around to the BACK OF THE 
           VAN and climbs in, shutting the doors behind him.

           INT. BACK OF VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy painfully, laboriously eases himself down onto a 
           scrunched-up mattress on the floor. He lets out an exhausted 
           breath.
           The wall is decorated with a MINI-SHRINE Randy has built to 
           himself. Old magazine and newspaper clippings, mini-posters, 
           etc. A few changes of clothes lie in a heap in the corner.

           INT. BACK OF VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, lying on the mattress in his underwear, can’t fall 
           asleep. He grabs a bottle of Vicodin and pops a few, washing 
           them down with a beer. He closes his eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VAN - NEXT MORNING

           Randy peers out the window of the van. 

           RANDY’S POV: A Days Inn HOUSEKEEPER walks out of a room. She 
           leaves the door open.

           EXT/INT. DAY’S INN - ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy slips into the room. He heads for the BATHROOM, where 
           he turns on the shower.

           INT. DAY’S INN - BREAKFAST AREA - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, nice and clean, is helping himself to the motel’s 
           complimentary CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST. He loads up a plate with 
           mini-cereal boxes, stale danishes, coffee, etc.

           INT. VAN - LATER

           Randy is driving north on I-95. Out the left-side window, the 
           Philadelphia skyline is visible. GUNS ‘N’ ROSES’ “ROCKET 
           QUEEN” blasts on the van’s stereo. 

           The song fades out. He pops “Appetite For Destruction” out of 
           the tape deck and tosses it on the passenger seat. On it is a 
           messy pile of cassettes. Skid Row. Mötley Crüe. AC/DC, Ozzy. 
           He sifts through the selection, one eye on the road.

           INT. VAN - LATER

           Randy, driving along Route 21, passes Cheetah’s, a STRIP 
           CLUB. He keeps an eye on it as he drives by.

           He pulls into the parking lot of a VFW HALL.
           INT. PASSAIC VFW HALL - CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER

           A makeshift locker room/staging area. Randy and 20 or so 
           other WRESTLERS stand before a tracksuit-clad PROMOTER.

                                 PROMOTER
                        Listen up, only saying it once. Vic 
                        Storm, you’re up first against D-
                        Day. Second, Rick Legend and 
                        Funkmaster Garry B. Slick. Third, 
                        Frankie Cirillo and Rob Dynamo 
                        versus J.T. Hammer and The Ultimate 
                        Freak. Fourth, Teddy Brewski and 
                        Lex Lethal. Fifth, Greg Woodson and 
                        The Patriot. Intermission. Six, 
                        Samoan Savages versus the Disco 
                        Brothers. Seven, the Irish Warrior 
                        and Vyper. Eighth, “Sandman” Steve 
                        Sambuca versus Hollywood. Last but 
                        not least, for the strap, Kid Loco 
                        versus Randy The Ram. Got it? Good.

           INT. CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits alone a table toward the back. He takes a roll of 
           athletic tape out of his duffel bag and starts WRAPPING HIS 
           HANDS AND ANKLES. He does it in a slow, methodical manner. It 
           feels almost ritualistic.

           INT. CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is going over things with his opponent, a wiry Puerto 
           Rican kid (22) whose shiny vinyl pants identify him as KID 
           LOCO.

                                 RANDY
                        After you post, the whole shit 
                        turns. I’m fuckin’ undestructable.

           Kid Loco nods, deferential to the legend.

           INT. THE RING - SHORT TIME LATER

           An ANNOUNCER stands in the middle of a rickety ring. Behind 
           him, a banner hangs reading NEW JERSEY WRESTLING FEDERATION.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Aaand now, please welcome to the 
                        ring...
           A song rises from the room’s speakers.

           MUSIC: AC/DC - “IF YOU WANT BLOOD (YOU GOT IT)”

           The hard-charging rock-n-roll riff kicks in. The BLUE-COLLAR 
           CROWD of about 60 rises from their chairs and look toward a 
           CURTAIN in anticipation. They know whose song this is.

           A man kneeling in front of the curtain pulls the top off a 
           plastic cooler, releasing DRY ICE into the air.

           BEHIND THE CURTAIN:

           Randy stands silent and still, head lowered slightly.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        From Hackensack, New Jersey, 
                        weighing in at 232 pounds... The 
                        former WWF superstar and wrestling 
                        legend... The one, the only... 
                             (beat)
                        Randy “The Ram” Robinnnnsonnnnn!

           INT. MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Randy explodes into the hall, full of fire and showmanship.

           He does a lap around the outside of the ring. His hand is 
           raised high in the air, index finger and pinky curled into a 
           set of RAM’S HORNS. Fans do the same in tribute.

           Kids rush toward Randy, reaching out for HIGH FIVES. He 
           obliges each and every one.

           Various people hold out METAL FOLDING CHAIRS in front of him. 
           (Just like in the opening wrestling-magazine montage.) He 
           ”rams” each of the chairs with his forehead.

                                 AC/DC
                        If you want blood... You got it!

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. THE RING - SHORT TIME LATER

           Kid Loco lies on top of Randy. Sweat drips from Randy’s every 
           pore. Kid Loco clenches tight around Randy’s arms, holding 
           him to the canvas while they catch their breath.
           The REFEREE drops to the canvas and checks that Randy’s 
           shoulders aren’t to the mat.

           Kid Loco lifts Randy up. They’re both on their knees, chest-
           to-chest. Randy makes like he’s groggy and out of it. Kid 
           Loco steps to his feet, lifting Randy with him.

           Kid Loco tightens around Randy’s arms, arches his back, 
           presses out his chest and... WHAM!! He and Randy fly with a 
           LATERAL DROP. Randy’s head hits the canvas hard as he slams 
           down on his back. As Randy writhes on the mat, Kid Loco HEADS 
           FOR THE TURNBUCKLE.

           RANDY’S POV: Kid Loco is untying the turnbuckle’s padded 
           cover.

           Randy, clutching his back, discretely reaches into the 
           waistband of his tights and pulls out a RAZOR BLADE. Hiding 
           the blade between two fingers in his cupped palm, he clutches 
           his woozy head, running the blade along his hairline. No one 
           in the crowd sees it happen.

           Kid Loco heads back to Randy. He picks up him by the hair and 
           drags him to the turnbuckle, throwing him HEAD-FIRST into the 
           exposed metal post beneath. BLOOD STREAMS DOWN Randy’s 
           forehead. 

           The crowd is electrified.

           Kid Loco slams Randy’s head into the metal post again. Again. 
           Again. Randy slumps over the corner ropes. Kid Loco cockily 
           struts around the ring.

                                 KID LOCO
                             (pointing at Randy)
                        Look at this loser! How pathetic!

           ANGLE ON Randy. The taunting stirs something in him. A look 
           comes over him, like he’s Bruce Banner about to become the 
           Hulk.

           Kid Loco saunters back over to Randy. He grabs his head for 
           another post smash, but HE CAN’T. Randy’s neck and arm 
           muscles bulge. His neck veins pop like he’s suddenly super-
           charged. 

           A look of fear comes over Kid Loco. He knows the tide is 
           about to turn.

           Randy reaches over his shoulder and grabs Kid Loco by the 
           hair. He pulls him in close.
                                 RANDY
                             (under breath)
                        Let’s go home.

           Randy juts his hips back and bends over, gaining the leverage 
           he needs for a throw. Kid Loco shakes his head, begging “no”. 

           Randy straightens his legs, raises his lower back, and yanks 
           down on Kid Loco’s head. Kid Loco’s feet fly off the canvas 
           as his head gets BURIED INTO THE MAT. He gets stuck UPSIDE 
           DOWN with his feet over the ropes.

           Randy, holding onto the top rope with both hands, thrusts his 
           knee into Kid Loco’s stomach. Again. Again. 

           Kid Loco somehow manages to untangle himself from the ropes. 
           He scurries away. Randy relentlessly hunts him down.

           Randy hits Kid Loco with everything he’s got. Dropkicks. 
           Elbows. Bodyslams. He pours it on, unstoppable.

           Randy drags Kid Loco into the middle of the ring. He looks 
           out upon the crowd.

           RANDY’S POV: A trio of fans are chanting.

                                 TRIO
                        Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...

           Randy cups his hand to his ear. The chant spreads.

                                 WHOLE CROWD (O.S.)
                        RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...

           Randy “mulls” it over. He looks at his laid-out foe. He looks 
           at the corner. 

           He heads for the corner.

           Randy climbs to the top rope. He looks around at the crowd 
           like he’s still a little undecided.

           RANDY’S POV: The fans are wild with anticipation.

           Randy bends his arms, pressing them against the side of his 
           head like ram’s horns. Just like in the photo in the opening 
           montage.

           He LEAPS.

           The leap is not terribly high or graceful. He crashes down 
           onto Kid Loco horns-first. Kid Loco’s whole body convulses.
           The fans lose it. This is what they wanted. The Ram Jam. The 
           money shot.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

           Randy sits in a chair as a GUY seals up his forehead gash 
           with KRAZY GLUE. A FELLOW WRESTLER walks past.

                                 WRESTLER
                        Ram, man, you popped that crowd.

                                 RANDY
                        You weren’t so bad yourself, T. 

           The guy keeps on walking toward the door.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                             (shouting after him)
                        You doin’ Parsippany next weekend?

           Randy clearly is.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHEETAH’S - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy gets out of his van and heads toward Cheetah’s, the 
           strip club he eyed earlier. Standing outside is a BOUNCER.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Whassup, Ram? How you been?

                                 RANDY
                             (friendly shake, entering)
                        Yo, Big Chris.

           INT. CHEETAH’S - SHORT TIME LATER

           A crowded, not very glamorous strip club. Randy stands over 
           by the bar. The female BARTENDER slides him a beer.

                                 RANDY
                        Thanks, hon.

           Randy takes a swig of his beer, looking around the club.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Cassidy around?
                                 BARTENDER
                             (glances toward back)
                        I think VIP.

           Randy, nodding oh, takes his beer and settles in at a table 
           facing the STAGE.

           ON STAGE:

           A YOUNG STRIPPER (22) works the pole, grinding lewdly to a 
           Dirty South/crunk hip-hop song.

           RANDY:

           Randy watches her for a while, but he soon grows bored. He 
           finds the stripper, like the song, crude and soulless. 

           He gets up and heads off toward the BATHROOM. En route, he 
           passes the curtained-off VIP ROOM. From inside, he hears:

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Trust me, babe. You’re gonna be 
                        happy.

           Randy slows, listening in.

                                 DUDE #1 (O.S.)
                        We said the other one.

                                 DUDE #2 (O.S.)
                        The dark chick. With the belly 
                        chain.

           Randy peeks through the curtain into the VIP ROOM. He sees 
           CASSIDY (38), a sexy, tattooed, aging rocker chick in a white 
           spandex dress. Surrounding her are six hair-gelled, goombah-
           wannabe BACHELOR-PARTY DUDES (20s). The BACHELOR is sitting 
           in a chair in the middle.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Sorry, guys, she’s on break.

                                 DUDE #1
                        Well, I’m sorry, but we don’t want 
                        you.

                                 DUDE #3
                             (looks her up and down)
                        How old are you, anyway?
                                 BACHELOR
                             (snickers)
                        You’re, like, my mom’s age.

           Stifled laughter from his buddies.

           OTHER SIDE OF CURTAIN:

           Randy’s anger builds as he watches.

           VIP ROOM:

           Cassidy, trying to salvage the gig, seductively straddles the 
           bachelor.

                                 CASSIDY
                        There’s nothing like experience.
                             (leans into his ear)
                        I’ve done things your little 
                        fiancee’s never dreamed of...

                                 BACHELOR
                        Yeah, like graduate in 1982.

           This cracks his friends up. Randy BURSTS THROUGH THE CURTAIN.

                                 RANDY
                        Apologize to this lady.

           Everyone is taken aback——including Cassidy.

                                 BACHELOR
                        Who the hell are you?

           Randy steps menacingly toward the bachelor.

                                 RANDY
                        You speak to her with respect.

           The bachelor scuttles backwards in his chair, scared. Cassidy 
           wedges herself between Randy and the guy.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I got this. It’s okay.

                                 RANDY
                        No, it’s not okay. This is 
                        definitely not okay.
                             (turns to the bachelor)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                        I guarantee you this woman’s 50 
                        times hotter than whatever skank 
                        you’re about to marry.

                                 DUDE #4
                             (to Dude #2)
                        You hear what he just called Gina?!

                                 DUDE #2
                        That’s my fuckin’ sister!

           Dude #2 steps to Randy challengingly. Randy suddenly GRABS 
           THE BACHELOR’S CHAIR OUT FROM UNDER HIM. He wields it 
           menacingly at Dude #2, who backpedals.

           Randy makes like he’s going to hit the guy with the chair but 
           then FLINGS IT AT THE WALL instead.

                     DUDE #2 (CONT’D)
                                                         DUDE #1
           Jesus!
                                              What the fuck?

           The entire bachelor party heads for the curtain, freaked. 
           Just like that, they’re GONE.

           Randy looks at Cassidy, expecting a hearty thank you for his 
           heroism. He instead gets a PISSED-OFF SHOVE.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Thanks a lot. That was $170 just 
                        walked out.

                                 RANDY
                        I was just trying to help.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Did I ask for help?

                                 RANDY
                        No.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Then don’t fuckin’ help.

                                 RANDY
                        You’re right. 
                             (sheepish)
                        I’m sorry.

           Pause. Cassidy calms down a little.

                                 CASSIDY
                        How ya been?

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. T.J. POOLE’S - LATER

           A local watering hole. Randy and Cassidy sit at the bar 
           drinking beers.

                                 CASSIDY
                        So you been workin’ a lot?

                                 RANDY
                        Yeah. Lot of New England, Philly... 
                        Not too much local.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I was gettin’ a little worried. I 
                        thought maybe I lost a customer.

                                 RANDY
                        You kidding?

                                 CASSIDY
                        Maybe you started goin’ to 
                        Babydolls or something.

                                 RANDY
                        Naver. I can’t stand that fuckin’ 
                        Tatiana pit.
                             (Russian accent, derisive)
                        Hello, would you like a lap dance 
                        from me?

           Cassidy chuckles. A song comes on the jukebox: 

           BUSH - “GLYCERINE”

           Randy looks toward the JUKEBOX, where he sees an Abercrombie 
           & Fitch FRATBOY nodding soulfully to the grunge ballad.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Speakin’ of can’t stand...

           Cassidy groans in agreement with Randy. Randy stands up, 
           fishing a $5 bill out of his pocket.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me.

           He purposefully marches over to the jukebox, brushing the 
           fratboy aside. 

           Randy starts to flip through the selection of CDs. He slows 
           as something catches his eye. He smiles at the jukebox. 
           That’s more like it.
           RANDY’S POV: The album is POISON - “OPEN UP AND SAY... AHH!”

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. T.J. POOLE’S - SHORT TIME LATER

           MUSIC: POISON - “NOTHIN’ BUT A GOOD TIME”

           Randy and Cassidy are on the bar’s pseudo-dancefloor, 
           JOYOUSLY ROCKING OUT to the hair-metal classic.

                                 CASSIDY
                        They don’t make ‘em like they used 
                        to.

                                 RANDY
                        Eighties, man. Best shit ever. 
                        Ozzy, Gunners...

                                 CASSIDY
                        Def Lep, The Crüe...

                                 RANDY
                        Then that Cobain pussy had to come 
                        around and ruin it all.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Like there’s something wrong with 
                        having a good time. Fuckin’ mopey 
                        douchebag.

                                 RANDY
                        “Ooh, look at me! I wear flannel! 
                        I’m all depressed!”

                                 CASSIDY
                        “I’m from Seattle! I like rain!”

           They share a laugh. Randy shakes his head sourly.

                                 RANDY
                        Nineties fuckin’ sucked.

                                 CASSIDY
                        No shit.

           We get the sense they mean more than just the music.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE of Randy and Cassidy ROCKING OUT on the dancefloor to 
           various ‘80s METAL CLASSICS, singing along with the choruses:
           GREAT WHITE:

                                 RANDY AND CASSIDY
                        My, my, my! I’m once bitten twice 
                        shy, baby!

           DEF LEPPARD:

                                 RANDY AND CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        Pour some sugar on me!

           GUNS ‘N’ ROSES:

                                 RANDY AND CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        Take me down to the Paradise City!

           AC/DC:

                                 RANDY AND CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        You! Shook me all night long!
                             (pointing at each other)
                        Yeah, you! Shook me all night long!

           Cassidy notices something intriguing over Randy’s shoulder. 
           Randy turns to see what she’s looking at.

           RANDY’S POV: Standing by the bar is a MAN.

           He turns back to Cassidy.

                                 RANDY
                        Who’s that?

                                 CASSIDY
                        A.J. 
                             (beat)
                        My old coke dealer.

           Randy nods oh. A slightly weird moment between them.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t do that anymore.

                                 RANDY
                        Me neither.

           They exchange a look.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:
           INT. WOMEN’S BATHROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           A single-person bathroom. Randy and Cassidy are doing BUMPS 
           OF COKE.

           INT. WOMEN’S BATHROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is FUCKING Cassidy from behind over the bathroom sink. 
           Cassidy MOANS LOUDLY.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Oh, Gawddd...

           There’s a KNOCK at the door.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                             (through door)
                        Could you fuck someplace else? I 
                        gotta piss.

           INT. BACK OF VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and Cassidy are fucking on the mattress.

           INT. BACK OF VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and Cassidy lie together in a post-coital daze. She’s 
           looking at the old wrestling pictures of him on the wall.

           Cassidy looks at Randy’s body, taking in his heavily scarred 
           torso.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I thought wrestling was fake.

                                 RANDY
                        Can’t fake a chair whackin’ your 
                        face. Can’t fake falling through a 
                        folding table from 20 feet up.

           Cassidy’s eyes fix on an ARM SCAR. She lightly traces its 
           raised ridge with her fingertip.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        What’s this one?
                                 RANDY
                        1986. Denver Coliseum. Billy Bob 
                        Banjo hit me with his two-by-four. 
                        Loose nail tore the bicep open.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Ow. Fuck.

           She traces a COLLARBONE SCAR.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        And this?

                                 RANDY
                        1988. Orlando Arena. Mr. 
                        Magnificent tossed me out of the 
                        ring. Landed on my shoulder, 
                        clavicle snapped in half.

                                 CASSIDY
                        How can you take all that pain? 
                        Don’t it hurt?

                                 RANDY
                        Not when they’re going crazy for 
                        you.

           Randy goes off someplace blissful in his head.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Best feeling in the world...

           Cassidy’s eyes drift back to the wall. She fixes on one of 
           the pictures, gazing at it in soulful silence.

                                 CASSIDY 
                        “He was pierced for our 
                        transgressions, He was crushed for 
                        our iniquities. The punishment that 
                        brought us peace was upon Him, and 
                        by His wounds we were healed.”

           Randy nods, pondering the quote. He likes it.

                                 RANDY
                        What’s that?

                                 CASSIDY
                        It’s from “Passion of the Christ”.

           CASSIDY’S POV: A wrestling-mag mini-poster of Randy standing 
           atop a corner turnbuckle, arms spread wide, Christ-style.
                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        You never seen it?

           Randy shakes his head no.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        Dude, you gotta. It’s amazing.
                             (beat)
                        It’s, like, so inspiring. They 
                        throw everything at Him. Whips, 
                        arrows, rocks... Beat the living 
                        fuck out of Him for, like, the 
                        whole two hours straight. And He 
                        just takes it.

                                 RANDY
                        I heard it’s good. I’ll have to 
                        check it out...

           Cassidy brushes her palm over Randy’s torso, taking in three 
           decades of battle scars.

                                 CASSIDY
                        The sacrificial Ram...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARADISE OAKS TRAILER PARK - FRONT ENTRANCE - 4 A.M.

           A trailer park somewhere in North Jersey. Randy’s van pulls 
           through the entrance gate.

           EXT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy parks in front of his TRAILER. He gets out and heads to 
           it. A “What the fuck?” look comes over his face.

           RANDY’S POV: The door is PADLOCKED.

           He tugs on the lock. He tugs on the door. No dice.

           EXT. RANDY’S TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy is trying to push open a window on the side of the 
           trailer. No dice.
           EXT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy climbs into the back of the van.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BACK OF VAN - NEXT MORNING

           Randy is asleep in his clothes from the night before. Next to 
           the mattress are SIX CRUMPLED $20s and a PLASTIC TITLE BELT.

           He’s stirred awake by the sound of kids YELLING and BANGING 
           on the outside of van. He slowly sits upright, massaging his 
           pain-wracked knees. Every inch of him feels like shit. 

                                 KID’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ram!

           RANDY’S POV: Through the front windshield he sees TWO 10-YEAR-
           OLD KIDS, boosted by TWO OTHER KIDS, peering in.

           EXT. PARADISE OAKS TRAILER PARK - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is playfully tussling with five or six kids. He picks 
           one of them up and “bodyslams” him.

                                 RANDY
                             (announcer voice)
                        Oh, my... look out!

           He picks up another kid and fake-drops him on his head.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Suplex!

           He slams another kid.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Tombstone piledriver!

           The kids are squealing with delight. Randy sees a car drive 
           up and park by the MANAGER’S OFFICE.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Catch you li’l maniacs later.

           The kids moan in disappointment as Randy heads off.
           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy looks pleadingly at Len, the trailer park’s MANAGER.

                                 RANDY
                        Come on, Len...

                                 LEN THE MANAGER
                        You’ll get in when I get my rent.

                                 RANDY
                        You know I’m good for it.

                                 LEN THE MANAGER
                        If you were good for it, there 
                        wouldn’t be a lock on your door.

           Randy can’t argue with this logic.

                                 RANDY
                        I need to get in. All my shit’s in 
                        there.

                                 LEN THE MANAGER
                        Don’t worry, it’s safe. Nobody’s 
                        gonna break in and steal your 
                        priceless valuables.

                                 RANDY
                        Could I at least park in back?

           Pause. A wave of pity comes over Len.

                                 LEN THE MANAGER
                        Twenty bucks.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SHOP-RITE SUPERMARKET - DAY

           Randy enters a suburban Shop Rite.

           INT. SHOP RITE - MANAGER’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy knocks lightly on a door marked MANAGER’S OFFICE.

                                 MANAGER (O.S.)
                        Yeah?

           Randy enters. Sitting behind a desk is the MANAGER.
                                 RANDY
                        Hey, Jim.

                                 MANAGER
                        What’s up?

                                 RANDY
                        I was just wondering if you had any 
                        extra shifts you could maybe throw 
                        my way.

           The manager reaches for a looseleaf binder. Randy watches 
           anxiously as he flips through it.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Anything weekday...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SHOP RITE - REAR LOADING DOCK - DAY

           Randy, working alongside a few MEXICAN GUYS, lifts a HEAVY 
           STACK OF BOXES off the back of a Boar’s Head delivery truck.

           INT. SHOP RITE - BACK OF STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy carries the boxes through a rubber-strip curtain, into 
           a WALK-IN COOLER. He puts them down and heads back out again.

           EXT. DELIVERY DOCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy grabs some more boxes.

           INT. OGDEN’S GYM - DAY

           A dank, no-frills bodybuilding gym. Randy is BENCHPRESSING. 
           He grunts loudly as he squeezes out one more rep, his SPOTTER 
           urging him on.

                                 SPOTTER
                        Push it out! You got this!

           INT. OGDEN’S GYM - LOCKER ROOM - TOILET STALL - SHORT TIME 
           LATER

           Randy, underwear pulled down, casually plunges a needle into 
           his ass cheek.
           INT. SUNSATIONS TANNING SALON - LATER

           A strip-mall tanning salon. Randy breezes in, nodding hello 
           to the FRONT-DESK WOMAN, who’s on the phone.

                                 RANDY
                        How ya doin’, Glor?

                                 FRONT-DESK WOMAN
                             (cupping phone)
                        Hey, babe. Four’s open.

           INT. SUNSATIONS TANNING SALON - SHORT TIME LATER

           ANGLE ON an upright tanning pod. INSIDE THE POD, Randy is 
           standing naked, baking under the UV lights.

           INT. THE MANE EVENT - SHORT TIME LATER

           A hair salon. Randy, freshly tanned, sits in a chair as a 
           female STYLIST wearing latex gloves BLEACHES HIS ROOTS. His 
           hair is full of plastic clips.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VAN - AFTERNOON

           Randy is driving west on I-80.

           INT. PARSIPPANY ARMORY - MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - EVENING

           A makeshift locker room/staging area. Randy and 15 OTHER 
           WRESTLERS huddle around a LINEUP CARD taped to a wall. He 
           searches for his name.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        All right, listen up.

           Standing by the door is FRANK, the event’s promoter.

                                 FRANK
                        This is a family event. No blood, 
                        no cursing, no cheap heat. Got it?

           The wrestlers mutter and nod yes. Frank, nodding, exits.

           Randy returns to scanning the list. The last match at the 
           bottom is RANDY THE RAM VS. THA GRIMM REEFER. 
           He seems puzzled.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Randy chases after Frank as he heads down the hall.

                                 RANDY
                        Yo, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        What’s up, Ram?

                                 RANDY
                        Who’s this Grim Reefer?

                                 FRANK
                        He’s good. He’s pretty new.

                                 RANDY
                        How come I never heard of him?

           Frank shrugs vaguely, averting eye contact.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you find him?

           Pause.

                                 FRANK
                        Through my sister.

                                 RANDY
                        Your sister?

                                 FRANK
                        It’s her son.

                                 RANDY
                        You’re headlining me with your 
                        nephew?

                                 FRANK
                        He’s a quick study. He’ll catch on.

                                 RANDY
                        What kinda rank-amateur shit are 
                        you——

                                 FRANK
                        Would you like to get paid?

           Randy falls deferentially silent.
           INT. MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is suiting up for the match, steaming inside.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. GYMNASIUM - THE RING - LATER

           CLOSE-UP on Randy in the ring mid-match, wearing a 
           frustrated, pissed-off expression.

           THA GRIMM REEFER (21), a doughy, zit-faced punk in homemade 
           tights covered with hand-drawn skulls and marijuana leaves, 
           is holding Randy by the hair.

           RANDY’S POV: The fans are restless, bored. A few BOOS.

           Tha Grimm Reefer throws an unconvincing punch that clearly 
           doesn’t connect. Randy does his best to sell the punch, but 
           it’s not easy. Tha Grimm Reefer throws another bad punch. 
           Randy falls to his knees.

                                 THA GRIMM REEFER
                             (to crowd)
                        That’s what I’m talkin’ bout!

                                 FAN (O.S.)
                        You suck!

                                 THA GRIMM REEFER
                        No, you suck!

           Tha Grimm Reefer charges toward the ropes. He bounces off, 
           hurtling toward Randy. He attempts a flying dropkick to his 
           face, but his boot winds up awkwardly glancing off Randy’s 
           shoulder. Randy has no choice but to hit the mat.

           RANDY’S POV: Standing against a wall is Frank. He looks 
           pained.

           Tha Grim Reefer stands tauntingly over Randy.

                                 THA GRIMM REEFER (CONT’D)
                        Prepare to be...
                             (mimics joint hit)
                        ...smoked.

           Tha Grim Reefer heads toward a corner. He climbs up, his legs 
           wobbly as he struggles to keep his balance on the ropes. He 
           gets to the top. 
           He spreads his arms dramatically, bending slightly at the 
           knees, poised for take off. He thrusts his body upwards 
           and... 

           ...WIPES OUT. His feet slip off the ropes as he tries to take 
           flight. He crashes to the mat face-first.

           The crowd ROARS with laughter. A chant begins.

                                 FANS
                        You fucked up! You fucked up! You 
                        fucked up!...

           The chant burns in Randy’s ears. He is mortified to be part 
           of this amateurish spectacle. 

           Determined to salvage the match, Randy drags Tha Grimm Reefer 
           to the middle of the ring and lifts him to his feet. He 
           bounces off the ropes and goes airborne with a VERTICAL 
           SPLASH, leaping stomach-first across Tha Grimm Reefer’s chest 
           and slamming him.

           Randy pops right up and follows this with a SUPLEX, lifting 
           Tha Grimm Reefer high up over his head and falling backwards 
           with him, slamming Tha Grimm Reefer’s back into the mat.

           RANDY’S POV: A smattering of cheers.

           Randy pops up again, hellbent on giving the fans their 
           money’s worth. He picks up Tha Grimm Reefer and flips him 
           upside down, his head between his thighs.

                                 THA GRIMM REEFER
                             (scared)
                        What are you doing?

           Randy drops him with a PILEDRIVER.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PARSIPPANY ARMORY - MEN’S ROOM - LATER

           Randy pokes an angry finger at Frank.

                                 RANDY
                        Never again, Frank!

           Randy paces the floor, steaming mad.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        That kid was greener than goose 
                        shit.
           Frank just takes it. He knows Randy’s right.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        He had no business being in the 
                        ring with me. None.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m sorry, Ram.

                                 RANDY
                        I don’t care if he’s your fuckin’ 
                        first-born, I will not put on a dud 
                        show.

           Frank reaches into his pocket.

                                 FRANK
                        Maybe this’ll help ease your pain.

           He counts off some TWENTIES and sticks them in Randy’s palm.

           Randy gazes at the money in his hand. He THROWS IT BACK at 
           Frank. The bills scatter all over the floor.

           Frank exits the bathroom with a shrug. Randy stews alone.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Yo, Ram.

           Randy looks toward the bathroom door. A FELLOW WRESTLER is 
           sticking his head in.

                                 WRESTLER
                        There’s some chick lookin’ for you.

                                 RANDY
                        Who?

                                 WRESTLER
                             (shrugging)
                        Some chick.

           The wrestler leaves.

           Randy looks at the bills scattered on the floor. He bends 
           down and starts picking them up.

           INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Randy emerges from the bathroom. His expression darkens.

           RANDY’S POV: Standing there is a plain, heavy-set WOMAN (22).
           Their eyes meet in tense silence.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. IHOP - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and the woman sit uncomfortably across from one another 
           at a booth in an iHop. In front of her is a black coffee. 
           Randy is drinking a large Coke.

                                 RANDY
                        How you been?

                                 WOMAN
                        Okay...

           An uneasy pause. Randy tries to think of something to say.

                                 RANDY
                        You still with that guy?

           She throws him a “What guy?” look.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Tall dude... With the beard...
                             (beat)
                        Kinda looked like Bin Laden...

           She has no idea who he’s talking about.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Never mind. I’m probably confused.

           Another uncomfortable pause. They’re off to a bad start.

                                 WOMAN
                        So you’re probably wondering why I 
                        came.

                                 RANDY
                             (small grin)
                        You didn’t come to see me wrestle?

           The woman, vaguely annoyed with his jokiness, takes a deep 
           breath.

                                 WOMAN
                        I wanted...

           The WAITRESS comes over with a plate of pancakes and bacon. 
           She puts it down in front of Randy.
                                 RANDY
                        Thanks, hon.

           The waitress heads off. Randy preps his pancakes, dousing 
           them in BUTTER, BOYSENBERRY SYRUP and SUGAR.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Go on.

           An irritated pause from the woman.

                                 WOMAN
                        I’m here because... 
                             (beat)
                        I came to make amends.

                                 RANDY
                        Amends?

                                 WOMAN
                        I’m supposed to talk to people I’ve 
                        harmed.

           Randy looks up at her, unsure what that means. He looks at 
           the cup of black coffee in front of her.

                                 RANDY
                        Ohh... 
                             (slight smirk)
                        AA.

                                 WOMAN
                             (bristling)
                        NA.

           Randy takes a big bite of pancakes.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ve had so many bad thoughts about 
                        you. Really negative thoughts.

                                 RANDY
                        That ain’t too surprising.

                                 WOMAN
                             (almost rehearsed)
                        It’s been a very destructive thing 
                        in my life, this anger I’ve 
                        carried. And I know that if I’m 
                        gonna move forward, I need to let 
                        it go.

           She pauses. This is not easy for her.
                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I want you to know that I forgive 
                        you, I release you, I set you——

           He CHUCKLES. She glares at him edgily.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Something funny?

                                 RANDY
                             (amused grin, mouth full 
                              of pancakes)
                        12 step.

                                 WOMAN
                        Please be respectful. I need to say 
                        this.

                                 RANDY
                        I thought this was gonna be about 
                        how you hurt me.

                                 WOMAN
                        It is. 
                             (beat)
                        It’s about letting go of my anger 
                        toward you. For walking out on me 
                        and Mom.

           This is STEPHANIE, Randy’s daughter.

                                 RANDY
                        She left me.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        How can you leave somebody who was 
                        never there?

                                 RANDY
                        She knew the deal when she signed 
                        on.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I didn’t sign on. I didn’t ask to 
                        grow up without a dad.

                                 RANDY
                        Being a father... I just wasn’t cut 
                        out for it. That’s not what I was 
                        put here to do.
                                 STEPHANIE
                             (bitter)
                        That’s right, you were put here to 
                        “rock a crowd”.

           Randy just shrugs.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        You never felt that missing from 
                        your life? Having family? Being a 
                        dad?

           No response.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        ...Human relationships?

                                 RANDY
                        Are we almost done with this?

                                 CAROLINE
                        This what?

                                 RANDY
                             (hits table with fist)
                        This ATTACK.

           Randy’s soda SPILLS from the table-rattling hit. People at 
           other tables look.

                                 RANDY (cont’d) (CONT’D)
                        I was a shit father. What do you 
                        want me to do about it now?

                                 CAROLINE
                        I want you to help me let go. To be 
                        free from all the hurt of the past.

                                 RANDY
                        I would if I could.

           Stephanie looks at him with disappointment and bitterness.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        But you can’t so you won’t.

           Randy, dodging her eye contact, flags down the waitress.

                                 RANDY (cont’d)
                        Could I get a new Coke?

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. OGDEN’S GYM - DAY

           Randy, dripping sweat, is kneeling over a bench doing 
           dumbbell rows. He grunts loudly with each rep.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is in the gym locker room with a huge BODYBUILDER. In 
           Randy’s hands is a SMALL PAPER BAG, which he looks at with 
           displeasure.

                                 BODYBUILDER
                        I’m tellin’ ya, bro, it’s identical 
                        to the German.

                                 RANDY
                        No, it ain’t. Know how I know? 
                        Because I cycled Mexican sus once, 
                        and it gave me bitch tits.

                                 BODYBUILDER
                        It was probably something else you 
                        were stacking.

                                 RANDY
                        No, it was your Tijuana Titty 
                        Sauce.
                             (eye contact)
                        Now I got a lot of gigs comin’ up, 
                        and I cannot be lookin’ like 
                        Jessica Simpson with balls. So 
                        please take this back and go find 
                        me some decent German, okay?
                             (shoves bag back in guy’s 
                              hands)
                        Thank you.

           INT. SUNSATIONS TANNING SALON - DAY

           Randy stands naked in a tanning pod, baking under the UV 
           lights.

           INT. VAN - ANOTHER DAY

           Randy is driving over the Throgs Neck Bridge.
           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SHORT TIME LATER

           The van pulls up to a two-family house in working-class 
           Queens. A huge dude steps out. It’s LEX LETHAL. (We saw him 
           earlier at the Passaic VFW Hall show.)

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           The van heads down a highway entrance ramp, Lex Lethal riding 
           shotgun.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        Thanks again for the lift, man.

                                 RANDY
                        No prob. You’re right on the way.

           Randy merges into traffic on the Long Island Expressway.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        So how big’s this place?

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        Nice. Two, two-fifty...

                        You been there. Where they did the 
                        Ricky Whipsaw memorial benefit.

                                 RANDY
                        That place? Right on.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        Should get a good gate. Bill says 
                        he’s gotten like 30 calls the last 
                        two days alone.

           Randy chuckles knowingly.

                                 RANDY
                        God bless hardcore.

           INT. DOLLAR TREE - SHORT TIME LATER

           A Long Island strip-mall 99-CENT STORE. Randy and Lex browse 
           an aisle. Randy is holding a TIN CAKE PAN. He bangs it 
           against his forehead. It makes a LOUD CLANG.

                                 RANDY
                        Whatcha think?
           Lex takes the pan, testing it against his own head.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        The cookie trays were better.

           Lex puts the pan back.

           INT. ANOTHER AISLE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Lex spots something exciting on a shelf.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        Hell, yeah...

           Lex grabs a pack of STEEL-WOOL PADS. Randy grins in approval. 
           Lex tosses them into the SHOPPING BASKET Randy is holding. 

           ANGLE ON basket. It’s full of all sorts of “supplies”: cookie 
           trays, lightbulbs, thumbtacks, cheese graters, wire hangers, 
           cutlery sets, pizza cutters, etc.

                                 RANDY
                        Let’s see if they got extension 
                        cords.

           They head off.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NORTH BABYLON COMMUNITY CENTER - GYM - LATER

           MUSIC: AC/DC - “IF YOU WANT BLOOD (YOU GOT IT)

           Randy stands BEHIND A CURTAIN as his song plays. He sneaks a 
           peek at the scene on the other side.

           RANDY’S POV: A ROWDY CROWD of about 150 fills a COMMUNITY-
           CENTER GYM. The vibe of the crowd is rougher than previous 
           events. Fewer women and children. Almost an underground, 
           “Fight Club”-type feel.

           A banner on the wall reads ECHW - EAST COAST HARDCORE 
           WRESTLING. Pressed against the outside of the ring are a 
           FOLDING TABLE and a 12-FOOT METAL LADDER.

           In the ring, an ANNOUNCER stands with a microphone. 

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Aaaand now... 
           BEHIND THE CURTAIN:

           Randy closes his eyes, head lowered.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Please welcome... From Hackensack,

                        pounds... A true legend and 
                        superstar... Randy “The Ram” 
                        Robinnnnsonnnnn!

           Randy explodes through the curtain.

           THE GYM:

           Randy enters to wild cheers.

                                 AC/DC
                        If you want blood, You got it!/ 
                        If you want blood, You got it!

           He does a lap around the perimeter of the ring, doing his 
           trademark head-butting of chairs.

                                 AC/DC (CONT’D)
                        Blood on the streets, Blood on the 
                        rocks/ Blood in the gutter, Every 
                        last drop/ If you want blood, you 
                        got it!!

           Randy climbs into the ring. He does a few neck rolls and knee 
           bends, limbering up. The song fades down. A NEW SONG rises to 
           take its place... 

           CELTIC FROST - “DOMAIN OF DECAY”

           Ugly, plodding hardcore death metal.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        And his opponent...

           The boos begin to rain down.

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        From Kinston, North Carolina, 
                        weighing in at 295 pounds... 
                        Hellbilly Cannibaaaal!

           Through the curtain, HELLBILLY CANNIBAL emerges. A huge, 
           overalls-clad, mangy, wild-eyed masochist. Crumbs cling to 
           his scraggly beard. He’s dragging a heavy CANVAS SACK.
           A KID in the crowd holds up a sign reading HELLBILLY CANNIBAL 
           SUCKS A FAT DICK.

           Hellbilly Cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a 
           folding chair. He heads to the center of the ring, where 
           Randy awaits. They sit down on chairs, facing each other. 
           Under Hellbilly Cannibal’s chair is his canvas sack. Under 
           Randy’s is his Dollar Tree plastic shopping bag.

           Hellbilly Cannibal punches Randy. Randy punches Hellbilly 
           Cannibal. They take turns punching, each punch escalating a 
           little. It’s like a violent version of “slaps”.

           After a stretch of this, Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his 
           sack and pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He SPRAYS it in 
           Randy’s face. Randy falls off his chair. He staggers around 
           the ring clutching his face, howling in agony.

           His foe blinded, Hellbilly Cannibal smashes Randy over the 
           head with his chair. Randy falls to his knees. Hellbilly 
           Cannibal reaches into his sack and pulls out a FLUORESCENT 
           LIGHT TUBE. Wielding it like a bat, he SMACKS RANDY in the 
           face. The tube explodes with a pop.

           Hellbilly Cannibal picks up Randy by the hair and drapes him 
           over the ropes. He grabs a fork from his sack and, pressing 
           against Randy’s back, REPEATEDLY STABS HIM in the same spot 
           on his forehead. He really works the fork in. Twirls it. 
           Grinds it. BLOOD starts to pour.

           RANDY’S POV: The fans push forward, eager to get a look.

           Hellbilly Cannibal drags Randy back to the center of the 
           ring. He reaches into his sack and pulls out a BOX OF SALT. 
           He pours liberal amounts of the salt onto Randy’s forehead 
           wound, grinding it in with his hand.

           Grabbing a folding chair, Hellbilly Cannibal charges toward 
           Randy. He takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie 
           board. Just as he’s about to crash down on Randy, Randy ROLLS 
           OUT OF THE WAY. Hellbilly Cannibal’s spine gets a violent 
           jolt as the chair hits the mat.

           Randy reaches into his Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a COOKIE 
           TRAY. He smacks Hellbilly Cannibal across the face with it. 
           The tray makes a fantastically loud METALLIC CLANG. He hits 
           him a bunch more times.

           Randy is starting to get winded. His heartbeat speeds up.

           He picks up Hellbilly Cannibal and throws him toward the 
           ropes. 
           Hellbilly Cannibal bounces off the ropes and ducks Randy’s 
           awaiting forearm. He bounces off the opposite ropes and 
           crashes into Randy knee-first.

           Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy by the hair and smashes his 
           face into the corner post. He scoops him up and flips him 
           over the top rope, out of the ring. Randy lands hard on the 
           concrete floor.

           Hellbilly Cannibal hops out of the ring with the folding 
           chair. He whales Randy in the face with it. Randy stumbles 
           backwards toward the metal barricade between the ring and the 
           fans. Hellbilly Cannibal kicks him in the chest. Randy flips 
           over the barricade, into the crowd. The crowd scatters in an 
           exhilarated panic.

           Hellbilly Cannibal throws Randy into a row of empty chairs. 
           Randy goes sprawling. Chairs fly everywhere. 

           Randy’s heart is beating LOUD and FAST.

           Randy grabs a metal GARBAGE CAN from the SNACK-BAR AREA. He 
           shakes out the contents over Hellbilly Cannibal, showering 
           him in trash. Randy sticks Hellbilly Cannibal’s head into the 
           can and falls on it, ass-first.

           Randy grabs the ladder resting along the base of the ring. He 
           pounds the garbage can with it, making an UNHOLY RACKET. 

           With the can still over his head, Hellbilly Cannibal staggers 
           to his feet. He HEADBUTTS RANDY WITH THE CAN. Randy, 
           stumbling around dazed, is headbutted again. Hellbilly 
           Cannibal throws off the can and drags Randy back to the ring 
           by his hair, carrying the ladder in his other hand.

           Plopping Randy down on the mat, Hellbilly Cannibal sets up 
           the ladder in the middle of the ring. He heads back out and 
           grabs the folding table, setting it up by the ladder. He then 
           reaches into Randy’s Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a BOX OF 
           THUMBTACKS. He scatters the tacks all over the table.

           Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy and drags him up the ladder. 
           They stand at the top, perched high above the table. Just as 
           Hellbilly Cannibal is about to push off, Randy unexpectedly 
           hits him with a vicious head-butt. Hellbilly Cannibal is 
           stunned. Randy head-butts him again. He PUSHES OFF, reversing 
           their positions in mid-air. Hellbilly Cannibal CRASHES 
           THROUGH THE TABLE with Randy on top of him.

           Hellbilly Cannibal rolls around the mat in a daze, his back 
           bloodied and covered with tacks. He staggers to his feet. 
           Randy promptly levels him with a dropkick.

           Randy’s heartbeat is DEAFENING. All other sounds drop out.
           Randy pulls Hellbilly Cannibal off the mat. As he gears up 
           for another dropkick, his KNEES BUCKLE. A scared look comes 
           over his face. He DROPS TO HIS KNEES, one hand on the mat.

           Randy grabs his arm. He massages it. He FLOPS OVER, clutching 
           his chest. He lies on his back gasping for breath, sucking 
           desperately at the air.

           RANDY’S POV: The fans are unaware anything is wrong. They 
           assume it’s part of the act.

           Hellbilly Cannibal sees a look of FEAR in Randy’s eyes. He 
           knows this is real. He looks out at the crowd.

                                 HELLBILLY CANNIBAL
                        Is there a doctor?

           Only a few people look around. Most of the fans still think 
           this is a gag.

           Among those who sense it’s real is JERRY DIFUSCO, the event’s 
           promoter. He climbs into the ring. He kneels over Randy.

                                 DIFUSCO
                        Randy. You okay?

           Randy is gasping. DiFusco looks at Hellbilly Cannibal.

                                 DIFUSCO (CONT’D)
                        Call 911.

           Lex Lethal and some of the other wrestlers climb into the 
           ring. They huddle around Randy.

                                 DIFUSCO (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get him up.

           With no small effort, they lift Randy. They carry him to the 
           ropes and pause, unsure how best to get him through.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        Put him down.

           They lower him to the mat. Lethal hops out of the ring and 
           grabs Randy’s ankles. Several of the other guys hop out of 
           the ring, supporting Randy’s underside as they carefully, 
           awkwardly pull him out.

           By now, the crowd realizes this is real. The push forward as 
           DiFusco and the wrestlers carry Randy toward the exit.

                                 DIFUSCO
                        Get back, get back, get back.
           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           They carry Randy down a long hallway, trailed by curious and 
           concerned fans. Lex is closest to Randy’s head.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        You’re okay, buddy. Hang on.

           They reach a door and enter. The wrestler holding Randy’s 
           feet shuts it behind them, keeping the gawkers out.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM/STAGING AREA - CONTINUOUS

           The “locker room”. Randy, eyes rolling back in his head, is 
           carried to a table, where he’s carefully laid out. Lex Lethal 
           squeezes his hand, trying to keep him conscious.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        Stay right here, bro. Stay with us. 
                        Help’s coming.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM/STAGING AREA - SHORT TIME LATER

           EMS WORKERS lift Randy onto a GURNEY.

           RANDY’S POV: Randy watches through blurry, half-closed eyes 
           as he’s wheeled out of the room. He can see and feel somebody 
           squeezing his hand.

                                 LEX LETHAL (O.S.)
                        C’mon, buddy, you got this.

           We continue from RANDY’S POV as he is wheeled down a hallway, 
           past the throngs of fans who still haven’t left.

                                 EMS WORKER (O.S.)
                        Clear a path, folks!

           INT. BACK OF AMBULANCE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Lex Lethal rides in the back of the ambulance with Randy.

                                 LEX LETHAL
                        You’re gonna be fine. Hang on.

           Randy goes completely unconscious.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
           INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - RANDY’S ROOM - NEXT DAY

           Randy lies unconscious in a hospital bed hooked up to all 
           sorts of monitors.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. RANDY’S ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Randy’s eyes slowly open.

           INT. RANDY’S ROOM - LATER

           Randy is watching “All My Children” on the wall-mounted TV.

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI (O.S.)
                        Mr. Ramzinski.

           Randy looks at the door. DR. TARACHANDANI (40) enters the 
           room.

                                 RANDY 
                        Call me Randy.

           The doctor nods. In his hands is Randy’s folder.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        So how we lookin’, doc?

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                             (very slight Indian 
                              accent)
                        We did a balloon angioplasty to 
                        open the blockage. Then we put in a 
                        defibrillator to prevent any rhythm 
                        disturbance in the future.

                                 RANDY
                        So I’m okay.

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        The cardiac cath shows extensive 
                        atherosclerosis in all the vessels.

                                 RANDY
                        In English that means...

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        Your heart is very weak.
                                 RANDY
                        But you can fix it.

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        You’re unfortunately not a 
                        candidate for bypass. The damage is 
                        too extensive.

                                 RANDY
                        So what do we do?

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        Well, for starters, you’re gonna 
                        need to make some serious lifestyle 
                        changes.

                             (beat)
                        The wrestling...

                                 RANDY
                        What about it?

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        A man your age, with your heart, 
                        should not be flying around a 
                        wrestling ring.

                                 RANDY
                        I thought exercise is good.

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI 
                        Regular moderate aerobic, yes.

                                 RANDY
                        What are you saying?

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI 
                        That you need to stop wrestling.

           Randy’s eyes flash with anger.

                                 RANDY
                        With all due respect, Dr...
                             (reading name tag, 
                              mispronouncing)
                        ...Trachanani, I’d like a second 
                        opinion on that.
                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        Of course. But I promise you, any 
                        doctor I showed your file would say 
                        the exact same thing.

           Randy lets out a skeptical snort.

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Ramzinski, you almost died. The 
                        next time, you won’t be so lucky.

                                 RANDY
                        I want a second opinion.

                                 DR. TARACHANDANI
                        Your heart’s been through a lot. 
                        Even before the——

                                 RANDY
                        I want a second opinion.
                             (beat)
                        I WANT A SECOND OPINION.

           INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - ADMISSIONS DESK - MORNING

           Randy is checking out of the hospital.

                                 ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN
                        This is your copy.

           The ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN hands him some paperwork. He folds 
           it up and tucks it in a jacket pocket. 

                                 NURSE
                        This was left for you.

           She hands him an ENVELOPE. Randy opens it. Inside is a note:

           YOU EARNED IT DUDE... YOUR A WARRIOR!!                      
           REST UP, FEEL BETTER.                                  
           ——JERRY DIFUSCO                                             
           PS... IF YOUR UP BY THE 23RD, I GOT SOMETHING IN YONKERS

           Randy reaches back into the envelope and pulls out $300.

           He looks at the money, chuckling ironically. It’s his biggest 
           payday in years.
           EXT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy steps out of the hospital into the bright light of day. 
           He squints, his eyes adjusting. He stands there looking 
           around, a lost animal.

           INT. TAXI - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits in the back of a cab, gazing blankly out the 
           window at the passing strip malls.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits in the van in the otherwise empty parking lot of 
           the North Babylon community center.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARADISE OAKS TRAILER PARK - NEXT MORNING

           Randy pulls into the entrance of his trailer park.

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy watches as Len the manager counts his cash.

           EXT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Len removes the padlock from Randy’s door.

                                 LEN THE MANAGER
                        Welcome home.

           INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - KITCHENETTE - SHORT TIME LATER

           A messy, junk-filled trailer. Randy sits at the table in the 
           kitchenette. On it is a WALGREENS PHARMACY BAG. 

           He opens the bag and takes out FOUR PRESCRIPTION PILL 
           BOTTLES. We catch a glimpse of the drug names on them: 
           PLAVIX. COREG. LIPITOR, LISINOPRIL.

           He gazes at the patient name on them: RAMZINSKI, ROBIN.
           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Randy flops down on the bed, exhausted.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Randy is taking a shower. On his chest is a SURGERY BANDAGE. 
           He soaps up, careful not to get the bandage wet.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, shirtless before a mirror, gingerly removes the 
           bandage. Beneath is a fresh TWO-INCH SCAR where the 
           defibrillator was inserted.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy lies on the bed, restless and bored. He gazes off. 
           Something catches his eye.

           RANDY’S POV: On the floor in front of the TV is an ancient 
           NINTENDO GAME SYSTEM. The game in the console is WRESTLEJAM 
           ‘88.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits on the floor playing the game, eyes glued to the 
           TV.

           ON TV:

           Cyber-Randy is wrestling The Ayatollah at the Hoosier Dome 
           before 70,000. The graphics are late-’80s crude.

           Randy flies all over the ring, devastating his foe with a 
           series of acrobatic leaps and kicks and flips.

           RANDY:

           Randy wears a look of vague dissatisfaction as he plays the 
           game. What should be a cathartic, vicarious thrill just 
           reminds him of his real-life limitations.
           ON TV:

           Cyber-Randy drops The Ayatollah with a knee to the chest. He 
           heads to a corner and climbs to the top rope. He raises his 
           arms, sticking his elbows out, pressing his fists to the 
           sides of his head to form a SET OF RAM’S HORNS. (Just like in 
           the opening photo montage.)

           Randy JUMPS. He flies high in the air, soaring over the mat 
           and crashing down on The Ayatollah horns-first. He pins The 
           Ayatollah as the ref counts to three for the victory. The 
           cyber-crowd goes wild.

           RANDY:

           Randy flings the controller aside.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, standing before the mirror, does a JUMPING JACK. He 
           does another. Another. A few more.

           He feels himself getting a little winded. A little woozy. He 
           sits down. He sits perfectly still, trying to slow his heart.

           He starts to CRY. 

           Angry, bitter, frightened tears roll down his cheeks.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits on his bed, sifting through a messy, junk-filled 
           shoebox. He pulls out an OLD PHOTO.

           ANGLE ON photo: It’s a mid-’80s shot of Randy and his infant 
           daughter Stephanie in front of the family Christmas tree. 
           Randy, wearing a Santa cap, is smiling and laughing, 
           Stephanie perched on his huge, steroid-pumped bicep.

           He flips the photo over. On the back are a bunch of scribbled 
           PHONE NUMBERS. They’re all crossed-out except the last one. 
           The numbers get progressively less faded from top to bottom, 
           as if they’ve been written down over the course of years.

           EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy stands at a PAY PHONE with the photo, ringing phone 
           cradled to his ear.
                                 STEPHANIE’S VOICE
                        This is Stephanie, you know what to 
                        do.
                             (answering machine BEEP)

           Randy hangs up.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy lies on his bed, bored and lost and lonely.

           INT. VAN - AFTERNOON

           Randy gets out of his van. He walks through a parking lot, 
           toward CHEETAH’S.

           INT. CHEETAH’S - CONTINUOUS

           Randy enters the club. He does a thorough scan of the place. 

           RANDY’S POV: A LUNCHTIME BUFFET CROWD loads up on greasy 
           buffalo wings and egg rolls as an R&B/RAP HIT blares on the 
           speakers.

           Randy heads over to the bar. A female BARTENDER comes over.

                                 RANDY
                        Is Cassidy around?

           The bartender looks toward the stage.

                                 D.J. (O.S.)
                        And now, for your viewing 
                        pleasure...

           RANDY’S POV: A STRIPPER is putting on her dress and getting 
           off the stage. 

                                 D.J. (CONT’D)
                        ...please welcome to the Cheetah’s 
                        stage...

           A new song comes on: MOTLEY CRUE - “GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS”

           Randy looks toward the curtained entrance to the dressing 
           area.

                                 D.J. FREDDIE TEE (O.S.)
                        ...the lovely Cassidy!
           Cassidy steps through the curtain. She takes the stage. 

           Randy watches as she works the pole with rock-n-roll energy.

           As she dances, she spots Randy watching her over at the bar. 
           She gives him a little smile. He smile-winks back.

           She does a spin around the pole, landing in a split. She 
           makes eye contact with some other RANDOM GUY, giving him an 
           identical smile.

           Randy notices. It upsets him a bit. He knows it shouldn’t, 
           but it does.

           INT. CHEETAH’S - SHORT TIME LATER

           As “Girls Girls Girls” fades out, Cassidy puts on her dress 
           and steps off stage. She heads over to Randy at the bar, a 
           little surprised to see him.

                                 CASSIDY
                        What’s up, hon?

           She gives him a friendly little peck on the cheek.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        Whatcha doin’ here on a weekday?

                                 RANDY
                        Ah, I was just in the 
                        neighborhood...

           Cassidy nods at the vague answer.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I was wondering...
                             (beat)
                        Would you maybe like to have dinner 
                        with me tonight?

           Cassidy chuckles.

                                 CASSIDY
                        You sound like you’re asking me on 
                        a date.

           Randy smiles coyly at her.

                                 RANDY
                        Maybe I am.

           She looks at him strangely. This is not how they operate.
                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        What, you don’t eat dinner with 
                        people?

                                 CASSIDY
                        Not with customers.

           Randy nods. He gazes off, clearly troubled about something.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        What’s up?

           A pause from Randy.

                                 RANDY
                        Something happened.

           EXT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and Cassidy sit in the front of his van.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Jesus...
                             (beat)
                        That sucks, dude.

           Randy nods. Sure does.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        How you feelin’?

                                 RANDY
                        Like I just had a heart attack.

           She puts a consoling hand on his shoulder.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I’m so sorry... 

                                 RANDY
                             (nodding)
                        Thanks.

                                 CASSIDY
                        You got it. Anytime.

                                 RANDY
                             (small chuckle)
                        Apparently not.
                                 CASSIDY
                        Look, Randy, I feel terrible about 
                        what happened, but you and me...

           She shakes her head.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        I got a whole other life that’s got 
                        nothing to do with this.

                                 RANDY
                        Guess I just thought I was in it a 
                        little bit.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I hate to sound like some cold hard 
                        bitch, but... You’re not.

                                 RANDY
                        Sure seemed like I was when I was 
                        fucking you.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Fucking is not knowing.

                                 RANDY
                        I know you.

                                 CASSIDY
                        No, you don’t.
                             (beat)
                        You don’t even know my name.

           Randy looks at her with surprise.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        Pam.

                                 RANDY
                        Pam?

                                 CASSIDY
                        Pam Casidio. That’s my name. That’s 
                        who I am.

           Randy looks off, feeling embarrassed and naive.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        Look, Randy, I like you. I have fun 
                        with you. But I got a whole life 
                        outside of this. Family. Friends. 
                        Plans.
                                 RANDY
                        What kinda plans?

           She hesitates answering. Then, she pulls out her CELLPHONE. 
           She holds it up to him, scrolling through some photos of an 
           UNDER-CONSTRUCTION CONDO BUILDING.

                                 CASSIDY
                        It’s down near Trenton. Should be 
                        ready early next year.

                                 RANDY
                        You’re moving?

                                 CASSIDY
                        I’m almost 40. It’s time to hang up 
                        the clear heels.

                                 RANDY
                        Why move?

                                 CASSIDY
                        It’s way cheaper down there. And 
                        the schools are good.

           Randy looks at her oddly. Cassidy realizes her slip-up.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        For my son.

                                 RANDY
                        You got a son?

           Cassidy nods. Yup.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        What’s his name?

           She doesn’t answer, just smiles.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        How old is he?

           No answer.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Is he into wrestling?

                                 CASSIDY
                        Randy...

                                 RANDY
                        Does he know who I am?
                                 CASSIDY
                        He doesn’t know I know you.

           Randy nods, trying not to seem hurt.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        We all got our personal lives. 
                        People we protect.

                                 RANDY
                        Of course...

           Pause.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I gotta go pay for some 
                        countertops.

           Cassidy reaches for the car door.

                                 RANDY
                        Wait.

           He tears the Randy The Ram action figure off the dashboard.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        For your kid.

           She looks at it, unsure if she should take it. She does.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Thanks.

                                 RANDY
                        You’re welcome. Pam.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Cassidy.

           She gets out of the car.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Randy lies awake in bed. Restless. Depressed. Lonely.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OGDEN’S GYM - DAY

           Randy, dressed in street clothes, sits on a exercise bench 
           chatting with a ‘ROIDHEAD BUDDY who’s doing bicep curls.
                                 ‘ROIDHEAD BUDDY
                        When’d you go off?

                                 RANDY
                        Like maybe a week and a half ago?

                                 ‘ROIDHEAD BUDDY
                        Cold turkey?

                                 RANDY
                        Pretty much.

                                 ‘ROIDHEAD BUDDY
                        Dude, that ain’t good. You got no 
                        testosterone in your system.
                             (beat)
                        Are you depressed?

                                 RANDY
                        Oh, yeah.

                                 ‘ROIDHEAD BUDDY
                        How’s the libido?

                                 RANDY
                        Pam Anderson could rub her pussy in 
                        my face, I wouldn’t notice.

           The guy, finishing his set, drops his weights to the floor.

                                 ‘ROIDHEAD BUDDY
                        I think I got something should 
                        help.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Randy sits at the table. On it is a small glass vial and a 
           syringe. He picks up the syringe. Draws liquid from the vial.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RAHWAY RECREATION CENTER - GYMNASIUM - DAY

           An autograph show. TEN FOLDING TABLES are set up around the 
           perimeter of the gym, each one manned by a WORN-OUT, OLD 
           WRESTLER (40s to 70s). One guy is asleep. Another looks 
           borderline homeless. Less than 15 FANS mill about. It’s 
           pretty pathetic.

           At one of the tables is Randy. He looks around at the other 
           tables.
           RANDY’S POV: Directly across from him is a Japanese guy of 
           about his age in a WHEELCHAIR. Attached to his calf is a 
           URINE BAG. A feeble stream of urine trickles through the 
           catheter into the bag.

           Randy looks down at the stack of 8x10 GLOSSIES in front of 
           him. It’s a high-flying, mid-air Ram Jam photo from the 
           height of his ’80s glory. It saddens him.

           INT. RAHWAY RECREATION CENTER - GYMNASIUM - LATER

           The show is over. The wrestlers are packing up their wares. 

           Randy closes up the folding table. He sticks his 8x10s and 
           match tapes into his duffel bag.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        When’re you gonna get a friggin’ 
                        cellphone?

           Randy looks up. Coming his way is a successful-looking man in 
           a sportcoat over a polo shirt. This is promoter NICK VOLPE 
           (55).

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        I been tryin’ to find you forever.

           Randy, surprised to see him, gives him a warm man-hug.

                                 RANDY
                        What’s up, man? Long time.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        How you feelin’, bro? I heard you 
                        had a little incident.

                                 RANDY
                        Yeah, nah, I’m fine, I’m fine...
                             (beat)
                        Whatcha doin’ here?

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        You’re what I’m doing here.
                             (beat)
                        Do you realize what’s coming up?

           Randy thinks.

                                 NICK VOLPE (CONT’D)
                        May 6th...

           Randy racks his brains. He has no idea.
                                 NICK VOLPE (CONT’D)
                             (singing “Sgt. Pepper’s”)
                        It was 20 years ago today...

                                 RANDY
                        I dunno, man. I give up.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        20th anniversary of you and 
                        Ayatollah at the Hoosier Dome.

                                 RANDY
                             (amazed, not realizing)
                        Holy shit...

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        I know. Time fuckin’ flies.
                             (beat)
                        So listen: I’m doing this big 
                        Fanfest thing down in Virginia that 
                        weekend, and I wanna headline it 
                        with the two of you. Big 20th 
                        anniversary rematch.

           Randy nods, a little vaguely.

                                 RANDY
                        Wow...

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        How sick would that be?

                                 RANDY
                        I don’t see Bob getting back in 
                        there.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        He’s in.

                                 RANDY
                        You talked to him?

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        Called him first. I knew you’d be 
                        down.

                                 RANDY
                        I don’t know... Maybe.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        “Maybe”?
                                 RANDY
                        I gotta think about it.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        You’re fucking with me.

                                 RANDY
                        That match... I mean, that was 
                        legendary. Maybe we don’t wanna 
                        mess with that.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        Are you kidding? The fans would go 
                        apeshit. 

                                 RANDY
                        Ya just don’t wanna... Sequels are 
                        never as good.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        What the fuck’s with you? It’d be 
                        insane.
                             (enticing smile)
                        And the payday. We could be talking 
                        a lot. Three, four...

                                 RANDY
                        Hundred?

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        Thousand.

           Randy is momentarily taken aback.

                                 RANDY
                        I gotta think.

           Volpe stares at him, baffled.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        You sure you’re Randy The Ram?

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits in the van, gazing at the ripped-off section of 
           the dashboard where the action figure was.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. STEPHANIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Randy stands at the doorstep of a modest lower-middle-class 
           house. He rings the bell. 

           A WOMAN (22) opens the door in an oversized T-SHIRT and 
           PANTIES.

                                 RANDY
                             (a little thrown)
                        Is Stephanie home?

           The woman looks coldly at Randy.

                                 WOMAN
                        Who may I say it is?

                                 RANDY
                        Her father.

           The woman, sneering, heads into the house. A few moments 
           later, Stephanie appears at the door. She crosses her arms.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What’s up?

                                 RANDY
                        I just wanted to say I’m sorry.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        For what?

                                 RANDY
                        Everything. 
                             (beat)
                        Everything I done or haven’t done 
                        since 1985.

           She looks at him in unnerving silence.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I was born in ‘86.

           Randy privately winces at his mistake.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        Just out of curiosity...
                             (beat)
                        When’s my birthday?

                                 RANDY
                        Your birthday?
           Randy, caught off guard, struggles to think.

                                 STEPHANIE

                        October...

                                 RANDY

                        October 25th.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        November 26th.

           She tsks in disgust.

                                 RANDY
                        C’mon, Steph. I’m trying here.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Trying to what?

                                 RANDY
                        Y’know... talk to you.
                             (beat)
                        I wanna try to be a father.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        It’s too late. I needed one then, 
                        not now.

                                 RANDY
                        Everybody needs a father.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Not me.

                                 RANDY
                        How ‘bout just a friend, then?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I got plenty of those, thanks.

           Randy doesn’t know what else to say.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        You just feel guilty. Don’t worry, 
                        it’ll pass.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                             (from inside house)
                        Steph! It’s on!
           Randy looks into the house.

                                 RANDY
                        Who is that?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Somebody in my life.

           Randy nods defeatedly. He’s not getting anywhere here.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go. Lost’s on.

           With this, she closes the door on him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SHOP RITE - MORNING

           Randy walks toward Shop Rite. A sign in the front window 
           piques his interest:

           NOW HIRING - FULL/PART TIME - EARN UP TO $14.25/HR.

           INT. SHOP RITE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy knocks on the MANAGER’S DOOR.

                                 MANAGER (O.S.)
                        Enter.

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Randy enters. The manager is at his desk.

                                 RANDY
                        That sign out front... What’s 
                        $14.25?

                                 MANAGER
                        Deli counter.

                                 RANDY
                        It pays that much more?

                                 MANAGER
                        That’s a very important, high-
                        traffic position.
                                 RANDY
                        So, like, up-front, working with 
                        customers?

                                 MANAGER
                        Prepping, slicing, serving...

           Randy looks tempted but reluctant.

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        You thinking about taking the 
                        challenge?

           INT. EMPLOYEE ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

           Randy slips into a DELI COAT. He tucks his hair into a 
           hairnet. Pulls a Shop Rite baseball cap over the hairnet. 

           He walks over to a mirror to see how he looks in his new 
           uniform. He feels a little silly and embarrassed.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Here ya go.

           He turns and sees WAYNE (40), the buzz-cut, beady-eyed DELI-
           DEPARTMENT MANAGER. Wayne hands him something. Randy looks at 
           the item in his hand, bothered.

                                 RANDY
                        I thought it was gonna say Randy.

           ANGLE ON item, a Shop Rite NAME TAG. The name on it is ROBIN.

                                 WAYNE
                             (shrugs)
                        Guess they got it off your W-4.

                                 RANDY
                        Do I really need to wear one?

                                 WAYNE
                        Are you going to be interacting 
                        with our valued customers?

                                 RANDY
                        I mean, yeah, but——

                                 WAYNE
                        Then yes.

                                 RANDY
                        Could they maybe re-do it?
           He gives Randy an unsympathetic shoulder pat.

                                 WAYNE
                        Just wear the darn thing.

           Wayne walks off. Randy pins the name tag to his apron. He 
           takes another look in the mirror, a sour expression on his 
           face.

           Randy heads toward a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN leading to the deli 
           counter. He pauses a moment, gathering himself like before a 
           wrestling match. He steps through. Showtime.

           INT. DELI COUNTER - DAY

           ABOUT 10 CUSTOMERS hover in front of the DELI COUNTER 
           clutching Take-A-Number tickets. 

           Randy, manning the counter, hands an OLD GUY in a WORLD WAR 
           II VETERAN baseball cap a packet of roast beef. The guy 
           shuffles off. Randy looks up at the Take-A-Number sign.

                                 RANDY
                        Seventeen.

           A woman (60s) steps forward holding a 17 and a SHOP RITE 
           CIRCULAR. She surveys the TURKEY-BREAST SELECTION in deli 
           case.

                                 WOMAN
                        The Hudson Acres, are they all on 
                        sale? 

           Randy looks into the deli case, clueless.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                             (holding up circular)
                        It’s really not clear.

           She hands the circular to Randy to take a look.

           RANDY’S POV: It says HUDSON ACRES TURKEY BREAST - $5.99/LB.

                                 OLD LADY
                        I’d rather the maple-glazed, but if 
                        it’s full price...

                                 RANDY
                        I’m not sure.
           Randy catches eyes with another customer, a BIG-HAIRED, SEMI-
           HOT PARTY CHICK in her forties. The kind of woman Randy might 
           hit on in a bar. He dodges the eye contact.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Hang on, let me...

           Randy picks up a phone behind the counter. 

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                             (into phone, over 
                              speakers)
                        Wayne, please come to the deli 
                        counter.

           He cringes a bit as his voice booms over the store speakers. 
           He hangs up and returns to the customer.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        It’ll just be a minute.

           The woman, nodding, looks into the deli case again.

                                 WOMAN
                        Which is the best smoked ham?

                                 RANDY
                             (no idea)
                        I mean, I guess it depends...

                                 WOMAN
                        I tried the Apple Valley Farms 
                        once, and it was very salty. Do you 
                        find that?

           Randy glances self-consciously at the party chick, 
           embarrassed.

           INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER

           ANGLE ON Take-A-Number sign. It says NOW SERVING: 46.

                                 RANDY
                        Forty-six.

           A WOMAN (35) in workout clothes steps forward with a 46.

                                 WORKOUT WOMAN
                        Could I get a half-pound of the 
                        pesto pasta salad?
                                 RANDY
                        Sure.
                             (grabs plastic container)
                        Pesto change-o.

           The woman smiles a little. This pleases Randy.

           Randy scoops pesto pasta salad into the container, carefully 
           measuring it with his eye. He puts the container onto the 
           scale. It reads 1.02 LB.

                                 WORKOUT WOMAN
                        Wow. You’re good.

                                 RANDY
                        Hey, that’s why I get the big 
                        bucks.

           She chuckles. Randy slaps a price tag on the container.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Can I get you anything else?

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        That’s it.

           He hands her the container.

                                 RANDY
                        You have yourself a nice day.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        I will. You, too.

           The woman heads off with a friendly smile. Randy’s spirits 
           are lifted by the exchange.

           INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER

           Randy looks up at the Take-A-Number sign. It says NOW 
           SERVING: 57.

                                 RANDY
                        O-57.

           A HOUSEWIFE-TYPE steps forward with the number.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Bingo!

           The housewife smiles, amused.
                                 HOUSEWIFE
                        What’s my prize?

                                 RANDY
                        Anything in the case, sweetheart.

                                 HOUSEWIFE
                        How about a pound of chopped liver 
                        and a half a pound of egg salad?

                                 RANDY
                        I think that can be arranged...

           He grabs a plastic container and throws it in the air, 
           catching it behind his back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VAN - EVENING

           Home from work, Randy drives through Paradise Oaks. His mood 
           is light. This changes as he comes to his trailer.

           RANDY’S POV: Sitting on his front step is Stephanie.

           He gets out of his van and walks toward her. They look at 
           each other in silence.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I think it’s my turn for a sorry.

           EXT. POINT PLEASANT BOARDWALK - LATER

           Randy and Stephanie walk along the boardwalk. It’s a charming 
           little Jersey-shore boardwalk/beach lined with skee-ball 
           games, ice-cream parlors, T-shirt shops etc. It’s a bit cold 
           and not very crowded, still out of season.

                                 RANDY
                        Remember when we used to come here?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Kinda. I was really young.

                                 RANDY
                        There used to be that funhouse.
                             (chuckles)
                        The Monster Motel...

           Stephanie doesn’t seem to recall.
                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        They had this cheesy-ass skeleton 
                        that popped out of a coffin. 
                             (makes hydraulic air-blast 
                              sound)
                        You’d get scared to death, every 
                        time. You loved it.

           Stephanie chuckles at the non-memory.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Whenever we’d get to that room, 
                        you’d hop on my foot and wrap your 
                        arms around my leg. I’d have to 
                        walk you through like that.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I totally don’t remember.

           He looks at her sweetly.

                                 RANDY
                        I do.

           EXT. BOARDWALK - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and Stephanie sit on a bench eating mint-chocolate chip 
           ice-cream cones.

                                 RANDY
                        I’m really proud of you, dealing 
                        with your stuff.
                             (beat)
                        It ain’t easy quitting.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I don’t feel like I’ve quit.

                                 RANDY
                        You have.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I struggle every day. I think about 
                        using all the time.

                                 RANDY
                        It’s a fight. When something’s in 
                        your blood...

           Randy can relate.
                                 STEPHANIE
                        I just don’t know if I can really 
                        do it.

                                 RANDY
                        So fake it. 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 RANDY
                        Pretend you’re fine and there’s 
                        nothing wrong.

           Stephanie looks at him, puzzled.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Lie to yourself long enough, you’ll 
                        start to believe it. You’ll be 
                        fine.

           Stephanie mulls this over.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I can’t tell if that’s great advice 
                        or horrible.

           Randy looks at her with a knowing smile. He shrugs.

           EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and Stephanie stand by her car. Randy’s van is parked a 
           few spots away. They look at each other in tentative silence, 
           neither one sure what to say.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Anyway...

           They hug, a little awkwardly.

                                 RANDY
                        Thanks for letting me talk to you.

                                 STEPHANIE
                             (nods)
                        No problem...

           She looks like she wants to say something more.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know if you’re interested, 
                        but...

                        I got, like, this medallion 
                        ceremony coming up. My six-month 
                        “cleaniversary”.

                                 RANDY
                        When? Definitely.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You totally don’t have to. I don’t 
                        even know why I——

                                 RANDY
                             (firm)
                        I’m there.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARADISE OAKS TRAILER PARK - PAY PHONE - DAY

           Randy stands at the pay phone, ringing phone to his ear. In 
           his hands is a well-worn DAY PLANNER open to a page of phone 
           numbers.

                                 RANDY
                        Yo, Nick. It’s Ram.

           INT. NORFOLK CIVIC AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Nick Volpe is on his cell in an EMPTY 3,000-SEAT AUDITORIUM. 
           A few other guys mill about in the background.

           (Intercut as necessary.)

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        How you doin’, man? What’s up?

                                 RANDY
                        Good, yeah, I’m fine. Listen...
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry, bro.

           Volpe grimace-groans.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t do it.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        Come on, man...
                             (announcer voice)

                                 RANDY
                        I’m done.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        I’m in the place right now.
                             (looks around)
                        It’s fuckin’... You’ll feel like 
                        you’re back at the Hoosier Dome.

                                 RANDY
                        I’m sorry. I’m done.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        What do you mean you’re done?

                                 RANDY
                        I mean I’m done. I’m retired.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        Randy The Ram can’t retire. He’s 
                        gonna be wrestling when he’s 98.

                                 RANDY
                        No, he ain’t. It’s over, Nick. I’m 
                        out.
                             (air of finality)
                        Time to move on.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLMARK STORE - DAY

           Randy is in the greeting-card aisle of a Hallmark store. He’s 
           browsing the CONGRATULATIONS cards. He grabs a card, checking 
           it out.

           RANDY’S POV: The front of the card says WAY 2 GO! in a big, 
           crazy font.

           Randy grabs the matching envelope. Glancing up, he notices 
           STUFFED ANIMALS all along the top of the greeting-card rack.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is driving. Riding shotgun is a HUGE PLUSH MOOSE.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CHEETAH’S - NIGHT

           Randy sits at the bar drinking a whiskey. He raises his glass 
           in the direction of someone across the room.

           RANDY’S POV: Cassidy, just finished giving a lapdance, sees 
           Randy looking her way.

           INT. BAR - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy and Cassidy sit at the bar together. The bartender 
           slides her a drink.

                                 RANDY
                        A toast...

           Randy raises his glass. He smiles.

                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                        To loved ones.

           They clink and drink.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Anybody in particular?

                                 RANDY
                        My daughter.

                                 CASSIDY
                             (surprised)
                        I didn’t know you had a daughter.

           Randy gives her a wry grin.

                                 RANDY
                             (quoting her)
                        We all got our personal lives. 
                        People we protect.

           She nods. Touché.

                                 CASSIDY
                        How old is she?

                                 RANDY

                                 CASSIDY
                        Oh, wow.
                                 RANDY
                        She’ll be 23 on November 26th.

           Cassidy isn’t quite sure why he added this.

                                 CASSIDY
                        You guys close?

                                 RANDY
                        We weren’t for a long time. But we 
                        been getting closer lately.

                                 CASSIDY
                        That’s great.

                                 RANDY
                        She’s in N.A. 

                                 CASSIDY
                        Oh, wow, okay...

                                 RANDY
                        That’s kind of her big thing right 
                        now.
                             (beat)
                        I’ve been helping her.

                                 CASSIDY
                        That’s great.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        We talk about her problems, have 
                        conversations about stuff...

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        Good for you.

                                 RANDY
                        Thanks. Yeah, it’s been good...

           He thinks of something. He raises his glass again.

                                 CASSIDY
                        What are we toasting now?

                                 RANDY
                        My new job. 
                             (beat)
                        At a major Tri-State supermarket 
                        chain.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Look at you. Congrats.
           She clinks his glass.

                                 RANDY
                        Thank you.

           He downs a gulp of whiskey.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Whaddaya say you help me celebrate? 
                             (beat)
                        Do you like shrimp?

           She throws him a look.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Randy...

                                 RANDY
                        What?

                                 CASSIDY
                        You know what.

                                 RANDY
                             (edgy smile)
                        Y’know, I’m starting to take this a 
                        little personal.

                                 D.J. (O.S.)
                        Give it up, y’all, for the lovely 
                        Devon!

           Randy and Cassidy look toward the stage, where DEVON is 
           getting off. 

                                 D.J. (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        And now, please welcome to the 
                        stage...

           A new song comes on. WARRANT - “CHERRY PIE”.

                                 CASSIDY
                             (to Randy, getting up)
                        Don’t go anywhere.

                                 D.J. (O.S.)
                        Cassidy!

           Cassidy takes the stage.

           ANGLE ON Randy watching her dance. She’s really putting on a 
           show. He looks around the club, taking in VARIOUS PATRONS 
           ogling her...
           ——A man near the stage sucks on a rum and coke through a 
           little red stirrer, his eyes locked on Cassidy’s breasts.

           ——A man smiles at Cassidy as he slips a dollar into her 
           garter.

           ——A man unconsciously licks his lips as Cassidy does a split.

           ——A pair of men watch hypnotized as Cassidy, twirling around 
           the pole, FLIPS HERSELF UPSIDE DOWN, slowly SLIDING DOWN THE 
           POLE with her legs spread wide.

           Randy’s mood visibly darkens.

           INT. BAR - SHORT TIME LATER

           Cassidy’s dance has just ended. She returns to the bar to 
           find Randy looking glum. Borderline surly.

                                 CASSIDY
                        What’s up?

                                 RANDY
                        Nothing.

           Randy stares off broodingly.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Something...

           Pause. He looks out at the crowd.

                                 RANDY
                        Guess I’m just a little jealous.

                                 CASSIDY
                        You’ve seen a hell of a lot more of 
                        me than they ever will.

                                 RANDY
                        Not of them. Of you.

           Cassidy seems a little confused.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I’d fuckin’ kill to pop a crowd 
                        again.

           Cassidy needs a moment to process this.

                                 CASSIDY
                        You’re jealous of me?
           She LAUGHS, finding this perversely amusing.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        You’d make a great stripper.
                             (beat)
                        You’re used to wearing spandex... 
                        You don’t mind dudes touching your 
                        thighs...

           Randy scowls, not amused.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        All you need’s a size 52 G-string, 
                        and you’re good to go.

           Randy takes out a $20. He holds it out to her.

                                 CASSIDY (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                                 RANDY
                        For a lapdance.

           He sticks the money in her hand. She flings it on the bar.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I’m not giving you a lapdance.

                                 RANDY
                        Why not? 
                             (mean)
                        You’re a stripper.

                                 CASSIDY
                        What’s your problem?

                                 RANDY
                        Nothing. I just want a lapdance.

                                 CASSIDY
                        No.

                                 RANDY
                        You’re refusing a customer?

                                 CASSIDY
                        Cut the shit, okay?

                                 RANDY
                        What, I’m not a customer? That’s 
                        what I am, right? I’m a customer, 
                        and you’re a stripper.
                                 CASSIDY
                        I think you should go.

                                 RANDY
                        I want a lapdance.

           He picks up the $20 off the bar, holding it out to her.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, shake your tits in my face.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Fuck off.

           He SLAMS the $20 down HARD.

                                 RANDY
                        I WANT A LAPDANCE!

           People turn and stare. The bouncer looks toward them, ready 
           to act if necessary. 

           Randy storms out of the club.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHOP RITE - DELI COUNTER - DAY

           Randy puts a block of swiss cheese onto the slicer. A few 
           strands of hair are sticking out of his hairnet. He stuffs 
           them back in and starts slicing.

                                 WAYNE (O.S.)
                             (disapproving tone)
                        Randy...

           Wayne drifts over, shaking his head and tsk-tsking. Randy 
           doesn’t know what he did wrong.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        We cannot be touching our hair 
                        while handling the food.

                                 RANDY
                        Oh. Shoot. Sorry.

                                 WAYNE
                             (condescending smile)
                        That’s all right. Go wash up.

           Randy goes over to the sink and washes his hands. He returns 
           to the counter.
                                 RANDY
                        Can I help who’s next?

           An OLD LADY steps forward.

                                 OLD LADY
                        A pound of German potato salad, 
                        please.

           Randy leans into the case to scoop potato salad.

                                 CUSTOMER (O.S.)
                        Excuse me...

           Randy looks up and sees a CUSTOMER looking at him smugly.

                                 CUSTOMER (CONT’D)
                        Do you think I could get my cheese?

           The customer throws a look toward the block of swiss over 
           Randy’s shoulder.

                                 RANDY
                        Oh, shoot. I apologize, sir.

           Randy hustles back to the slicer. He slices the cheese, 
           weighs it, wraps it up and hands it to the customer. 

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, sir. Have a nice day.

           The man huffily walks off with his cheese.

           Randy grabs a container from the case and starts scooping 
           potato salad for the old lady. He puts the container on the 
           scale. It reads 1.12 LB.

                                 OLD LADY
                        A little less.

           Randy scoops out a little and weighs it again. The scale 
           reads .94 LB.

                                 OLD LADY (CONT’D)
                        A little more.

           Randy puts a little more in. The scale reads 1.05.

                                 OLD LADY (CONT’D)
                        A little less.

           Randy, trying to contain his aggravation, takes some out. The 
           scale reads 1.00. The old lady nods in approval.
           Randy slaps a price sticker on the container and hands it 
           across the counter.

                                 RANDY
                        Thank you, ma’am. Have a nice day.

           Nodding, she shuffles off.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Can I help who’s next?

           A GUY (40s) steps forward.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Hi, could I get a...

           The guy, looking at Randy, does a surprised DOUBLE-TAKE.

                                 CUSTOMER (CONT’D)
                        Are you... 
                             (studying Randy’s face)
                        Randy The Ram?

           Randy is deeply embarrassed to be spotted here.

                                 CUSTOMER (CONT’D)
                        What are you——?

           He cuts himself off, not wanting to be disrespectful.

                                 CUSTOMER (CONT’D)
                        Nice to... I’m a big fan.

                                 RANDY
                             (awkward nod)
                        Thanks. Cool.

           A painful pause. Both of them just want this to be over.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Could I get a half pound of 
                        Virginia ham and a half pound of 
                        the Jarlsberg low-sodium?

           Randy reaches into the case and pulls out a ham. He brings it 
           over to the slicing machine and goes to work.

           ANGLE ON ham as Randy slices. There’s only a SMALL CHUNK 
           left. The chunk dwindles, getting smaller and smaller. The 
           meat separating Randy’s fingers from the blade grows thin.

           Randy watches as his thumb gets perilously close to the 
           blade. He stares at the blade, transfixed.
           He almost seems tempted.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - LATE NIGHT

           Randy, unable to sleep, sits shirtless on the couch, staring 
           glassy-eyed at the TV.

           ON TV:

           An NBA HIGHLIGHT CLIP of a FEROCIOUS DUNK. The crowd goes 
           wild. The player roars as he runs back up court, full of 
           testosterone and swagger.

           RANDY:

           Randy’s eyes drift downward to his stomach. He’s getting a 
           GUT. He gives his belly fat a little slap. He clutches it. 
           Kneads the flesh between his fingers.

           Randy grabs a pec in each hand. He hunches over, gathering up 
           as much chest flesh as possible in each palm, trying to form 
           a pair of tits. 

           He is disgusted with his body. With himself.

           His eyes drift to something on the floor in front of the 
           TV...

           RANDY’S POV: An ancient NINTENDO GAME SYSTEM. The game in the 
           console is WRESTLEJAM ‘88.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits on the floor playing WrestleJam ‘88 with edgy 
           intensity. Next to him is a bottle of red wine.

           ON TV:

           Randy The Ram climbs the ropes. He crashes down on The 
           Ayatollah with a back-flip moonsault.

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                        Motherfucker.
           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, standing near his bed, takes a big swig of wine, 
           polishing off the bottle. He pops a cassette into his 
           BOOMBOX. The tape is GUNS ‘N’ ROSES - USE YOUR ILLUSION II.

           Randy cranks up the volume and hits PLAY...

           GUNS ‘N’ ROSES - “GET IN THE RING”

           The song begins with the sound of a ROARING STADIUM CROWD. A 
           chant begins:

                                 CROWD (ON THE SONG)
                        Guns! And! Roses!... Guns! And! 
                        Roses!...

           Randy starts to prowl the floor, like a wrestling ring before 
           a match. He waves his arms, exhorting the crowd on the song 
           as if their cheers are for him.

                                 RANDY
                             (cups hand to ear)
                        What’s that?

           Randy works the crowd. He points at a fan in the back row. 
           Flexes theatrically. Bangs his head on pretend chairs.

           Randy grabs the top rope and gives it a hard shake. Loosening 
           up with some neck rolls and trunk twists, he heads to the 
           center of the ring.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                             (announcer-like)
                        Folks, we are ready to rumble...

           The song, which starts with a slow, bluesy guitar intro, 
           kicks in. FAST, RAGING HARD ROCK.

           Randy stares down his invisible opponent. The opponent SUCKER 
           PUNCHES him. Randy drops to the ground.

           Randy lies on the ground getting kicked and punched. He 
           knocks his opponent down with a leg sweep and pops up. 

           Randy hits his opponent with a flurry of backhand chops. 

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never seen such determination!

           Randy immobilizes his opponent in some sort of headlock.
                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Sleeper claw!

           Randy flips his opponent upside down, his head between his 
           knees, and drops him headfirst onto the bed/mat.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Piledriver!
                             (mimics roaring crowd)
                        Just listen to this place!

           Randy scoops up his opponent again and slams him to the mat 
           on his back with another fancy move.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Powerbomb!

           The song, meanwhile, reaches its frenzied, chant-like CHORUS:

                                 GUNS ‘N’ ROSES
                        Get in the ring! Get in the ring! 
                        Get in the ring! Get in the ring!

           Randy joins in, standing tall and pumping his fist.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NINTH INNING COLLECTIBLES - DAY

           A strip-mall sports-card/comic-book shop. Tacked to the wall 
           by the entrance are FLYERS for various events——card shows, 
           autograph signings, etc. 

           Behind the counter is Scott Brumberg, the promoter from way 
           back at the Wilmington, Delaware show. He’s wearing the same 
           Mets jersey as last time. 

           The door opens. He looks up.

                                 BRUMBERG
                        There he is... Randy The Retired.

           ANGLE ON Randy, bristling at the name. He heads over and 
           gives Brumberg a hello handshake.

                                 BRUMBERG (CONT’D)
                        How’s life? What brings ya by?

                                 RANDY
                        I was thinkin’...
                                 BRUMBERG
                        Uh-oh, that’s never good.

                                 RANDY
                        I was thinking about maybe doing a 
                        reffing gig.

           Brumberg chuckles cynically.

                                 BRUMBERG
                        What was that, two weeks?

                                 RANDY
                             (irked)
                        Just reffing. I’m retired.

                                 BRUMBERG
                        Suure, suuure...

                                 RANDY
                        This’d just be for fun. A little 
                        taste.

                                 BRUMBERG
                        Just a taste. Just a teeny taste of 
                        coke.

                                 RANDY
                             (walks off, pissed)
                        Fuck off. Forget it.

                                 BRUMBERG
                        Come on, man.

           Randy heads for the door.

                                 BRUMBERG (CONT’D)
                        Come back.

                                 RANDY
                        If you’re gonna be a fuckin’ 
                        asshole.

                                 BRUMBERG
                        C’mon, come back. 
                             (beat)
                        I was just playin’.

           Randy reluctantly slows.

           Brumberg reaches down and grabs out a beat-up old SPIRAL 
           NOTEBOOK with event flyers sticking out. He holds it up to 
           Randy.
                                 BRUMBERG (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure we got something.

           Randy looks at it, tempted. He heads back to the counter. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BRIDGEPORT NORTH HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LATER

           Randy is slipping into a REFEREE UNIFORM. He is approached by 
           BOOKER D (30s), a big black guy in FULL PIMP REGALIA. Though 
           not a pro like Randy, he’s upper-tier indie circuit.

                                 BOOKER D
                        How you doin’, ref?

                                 RANDY
                        Hey, ‘sup, bro?

           They hug hello.

                                 BOOKER D
                        Me and McPride was going over 
                        spots, and we got this dope idea 
                        how to work you in.

                                 RANDY
                        Ah, I really ain’t looking to mix 
                        it up tonight.

                                 BOOKER D
                        You’re gonna love this, check this 
                        out. So McPride——

                                 RANDY
                        That’s okay. 
                             (beat)
                        You guys do your thing.

           Booker D looks at him, surprised and puzzled.

           INT. BRIDGEPORT NORTH H.S. - GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy stands in the middle of the ring in his ref uniform. 
           Next to him is an ANNOUNCER. On the wall hangs a banner that 
           says CAPW - CONNECTICUT ALL-PRO WRESTLING. 

           RANDY’S POV: Pimp cup in hand, Booker D struts toward the 
           ring to CURTIS MAYFIELD’S “SUPERFLY”. On his arm is his 
           “manager”, the bodacious FOXXY D. The crowd BOOS.
           Booker D climbs into the ring. He removes his fur-lined cape 
           and fedora and hands them to Foxxy D. He’s wearing bright-
           yellow briefs that say BOOKER D across the ass.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        And his opponent...

           The crowd looks to the curtain as a new song comes on. HOUSE 
           OF PAIN’S “JUMP AROUND”.

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        Weighing in at 210 pounds, from 
                        Hartford, Connecticut... 
                             (beat)
                        Shawn McPriiide!

           ANGLE ON Randy’s face as he watches McPride enter the gym to 
           loud cheers. Cheers that are normally for him.

           Stocky sparkplug SHAWN MCPRIDE, an upper-tier indie guy, 
           climbs into the ring. 

           He and Booker D warily circle each other, feeling each other 
           our. Booker D hits McPride in the face. It’s on.

           Booker D hits McPride with a flurry of punches. McPride 
           stands there absorbing the blows like they have no effect. He 
           throws Booker D a look that says “That all you got, chump?”

           The crowd is eating it up.

                                 CROWD  (O.S.)
                        Shawn Mc-Pride! Shawn Mc-Pride!...

           ANGLE ON Randy off to the side, irrelevant to the action.

           Booker D throws McPride into the ropes. He tries to 
           clothesline him on the bounce-back, but McPride ducks his 
           outstretched forearm. McPride bounces off the opposite ropes 
           and hits Booker D with a flying boot to the gut. 

           ANGLE ON Randy, watching, itchy to get involved.

           McPride falls on top of Booker D for the pin. Randy smacks 
           the mat, counting.

                                 RANDY
                        One!... Two!...

           Booker D kicks out. McPride picks up Booker D. He hits him 
           with a CHEST CHOP, sending him stumbling backwards into the 
           ropes. McPride hammers him with a forearm. 
           Booker D flips over the rope, crashing headfirst onto the 
           floor outside the ring. McPride hops out of the ring. Randy 
           follows.

           OUTSIDE THE RING:

           McPride lifts Booker D and hits him with an elbow to the 
           face. Booker D stumbles backwards toward the BLEACHERS. 

           McPride drags Booker D up to the top row. Fans scramble to 
           clear a path. McPride punches Booker D a few times then flips 
           him over his shoulder, SLAMMING HIM hard onto his back. 
           Booker D TUMBLES DOWN THE BLEACHERS.

           McPride throws Booker D back into the ring. Booker D rolls to 
           a stop in the center of the mat. McPride drops a knee onto 
           Booker D’s head.

           Booker D pulls a can of MACE out of his boot and SPRAYS 
           MCPRIDE IN THE FACE. McPride howls in agony. Booker D 
           scurries off.

           McPride, clutching his blinded eyes, staggers to his feet and 
           stumbles toward Randy.

                                 MCPRIDE
                        Did you see that?! He maced me!

                                 RANDY
                        I didn’t see it!

                                 MCPRIDE
                        You must be blinder than me!

           The crowd LAUGHS at the line. 

           Meanwhile, Booker D is sneaking up behind McPride with a 
           FOLDING CHAIR.

                                 MCPRIDE (CONT’D)
                             (to Randy, oblivious to 
                              Booker D behind him)
                        What kinda ref are you? 
                             (angrily shoves Randy)
                        You stink!

           Randy gives McPride a HARD SHOVE BACK——at the EXACT MOMENT 
           Booker D is bringing the chair down. The chair misses 
           McPride, hitting Randy RIGHT IN THE FACE. 

           Randy FLIES BACKWARDS, tumbling under the ropes, onto the 
           HARD FLOOR outside the ring.
           Booker D, taking advantage of the ref-less ring, MACES 
           MCPRIDE AGAIN. He starts beating him senseless.

           Randy, who doesn’t see the macing, staggers to his feet and 
           climbs back into the ring, where Booker D is pinning McPride. 
           Randy drops to his knees for a count.

                                 RANDY
                        One!... Two... THREE!

           Ding-ding-ding! The match is over. 

           Booker D raises his arms in victory. McPride is wild with 
           outrage.

           RANDY’S POV: The pro-McPride crowd hurls boos and expletives 
           and plastic cups at the ring.

           Randy grins slightly to himself. He got a little taste.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BOYS’ LOCKER ROOM - SHOWER AREA - POST-MATCH

           Randy, Booker D, and McPride are SHOWERING in the open shower 
           area. They’re on a post-match high.

                                 BOOKER D
                        What a screwjob.

                                 MCPRIDE
                        Crowd was pissed.

           McPride gives Randy a “We’re not worthy” bow of respect.

                                 MCPRIDE (CONT’D)
                        The master...

                                 BOOKER D
                             (wags finger at Randy)
                        Just reffing, my ass. I knew you’d 
                        get in there.

           Randy gives him a playful “Hey, what can I say?” shrug.

                                 MCPRIDE
                        Y’all feel like grabbing a drink?

           McPride and Booker D both look toward Randy. He’s the one 
           they’re interested in hanging with.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. HOLIDAY INN BRIDGEPORT - HOTEL BAR - LATER

           A hotel bar, lively and hopping with a Friday-night crowd. 
           Randy sits at the bar, holding court with Booker D and 
           McPride. They’re all well on their way to being drunk.

                                 RANDY
                             (mildly shocked)
                        You never heard the shit-pit story?

                         BOOKER D
                                                         MCPRIDE
           Tell it!
                                              Tell me!

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        1990. Rage In The Cage II, 
                        Nashville Coliseum. I’m in the 
                        locker room shaving when behind me 
                        one of the stall doors opens. I 
                        turn and there’s Chris Columbo on 
                        the can taking a dump. He goes, 
                        “This is for Petrov”, and he wipes 
                        his ass, takes the shit-covered 
                        toilet paper and rubs it in his 
                        armpit. Five minutes later, he’s in 
                        the ring with Petrov in a headlock, 
                        fuckin’ Petrov stuck there in CC’s 
                        pit lookin’ like he’s gonna puke.

           McPride and Booker D roar with grossed-out delight.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Fuckin’ classic...

           Booker D spots something intriguing by the bar entrance.

                                 BOOKER D
                        Uh-oh...

           Randy and McPride follow his eyes there.

           RANDY’S POV: TWO WOMEN——late 30s, frosted hair, tight denim 
           miniskirts——just walked in the bar. He catches the twosome 
           stealing a glance in their direction.

                                 BOOKER D (CONT’D)
                             (elbows Randy)
                        Ring rats, twelve o’clock.

           Randy seems to agree with Booker D’s assessment. 
           INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER

           MUSIC: BLACK CROWES - “HARD TO HANDLE”

           The wrestlers are dancing with the women, MELISSA and ALYSSA, 
           on the bar’s dance floor. Melissa is sandwiched between 
           Booker D and McPride, grinding and shaking her ass for them 
           like a 19-year-old spring breaker.

           Alyssa is paired off with Randy, rubbing up against him as 
           she dances. She looks at him with a coy smile.

                                 ALYSSA
                        I know who you are...

           Alyssa slowly runs her hands up Randy’s sides.

                                 ALYSSA (CONT’D)
                        My brother used to have your poster 
                        on his door.

           Randy seems pleased by this. She pulls him in for a KISS. 
           They start MAKING OUT. Sloppy, wet, lots of tongue. 

           She pulls back and looks at him, eager for a verdict.

                                 RANDY
                        Thank you. I enjoyed that.

           Looking into Randy’s eyes, she clacks her tongue ring. Runs 
           it suggestively along her teeth.

                                 ALYSSA
                        I live pretty close to here.

           Randy gives her a drunken, heavy-lidded grin.

                                                                CUT TO:

           BLACK SCREEN.

           RANDY’S POV: His eyes slowly open. Staring down at him from a 
           cheap stucco ceiling is a poster of a HUNKY, SHIRTLESS 
           FIREMAN with a pair of suspenders stretched across his oiled-
           up six pack. Across the bottom it says FIVE-ALARM FIRE.

           Randy looks around, disoriented. He is NAKED, in bed, in a 
           STRANGE BEDROOM. His clothes lie on the floor next to a large 
           glass bong.
           INT. KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, wearing only a pair of bikini briefs, stumbles into a 
           KITCHEN. A WOMAN (23) in a Tweety Bird nightshirt is pouring 
           herself a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios. She looks up at Randy 
           with a casual head-nod.

                                 WOMAN
                        Wassup. Alyssa’s in the shower.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy emerges from Alyssa’s building in last night’s clothes, 
           squinting at the blinding sunlight.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy enters his trailer, chuckling self-amusedly. He tosses 
           his keys on the table. 

           His cheery mood suddenly FADES. A look of DISMAY comes over 
           his face.

           RANDY’S POV: On the table is the stuffed moose, gift-wrapped. 
           Taped to it is the card.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STEPHANIE’S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy stands at Stephanie’s door with the moose under his 
           arm. He rings the bell. Stephanie’s “friend” answers the 
           door. She looks at Randy edgily.

                                 RANDY
                        Is she...?

           She glances over her shoulder.

           INT. STEPHANIE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy enters the house to find Stephanie curled up on the 
           living-room couch watching TV.

                                 RANDY
                        I’m so sorry. I totally, 
                        completely...
           He looks at her guiltily.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        It’s fine. I’m not upset.

           Randy is thrown. She really doesn’t seem upset.

                                 RANDY
                        I missed your ceremony. I wasn’t 
                        there.

                                 STEPHANIE
                             (nonchalant shrug)
                        You can’t miss what you never had.

           Randy is privately devastated. He looks at the large wrapped 
           gift under his arm.

                                 RANDY
                        This is for you.

           He hands her the gift.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Thanks.

                                 RANDY
                        You’re welcome.

           Randy waits for her to open it.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        You can open it now if you want. Or 
                        not. Whatever you like...

           She puts it down. She stares blankly at the TV. She seems a 
           little out-of-sorts.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Not really.

           She starts flipping channels.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                             (eyes on TV, flipping)
                        I relapsed.

                                 RANDY
                        When?
                                 STEPHANIE
                        ‘Bout a week ago.

           Randy looks distraught——and full of guilt.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. You’re not the reason.

                                 RANDY
                        Yeah, I am.

           She looks up at him.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You give yourself way too much 
                        credit.

           Randy doesn’t know what to say.

                                 RANDY
                        What are you gonna do?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What I should do is get the fuck to 
                        rehab.

                                 RANDY
                        But...

                                 STEPHANIE
                        But $4,200.

           Randy is taken aback by the figure.

                                 RANDY
                        It’s that much?

           She nods. Yup.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I could help.

           Stephanie chuckles.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You can’t even afford a phone.

                                 RANDY
                        I could figure something out.
                                 STEPHANIE
                             (super-sarcastic)
                        That’s great! I’m saved! Thank you 
                        so much!

                                 RANDY
                        C’mon, Stephanie.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Make the check out to Horizon House 
                        Drug And Alco——

                                 RANDY
                        Stephanie...

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What?

           Randy is silent.

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHOP RITE - MANAGER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Randy enters the manager’s office.

                                 MANAGER
                        Yes?

                                 RANDY
                        I was just wondering if it was 
                        possible to... if maybe I could get 
                        an advance.

                                 MANAGER
                        How much of an advance?

                                 RANDY
                        Like maybe three months?

           The manager gives him a patronizing smile.

                                 MANAGER
                        I don’t think so.

           INT. SHOP RITE - DELI COUNTER - LATER

           ANGLE ON Take-A-Number sign. It reads NOW SERVING: 54
           A crowd of AGGRAVATED CUSTOMERS wait at the counter. A FAT 
           GUY in a motorized cart clutching a 71 throws a fellow 
           customer a “Do you believe these morons?” eye roll. 

           Behind the counter are Randy and two other DELI WORKERS. 
           Randy is putting a block of Havarti onto the slicer. He moves 
           a bit lackadaisically. Wayne, noticing, heads over.

                                 WAYNE
                             (two quick claps)
                        C’mon, let’s pick it up. Rush hour.

           Wayne walks off. Randy adjusts the machine’s setting and 
           begins to slice. He isn’t moving much faster.

                    CUSTOMER #1 (O.S.)
                                                   CUSTOMER #2 (O.S.)
           While we’re young...
                                              Any year now...

           Randy keeps right on slicing at his unhurried pace. He gets 
           in a nice, meditative groove. 

           Slice... slice... slice... slice... slice...

           He WINCES, his body JERKING BACKWARDS. He looks down at his 
           hand. He’s CUT HIS THUMB. Badly.

           Randy stares at the DEEP GASH, watching as blood pulses out 
           in crimson surges. He smiles strangely at it.

           He raises the thumb to his face, TASTING THE BLOOD with his 
           tongue. It tastes familiar and good. An old friend.

           A customer, seeing this, GASPS. A commotion quickly spreads. 

                                 WAYNE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Randy!

           Randy turns and sees a shocked Wayne rushing toward him. 
           Wayne takes Randy’s arm and tries to lead him into the back.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                             (conscious of customers 
                              watching)
                        Let’s get that patched up.

           Randy roughly shoves him away. Wayne stumbles backwards.

                                 WAYNE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Somebody call security.

           Randy, turning toward the onlookers, raises his thumb to his 
           face. He dramatically smears the BLOOD ACROSS HIS MOUTH.
           Customers GASP. A few women SHRIEK.

           Randy drags the gash across his cheek. He SMEARS A LINE OF IT 
           under each eye like WARPAINT.

                                 RANDY
                             (strikes wrestling pose)
                        Let’s get it onnn!

                                 WAYNE (O.S.)
                        Security!

           Randy ROARS at Wayne. Wayne JUMPS BACK, frightened.

           Randy rumbles out of the deli area laughing.

           SUPERMARKET AISLE:

           Randy dashes down an aisle. He dodges a WOMAN PUSHING A 
           SHOPPING CART, purposely “over-dodging” her so he CRASHES 
           INTO THE SHELVES and sends stuff flying. He dodges ANOTHER 
           SHOPPER, purposely and dramatically crashing into the shelves 
           again.

           FRONT REGISTER AREA:

           Randy charges past the cashiers, out of the supermarket.

           INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy sits in the van in a PARKING LOT (not the Shop Rite 
           one). He gazes at himself in the rear-view mirror, dried 
           blood caked on his face. He likes how it looks.

           He looks at the empty space on the dashboard where the Randy 
           The Ram action figure used to be.

           A thought is taking shape in his head.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NICK VOLPE’S CAR - LATER

           Nick Volpe is driving in his Lincoln Navigator SUV. His 
           cellphone rings. He picks up.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        Hello?
           EXT. PARADISE OAKS TRAILER PARK - PAY PHONE - CONTINUOUS

           Randy is on the pay phone.

                                 RANDY
                        $4,200.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - DAY

           Randy is digging through a pile of clothes in a closet. He 
           pulls out his wrestling tights.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - BATHROOM - LATER

           Randy is SHAVING HIS CHEST. The hair has grown in since he 
           last wrestled.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - LATER

           Randy stands in just a pair of bikini briefs. In his hands is 
           a product called TAN IN A CAN. He gives the can a good shake 
           and starts spraying his torso.

           INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - BATHROOM - LATER

           Randy, wearing rubber gloves and a towel around his neck, 
           combs peroxide through his hair.

           INT. VAN - EVENING

           A freshly bleached and tanned Randy is driving. On the 
           passenger seat is his travel duffel bag.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHEETAH’S - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy enters the club. He spots Cassidy at the bar casually 
           chatting with the bartender. He heads over.

                                 RANDY
                        Hey...
           She looks at him coldly. The bartender heads off, giving them 
           their privacy.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry I was such an asshole.

           She shrugs.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Shit happens.

                                 RANDY
                        I got upset. I shouldn’t’ve... I 
                        didn’t mean any of that.

           She nods silently.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        I’m going away this weekend.
                             (beat)
                        I doing a match.

                                 CASSIDY
                        You’re wrestling?

           Randy nods.

                                 RANDY
                        For my daughter. 
                             (beat)
                        She relapsed.

                                 CASSIDY
                             (sincere)
                        I’m sorry to hear that.

                                 RANDY
                        She needs money. For rehab.

                                 CASSIDY
                        What about your...?

           She glances at his chest.

                                 RANDY
                        I’ll be fine.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I thought the doctor...

                                 RANDY
                        They always say that. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                        “You go back in there with that 
                        knee, you’re gonna get permanent 
                        blah-blah-blah...”

                                 CASSIDY
                        A heart, that’s not a knee.

                                 RANDY
                        If I listened to doctors every time 
                        I got banged up, I wouldn’t have 
                        had a career.

                                 CASSIDY
                        Yeah, but a heart...

                                 RANDY
                        I know what I’m doing. I’ve done 
                        this a million times.

                                 CASSIDY
                        There’s gotta be some other way to 
                        get money.

                                 RANDY
                        Why don’t you come watch? 

                                 CASSIDY
                        That’s okay.

                                 RANDY
                        Have you ever been to Virginia?

                                 CASSIDY
                        Randy, I really don’t think——

                                 RANDY
                        Bring your kid. You could make a 
                        weekend of it. 

                                 CASSIDY
                        Randy...

                                 RANDY
                        I’m sure they got, like, waterparks 
                        and shit down there.

           She looks at him with sympathy.

                                 CASSIDY
                        I’m sorry.

           He shrugs “casually”.
                                 RANDY
                        Hey, that’s cool, your loss...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VAN - NIGHT

           Randy is driving south on I-95.

           INT. CASSIDY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Cassidy comes home from work to find her SON (9) on the floor 
           playing with the Randy The Ram doll. He has the doll climb up 
           the couch’s armrest. The doll takes a flying leap off the 
           couch onto a robot laid out on the floor below. The son makes 
           an EXPLOSION SOUND as Randy slams down on his foe.

           EXT. I-95 - SIDE OF THE ROAD - MIDNIGHT

           The van is pulled over on the side of the interstate.

           INT. BACK OF VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Randy is catching a nap as 18-wheelers barrel past.

           INT. VAN - NEXT MORNING

           Randy is driving along I-64. A sign reads NORFOLK - THIS 
           EXIT. He gets off. 

           INT. NORFOLK CIVIC AUDITORIUM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy stands at a CHECK-IN TABLE signing an injury-release 
           form. The guy manning the table hands him a Fanfest T-shirt.

           Randy looks around. DOZENS OF FANS mill about. Some steal 
           glances at him. He basks in the scene.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           A bunch of WRESTLERS, mostly men in their 50s, mill about. 
           They chat amiably as they get dressed, catching up.

           Randy puts his duffel bag down on a bench. Across the room, 
           he spots a huge, dark-skinned man of indeterminate ethnicity.
           Randy heads over. The man is wearing tan khakis and a polo 
           shirt with a BOB ZAYID PONTIAC logo embroidered on the right 
           breast. From his appearance, we sense he’s made a more 
           successful transition to post-wrestling life than most of the 
           others in the room. This is THE AYATOLLAH.

                                 RANDY
                        What’s up, Bob?

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        Hey, Ram. What’s shakin’?

           They shake hands, more cordial than chummy.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH (CONT’D)
                        You ready to do this? 

                                 RANDY
                        I believe so.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        Should be a hoot. 
                             (chuckles)
                        Though the wife ain’t too happy. 
                        “You’re doing what?” She thinks I’m 
                        going off the top rope or 
                        something.

           Randy bristles at his flip attitude.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH (CONT’D)
                        So how ya been?

                                 RANDY
                        I’m all right.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        Cool. Yeah, things are good with 
                        me. Business is rockin’. Just 
                        opened up a third dealership.

                                 RANDY
                             (not very interested)
                        Wow...

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        Two in Columbus, one in Dayton.
                             (beat)
                        If you’re ever in Ohio, drop by. 
                        I’ll make you a nice deal on a G6.

           Randy chuckles politely.
                                 RANDY
                        When you get settled in, we should 
                        over things.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        What things?

                                 RANDY
                        The match. Y’know, hash it out.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                             (dismissive wave)
                        Ah, we can wing it.

                                 RANDY
                        We should know the basic spots.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        It’ll be fine.

           He can see Randy is not happy with this plan.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH (CONT’D)
                        How’s this: I’m the heel, you’re 
                        the face. 
                             (chuckles)
                        Done.

           Randy walks off, annoyed. He heads back to where he put his 
           duffel bag.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Yo, Randy.

           Randy looks toward the locker-room door. Sticking his head in 
           is Nick Volpe.

                                 NICK VOLPE
                        There’s some chick out here to see 
                        you.

                                 RANDY
                        Who?

           Volpe gives him a “beats me” shrug and disappears.

           INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Randy steps out of the locker room.

           RANDY’S POV: Standing there is Cassidy and her son. The son 
           is wearing a T-shirt of some current wrestling star.
           He looks at Cassidy, touched.

                                 RANDY
                        You came.

           She nods yup. Randy looks at her son.

                                 CASSIDY
                        This is Daniel.

           Randy shakes the kid’s hand.

                                 RANDY
                        Pleased to meet you, Daniel.

           Daniel smiles shyly at the giant.

                                 CASSIDY
                        He’s a big wrestling fan.

                                 RANDY
                        All right. Good man.

           Randy holds up a hand for a high-five. Daniel high-fives him.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Ever been to a show?

           Daniel shakes his head no.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                             (gleam in his eye)
                        You’re gonna see one tonight.

           A slightly NERVOUS LOOK comes over Cassidy’s face. Randy 
           notices.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Relax. I know what I’m doing.
                             (sly grin)
                        Besides...

           Randy covers Daniel’s ears.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                             (to Cassidy, with a wink)
                        It ain’t like it’s real.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy, sitting on the bench in just a jock strap, tapes up 
           his knees. He is quiet, intense. Reflective.

           He slips on his tights. Pops a Vicodin and washes it down 
           with some beer.

           EXT. HALLWAY - SHORT TIME LATER

           Randy is at a PAY PHONE in an empty hallway, ringing phone 
           cradled to his ear.

                                 STEPHANIE’S VOICE
                        This is Stephanie, you know what to 
                        do.
                             (answering machine BEEP)

                                 RANDY
                        Hey. It’s me. Your dad.
                             (beat)
                        I just wanted to say... I’m sorry I 
                        wasn’t better. 
                             (beat)
                        I love you.
                             (beat)
                        I’m gonna fix everything. I 
                        promise.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AUDITORIUM - SHORT TIME LATER

           The announcer stands in the ring. Boos rain down from the 
           crowd of 300 as ARABIC MUSIC blasts on the speakers.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        From the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
                        weighing in at 292 pounds... The 
                        Tehran Terror, the Beast Of The 
                        Middle East...
                             (beat)
                        The Ayaaa-tooo-laaaaaah!

           The Ayatollah bursts through the curtain waving a big IRANIAN 
           FLAG. Enraged fans curse and give him the finger.

                                                         FAN #2
                          FAN #1
           Suck a goat dick!
                                              Camelfucker!
           The Ayatollah waves his arms, egging them on. For all his 
           locker-room nonchalance, he knows how to work a crowd.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Randy sits on the bench, hunched over in quiet reflection.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                             (from auditorium)
                        And his opponent...

           Through the wall, we hear a familiar song come over the 
           auditorium speakers.

           AC/DC: “IF YOU WANT BLOOD (YOU GOT IT)”

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           TRACKING SHOT of Randy as he walks through the room, passing 
           VARIOUS WRESTLERS along the way. 

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        From Hackensack, New Jersey, 
                        weighing in at 246 pounds... 

           The wrestlers pat Randy on the back, offering words of luck.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        A true wrestling immortal... 

           Randy slows at the entrance curtain.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        One of the greatest of all time... 
                        Randy “The Ram” Robinnnnsonnnnn!

           INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Randy bursts through to HUGE CHEERS.

           INT. COMMENTATORS’ TABLE - CONTINUOUS

           Seated at a ringside table are the match’s COMMENTATORS, a 
           pair of wannabe Marv Alberts in their 20s. A sign taped to 
           the table reads MID-ATLANTIC WRESTLING NETWORK. Next to the 
           table is a VIDEOCAMERA on a tripod.

                                 COMMENTATOR #1
                        There he is, folks! Randy The Ram!
           Randy raises a set of ram’s horns high in the air. Fans do 
           the same in tribute.

                                 COMMENTATOR #2
                        History about to be made here at 
                        the Norfolk Civic Auditorium.

           Randy takes a long lap around the ring, ramming chair after 
           chair. The fans love him. He loves them.

                                 COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It was 20 years ago today.

           Randy climbs into the ring, where The Ayatollah awaits.

           The cheers continue. Loving, appreciative, sustained cheers. 
           Randy stands there soaking it in. It finally dies down.

           He grabs the mike from the announcer. Looks around at the 
           crowd.

                                 RANDY
                        I just got one thing to say to you 
                        people...

           He takes a long, dramatic pause.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           The crowd cheers loudly. He puts his hand over his heart.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           MORE CHEERS. The cheers die down. 

           All eyes are on Randy, who stands there silently in the 
           middle of the ring. He is pensive, soulful. Finally, he 
           speaks:

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        You take your lumps and bruises in 
                        this game. But you know what? It’s 
                        all worth it. Because of you guys. 
                             (beat)
                        Your cheers keep me young. They 
                        make me feel alive. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        No matter how crappy I’m feeling, 
                        no matter how bad my knee’s 
                        twisted, how sprained up my neck 
                        is, how bruised my ribs are, when 
                        I’m in that ring doing my thing for 
                        you, and you’re out there doing 
                        your thing for me, I’m feeling no 
                        pain.
                             (beat)
                        There ain’t no anaesthesia like a 
                        cheering crowd.

           CHEERS from the crowd. Randy takes another pause.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        In 1982, the year I wrestled my 
                        first professional match, I was six-
                        foot-one. By 1993, I was five-foot-
                        eleven. Seven back surgeries in 11 
                        years knocked two full inches off 
                        my height. But let me tell you 
                        something, broskis. I may be down 
                        to five-eleven, but performing in 
                        front of you people has always made 
                        me feel 10 feet tall. And that’s 
                        the way it’s always gonna be. 
                             (beat)
                        Forever.

           He lowers the mike, finished. MORE CHEERS, the loudest yet. 
           Randy stands there nodding appreciatively at the crowd. 

           As he nods, The Ayatollah SNEAKS UP BEHIND HIM with a folding 
           chair. The fans scream, trying to warn Randy. The Ayatollah 
           SMASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD. Randy goes down. 

           The match is on.

           The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes. 
           Randy bounces back toward The Ayatollah, who lazily puts up 
           an elbow for Randy to run into. Randy practically has to lead 
           his face to the elbow. Hitting the mat, Randy pops back up 
           and grabs The Ayatollah.

           The Ayatollah, phoning it in, throws Randy into the ropes 
           again. This time, The Ayatollah has a raised knee waiting for 
           Randy. Randy runs into it, doing his best to sell the shot.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                             (under breath)
                        You’re working pretty light.
           Randy gets up and grabs The Ayatollah’s arms. With a nifty 
           move, he flips The Ayatollah over his shoulder, slamming him 
           hard into the mat. Randy falls on top of him, pressing his 
           face into the canvas.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        Jesus... relax.

           Randy flips The Ayatollah over onto his back, pinning his 
           shoulder blades. The REF swoops in for a count.

                                 REFEREE
                        One! Two!...

           The Ayatollah KICKS OUT. They both get up. The Ayatollah jogs 
           toward the ropes. He bounces off. Randy braces for something 
           good, but all he gets is a feeble CHEST SLAP. Randy grabs The 
           Ayatollah and puts him in a headlock.

                                 RANDY
                        Anytime you wanna join in.

           Randy scoops up The Ayatollah and drops him over his knee 
           with a BACKBREAKER. The Ayatollah grimaces in pain as he hits 
           the mat. Before he has a chance to get up, Randy hits him 
           with a FLYING ELBOW DROP. 

           The Ayatollah gets up. He is pissed.

           Randy goes for a dropkick, but The Ayatollah catches his 
           ankles in midair. He JERKS UPWARD on Randy’s legs, sending 
           Randy CRASHING TO THE MAT on the back of his head. The 
           Ayatollah falls on his throat with his knee. He grinds 
           Randy’s face into the canvas as Randy did to him.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        That better?

                                 RANDY
                        Yes.

           The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes. 
           Randy bounces back, flinging himself sideways at The 
           Ayatollah. The Ayatollah catches him in mid-air, cradling him 
           in his arms. The Ayatollah drops Randy onto his bent knee. 
           Randy falls to the canvas, clutching his side in pain. The 
           Ayatollah falls on top of him.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                             (under breath)
                        I forgot how much fun this is.

           The ref swoops in for a count.
                                 REFEREE
                        One!... Two!...

           Randy KICKS OUT. As Randy “recovers”, The Ayatollah jumps out 
           of the ring. He grabs a folding chair.

           The Ayatollah props up the chair in a corner. He picks Randy 
           off the mat and flings him at it. Randy VAULTS OVER IT, 
           sailing through the ropes and OUT OF THE RING. He hits the 
           concrete floor, crashing against the metal barricade.

           IN THE CROWD:

           Cassidy winces, feeling Randy’s pain. Daniel is loving it.

           THE RING:

           The Ayatollah hops out of the ring. He stands over Randy, 
           kicking him repeatedly. He grabs his Iranian flag, waving it 
           tauntingly at the crowd.

                                              Fat piece of shit!

           The Ayatollah looks down at Randy.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        Pathetic! 
                             (”spits” on Randy)
                        Pitiful godless infidel!

           IN THE CROWD:

           Boos rain down on The Ayatollah. An 11-YEAR-OLD in the front 
           row gives him the finger.

           The kid’s FATHER gives his son a proud high-five.

           JUST OUTSIDE RING:

           The Ayatollah takes the butt end of the flag pole and JABS IT 
           into Randy’s side. Randy grimaces in pain. 

           The Ayatollah unties the flag from its pole and WRAPS IT 
           around Randy’s neck.
           COMMENTATORS’ TABLE:

           The two commentators look on in outraged shock.

                        The Ram being choked!

           JUST OUTSIDE RING:

           The Ayatollah jerks upward on the flag, lifting Randy off the 
           mat by his neck. Randy thrashes around, struggling to 
           breathe.

           The ref tries to break up the choke, but The Ayatollah 
           casually SHOVES HIM. The ref flies over the barricade.

                        He just did!

           JUST OUTSIDE RING:

           The Ayatollah releases Randy from the choke. Randy crumples 
           to the ground, gasping for air. The Ayatollah picks up him by 
           his hair and throws him back in the ring. 

           THE RING:

           The Ayatollah grabs the folding chair from the corner. He 
           SMASHES RANDY OVER THE HEAD with it. Randy’s forehead is 
           BLEEDING. The Ayatollah hits him again, taking aim at the 
           forehead cut. More blood. Randy falls limply to the mat.

           Randy’s heart is BEATING FAST.

           The Ayatollah takes a few steps back. He charges toward 
           Randy, kicking up his legs as he goes airborne.

           THE RING:

           At the last possible second, Randy ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY. The 
           Ayatollah slams HARD INTO THE MAT, ass-first.

                                 COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)
                        Oh, my!

           The Ayatollah squirms on the mat. Randy, lying next to him, 
           reaches for the folding chair, but The Ayatollah beats him to 
           it. Barely able to lift his head, he SMASHES RANDY IN THE 
           FACE with it. Randy snatches the chair out of The Ayatollah’s 
           hands and does the same right back.

                                 COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        They’re fighting on their backs!

                        Incredible!

           The crowd noise has reached a fever pitch. The Ayatollah 
           rolls on top of Randy, punching him repeatedly.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                             (between punches, under 
                              breath)
                        Wanna take it home?

                                 RANDY
                        It’s time.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        All you, bro. Lead on...

           Randy, giving him a discrete, appreciative nod, flips The 
           Ayatollah over. Randy struggles to his feet. He picks up The 
           Ayatollah and levels him with a dropkick.

                             (a third one)
                        Another!

           Randy’s heart is POUNDING out of his chest. He picks up The 
           Ayatollah and BODYSLAMS him.

                                 COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Bodyslam!
           Randy stands over his laid-out opponent. A chant rises from 
           the crowd:

                                 CROWD (O.S.)
                        Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...

           Randy falls on top of The Ayatollah, putting him in a rest-
           move headlock. 

                                 CROWD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...

                                 COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.)
                        Just listen to this crowd!

           The Ayatollah can hear how labored Randy’s breathing is.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        We don’t need the big finish.

           Randy searches out Cassidy in the crowd. He finds her. She 
           looks worried.

                                 CROWD (O.S.)
                        Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...

           Randy looks around at the crowd, chanting, hungry for the Ram 
           Jam. He is torn. He looks The Ayatollah in the eye.

                                 RANDY
                        Let’s do this.

           Randy gets up. He lifts The Ayatollah off the mat, locking up 
           with him chest-to-chest. He arches his back and thrusts his 
           hips. The Ayatollah’s feet fly off the canvas as his legs 
           whip into the air. His body does a COMPLETE FLIP as he slams 
           onto his back. Randy stays with him, his body contorting in a 
           tight BACK FLIP as he CRASHES DOWN on top of him.

                        Lateral drop!

           Randy gets up. His HEART LURCHES. 

           He goes back down to his knees. Puts his hand to his chest. 
           Something definitely just happened.

           Randy looks out at the crowd. The whole place is on its feet.

                                 CROWD (O.S.)
                        Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...

           Randy’s heart LURCHES AGAIN. The Ayatollah sees this.
                                 THE AYATOLLAH
                        You okay?

           Randy is clearly not.

                                 THE AYATOLLAH (CONT’D)
                        Just pin me, man.

           Randy looks out at the crowd again.

           RANDY’S POV: The fans are in a frenzy. A guy in the front row 
           is shaking a a WE WANT BLOOD sign.

                                 CROWD (O.S.)
                        RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...

                                 THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.)
                        C’mon, finish it.

           Randy is torn. He puts a hand to the canvas. He... GETS UP.

           Randy STAGGERS to the corner. He climbs to the top rope, high 
           above the ring. His heartbeat is UNNATURAL AND DEAFENING.

           BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM...

           He raises his arms and sticks his elbows out, pressing his 
           fists to the sides of his head to form a set of RAM’S HORNS.

                                 COMMENTATOR #2 (O.S.) 
                        Uh-oh, the horns are out...

           The fans are on the edge of their seats, primed to see their 
           hero do his trademark finishing move.

           BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM...

           Randy takes a long look around the room, lingering on the 
           fans’ faces, savoring their cheers.

           He finds Cassidy in the crowd. Their eyes meet. He gives her 
           a small smile.

                                 COMMENTATOR #1 (O.S.)
                        Here we go...

           BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM...

           He LEAPS.

           FREEZE on Randy in mid-air, glorious and immortal.

                                                                   END.
