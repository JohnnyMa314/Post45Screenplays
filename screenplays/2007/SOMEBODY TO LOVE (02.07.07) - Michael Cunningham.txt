                              QUEEN (O.S, SINGING)
                         Let’s go!
                                   Steve walks warily

                     down the street with his brim
                     pulled way down low, ain’t no sound
                     but the sound of his feet, machine
                     guns ready to go.

                     We see Freddie get into the back seat of a black
             From the p.o.v. of the street, we take in Freddie’s’house,
             Garden Lodge.

             gardens.
             limo, with a DRIVER at the wheel.

             We pull back to see the gates in the wall that surrounds
             Freddie’s compound.
                              At least A DOZEN FANS, many of them
             YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN VERY UP-TO-THE-SECOND MID-EIGHTIES
             CLOTHES, clamor around the car. We see that the wall is
             covered in graffiti, various declarations of love for
             Freddie.

                                         The fans go crazy.

             The limo pulls out of the gates.
             MAN hurls himself forward, presses his face to the passenger
             window.

             INT. THE LIMOSINE - DAY

                                               The young man
             Freddie, ensconced in the back seat, leans forward and kisses
             the young man through the window glass.
             presses his tongue to the window glass and Freddie, a wild
             thing indeed, answers with his own tongue, from his side of
             the glass.

             The DRIVER glances back at the shenanigans, steps on the gas
             and the limo pulls away.

             EXT. FREDDIE’S STREET INLONDON - DAY

              elated fans bid him farewell.
              kiss through the glass, however, keeps running alongside the
              car.

              be audible, but it’s meant as a counterpoint of sorts to the
              music, like the chorus in an opera.

                               Are you hanging on the

                                 doorway the bullets rip, to the
                      sound of the beat, yeah.

           The young man, who’s been falling steadily behind the car,
              finally stops running and drops to his knees in supplication
           to his vanishing idol.

           As the young guy ~co1lapses,we reach the moment in the song
           when Queen sings:

                               QUEEN (O.S., SINGING)

                       think?

                       No.
                       out and nobody’s there.

              The limosine drives on, out of our view.

                       How do you think I’m going to get
                       along without you when you’re gone.
                       You took me for everything that I
                       had and kicked me out on my own.

              The limo pulls up, and Freddie emerges into another minor sea
              of fans.
                      We watch the driver escort Freddie throughe
             They’ve worked up a good act, the two of them - Freddie makes
             as if he’d love to spend the whole day with his fans, but his
             driver/bodyguard simply won’t allow it.

             INT. REHEARSAL SPACE IN LONDON, 1985 — DAY

             They’re rehearsing “Radio Ga-Ga,”
                                         Freddie is singing:

             Although we continue to hear the dialog in the rehearsal
             space, we see the 20-year-old Freddie, with beautiful long
             hair, getting dressed in the morning in his shabby flat in
             1971, smoking a cigarette and listening with great intensity
             to the radio, which is playing Jimi Hendrix doing “All Along
             the Watchtower.”
                            Freddie at this age is long-haired, lithe,
             androgynous~ pale and.beautiful as a Era Angelica.

             Freddie pauses in front of a mirror, does.a Hendrix move,
             smiles open-mouthed and quickly hides his buck teeth, as we
             saw him do earlier and, as we understand, he will do all his
             life.

                                     We are going to

             INT. A STUDIO IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF ART, 1971 - DAY

                               We see Freddie at 20, sitting among a

             model is an unprepossessing, middle—aged man.
                              Then we get to Freddie’s drawing.

                                                What Freddie is
             We pass behind the students, get quick glimpses of their
             variously competent and incompetent attempts to render the
             man realistically.
             Freddie, who is clearly able to draw, has made the naked man
             into a god —— handsome, muscular, broad—shouldered.
                                                         Freddie
             has managed to render the model as he would, in fact, be if
             he were younger and in better condition.
             drawing is not so much a fantasy as an improvement on
             reality.

              The off—screen dialog ends, and we’re fully in the scene.

                        The stalls sell all manner of treasures:

             An hour later.
              afternoon in 1971, an acid dream mixed with a bazaar in
              Marrakesh.
              brilliant Indian tapestries, peacock feathers, elaborately
              embroidered vests and jackets, lavish strands of beads.
                                                            The
              crowd of people who browse the bazaar are like visitors from
           a brighter, more beautiful planet, with untamed riots of
           hair, extravagant hats, bangles, seven-league boots.
              Rousseau jungle; it’s the cover of the Sgt. Pepper’s album.

           Instead of rock or pop music, however, what we hear under the
           scene is “Quando m’en vo,” from Act II of Puccini’s “La
           Boheme.”

             The young man leaves with the coat.
                                           Roger is happily
             pocketing the money when Freddie appears, holding two
             steaming cups of tea.

                              FREDDIE
                     Darling, that was my coat.

             Freddie looks wistfully at the departing young customer.

                              ROGER
                     Shall I go after him?

             He appears to be hearing a Queen song that won’t, in fact, be
             written for years, but even now, it’s hanging in the air over
             his head.

           Brian passes the joint to Roger.

                               FREDDIE
                      I think we should call ourselves
                      Queen.

              Brian, Roger, and John look at each other uncertainly.

                               FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                                 It’s memorable.

             He goes off toward the bathroom.

                              FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                     I’m going to freshen up, and then
                     we’ll rehearse the damned song a
                     hundred more times.

             When Freddie is out of earshot, Brian says softly to the
             others:

                              BRIAN

                     Can’t hardly sing, and he wants to

              He takes off down the road.
                                     As he goes he calls back:

                      Real ten, not diva ten.

                                                    We get the
             impression that they’re former lovers, still on friendly
             terms.
             quick, expert toke.

                      Christine, this is Freddie-

             As he says “Bulsara,” Freddie leans in and overrides him.

                        to meet you.

             He extends a graceful hand, resplendent with black nail
             polish.
                     Christine takes it.
                              CHRISTINE

                      Freddie’s our lead singer.

                              FREDDIE
                      Darling, what do you think of
                      Queen?

                              CHRISTINE
                      Hm?

                              FREDDIE
                      As a name for our band.

                              CHRISTINE
                        I like it.

                              FREDDIE
                                    It’s royal.
                        It’s memorable.
                        Right?

                              CHRISTINE
                        Absolutely.

                              ROGER
                      Get you some tea, love?

              She rises.

                               CHRISTINE
                      No, I’ve had mine, I’m off to work.
                               ROGER
                                 See you tonight.

           She looks with great amusement back at Freddie.

                               CHRISTINE
                                 Love your nails.
                                     Love your hair.

                               FREDDIE
                                 Love your nails. Love your hair.
              She departs.

                               FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                      She’s fantastic.

                               ROGER
                      Freddie Mercury?
                              FREDDIE
                     It’s better, don’t you think?

                              ROGER
                     Matter of fact, I do.

             INT. FREDDIE’S LIVING ROOM, 1985 - NIGHT

                         Freddie’s living room at Garden Lodge is done
                                                Or, if you prefer,
                                It’s a hybrid of Haiston white ultra-
             Back to 1985.

             Rich in the Eighties.
                                    Big deep sofas, vases that cost
             suede and a Sultan’s tent.
             more than new cars, pillows everywhere.
                                               It is not, however,
             chilly or forbidding, as grand rooms can be.. it looks quite
             comfortable.

             and staff.

                                    Peter, as we know, has been given
             the nickname “Phoebe,” Joe is known as “Liza,” and Freddie is
             occasionally referred to as “Melina” (for the mercurial Greek
             actress Melina Mercuri).
                                   Peter seems somehow to have escaped
             a nickname entirely.

                            All have short hair, and all but Peter

             vaguely similar.

                               Though “butch” is not the word that
             comes to mind in describing them, their dress is distinctly
             butch —- t-shirts or polo shirts, jeans, and work boots.

                    while we will be seeing Freddie at various times in
             Note --
              his life, he has, essentially, two main “looks” —— the
             willowy, long-haired androgyny of his youth, and his “manly”
             mode, the aforementioned short hair, mustache, and simple,
              utilitarian clothes.

              Freddie and the others are lounging around on the big,
           comfortable sofas.
                              The coffee table is littered with
           champagne and vodka bottles, overflowing ashtrays, and lines
           of cocaine.

           On the stereo, Freddie is playing Caballe singing the aria
              “Casta Diva,” (“Chaste Goddess”) from the first act of
              Bellini’s “Norma,” in which Norma, the rejected lover, sings
           to the goddess of the moon.

                        mind.

                              FREDDIE
                        You’re just a fucking laundress,
                        Lisa, you know nothing of the
                      responsibilities involved in being
                      an internationally revered diva.

             •They all laugh, Freddie harder than anyone.
                                                  Then, rather
           abruptly, Freddie gets serious.

                               FREDDIE (CONT’D)

                                   I can’t seem to get
                      Darlings, do you understand that

                               FREDDIE
                                 Not like they were.

                               PETER STRAKER
                                 There are masses of fans outside
                                 your gate right now.
                                        In the rain.

                               FREDDIE

                                            We’re
                      It’s not just decent sales and a
                      few hundred insane fans.
                      starting to slip.
                                      I can feel it.

                               PETER STRAXER
                      There are bound to be highs and
                      lows.

                               FREDDIE
                      And if you’re low too long you
                      become a joke, you become some band
                      somebody’s parents listen to, and
                      you can’t come back from that.
                      Millions of people are going to be
                      watching, this concert.

                     Can we please talk, about something
                     important? What are you wearing?

                              FREDDIE
                     Jeans and a tank.

                              PETER FREESTONE
                      I can’t help but be the tiniest bit
                      disappointed.

                              ‘FREDDIE
                      All right, a leather arm band,

             Freddie frowns, gets up and moves a quite valuable—looking
             Chinese vase from one shelf to another.

                                 Remember?

                              JOE (TO PETER FREESTONE)
                        I win.

                              FREDDIE
                        What?

                              JOE
                        We had a bet.

                              PETER FREESTONE
                                 It took him half an hour to notice.

                               JOE
                                 Immaterial.
                                 Pay up.

                            He doesn’t ‘mind a joke at his expense.
           Freddie laughs.
           Well, sometimes he doesn’t.

                               PETER STRAKER
                                 Where’s Christine tonight?

              Joe and Peter Freestone shoot him cautionary looks.
              good subject.
                          Freddie stops laughing.

                               FREDDIE
                      Fuck if I know.
              INT. THE BAR AREA OF A PUB IN LONDON, 1971 - NIGHT

           We return to the young Freddie, who has just met Christine.
              Like much of London in 1971, the pub is a curious mix of the
              old (ancient men dressed in tweed, slumped dejectedly over
              their pints) and the new (young, wild-haired men and women
              dressed in thrift-shop splendor, celebrating themselves).
              The jukebox blasts out Smokey Robinson’s “Tears of a Clown.”

                                              He’s getting cruised
                                              The guy is a little
                            long straggly hair and stubble, grimy
              Freddie is at the bar, buying drinks.
              by a SOMEWHAT OLDER, DARK-HAIRED MAN.
              rough-looking --
              leather jacket.

                               OLDER MAN
                      Hello.

                               FREDDIE
                      Hello.

                               OLDER MAN
                        -Do you know that you’re the sexiest
                      thing here?

              Freddie pauses in mock concentration.

                               FREDDIE
                       Hm.
                           Yes, I do.
              They both laugh.
                             The older man nods questioningly in the

                                                   -
              direction of the exit.
                               FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                     - Sorry.
                             With friends.

              By then, the barkeep has given him his drinks —- five pints.
              Freddie gathers them up,. with both hands, smiles at the older
              man and, somehow managing to carry five pints, turns away
              from the bar.

              INT. SEATING AREA OF A PUB IN LONDON, 1971 - NIGHT

                                                    Roxanne, like
              Freddie brings the pints to a table where Roger, Brian,
              Christine and her friend ROXANNE are seated.
              Christine, is a great young beauty, blond and bright,
              fantastically dressed.

                               ROGER
                     - Mister Mercury!
                              BRIAN

                     I’ve changed mine too.
                     Mars now.

                              ROGER

                  -

                     Uranus.

                                In so doing, he glances at the guy at
             Freddie laughs along.
             the bar, who smiles and winks at him.
                                             Freddie winks back.

                                                 When he runs out
             Surreptitiously, barely audible to .the others, Freddie taps
             his fingers on the tabletop and sings a few lines from a song
             he’ll write in the future, “Killer Queen.”

                      I want ‘to change my name, too.

             Freddie stops singing, looks at her with interest.

                              FREDDIE
                      You’re the Killer Queen.

                              CHRISTINE
                      I beg your pardon.

                      You’re a girl with gunpowder.
                      You’re not all frilly and nervous.

             She is clearly amused.

                              CHRISTINE
                        I’d been thinking more along the
                        lines of an exotic flower, frankly.
                        Or some distant moon.

              Christine has gone to the ladies’, is standing at the sink
           checking her make-up in the mirror.
                                            Freddie barges in.

                               CHRISTINE
                                 Hello.

           Freddie takes out a coke vial and a spoon, scoops some out
           for her.
                        She inhales it.

                               FREDDIE
                                 Killer Queen.

                      Stop that.

                                Really.

                               FREDDIE
                      Killers never think they are.

              He takes a spoonful of cocaine for himself.

                               CHRISTINE
                      Darling, I hate to disappoint you,
                      but really, I’m just an ordinary
                      girl.

              He puts a finger to her lips.

                                          There’s
                               FREDDIE
                      No.
                           You’re brand new.
                      never been anyone like you.

              As he looks at her, Christine takes on a glow, a little like
              an angel by Raphael.
              impossibly delicate shade of pinkish white.

                              Freddie and Christine lie naked together’
              Later that night.
              amid a tangle of sheets.
                                   They’ve clearly been making love.

                               CHRISTINE

                                                     As they go
             We briefly see the 11-YEAR-OLD FREDDIE, in a school uniform,
             lined up with the OTHER BOYS under the stern eye of an
             ELDERLY PROFESSOR, who marches the boys inside.
             we notice that Freddie, in marked contrast to the other boys,
             has pomaded his hair and has tied a pale orange ribbon, like
             a wispy little necktie, around the collar of his starched
             white shirt.

             INT. FREDDIE’S BEDROOM IN FELTHAM, 1971 - NIGHT

             Freddie ignores the question, runs a finger along Christine’s
             bare hip.

                              FREDDIE
                     Did you know you have six freckles
                     right here that are exactly the
                      shape of Casseopeia?

                              CHRISTINE
                      I don’t like my freckles all that
                     much.

                              FREDDIE
                                I wonder if you have
                      You should.
                      other constellations somewhere?

             He looks avidly over her naked body.

                              CHRISTINE

                      I’m hungry. Are you hungry?

                      Perfect.

             Freddie jumps out of bed naked, picks up his own ruffled
             Edwardian shirt from the floor.

                              FREDDIE
                      Wear this.

                              CHRISTINE
                        It’s lovely.
                               FREDDIE
                      Other people’s clothes are always
                      sexier, don’t you think?

              As he speaks, he ties Christine’s silk scarf around his neck.

                               CHRISTINE

                      Depends on the person.

              Freddie and Christine are in the standing room section.

              Violetta’s aria, is sung, of course, in Italian, and since
              Christine neither knows “La Traviata” nor speaks Italian,
              she’s unaware of any implied omen regarding her future with

                      Having to stand in a cold park
                                 listening to one.
                                 go find a drink.

                       He takes Christine’s hand, and they run together
              This is typical Freddie --

                               Christine hasn’t noticed a thing.

                                       It’s a rather low-key affair --

                                     but it iá at the same time the
             We find ourselves at a party.
              there are only about 15 or 20 PEOPLE, including Roger and
              Brian ‘(John has not come) --
             very embodiment of the sort of cool hedonism most of us only
           imagine must exist, well, somewhere, for someone.’

              Everyone is young, healthy, sexy, and beautifully dressed.
           There are hundreds of. candles, vast arrangements of flowers,
           bigmodern sofas that practically ask to be the sites of
           sexual maneuvers.
             The music is David Bowie’s “Rock n’ Roll Suicide.”

             NIGHT

              Freddie arid a HANDSOME DARK-HAIRED BOY have snuck into the
             bedroom to do a few lines of coke.
                                           They sit close together
              on the bed, passing the vial back and forth.

                              FREDDIE
                                 What’s your favorite opera?

                               BOY
                                 Don’t know much about it, really.

                               FREDDIE
                                 Neither do I.

                                         They make out until
           He leans in and kisses the boy.
           Christine enters, unexpectedly.

                               CHRISTINE
                      Sorry, I thought it was the loo...
                      oh.

                                     Freddie looks at Christine,
              But Eddie is out of there.
              smiles, shrugs, and pats the spot on the mattress that the

             INT. THE BATHROOM OF A FLAT IN KENSINGTON, 1974 - NIGHT

                            Freddie and Christine have moved in
             Two years later.
             together. Freddie is lying luxuriously in the bathtub of a
             perfectly nice but not particularly ostentatious bathroom.

                   In its force and drama, it ever so slightly resembles
             Balanced on the sink, a tape player plays “Don Giovanni,
             Cenar Teco M’invitasti,” the final scene in Mozart’s opera
             “Don Giovanni,” in which Don Giovanni is dragged down to
             hell.
             “Bohemian Rhapsody.”

             Christine enters.

                              CHRISTINE
                      You look like Ophelia.
                              FREDDIE
                      Precisely my intention.
             She comes and sits on the edge of the tub.

                              CHRISTINE
                      Pensive?

                              CHRISTINE
                      Darling, are you upset because
                      you’re not Mozart?

                      Stop this.

              Freddie flashes her a big, fake~grin.
                                             He’ s in no mood. ~But
              even now, even with Christine, he quickly revises the grin to
              conceal his teeth.
                              His voice drips with sarcasm.
                               FREDDIE

                      Right, nothing to worry about, just
                      do your
                                   bit of work and then
                      die peacefully.

                               CHRISTINE
                      There’s a large, fertile realm
                      between impossible perfection and
                      abject failure.

                                           Christine is the only one
              Freddie drops his sarcastic grin.
              he believes on this (and many) subjects; the only one’ he
              trusts.

                               FREDDIE
                       I know.

              Christine starts to take her blouse off.,

                               CHRISTINE

                      Shall I get in the tub with you?
                               FREDDIE
                      Actually, I’d like to be alone for
                       a while.
                               Do you mind?

              We can tell from her face that she does mind, slightly, but
              knows better than to say anything.

                               CHRISTINE
                      Not at all.

              ‘She touches his face with tenderness, and he looks at her
              gratefully.

                                        Freddie closes his eyes and
              After a moment, she withdraws.
              listens with great intensity to “Don Giovanni.”

             we saw earlier, lined up with the others at school.
             barely visible in the dark
             looking up at his older self who’s standing at a lighted
             window, looking down at him.

             Freddie sings, very softly, to himself.

                                   -
             For a few moments, we watch Freddie hum this strange new tune
             to the ghost of his boyhood self.
             Freddie’s voice singing the new song, we see a couple of
             other scenes.

                                     This is, of course, a lot of

             JOHN REID, QUEEN’S MANAGER.
              sound going on simultaneously --
              an opera, so that Freddie’s a capella singing is a background
              to the off-screen argument he’s having with John Reid..

              in the white satin outfits we saw them being fitted for.
              They’re clearly a little nervous, though Freddie is making
              the most convincing show of bravado.

              accompanying video is projected onto a giant screen behind
              them.
                    Parts of the video precisely match the actual, live
              band on stage.
             We understand (or do not quite understand) that Queen is one
             of the first rock bands to project an image, and then imitate
             its own image.

             We spend a few minutes with the boys, the audience, and the
             music.

             We pan over the audience.
                                   They’re going crazy, though we can
             see that at least a few members don’t quite know what to make
             of this strange new song.

           We continue to hear “Bohemian Rhapsody,” but now it’s four
           years later and we’re in the middle of an. enormous, wild

              thrown something fabulous together, a la the Cockettes of San
              Francisco — beards and tiaras and ancient ball gowns, say, or
              pink beehive wigs and ratty old mink coats.

              black lipstick.

              Although the men outnumber the women by about six to one,
              women have done well, too.
                                     There’s a brigade of businessmen
              in suits and mustaches, an admiral, and four women dressed as
              the Rolling Stones, among others.

              Prominent among the party-goers is a HANDSOME YOUNG BLACK
              MAN, naked except for an enormous blond Lady Godiva wig,
              riding,a white horse through the crowd.

                      poor family - spare him his life
                      from this monstrosity.

                          there’s no element of Max Ernst or Cabaret or
                                   Things may take a dark—ish turn in
             All these dramas-within-the-drama ‘should register
             subliminally, as we survey the party and listen to the music.
             The general atmosphere, by the way, is fabulous and
             celebratory --

             love, and drag.

             Between the concert and the overview of the party, we will
             hear “Bohemian Rhapsody” in its entirety, which, as we all
             know, takes just under seven minutes.

           Freddie’s hair is shorter.
           by 1985, but he’s no longer sporting the long, flowing locks.
           His hair right now is a bit Duran Duran-ish (though Freddie
           would probably grimace at the comparison).

              He stands drinking champagne with Brian (who is dressed as a
              girl vampire) and SEVERAL OTHERS, including a MUSTACHED MAN
              dressed as a geisha and A VERY LARGE WOMAN, topless, in
              jeans, tool belt, and hardhat.

              We will hear the following dialog under “Bohemian Rhapsody.”
              It doesn’t really matter if we can’t quite hear what’s being
              said,- we get the picture.

                               BLOND BOY
                       I’ve finally had enough drinks to
                       introduce myself.

                               FREDDIE
                       Please, don’t tell me your name.
                       Angels have no names.

                               BLOND BOY
                       It’s a great song.

              He gestures into the air, referring to “Bohemian Rhapsody,”
              which is blaring over the noise of the revelers.

                       So you think you can stone me and
                       spit in my eye.
                                     So you think you
                       can love me and leave me to die -—

                       Can I ask you what it means?

                       — just gotta get out, just gotta
                       get right out of here.
                                                         As the
             Ten—year—old Freddie sits at adesk in a classroom.
             teacher drones on, Freddie surreptitiously draws a
             magnificent woman, a fantasy princess—warrior, with an
             elaborate headdress, a spear, and a flowing gown.

                       They are fantastic—looking, almost mythic -~ the

                                                 We hear Freddie
             At that moment, “Bohemian Rhapsody” ends.
              sing, “...nothing really matters to me,” followed by the
             closing instrumental,,
                                and the fade-out.

           It’s clear from this casual exchange that there’s nothing
           particularly upsetting to either of them about the situation.
           The boy, however, is nonpiussed.
           Freddie.

              Christine comes and stands beside them, looking out at the
              stars.

                      You’re a lovely one.

              Freddie takes her in his arms,’ holds her tenderly.

                               FREDDIE
                      Beauty, beauty, it’s everywhere.
                                 Are you having a good time?

                                                       They look
              almost classical, like figures in a Medieval altar painting
              of an Annunciation.

                            He’s Alexander the fucking
                      Great.

              The black man in the Lady Godiva wig strides by on horseback.
              Freddie jumps up behind him, onto the horse.

                       And here’s my Alexander now~ Let’s
                       go for a gallop, shall we?

              The rider nods, steers the horse through the crowd and out
              onto the terrace.

                      sensible shoes are falling down

                        I have no intention of delivering,
                        I’m just feeling a little old and
                        unattractive that day, and I need a
                        lift.

                              FREDDIE
                        How do you win at this game?

                              CHRISTINE
                      I suppose you win if you tell the
                        most embarrassing and revealing
                      thing.

                              FREDDIE
                                 I don’t see the point.

                              We’re playing Secrets

                      Darling, there’s not really a
                      winner and it doesn’t exactly have
                                 a point.
                      because, well, you and I seem to
                                 give just about everything else
                                 we’ve got to just about anybody

                                 Maybe you do.

                               CHRISTINE
                      Come on.

                               FREDDIE
                          All right.
                                    I’m horribly vain.

                           I take a considerable number
                      Urn.
                      I spend masses of money.
                                            I love
                      men and I love you. I drink like
                      mad.
                      of drugs, and wish I could
                      accommodate more.

                               CHRISTINE
                      But those aren’t secrets.

                               FREDDIE
                      What, then?

                               CHRISTINE
                                      I couldn’t know,
                       I can’t tell you.
                       could I?

              Freddie pauses, considering.
                              FREDDIE
                                I invented a person

                                               He
                     How’s this?
                     called Freddie Mercury, and it
                     turned out he could sing better
                     than that other person could.
                     actually had a better voice.

                              CHRISTINE
                      That’s not a secret, either.

                              FREDDIE
                      It’s not?

                              CHRISTINE
                      Not to me.

                              FREDDIE
                      Oh.
                          Well.

                              CHRISTINE
                      Perhaps it’s just not your game.

             Freddie glares at her.
                                 He never loses a game.

                              FREDDIE
                      I worry that I’m just a dull little
                      man who can’t possibly live up to
                      all this.

             He makes a sweeping gesture that takes in the whole luxurious
             room.
                   Christine looks at him skeptically.

                              CHRISTINE
                        Is that really true?

                        Well, no.
                              FREDDIE
                               Not really.

                      life before I left my nursery.
                                 Left alone with big fat Fanny, she
                                 was such a naughty nanny!

              He tears open his shirt and reveals a big tattoo of Freddie,
              emblazoned across his scrawny chest.

                                                   Jim was clearly
              Freddie has opened the door and let Jim in.
              not expecting this sort of opulence.

                                        -
                               JIM
                      Shit.

              Freddie grabs him, kisses him.
                                        Jim pulls away for a moment.
                              JIM (CONT’D)
                     Never know who you’re gonna meet in
                     a bar, do you?

                              FREDDIE
                     Forget about who I am.

             From the blank look on Jim’s face, it begins to dawn on
             Freddie that this guy may actually not know who he is.

                              FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                     I have a band called Queen.

                              JIM
                               I’ve heard you.

                     Oh, right.
                     radio.

                              FREDDIE
                     But you don’t give a shit, do you?

                              JIM

                                                  -
                     I don’t know music, really.

                                      He presses his mouth hungrily
             Freddie is turned on by this.
             to Jim’s.

             EXT. A STRANGE HOUSE - NIGHT

                                    We hear a distant piano playing
             We are in Freddie’s dream.
             “Save Me.”
                       No lyrics, just the tune.

                 He opens the door.
                                  A blinding silver light bursts out.
                                                 It’s clear that
                                          It’s not clear whether the
             Freddie is walking through a dark house, which is vast and
             seemingly empty.
                            He comes to a wall with a single door in
             it.
             Freddie is at once ecstatic and terrified.
             the light is go’ing to absorb him.
             experience will be fabulous or excruciating—-

             INT. FREDDIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

                             Freddie wakes up, sees that he’s in bed
             The next morning.
             with Jim, who’s already awake-.

                              FREDDIE

             Peter enters, with a cup of tea.

                          As we ‘hear the song,. we begin to move
            We can hear the sounds of Freddie’s and Jim’s passion, but
            gradually the song “Somebody to Love” ‘comes up and begins to
            drown them out.
            through the rooms of Freddie’s house.

                      He was the biggest and most
                      beautiful.
             INT. A FABULOUS SHOP IN LONDON - DAY

                              Freddie and christine are in a boutique
                                               It’s Goth-rocker-
            Later the dame day.
             that positively radiates cool abundance
             pirate, very much along the lines of early Viviennne
             Westwood.

             Christine stands in.front of a mirror, wearing a fantastic
             black lace dress that’s full of pleats and scallops.
             stands behind her, adjusting the dress.

                              CHRISTINE
                     Do you think?

                                                        She is
             A very eager-looking YOUNG SALESGIRL stands nearby.
             dressed, more or less, as a female Iggy Pop.

                              SALESGIRL
                     It’s stunning.

             Christine fusses with the dress’s neckline.

                              CHRISTINE
                     Am I getting a little old for this
                     much cleavage?

                              FREDDIE
                                   Let’s look at
                     Absolutely not.
                      shoes.

                                Freddie pauses periodically to finger
             He and Christine, trailed,by the salesgirl, work their way
             through the boutique.
             a scarf, or the sleeve of a blouse.

                              FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                      I met the most amazing man last
                      night.

                                              ‘
                              CHRISTINE
                      Did you, now?

                     she tries to adjust it, make it a bit’ less
             She continues to worry over the neckline of the dress she’s
             got on --
             revealing.

                                     ‘
                                         ‘
                                               He’s
                              FREDDIE
                      He’s barely even heard of me.
                      a barber.

                              CHRISTINE
                        I can understand the attraction.
                              FREDDIE
                      I think I’d like to see this one
                      again.

                              CHRISTINE
                      Really?

                              FREDDIE
                      Mm.
                          He’s sweet, he’s sexy——

             Suddenly, and quite unexpectedly, Christine takes in bOth
             hands the bodice of the dress she’s wearing, and rips it.
             It’s very thin and gauzy --
                                    it rips right down to the waist.

                              FREDDIE
                      Darling--

                              CHRISTINE
                                          You know
                        I don’t see other men.
                        that, don’t you?

              The shop girl hesitates, then beats a hasty retreat.

                              FREDDIE
                        You can see as many other men as
                        you like.

                              CHRISTINE
                                      I might not want
                        Did you think that
                        to hear the details of some idiot
                        you fucked the day after we’d
                        talked about getting a house
                      together? Did that possibility
                      occur to you?

                                                       Freddie
           She turns and goes back toward the dressing room.
           follows her.

                               CHRISTINE (CONT’D)
                                 I’m going to have to pay for the
                                 fucking dress.

                               FREDDIE

                                 it off with them.

                                  ‘
              Christine reaches the back of the store, pulls the dress off.
              It rips further.

                               CHRISTINE
                                         Where did I
                                 Where are my clothes?
                      leave them?
                              FREDDIE
                      You’re the one I love.

                              CHRISTINE
                      You have no idea how cold you are.

                              FREDDIE
                      I’m not cold.

                              You don’t really give a

                      selfish.
                      shit about anybody.

                              FREDDIE
                      That’s not true.

             Just as suddenly as the fit took Christine, it leaves her.
             Flushed, as if she’s just run a considerable distance, she
             looks levelly at Freddie.

                              CHRISTINE
                        Iknow.

             Freddie takes her in his arms.

                              FREDDIE
                        We agreed there’d be dungeon
                      -masters and rugby teams.

                              CHRISTINE
                      Don’t pay any attention to me.
                                                You
                      have enough on your mind right now.

                              FREDDIE
                                 I want you to be happy.

                               CHRISTINE

                                 Let’s go look at shoes, shall we?

                               CHRI STINE
                      Fine. •Yes.
                                 Let’s look at -shoes.
              INT. FREDDIE’S LIVING ROOM, 1985 - NIGHT,

                         Freddie has curled up on one of the deep sofas,
           That night.
              covered himself with a blanket, and is listening to the Act
              III aria “Nessum dormal” from Puccini’s “Turandot.”
                                                         We can
              see from Freddie’s face that he’s troubled, lonely, confused,
              and is taking whatever consolation hecan in this immortal
           music.

              INT. A FANCY LONDON RESTAURANT - NIGHT

                              Freddie is having dinner, in a very chic
                                            the other members of

              Later that ‘night.
              restaurant, with a crew of friends:
              Queen, Christine, and a few NEW PEOPLE:
              VERY MUCH LIKE ELTON JOHN, A BEAUTIFUL BLACK-HAIRED WOMAN OF
              INDETERMINATE AGE, A PAIR OF IMPOSSIBLY BEAUTIFUL YOUNG BOYS
              WHO MIGHT HAVE COME AS THE GUESTS OF THE MAN WHO RESEMBLES
              ELTON JOHN.

              Under the scene, we hear Queen doing “Play the Game.”

                               QUEEN (O.S., SINGING)
                      Open up your mind and let me step
                       inside, rest your weary head and
                       let your heart ‘decide

              Freddie leans in toward Christine, whispers conspiratorially.

                               FREDDIE
                       Love the shoes.

                               CHRISTINE
                       You can’t even see them.

                               FREDDIE
                       Noticed them on the way in.
                       Remember who you’re talking to.

                                       They are, no denying it, a good

              They laugh briefly together.
              match, and in a different world --
              prefer —— they could go on forever as a sort of hybrid of
              best friends and husband and wife.

              We tune in, on an ongoing conversation between Brian and the
              black-haired woman.’

             Although we continue to hear the dialog and the music, we
             leave Freddie and Co. and swing around the restaurant, which
             is full of THE COOLEST OF THE COOL - YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE.
             It’s the epitome of style and posh

             AGED COUPLES are clearly in the middle of an awkward
             interlude, in which the WIFE of one MAN flirts flagrantly
             with the HUSBAND of the other WOMAN.
             LOVELY YOUNG COUPLE holds hands and holds a whispered
             conversation --
             untroubled.
             clear impatience, for her date to arrive.

             We hear the black-haired woman speak in a loud, strong voice.
             She’s a Big Thinker.

                      the question, is it?

                      But I want to have a drink or two

              Jim has taken Freddie to a very sleazy bar indeed.
              dungeon—ish, S&M place, and its predominant clientele is MEN
              OF A CERTAIN AGE, wearing leather chaps, motorcycle caps,
              harnesses, and related gear.
              of the world in which one particular, and rather eccentric,
              notion of sexiness prevails, and beauty in all its other
              ‘forms is banished.

              Freddie don’t really fit in here, though they have the
              requisite short hair and ‘mustaches.
                                             Jim is a bit more
              passable, in a tight black t-shirt, but Freddie, in the big-
              collared silk shirt he wore to dinner, looks, a bit like an
              orchid in a slag heap.

                       It’s the terror of knowing what
                       this world is about, watching some
                       good friends screaming, get me outs

                      Experience indicates that once you
                      actually start talking to a big
                      sexy fuck like you, that’s the end
                      of all attraction.
                                      I’ve decided to

                      Lately I feel like I can’t stand
                        attention and I can’t stand it when
                        nobody recognizes me, either.
                        Don’t know what to do about that,
                        really.

           Freddie looks at him uncertainly.
                                          Jim laughs, and sits down
           again, close to Freddie,.

                                 You really think I’d hear a little
                                 thing like that and not want to

                                 Which would not be a surprising
                      sentiment corning from a fifteen—
                      year-old girl.
                                           Now you

                      insignificant secret I’ve ever

                               JIM
                      You said it could be a small one.

                      I didn’t mean microscopic.

                      I like your pond.

                      A bit of breakfast?

              Christine looks skeptically at him, but does, in fact, snort
              up the spoonful of coke he’s offered her. ‘ He does a spoonful

                                              Just

                      couldn’t take all the palaver,
                                 y’know?

              As if gripped by a sudden panic, Christine pitches him off
              and jumps out of bed.
                               FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                      Hey, love--

              Christine stands staring at him.

                               FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                      Come on.
              Freddie gets up.
                             She literally runs away from him, out of
              the room.

              Christine stands in the middle of the room, fearfully, almost
              as if she were confronting a thief who’d just broken in.

                               CHRISTINE
                       What have I done?

                               FREDDIE
                       Nothing.

              She emits a hysterical whoop of laughter.

                               CHRISTINE
                       That’s exactly right.

             Although Christine and’Freddie remain exactly where they were
             in. the previous scene, we are transported to an opera stage,
             where an opera—sized version of Christine’s living room has
             been constructed.

             Under the dialog, we hear Queen doing “I Want It All.”
                                                           The
             following occupies a strange zone between opera and schlock.

                        Hard to imagine how anyone could be
                      freer.

                      Hey, now

             But Freddie is on a tear.
                                   He jumps up.

                              FREDDIE
                      Do you have any opinions, about
                               Do you care about me?
                      anything?

            - Jim gets up.
                         He’s not one for a scene.

                              JIM
                      I should be going.
                              FREDDIE
                        That’s your response.

                      What moves you through the days?

              temporary stalemate.
                                Jim turns and leaves.

              still holding the vase.

               Christine, neither of whom is at Wembley Stadium.

           his fist in triumph.

                               BRIAN (TO FREDDIE)
                      Did it.

                               FREDDIE
                      Did.
             Freddie lifts his champagne glass to Brian.

             INT. BATHROOM AT FREDDIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

                               Freddie sits on the closed toilet seat
                                                       It bears
             A short while later.
             with one pants leg rolled up, looking at his shin.
             another Karposi’s sarcoma lesion.

             The door opens halfway.
                                 It’s Peter.

                              PETER
                     Whoops.

                              FREDDIE
                     Just me, Phoebe.

                         Freddie quickly pulls his pants leg back down,
             Peter enters.
             takes out the coke vial, gives it to Peter, who helps
             himself.

                              PETER,
                     You were good, you know.

                              FREDDIE
                     I do know.

                                     He and Peter pass the cigarette
             Freddie lights a cigarette.
             and the coke vial back and forth, simultaneously, as they’
             talk.

                              FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                      Phoebe, would you say that you’re
                      happy?

                                       -
                              PETER

                                        -
                      More or less.

                              FREDDIE
                      I know I can be horrible sometimes.

                              PETER
                      Only sometimes.

                              FREDDIE
                      I hope I’ve made you at least a
                      little bit happy.,

                              PETER
                      What’s going on, Melina?
                               FREDDIE
                      Post-concert, you know how I am.
                      Drama queen, going all sentimental.

                             Then he puts a hand, very gently, on the
              Peter hesitates.
              back of Freddie’s head.

                               PETER
                       Darling, you’ve got it, haven’t
                       you?

                               FREDDIE
                       Got what?

                               PETER
                       Don’t fuck with your auntie.

              Freddie jumps away from Peter, in a fit of rage and panic.

                               FREDDIE
                       I’m perfectly fine.
                               PETER
                       You should see a doctor.

              Freddie looks like a cornered animal.

                            -
                               FREDDIE

                       I’m perfect.
              Reflexively,, he puts his hand to his mouth, as if to cover
              his teeth.
              Peter tosses the cigarette into the sink.

                               PETER
                       For one thing, I suspect you need
                       to stop smoking.

                               FREDDIE

                                        ‘
                       Fuck off.

              He lights another cigarette.

                               PETER

                                            ‘
                       I’ll do whatever you need me to.
                       You know that.

              Freddie hesitates.
                               His rage and panic start to slip away.

                                       -
                               FREDDIE
                       Are you all right?
                                             -
                                             I
                              PETER
                     Do you mean, have I got it?
                     don’t think so.

                              FREDDIE.
                     Don’t say anything. ‘To anybody.
                     Promise me you won’t say anything.

                              PETER
                     Not if you don’t want me to.

                              FREDDIE
                     Because I think I can stand
                     being... having this.
                                        But I don’t
                     think I could stand being treated
                     like someone who’s sick.

                                                     After a
             They stand there together, briefly, in silence.
             moment, Freddie smiles (closed—lipped, of course).

                              FREDDIE (CONT’D)
                     Actually, y’know, I came in here to
                     take a shit.

             With that, he drops his ‘pants and raises the toilet seat.

                              PETER

                                                   ‘
                                                     ‘
                      There are levels of intimacy to
                     which 1 don’t aspire, thank you.

             He exits.

             INT. JIM HUTTON’S FLAT - NIGHT

                                        Jim, wearing only briefs,

                                              It’s Freddie, still
             It’s very late that same night.
             sleepily crosses his modest living room in response to a
                              He opens the door.
             knock at his door.
             wearing the clothes we saw him in at the post—concert party.

                              FREDDIE
                        Sorry, sorry, sorry.

                              JIM
                      Come on in.

             Freddie sweeps ,in, kisses him deeply.
                                             Freddie is quite high.

                              FREDDIE
                        I’m a miserable human being.

                              JIM
                        I’ve had worse.
                                                          Freddie

                                             -
              Jim turns and walks in the direction of the bedroom.
              follows, undressing as he goes.

              INT. JIM’S BEDROOM — NIGHT

              The bedroom, like the living room, is spare and masculine-ly
                                             Jim gets back into bed.
              under-decorated and very, very neat.
              Freddie continues undressing.

                               JIM
                                 How’d it go?

                               FREDDIE
                                                How
                      It went quite well, thank you.
                                 was your day?
                               JIM
                      The usual.

           Freddie, naked now, gets into bed beside Jim.

                               FREDDIE
                      Do you like cutting people’s hair?

                               JIM
                      It’s all right.
                               FREDDIE
                      Tell me about the most remarkable
                      head of hair you’ve ever
                      encountered.

                               JIM
                      Now you’re being silly.

                               FREDDIE
                       I am.

                               JIM
                      Go to sleep.
                                  It’s late.

                      Mm-hm.

                                            Freddie, blazing on coke,
                                                   Freddie speaks
              Jim nestles into the nape of Freddie’s neck and is almost
              instantly back in the land of nod.
              lies awake, holding Jim, stroking his hair.
              softly to the slumbering Jim, knowing he can’t be heard.
                •

                              FREDDIE (CONT’D)

                                                 I
                                  If ,we make things up
                     You were awfully harsh, you know.
                     Of course it’s all made up, I never
                     tried to hide that.
                                      But ‘we can
                     make things up, don’t yOu think?
                     think we can.’
                     and believe in them enough, they
                     become real.
                                 Real enough.
                                            Because
                    - you.know, Jim darling, it has
                     always been my convicti9n that a
                     life of straightforward reality is
                     really just a terrible failure of
                     imagination.

                          Freddie, wide awake, holds him and looks up
             Jim snores on.
             at the ceiling.

             INT. THE BULSARA HOUSE IN PERSIA, 1952 - DAY

             It’s the day in Freddie’s childhood that we saw in the
             opening montage - that brief moment in which the very young
             Freddie laughed delightedly at a clown in a parade.’ At this
             moment, his family is about to leave for the parade.

                                               The radio plays
             Freddie, aka Farrokh., age six, stands in his parents’ nicely
             furnished, comfortable-looking bedrooom.
             Bill Haley and the Saddlemen, singing “Rock the Joint.”

             Freddie has tied a sheet around his shoulders, as if it were
             a cape, and is practicing a few moves in front of his
             parents’ full-length mirror.

                                        This is a younger Bomi, a
             Born!, Freddie’s father, enters.
             handsome, well-dressed man in his early thirties, who looks
             very much like the man little Freddie, aka Farrokh, will grow
             into.

                                           He’s lost in the music,
             Freddie doesn’t notice his father.
             and his own ability to swingthose little hips of his.

                                                        It’s
             After a moment, Bomi squats beside little Freddie.
             clear that he loves his son, and that he is not in any way
             put off’ by Freddie’s desire to put on a costume and dance.

                      Farrokh, it’s time ,to go.

                              SIX-YEAR-OLD FREDDIE
                        One more minute.

                              BOMI
                        Your mother is waiting.
                              SIX-YEAR-OLD FREDDIE
                        Till the end of this song.

                              BOMI
                                Until the end of this
                        All right.
                      song.

                                                    Freddie
             He strokes his son’s hair, stands, ‘and exits.
             continues dancing, and in a moment, the song in fact does
              end.
                  We hear the voice of a DISC JOCKEY.

                              DISC JOCKEY
                      That was Bill Haley and the
                                 Saddlemen, singing “Rock the
                      Joint.” Next up, the Dominoes and
                                 “Have Mercy Baby.”

                                                      The radio
           Freddie is obviously enchanted by the prospect.
              plays the opening bars of “Have Mercy Baby,” and Freddie
           starts dancing again.

           From off—screen, we hear his father’s voice.

                                          ‘
                                 Farrokh.
                               BOMI (O.S.)
                              Now.

           Reluctantly, little Freddie turns away from the mirror, turns
              off the radio, and exits, still wearing his homemade cape.
                                               We continue seeing
           We watch him go down a long, dark hail.
           the dark, empty hall after little Freddie has passed out of
              our sight.

              EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE CHRISTINE’S BUILDING - DAY

                          Freddie, all shaved and showered, is standing
              The next day.
              outside Christine’s building. At the moment, two TEENAGE
              GIRLS are standing awe-struck before him.

                               GIRL #1
                       I can’t believe it’s you!

                               FREDDIE
                       I can’t believe it’s me either,
                       love.

                               GIRL #2
                      Would you sign something?

              She rummages in her purse.
                                     Her friend does likewise.

                               GIRL’ #1
                       I think I have a pen.
                              GIRL #2
                      Sign my face.
                                  Write all over me.

                                           She looks long and hard
             At that moment, Christine emerges.
             at Freddie.

                              CHRISTINE (TO FREDDIE)
                        Now whO’ s being melodramatic?

                              FREDDIE
                        If I’d called, would you have
                        wanted to see me?

                              GIRL #1
                        Who’s she?

                              GIRL ,#2
                      I don’t think she’s anybody.

                                                    Freddie walks
              Christine starts walking off down the street.
              alongside her, with the two girls in direct pursuit.

                          Yes.
                              CHRISTINE
                               Honestly, I have no
                            You were fantastic

                                 yesterday.

                               FREDDIE
                                 Was, wasn’t I?

           As Christine and Freddie talk to each other, the two girls
              keep up a running dialog of their own.

                               GIRL #1
                                        I have a

                      lipstick.

                               GIRL #2
                      Oh, write on us in lipstick.

              As this-strange entourage moves down the street, they attract
              attention.
              dressed, fall in.
                        A MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE, rather conservatively
                              They speak to the two girls.

                               MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
                       Is that who I think it is?

                      They’re always smaller than you

                               FREDDIE
                       I feel empty and lost without you.

              Although Freddie is no stranger to true feeling, this
              statement is unusually simple and direct for him.
              and Christine register that.

                               CHRISTINE
                       You’ll recover.

                               FREDDIE
                       I don’t think I will.

              As they progress down the street, yet another FAN falls in,
              this time a COOL-LOOKING MAN IN HIS EARLY 20S.

                               YOUNG MAN
                       Oh, my god.
                                  It can’t be.

              He falls in stride next to Freddie.
              Freddie’s right and this stranger on his left.

                               YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
                       I just want to tell you how much I
                       love you.

              at the same time she knows she can’t continue as she has.

                       So do you want to give it all up
                       and be just us?

                                FREDDIE
                       Yes.

                                              They know how
              They pause, and both start laughing.
              impossible that would be.
                              YOUNG MAN,
                        I don’t mean to intrude.

             And yet, he doesn’t give up, either.

                        do this for you, I would.

                                 life-—

              One of the teenage girls, seeing herself outflanked, has
              picked up speed and is competing with the young man for
              Freddie’ s attention.

                              GIRL #1
                                        I’m sorry, I
                                 You’re so beautiful.
                      just need to tell you that.

           Christine, frustrated almost to the point of hysteria, hails
                                                She opens the door.
           a passing cab, which pulls over for her.

                               FREDDIE

                            You’re my life.

              Christine trembles on the brink of really and truly losing
              control’.
                                                      the fact
                                 It’s too much, and it’s too strange --
              that her true love is a gay man, the yanimering crowd that
              surrounds him.

                               CHRISTINE

                      And, all
                      mine too.

              Tenderly, Freddie touches her face.

                               FREDDIE

                       Call me when you can.
              Christine nods.
                            She’s managing not tocry.

                               CHRISTINE
                       I don’t want you to be alone.

                               FREDDIE
                       I’m never alone.
                                                Freddie almost asks
              They stand there together for a moment.
              to get in the cab with her, but knows it’s time to let her
              go.

                                       As the cab pulls away, Freddie
              Christine gets into the cab.
              is left standing on the sidewalk with his little legion of
              fans.

                       Marianne Faithfull is much prettier
                       than that.

              watching the love of his life drive away, and at the same
              time he knows there’s no way for them to be happy, together --

               foundation, and a. touch of rouge.

               While Freddie applies his make-up, we hear Maria Callas
               singing “Vissi d’arte” (“I Have Lived for Art”) from Act II
               of Puccini’s “Tosca.”

               EXT. A PARTY IN SWITZERLAND, 1988 - NIGHT

               We continue to hear Callas singing the aria from “Tosca” as
               we survey a big, raucous party.
                             All wearing extravagant hats, a A VAST

                               The terrace is strung with paper
                       it’s quite’ lovely.

                        It’s also clear that a certain,nuxnber of NEW,
             It’s a Hat Party.
             CROWD OF GUESTS is gathered on a beautiful terrace
             overlooking a lake.
             lanterns --
             we’ve seen before - Joe Fanelli, the Elton John-like guy
             ‘among them.
             BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MEN are being continually ad~edto the
              ongoing party.

             As we survey the party and hear Callas’ voice, however, we
              know something most of these people don’t --
                                                  that many of
              them are infected; that many will die in the coming years;
              that the party, in a sense, is over.

           INT. FREDDIE ‘S BEDROOM IN ‘SWITZERLAND, 1988 - NIGHT

           Callas’ aria continues through this scene.

           Freddie stands at the window of his upstairs bedroom,
              watching the party unfold below.

                       I most certainly do.

              Peter takes from the bureau a gigantic version of the Mad

                        Not exactly.

             A look of sorrow comes over Freddie’s face.

                              FREDDIE

              Jim speaks to Freddie with a softness and tenderness of which
              we weren’t quite sure he was capable.

              Those who know “La Traviata” will know that Freddie’s line
              coincides with Violetta’s last line, in which she declares
              herself healed, just before she collapses in death.

              Freddie smiles ecstatically.
