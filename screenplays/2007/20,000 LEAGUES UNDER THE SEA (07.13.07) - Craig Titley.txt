           FADE UP ON:

           A NAUTILUS SHELL. Explore its spiraling pattern. 

                                 DAKKAR (V.O.)
                        There is a design in the Universe.

           A refined voice. Passionate. Hindi accent masked by years of 
           European education. 

                                 DAKKAR (V.O.)
                        It is a perfect mathematical design that 
                        appears everywhere in nature. 

           The Nautilus shell morphs into a SUNFLOWER...a RAM’S HORN...a 
           WHIRLPOOL. The pattern never changes.

                                 DAKKAR (V.O.)
                        Even when this design cannot be seen with 
                        the naked eye, its underlying 
                        mathematical formula is still there -- 

           Mathematical equations and formulaic lines annotate the 
           spiral pattern. The equations become geometric shapes which 
           become the PARTHENON, the PYRAMIDS, notes of a MUSICAL SCORE.

                                 DAKKAR (V.O.)
                        -- not only in nature, but in man-made 
                        wonders. It would seem that this design 
                        has been planted in our very souls. 
                        Perhaps even in the fabric of the cosmos.

           The equations resume their spirallic form and now become a 
           SWIRLING SPIRAL of STAR CLUSTERS and PLANETS. Our galaxy.

                                 DAKKAR (V.O.)
                        So you see, my son --

           The galaxy fades away and becomes once again --

           A NAUTILUS SHELL

           Held in the hands of SAGAR, a 7-year old Indian boy standing 
           on a beautiful BEACH. His father, PRINCE DAKKAR -- handsome, 
           38, barefoot -- sits cross-legged in front of him, a LEATHER 
           JOURNAL in his lap with a ORNATE “D” on the cover.

                                 DAKKAR
                        -- you not only found a Nautilus shell, 
                        you found the Will of God.

           His son stares at the shell. Looks bewildered. Overwhelmed. 
                                 DAKKAR
                        Too much to think about on such a 
                        beautiful morning?

           Sagar nods. Way too much. Dakkar ruffles his son’s hair.

                                 DAKKAR
                        Then today let a shell be just a shell. 

           Sagar runs back to the ocean where we see a ROYAL YACHT 
           anchored just off the shore. Dakkar watches him for a beat. 
           Smiles. Then closes his eyes and inhales the crisp clean air. 

                                 SITA (O.S.)
                        I wish we could stay here forever.

           Dakkar opens his eyes. Looks up. Sees his wife SITA standing 
           behind him. Backlit by the sun. Beautiful. She gently wraps a 
           royal TURBAN around his head.

                                 DAKKAR
                        If only I were a fish and not a prince.

           Dakkar rises, kisses her. They watch Sagar play in the surf.

                                 DAKKAR
                        How blessed I am to have two such 
                        beautiful jewels in my life.

           EXT. BUNDLEKIND, INDIA - DAY

           Streets lined with people, waving as Prince Dakkar’s 
           caparisoned ELEPHANT and parade of ATTENDANTS pass by.

           SUPER: BUNDLEKIND, INDIA 1857

           Dakkar, Sita, and Sagar ride in the carriage atop the 
           elephant. An inordinate amount of BRITISH SOLDIERS are in the 
           streets. Not unnoticed by Dakkar.

           EXT. DAKKAR’S ROYAL PALACE - ESTABLISHING

           As grand as the TAJ MAHAL. 

                                 COUSIN (O.S.)
                        Lead us, my Prince. Lead us and your 
                        people will follow.

           INT. DAKKAR’S PALACE LIBRARY - SAME

           An enormous room filled with books, sculptures, works of art. 
           And a wall-size FISH AQUARIUM. 
           Dakkar tinkers with a strange APPARATUS while listening to 
           his ADVISORS -- his UNCLE and COUSIN among them.

                                 DAKKAR
                        Lead you where? We are no match for the 
                        British Army.

                                 COUSIN
                        The American colonists were no match for 
                        them either. But they stood and fought. 
                        Now they are free.

                                 UNCLE
                        India is far better off with the British 
                        than without them. They have brought 
                        wealth and progress --

                                 COUSIN
                        What good is wealth if we are not free?

                                 DAKKAR
                        This is not the time, cousin.

                                 COUSIN
                        It is the time! If you weren’t so 
                        distracted by your books and your science 
                        experiments, you would see--

           An ELECTRIC ARC shoots from Dakkar’s apparatus to a PROPELLER-
           LIKE OBJECT suspended in the aquarium. The propeller SPINS 
           and FISH scatter. 

                                 DAKKAR
                        Books and science -- knowledge -- is the 
                        path to freedom.

                                 COUSIN
                        With all due respect, cousin, I’ll put my 
                        faith in a rifle.

           He storms out of the room. Dakkar looks at his Uncle and 
           advisors. They are still awestruck by the electric show.

           INT. DAKKAR’S PALACE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dakkar and Sita sleep peacefully. We hear a COMMOTION 
           outside. Horses. Voices. Dakkar awakens as a SERVANT enters. 

                                 SERVANT
                        My Prince. You are needed.
           EXT. BUNDLEKIND - NIGHT

           A FULL MOON shines in the black sky. We will soon wish it had 
           spared us from what we are about to see.

           A dozen bound-and-gagged INDIANS are positioned and secured 
           in front of CANNONS, the BARRELS pressing into their backs. 
           Among them: Dakkar’s Cousin and Uncle. 

           A crowd of people SHOUT at the BRITISH SOLDIERS who keep them 
           at bay with guns and swords.

           Dakkar rides up on his powerful STEED. Quickly leaps off and 
           runs toward GENERAL ANSON, the British General in charge.

                                 DAKKAR
                        Almighty, God! Enough! Enough! Release 
                        them! Release them now!

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        These men are rebels. They have been 
                        stockpiling weapons and ammunition. The 
                        old man was trying to protect them.

           Dakkar sees his Uncle’s scared, pleading eyes.

                                 DAKKAR
                        Then I will punish them as I see fit.
                        Release them.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        I don’t take orders from any Hin-doo.

                                 DAKKAR
                        I am Prince Dakkar!  

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        You are no one!

           General Anson motions to his soldiers. They restrain Dakkar. 

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        FIRE!!!

           CLOSE ON DAKKAR

           An expression full of horror and outrage as we hear the 
           CANNONS BLAST. And the SCREAMS and CRIES of witnesses.

                                 DAKKAR
                        Monsters!!!!
           Dakkar snaps, breaks free from the soldiers, grabs one of 
           their rifles and FIRES at General Anson. Hits him in the 
           chest. He falls. Dead? 

           A beat of silent confusion. 

           And then a revolution is born. Indians rush the Soldiers. 
           Dakkar leads the charge.

           Amidst the sound of GUNFIRE and DEATH, SMOKE rises in the 
           air, forms a natural swirling pattern...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           THE ATLANTIC OCEAN

           Gray waves, gray sky. No land in sight.

           SUPER TITLE: THE NORTH ATLANTIC - TEN YEARS LATER

           A SHADOWY BLACK MASS appears just below the surface, moving 
           at a rapid pace. It breaks through the surface and a SPOUT OF 
           WATER shoots up from its slick hide.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Thar she blows!

           The black mass is a monstrously large WHALE. 

           A LONGBOAT appears, bouncing on waves, moving as fast as the 
           four OARSMEN can row. Another longboat appears. Then another. 
           And another. Six in all. 

           IN THE LEAD BOAT

           A man stands at the bow. Steely-eyed and emotionless. Holding 
           a HARPOON. His name: NED LAND. But that fact is known only to 
           us. Everyone else knows him as “Jim Cooper.”

                                 OARSMAN
                        Stick this fish so we can all go home, 
                        Jim. Six months is a long time to be 
                        looking at all your whiskery faces.

                                 OARSMAN #2
                        Just like lookin’ at your wife’s face.

                                 OARSMAN
                        That’s why I’m going home to your wife.

           The Oarsmen and the BOATHEAD (manning the rudder) laugh. But 
           not Ned. He’s all focus.
                                 BOATHEAD
                        What say you, Jim? What are you looking 
                        forward to?

                                 NED
                        Land.
                          (beat)
                        And a nice thick steak. 

           Ned watches the surface of the water, reading signs that most 
           people would never notice. He cocks his arm, firing position.

           Then hesitates. For a very long beat. 

                                 NED
                        She’s turning around.

                                 OARSMAN
                        What!?

                                 NED
                        Stop rowing. She’s turning around.

                                 OARSMAN
                        Whales don’t turn around when you chase--

           The WHALE breaches, sails over the boat! The resulting WAVE 
           nearly capsizes them. An Oarsman flies into the sea.

                                 BOATHEAD
                        Man overboard!

           Ned and the other Oarsmen pull their mate back in just as --

           -- an EERIE, SHRILL, INHUMAN SOUND fills the air. A DOZEN 
           WHALES break through the surface a hundred yards ahead, 
           swimming straight for the longboats. 

                                 OARSMAN
                        What the Devil--

                                 NED
                        Something’s spooking them.

                                 OARSMAN #4
                        It’s the monster! The one we’ve been 
                        hearin’ about. I told you it was real! 

           No one’s sure they believe that. Still --

                                 NED
                        Turn this boat around. Now!
           The Boathead pulls hard on the rudder. The longboats make for 
           the WHALING SHIP (”ALBATROSS”) in the distance. But the WHALE 
           STAMPEDE gets closer...closer...closer...

                                 BOATHEAD
                        Faster! I ain’t in a swimmin’ mood today!

           The whales catch up to the longboats, plow right through 
           them, SPLINTERING them into a hundred pieces. Bodies are 
           flung into the sea like chum.

           ON NED’S BOAT

           Losing ground to a WHALE coming up fast behind. Ned works his 
           way to the back, readies his harpoon...

           ...just as ANOTHER WHALE surfaces beneath the Longboat! Ned 
           and the crew spill into the sea.

           In the churning water, everyone tries to keep from being 
           pulled under while grabbing onto the remains of their boat. 

           ON NED

           Watching as the fleeing whales disappear into the horizon. 

           Then he sees an EERIE GLOWING SHADOW moving beneath the 
           surface. Leaving a long wake. Heading right for them.

           The Oarsmen swim for their lives. 

           Ned remains. Calm. Watches as the SHADOW passes beneath him. 
           Close enough so he can see its enormous size. Deep enough so 
           he can’t tell what the hell it is... 

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           THE WIDE-OPEN MOUTH OF A WHALE

           A painted, wooden sign hanging in front of --

           EXT. “BELLY O’ THE WHALE” TAVERN - NANTUCKET - NIGHT

           A 37-STAR AMERICAN FLAG waves in front. A man with a PEG LEG 
           walks out, steps on a newspaper. The headline: “Luxury Liner 
           Waylander Lost at Sea. Is the Monster to Blame?”

           INT. “BELLY O’ THE WHALE” - SAME

           A rowdy mix of WHALERS, FISHERMEN, and a few tarty, seaman-
           loving WOMEN. The Albatross crew holds court at the bar.

                                 OARSMAN #1
                        It was the size of a ship --
                                 OARSMAN #2
                        Two ships! 

                                 OARSMAN #3
                        But we didn’t run. We stayed to face the 
                        beast! Stuck it with a dozen darts --

                                 BOATHEAD
                        Stuck nothing! You swam away so fast I 
                        thought you’d grown some fins!

                                 OARSMAN #4
                        The Devil himself made this monster. You 
                        can be sure of it.

                          (annoyed with them)
                        The only monsters around here are the 
                        kind you find in trousers.

           The whalers and fishermen burst out laughing.

                                 BOATHEAD
                        Seen a lot of those...trouser monsters 
                        have ya?

                                 BARMAID
                        I’m talking about the likes of you 
                        butchers! Killing’s no way to make a 
                        living.

           She grabs a plate with a STEAK on it, carries it across the 
           tavern to --

           -- a corner table by the FIREPLACE. Where Ned Land sits 
           alone, sipping an ale. She slams the plate down on his table.

                                 BARMAID
                        Sorry about the wait.

                                 NED
                        You have no idea.

           Ned tucks a napkin into his collar. Meticulously lifts his 
           utensils like a high priest handling divine instruments. 

           He is just about to cut the steak when --

           Several U.S. MILITARY SOLDIERS enter. 

                                 MILITARY OFFICER
                        We’re looking for the crew of the 
                        Albatross, the whaler that just got in. 
           Ned sighs. Damn rotten timing. 

                                 OARSMAN #4
                        It’s about the monster, ain’t it!? We saw 
                        it alright!

                                 MILITARY OFFICER
                        If you could all just step outside for a 
                        moment, this won’t take long.

           As the Albatross crew BITCHES and MOANS, making their way to 
           the front door, a SOLDIER scouts the bar. Passes Ned’s table 
           but...he’s not there and his plate is empty.

           EXT. “BELLY O’ THE WHALE” - BACK ALLEY - SAME

           Foggy. Creaky. Ned lurks in the shadows, holding his harpoon, 
           his STEAK impaled on the end. He turns a corner onto --

           THE WHARF

           -- and encounters THREE HUNGRY, SLOBBERING, MANGY DOGS. 
           Eyeing his steak. He turns to walk the other way and finds: 
           THREE SOLDIERS. Holding rifles.  

                                 SOLDIER
                        Drop the weapon and come with us.

                                 NED
                        I don’t think you want me to do that.

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        And why is that?

                                 NED
                        Because I’m a desperate man, fellas. I’ve 
                        been at sea for six long months and 
                        during that time I had only three things 
                        on my mind: land, the love of a woman, 
                        and a thick steak. But this tiny speck of 
                        dirt they call an island ain’t enough 
                        land to spit on, and I’ve come to my 
                        senses about the love of a woman. So if 
                        you don’t mind, I’d like to eat my steak 
                        before it gets cold.

           Ned takes a step forward. The Soldiers lift their rifles. 

                                 NED
                        Alright. Fine. You’ve made your point.

           He holds out the harpoon. The Soldiers lower their guard. As 
           one of them reaches for Ned’s harpoon --
                                 NED
                        Now I’ll make mine.

           Quick as anything we’ve seen, Ned uses his harpoon like a 
           Chinese fighting staff and disarms two of the soldiers. 

           He deflects the third soldier’s rifle just as it fires...then 
           fights “staff” to “staff” (harpoon to gun) with him.

           The other two rejoin the duel and Ned fights three-on-
           one...ever mindful of the steak at the tip of his harpoon...

           ...and the mangy dogs leaping all over the place trying to 
           get their chomps on it.

           Ned disarms two soldiers, sends the third into the water... 
           and the steak flying onto the dock. The dogs run after it.

           Ned hurls his harpoon. The blade severs a rope holding a 
           GLASS LANTERN. It crashes to the dock. A SMALL BLAZE ignites 
           near the steak, keeps the dogs at bay.

           The two remaining soldiers come at Ned armed with BOAT OARS. 
           They swipe at him relentlessly.

           Ned backs into a corner, grabs a FISHING NET, hurls it at the 
           soldiers. They become entangled, stumble blindly. Ned then 
           loosens a chain holding an ANCHOR...

           It swings free, knocks them into the water. 

                                 NED
                        That drink’s on me.

           Ned yanks his harpoon out of the lantern pole. Impales his 
           steak -- now being consumed by FLAMES -- and dips it into a 
           barrel of water. When he pulls it out it is CHARRED, SMOKING.

           He starts to take a bite when -- a GUNSHOT. He turns to see 
           the rest of the Soldiers lined up like a firing squad. 

                                 MILITARY OFFICER
                        Drop it. Now!

           Ned deflates, drops his harpoon. As soon as it hits the dock, 
           the MANGY DOGS rip the steak away and disappear into the fog.

           Ned looks so very annoyed. Should’ve gone for the love of a 
           woman after all.
           INT. MILITARY STOCKADE - WEEKS LATER - DAY

           Ned alone in his tiny cell. Contemplates eating the plate of 
           DISGUSTING GRUEL in front of him while watching the ARMY 
           GUARD behind the desk eat a steak.

                                 NED
                        Think you could eat that somewhere else?

           The Guard takes a nice leisurely bite to taunt him as TWO 
           NAVY PETTY OFFICERS enter. One of them hands the guard an 
           OFFICIAL PIECE OF PAPER.

           The Guard, mouth full, examines it then taps a WANTED POSTER 
           hanging above his desk. “WANTED FOR DESERTION FROM THE U.S. 
           ARMY -- NED LAND -- $50 REWARD.” There’s a sketch of Ned. 
           Then the Guard points his fork at the real Ned in the cell. 

                                 NED
                        That doesn’t even look like me! And even 
                        if it were, I’d be worth a helluva lot 
                        more than fifty dollars.

                                 NAVY OFFICER
                        I wouldn’t give five cents for a coward 
                        like you. 

                                 NED
                        For the last time, my name is not Ned 
                        Land. It’s James F. Cooper! 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        James F. Cooper wrote the stories we read 
                        when we were kids.

           Standing in the doorway: highly decorated NAVAL COMMANDER 
           DAVID FARRAGUT. He tosses a BOOK to Ned. James Fenimore 
           Cooper’s Last of the Mohicans. 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Personally, I think you look more like 
                        the Dickens.

                                 NED
                        Dave!? Dave Farragut!? You ol’ sonofa--

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Commander Farragut. And you’re in a world 
                        of trouble, Ned.

                                 NED
                        The world I know best, old friend.
                                 FARRAGUT
                        Maybe not much longer. There’s a dozen 
                        bullets and a firing squad just itchin’ 
                        to introduce you to a new one.

           INT. MILITARY CARRIAGE - MOVING, AND VERY BUMPY - LATER

           The 19th Century equivalent of a government limo. Farragut 
           and Ned are inside facing each other.

                                 NED
                        Just like old times, only it was usually 
                        me getting you out of a fix. But I 
                        appreciate it just the same. So if you’ll 
                        just drop me off, I’ll disappear all 
                        quiet like.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        I’m not helping you escape, Ned. That’s 
                        not what this is about.

                                 NED
                        Then I’ll help myself.

           He reaches for the door handle. Locked. 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        You’re a deserter. The United States 
                        government does not take that lightly.

                                 NED
                        I didn’t desert. I retired. Unofficially.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        And unhonorably. I’ve never known you to 
                        run from a fight.

                                 NED
                        Who said anything about running? 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Then why were you on a Canadian whaler?

                                 NED
                        Trying to earn enough money for a patch 
                        of land so I could disappear and mind my 
                        own business.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        That didn’t work out so well.

                                 NED
                        Such is my luck. 
                                 FARRAGUT
                        What would you say if I told you I could 
                        get you released from prison with a full 
                        pardon? 

                                 NED
                        I’d say things that sound too good to be 
                        true usually make you dead or want you to 
                        marry ‘em. 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        All you have to do is join me on a 
                        hunting expedition.

                                 NED
                        A hunting expedition.
                          (suspicious)
                        What’s the catch?

           The carriage comes to a stop.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        The catch, old friend --

           A NAVY SOLDIER opens the carriage door. Farragut steps out, 
           followed by Ned. They are now standing --

           INT. NAVAL SHIPYARD HANGAR - DAY

           -- before an awesome frigate warship: the ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 
           SPARKS fly as Naval mechanics, engineers, and workers weld 
           and fit the hull with IRON PLATING. 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        -- is something very, very big.

           INT. FARRAGUT’S OFFICE - LATER

           A “pressbox” overlooking the ship’s retrofit. 

                                 NED
                        All this to find some phantom monster?

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Phantom? You saw the thing. And it’s a 
                        damn bit of luck you did. If not, I doubt 
                        I could’ve done anything to save your 
                        neck. 

                                 NED
                        I don’t know what I saw.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Your shipmates saw it plain as day.
                                 NED
                        They’ve been known to see Mermaids too, 
                        depending on how much they had to drink.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Then what was it?

           Ned watches as a LARGE CANNON is hoisted onto the ship below.

                                 NED
                        Something that probably ought to be left 
                        alone.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        That’s no longer an option. 

           Farragut walks over to the large WORLD MAP, the oceans 
           covered with PINS.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Thirty-six sightings in the past year. 
                        Half of them in the past two months. It’s 
                        been seen in every ocean. Witnessed by 
                        fishermen, merchant marines, whalers --

           He pulls out one of the pins.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        That’s you.
                          (continuing)
                        And whatever it is, it’s getting more 
                        aggressive. On March 5th it tore the 
                        rudder of the Harper Goff. Two weeks 
                        later the British warship Tonnant went up 
                        like a powder keg. Survivors said it was 
                        attacked from below. Then four weeks ago, 
                        the Waylander, a passenger ship with two 
                        hundred American souls on board, 
                        disappeared without a trace.

                                 NED
                        Those are rough seas. It doesn’t take a 
                        monster to make a ship disappear.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        She disappeared in the same waters where 
                        you saw the thing. And only a day later. 

           He pours a couple of BRANDIES. Hands Ned a glass.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        The people are demanding an answer, Ned. 
                        I’ve been ordered to find that answer. 
                        And to kill it if I can.
           Ned stares into his drink.

                                 NED
                        And if I say no?

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Then your fate is out of my hands. Most 
                        likely you’ll be court-martialed and 
                        executed.

           Not a tough decision. Ned downs his brandy. Smooth.

                                 NED
                        Does this mean I have to call you 
                        “Commander”?

                                 FARRAGUT
                          (smiling; relieved)
                        Only in front of the crew.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR (BROOKLYN PIER) - ONE WEEK LATER

           The iron-clad, 72-gunned ABRAHAM LINCOLN is docked at the 
           pier. NAVY DOCK WORKERS load the cargo hold with crates.

           ON THE DOCKS

           Reporters, well-wishers. Many read NEWSPAPERS. One headline: 
           “NAVY HERO FARRAGUT VOWS TO CAPTURE BEAST DEAD OR ALIVE.” 

           Another: “WORLD RENOWNED MARINE EXPERT TO JOIN MONSTER HUNT.” 
           Accompanied by a photo of “the distinguished Prof. Aronnax.”

           JULIE, an attractive girl in her early twenties, lowers her 
           newspaper, watches as a CARRIAGE pulls up. Dozens of 
           REPORTERS and SPECTATORS descend upon it.

                                 REPORTERS (O.S.)
                        Professor Aronnax! Professor Aronnax!

           The carriage door opens. PROFESSOR PIERRE ARONNAX steps out. 
           He’s nebbishly handsome, in his early thirties. Wire-rimmed 
           glasses. A little uptight, very meticulous. 

           Dozens of FLASHES ignite from WOODEN BOX CAMERAS. Aronnax is 
           taken aback by the attention, by the sudden celebrity. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Professor Aronnax! Do you really think 
                        you’re going to find the monster?
                                 ARONNAX
                        Monster may be a bit of hyperbole. But, 
                        yes, I believe we will find the creature 
                        and classify it accordingly.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Professor Aronnax!?

           Julie works her way to Aronnax. She’s wearing as sexy a dress 
           as you’re likely to find in 1867. Aronnax is smitten. 

                                 JULIE
                        I’m a great admirer of your work.

           She holds out a copy of Aronnax’s THICK TOME, The Mysteries 
           of the Great Oceanic Depths. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        You’ve...read my book?

                                 JULIE
                        I want to join you on your expedition. 
                        I’m a very hard worker and a good 
                        proofreader. Ask me to spell anything!

                                 ARONNAX
                        I’m terribly flattered. But it is not my 
                        expedition. I am an invited guest of the 
                        United States government. 

           A bald, round Peter Lorre-esque head pokes out of the 
           carriage, glares jealously at Julie. He is Aronnax’s CONSEIL.

                                 CONSEIL
                        And the professor already has an 
                        assistant.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Yes. Indeed I do.
                          (leans into Julie)
                        But nowhere near as charming. 

                                 DOCK WORKER
                        Any luggage, Sir?

           Aronnax motions to a flatbed wagon following the carriage. On 
           it: THREE LARGE WARDROBE-SIZED TRUNKS.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Conseil, if you wouldn’t mind, go with 
                        this gentleman and see to it that our 
                        luggage is handled properly. I’ll meet 
                        you on board.
           Conseil steps out. Aronnax turns back to Julie --

                                 ARONNAX
                        Perhaps when I return --

           -- but she has disappeared into the crowd.

           EXT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN - DECK - SAME

           Ned relaxes on a cable spool, sharpening his harpoon, 
           watching the crowd down below. Farragut joins him.

                                 NED
                        You sure know how to throw yourself a 
                        going away party, Commander. Hope we 
                        don’t disappoint them all.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Then make sure your aim is as sharp as 
                        that point. 

           Farragut pats him on the shoulder, steps onto the helm. 

           INT. DOCK WAREHOUSE - SAME

           Conseil stands beside Aronnax’s trunks as a NAVAL INSPECTOR 
           examines them. Inside the first one: dozens of books.

                                 CONSEIL
                        The professor always travels with his 
                        library.

           Inspector closes the case, slaps an “INSPECTED” sticker on 
           the outside. Opens the second one: several bottles of WINE.

                                 CONSEIL
                        And his spirits.

           “INSPECTED.” The third trunk is labeled: “WARNING: FRAGILE.”

                                 CONSEIL
                        And his pets.

           Inspector cautiously opens the last trunk, revealing: dozens 
           of SPECIMEN JARS containing creepy preserved sea creatures. 

           Inspector examines one up close and--CHEAP SCARE!--a tentacle 
           smashes against the glass. He slams the trunk. “INSPECTED.”

           Inspector walks away. And Julie appears.

                                 JULIE
                        Likes to travel light, does he?
                                 CONSEIL
                        What do you want?

           WHACK! She clobbers him in the head with Aronnax’s hefty 
           book. Conseil’s eyes cross, he falls to the ground. Out cold. 

                                 JULIE
                        Your job.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - SUNSET

           The Abraham Lincoln is far out to sea. BLACK SMOKE belches 
           out of it’s two FUNNELS.

           INT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN - GALLEY - SAME

           Ned, Farragut, and other crew members look bored as Aronnax 
           lectures. He seems nervous, absent-minded. SKETCHES of 
           BIZARRE MYTHICAL CREATURES hang on the wall behind him.

                                 ARONNAX
                        ...and after examining these different 
                        hypotheses and making a careful study of 
                        the drawings made by eye witnesses, we 
                        must admit...
                          (shuffling papers)
                        I’m terribly sorry, I’m a bit 
                        disorganized without my assistant, who 
                        seems to have missed the boat or...here 
                        it is. Yes.
                          (reading)
                        “...we must admit, all other suppositions 
                        having been refuted, the existence of a 
                        marine animal of enormous power, the 
                        likes of which has never been seen 
                        before.”

           His revelation is greeted with blank looks and snickers.

                                 NED
                        That’s your theory? Something that “has 
                        never been seen before”? 

                                 ARONNAX
                        Perhaps you’d care to offer one.

                                 NED
                        I prefer facts, professor. So how ‘bout I 
                        just keep my mouth shut and let you put 
                        all the wind in our sails.

           More snickers. Tough crowd.
                                 ARONNAX
                        I am not foolish enough to pretend that I 
                        know every one of Nature’s creatures. We 
                        have barely scratched the surface of our 
                        seas. In fact, I have in my very 
                        possession several specimens -- creatures 
                        that washed ashore or got tangled in 
                        fishing nets -- that had never before 
                        been seen by human eye.

           He unlocks the standing trunk. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        I’ll wager that no one here has ever seen 
                        creatures such as these--

           He swings the door open. Every jaw drops...

           ...as Julie stumbles out, holding an empty bottle of wine and 
           clearly drunk as a skunk. Her speech is slurred.

                                 JULIE
                        It’s about time. I hate drinking alone. 
                        In a box.

                                 ARONNAX
                        You! What did you do with Conseil!?

                                 JULIE
                        I put him to sleep with a good book.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Aronnax! Would you mind explaining what 
                        this girl is doing on my ship!?

                                 ARONNAX
                        I’m terribly sorry. I met her this 
                        morning. She’s an admirer of my work --

                                 JULIE
                        I never even heard of you until 
                        yesterday, professor Arrrrnnx.

                                 ARONNAX
                        But...you read my book.

                                 JULIE
                        I tried to. A bit dry for my taste. I 
                        prefer a little more derring-do. And I 
                        like them to end with a kiss.

           She leans into the professor like she might very well kiss 
           him. Then she sways back.
                                 ARONNAX
                        It’s not a penny dreadful! 

           He recognizes the wine bottle in her hand.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Is that my ‘57 Bordeaux!? Do you have any 
                        idea how valuable that is...was!? I was 
                        saving it for a special occasion!

           Julie BURPS. Hands him the bottle.

                                 JULIE
                        Congratulations.

           Ned and the others are laughing now, enjoying the show. 
           Farragut, however: not amused. 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Who are you!? Why are you on my ship!?

                                 JULIE
                        My name is --

           She teeters in front of Ned. He catches her before she falls. 
           She smiles up at him. A wee crush perhaps? 

                                 JULIE
                        -- Julie. Julie Fleischer.

           Ned offers no reaction, but Aronnax looks a little jealous.

                                 JULIE
                        My father...was on the Waylander.

           Julie closes her eyes and rests her head against Ned’s chest. 
           She’s out cold. The mood is suddenly very somber. 

           EXT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN - NIGHT

           Rough Seas. In the distance, not far from the Lincoln, as if 
           stalking it: a GLOWING SHADOW beneath the tumultuous waves...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN - DECK - NEXT MORNING

           A gathering of SAILORS. Sounds of REVELRY. One SAILOR stands 
           behind a new deck-mounted Sven Foyn HARPOON CANNON. He FIRES! 
           A blast sends the HARPOON rocketing across the deck...

           THWACK! It stabs into the mast, six inches above a PLAYING 
           CARD target. CHEERS erupt. 
                                 BOOKIE SAILOR
                        And now, the man who will challenge the 
                        machine! The King of the Harpooners, the 
                        mighty slayer of serpents and lancer of 
                        ladies: Ned Land!

           Ned steps forward, shirt off (and he’s ripped, ladies!). He 
           holds his harpoon over his shoulder. Focuses on the card. 
           This is it. The big showdown. He takes aim...

           A YOUNG SAILOR runs into the crowd.

                                 YOUNG SAILOR
                        She’s waking up! She’s waking up!

           Everyone forgets the contest and runs after the young sailor. 

           Ned is left standing alone with his stick in his hand.

           He launches the harpoon. THWACK! Dead center in the card. 

           ON DECK - ELSEWHERE

           Sailors gather around a PORTHOLE, jumping up and down, 
           pushing each other aside to catch a glimpse inside.

           INT. ARONNAX’S CABIN - SAME

           The other side of the porthole. Julie stirs in the bed. 
           Aronnax sits in a chair across from her.

                                 JULIE
                        God. I feel awful. It’s like the whole 
                        world is one big wave.

           Aronnax stands, blocking the Sailors’ view. He hears the 
           resulting HUBBUB, turns and sees FACES pressed against the 
           glass. Aronnax yanks the curtains shut. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        Perhaps that’s because you’re on a ship.

                                 JULIE
                        Right. I remember...someone catching me. 
                        It wasn’t you though. Who was he?

                                 ARONNAX
                        Ned Land. He’s a harpooner. And not a 
                        very well-mannered man.

                                 JULIE
                        Yet somehow I ended up in your bed.

           Aronnax looks defensive, embarrassed. 
                                 ARONNAX
                        You were ill. I have medical experience.

           He hands her a GLASS OF WATER. She takes a long drink.

                                 JULIE
                        Sorry about your jars of fish.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Rare bio-aquatic specimens.

                                 JULIE
                        And your wine.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Yes, well, at least someone enjoyed it.

                                 JULIE
                        And your assistant.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Can you spell “nuisance,” Miss Fleischer?

           Julie suddenly gets very serious. Loses all charm.

                                 JULIE
                        I want answers, professor, just like you. 
                          (beat)
                        Only I don’t believe in monsters.

           A COMMOTION outside. People running. Barking orders. 

           EXT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN - DECK - LATER

           Farragut is at the HELM bellowing commands. Sailors scramble 
           to lower the SAILS. Others scurry up into the CROW’S NESTS. 

                                 NED
                        Why are we slowing?

                                 FARRAGUT
                        This is where the Waylander went down. 

           EXT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN - LATER

           FIVE SAILORS suit up in HEAVY-FOOTERS -- bulky, old- 
           fashioned canvas diving suits with round brass helmets.

           At the same time a bizarre ANTHROPOMORPHIC METAL SUIT is 
           lowered onto the deck. It looks like ROBBY THE ROBOT. 

                                 NED
                        What the hell is that thing?
                                 NAVAL ENGINEER
                        The Iron Duke. A fully-articulated diving 
                        suit with self-contained air supply and 
                        communication system. 

                                 NED
                        Someone actually goes in that tin can?

           Ned can tell by Farragut’s look that he is that someone.

                                 NED
                        Oh no. Forget it. Send the professor 
                        down. He’s the fish expert.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Don’t be such a baby.

           Everyone turns to see Julie (in a SAILOR UNIFORM and CAP) 
           approaching with Aronnax. She could easily pass for a young 
           sailor. Except she can’t help but size up Ned’s sixpack.

                                 NED
                        Then maybe you’d like to try it on?

                                 JULIE
                        I’d be happy too.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Aronnax! Miss Fleischer is supposed to be 
                        confined to your cabin!

                                 ARONNAX
                        Yes. And if I may have a quick word --

           Aronnax steps up to Farragut, whispers so only he can hear.

                                 ARONNAX
                        With all due respect, Commander, this is 
                        her father’s grave site.

           Farragut considers this for a moment. Turns to Julie --

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Do not get used to this freedom, Miss 
                        Fleischer. You have one hour. 

                                 JULIE
                        Thank you, Commander.

                                 FARRAGUT
                          (back to Ned)
                        I need you down there, Ned. You’re the 
                        best tracker I know. You’ll see things a 
                        hundred other eyes would pass right by. 
                                 NED
                        On land! Not the ocean floor!

                                 FARRAGUT
                        I’ve never known you to pass up a chance 
                        for a little adventure.

                                 NED
                        Forget it. We’re not kids anymore. You 
                        can’t just say “I dare you” and I’ll run 
                        off and do any ol’ damn fool thing.

           A beat. 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        I dare you.

           EXT. THE OCEAN FLOOR - LATER

           A CRAB scuttles across the sand. An IRON FOOT crushes it. 

           Ned is inside the IRON DUKE, lumbering across the ocean 
           floor. A COMMUNICATION TUBE is all that connects him to the 
           ship. (We see his face through the Duke’s “face” porthole.)

           He’s followed by the heavy-footed DIVERS, tethered to the 
           ship with their UMBILICAL AIR HOSES.

                                 NED
                        All I wanted was one lousy steak. 

                                 FARRAGUT’S VOICE
                          (faint and echo-y)
                        Do you see anything?

           EXT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN - DECK - SAME

           Farragut holds a VOICE-PIPE that allows him to speak and 
           listen to Ned. 

                                 NED’S VOICE
                        Yes. There seems to be...an enormous... 
                        amount of water.

           EXT. THE OCEAN FLOOR - SAME

           Ned lumbers forward. The Heavy-Footers reach the end of their 
           ropes. Literally. Ned soldiers on without them, past a 
           massive rock formation. A WALL OF FISH swim by. 

           After they pass, Ned sees the BOW of a ship directly in front 
           of him. “W-A-Y-L-A-N-D-E-R.” A big gaping HOLE in its side. A 
           dozen SHARKS swim above the wreckage.
                                 NED
                        She’s down here. Something got to her 
                        alright. 

           INT. WAYLANDER HULL (UNDER WATER) - LATER

           Ned steps through the hole, looks around. The HOLD is filled 
           with THRASHED and OPENED CRATES. 

                                 NED
                        I’m in the cargo hold. Looks like the 
                        place was ransacked before it went down.

           Ned looks around. A DECOMPOSING BODY falls in front of him. 

           Then he see a STRANGE LOOKING RIFLE-GUN. He picks it up with 
           the Duke’s PINCER HAND. Pulls the trigger. 

           PFFT! A pellet fires out. When it hits the ship, BLUE FINGERS 
           OF ELECTRICITY spread out from the point of impact. WTF!?

           EXT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN - DECK - SAME

           A BELL CLANGS. In the CROW’S NEST, a LOOKOUT rings the bell. 

                                 CROW’S NEST SAILOR
                        Ahoy! The thing itself! Abeam to leeward!

           Everyone rushes to leeward. Farragut peers through a LOOKING 
           GLASS, sees a LONG WAKE made by a DARK SHADOW a mile away.

                                 FARRAGUT
                          (into Voice-pipe)
                        Ned, something’s coming your way! Get 
                        everyone back to the ship!

           INT. WAYLANDER HULL (UNDER WATER) - SAME

           Ned lumbers toward the hole. He is just about to step out 
           when -- a GREAT WHITE SHARK rams its head in, JAWS WIDE OPEN! 

           The shark clamps down on IRON DUKE, drives Ned back inside.

           He is jerked all over as the shark tries to get a piece o’ 
           him. Ned drops the gun. His communication cable is severed. 

           EXT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN - SAME

           The Lincoln prepares for war. All seventy-two cannons are 
           sticking out of their firing holes. Men are lined up on the 
           deck with guns. The harpoon-cannon is ready. 

           Aronnax and Julie watch the approaching shadow. 
                                 JULIE
                        Any idea what it is?

                                 ARONNAX
                        Fast. Very very fast.

           Farragut looks to a group of SAILORS manning the oxygen 
           cables and dive platform.

                                 FARRAGUT
                          (into voice-pipe)
                        Ned? What’s going on? Where are you?

           A COMM. SAILOR reels in the SEVERED communication cable. 

                                 FIRST MATE
                        The creature is in range, Commander.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Aronnax, take Miss Fleischer to your 
                        cabin. Both of you stay there. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        I need to observe--

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Take her now! That’s an order!

           Decision time. 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Fire at will!

           INT. WAYLANDER HULL (UNDER WATER) - SAME

           The shark flings Ned across the hold. He lands near the 
           strange gun. As the shark comes at him, Ned gets a grip, 
           presses the trigger and--

           PFFFHT! A PELLET hits the shark. Engulfed it in the BLUE 
           FINGERS of ELECTRICITY. The shark writhes in agony, dies.

           Ned looks relieved. Then he notices: BUBBLES coming from his 
           suit. A PUNCTURE. Not good. 

           Then a CANNON BALL smashes though the hull. Really not good.

           EXT. OCEAN FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Ned steps out of the hole to find himself in a war zone. 
           CANNON BALLS drop all around him!

           The Heavy-Footers are fleeing as fast as their lead feet will 
           take them. And coming up fast behind them --
           THE DARK SHADOW

           Ned stops and stares. As it gets closer it slowly takes 
           shape, becomes recognizable...

           ...and passes right over him. This is no sea monster. It is a 
           man-made vessel. Ladies and gentlemen, I present --

           THE NAUTILUS

           It’s enormous. Just keeps going and going. The metal plating 
           and fins make it look like a menacing CREATURE OF PREY. 

           CANNON BALLS bounce uselessly off its hull. 

           Within moments the Nautilus passes over the Divers. Slices 
           through their umbilical hoses. Condemning them.

           One Diver’s hose gets caught in the Nautilus PROPELLER. The 
           attached diver is pulled into the blades for a grisly demise.

           EXT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN - SAME

           The cannons continue their assault as the Nautilus closes in. 
           The HARPOON CANNON fires. The metal blade PINGS off its hide.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Prepare for impact!

           EXT. OCEAN FLOOR - SAME

           Ned watches helplessly as the Nautilus slices through the 
           Lincoln’s hull. An EXPLOSION erupts from the volatile cargo.

           INT. ARONNAX’S QUARTERS - SAME

           Aronnax and Julie. Thrown on top of each other by the impact. 

                                 JULIE
                        It attacked us!

                                 ARONNAX
                        Yes, well, there’s no cause for panic. 
                        This ship’s hull is impenetrable. 

           The ship GROANS, begins to tilt. 

           EXT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN - DECK - LATER

           Chaos. Sailors scramble to put out FIRES, to stave off the 
           inevitable. LIFEBOATS are readied.

           Aronnax drags his trunks onto the deck. 
                                 JULIE
                        We’re going down, Professor! Maybe it’s 
                        time to part with your luggage!

           As they run toward the LIFEBOATS another EXPLOSION rocks the 
           ship and the LIFEBOATS are engulfed in FLAMES! 

           The Lincoln tilts to a steeper angle. Aronnax loses his grip 
           on one of the trunks. It slides into the water, floats away. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        My books!

           Julie kicks the latch off the other trunk. The lid flies 
           open. Wine bottles fall out, roll down the deck.

                                 ARONNAX
                        My wine! What are you doing!?

                                 JULIE
                        Getting us off this ship. 

           EXT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN - DECK - SECONDS LATER 

           Aronnax and Julie are sitting in the empty trunk, SCREAMING, 
           sliding down the deck like they’re on a flume ride! They 
           close the lid and -- SPLASH! -- they’re in the water.

           EXT. OCEAN FLOOR - SAME

           Ned, GASPING for air, watches in horror as the Lincoln sinks 
           before his very eyes. And SHARKS speed toward the buffet.

           It’s a spectacular sight. And Ned’s death knell. He’s 
           stranded. Almost out of air. 

           And then the Nautilus returns. 

           A LARGE ROUND WINDOW on its side spirals open.

           In that window: the BACK-LIT SILHOUETTE of A SOLITARY MAN. 
           Observing the devastation. He seems to look right at Ned. 

                                 NED
                        Who...

           NED BLACKS OUT.

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - HOURS LATER

           Dense FOG. Julie and Aronnax float amidst the debris.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Hello!? Is anyone out there!?
           Silence. While Aronnax continues calling out, Julie fishes a 
           book out of the sea. The Last of the Mohicans.

           Julie opens the cover. “To Ned. Welcome Aboard. ‘Commander’ 
           Dave” is inscribed inside.

           Suddenly, the sea begins to RUMBLE. A METAL TAIL-FIN rises 
           beneath the trunk, spilling Julie and Aronnax into the sea. 

           They grab onto the fin. Up, up, up they go as the Nautilus 
           surfaces beneath them. 

           Aronnax is standing on a NAUTILUS SHELL design protruding 
           from the tail fin, he pulls Julie up. They see the entire 
           Nautilus spread out beneath them. 

                                 JULIE
                        Still believe in monsters?

           A HATCH opens below. Several CREWMEN climb out. Various 
           nationalities. LANGUAGE unknown. They inspect the ship...

           ...and see Aronnax and Julie (who still looks like a sailor). 
           The crewmen YELL to each other, surround the tail. 

                                 ARONNAX
                          (to Julie)
                        Let me handle this. I may not have Ned’s 
                        brawn, but I am well versed in diplomacy.
                          (he stands tall)
                        Ahoy! I am Professor Pierre Aronnax of 
                        the Paris Museum of Natural History and 
                        we are both innocent civilians lost at 
                        sea. You are required by international 
                        law to take us to the nearest port.

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           PITCH BLACK

           Quiet. Until -- GASP! Followed by rapid BREATHING. Shivering. 
           Then FRANTIC MOVEMENT. Like that of a caged animal. 

           A door opens. LIGHT enters. The animal is Ned. Julie and 
           Aronnax are thrown into his cage, both shivering.

           The door slams. PITCH BLACK again. It all happens fast.

                                 JULIE
                        Ned? Is that you? 

                                 NED
                        Who’s there?
                                 JULIE
                        Julie. And the Professor. We thought you 
                        were dead.

                                 NED
                        Who says I ain’t?

                                 ARONNAX
                        Because if you’re dead, we’re all dead. 
                        And I feel very much alive...

           The ship GROANS. A disturbing sound.

                                 ARONNAX
                        ...for the moment.

                                 NED
                        Where are we?

           And then there was LIGHT. They are inside a SMALL METAL ROOM. 
           One table. Three stools. Illumined by a single LIGHT BULB.

                                 ARONNAX
                        In the belly of the beast, I’m afraid.

                                 JULIE
                        How did you get in here?

                                 NED
                        I...don’t... The Lincoln. I saw her...
                          (realizing)
                        Dave?

           Julie shakes her head.

                                 JULIE
                        I think we’re the only ones who made it.

           She hands Ned the soggy book. Whatever he feels, he locks it 
           inside. Aronnax inspects the room. No sign of a door. He is 
           fascinated by the light bulb.

                                 NED
                        What kind of ship is this?

                                 ARONNAX
                        It appears to be an electric-powered 
                        submersible. A sub-marine ship. Manned by 
                        a crew of many nationalities speaking a 
                        language I’ve never heard before.

           Ned body-slams the wall. 
                                 ARONNAX
                        Don’t waste your energy. These walls are 
                        solid steel. It’s impossible--

           Ned slams into the wall again. 

           The door HISSES, opens, revealing four CREWMEN armed with the 
           strange “electric” rifles: 

           A YOUNG INDIAN (19); a European with a burn-scarred face 
           (SCAR); a bald Asian with an EYE-PATCH; and a South Pacific 
           ISLAND NATIVE with a full body tattoo.

           Eye-Patch and the Native train their rifles on the prisoners, 
           while Scar brings in a stack of CLEAN DRY CLOTHES and three 
           BLANKETS. The Indian follows with three BOWLS OF FOOD. 

           Then they exit without a word; the door seals behind them.

                                 JULIE
                        Last supper?

           Ned rips off his soaked shirt, puts on a clean dry one. 
           Starts to remove his pants when...Aronnax CLEARS HIS THROAT, 
           glances toward Julie. Ned could give a shit.

                                 NED
                        If you see something you haven’t seen 
                        before, give a holler.

           Ned strips off his wet trousers, puts on a clean pair. He 
           sits at the table, sniffs the bowl of stew. Grimaces.

                                 NED
                        Another reason to get off this barge.

           Julie looks at the clothes, looks at the tiny room...and the 
           tiny sink and toilet in the corner.

                                 JULIE
                        Maybe I should request my own room.

                                 NED
                        Good idea. I’m sure all the salty sailors 
                        in this tub would be happy to know 
                        there’s a woman on board. 

           Julie considers her options.

                                 JULIE
                        Turn around.

           Aronnax does. Ned doesn’t. 
                                 NED
                        If I see something I haven’t seen before, 
                        I’ll give a holler.

                                 JULIE
                        Fine.

           She turns her back to Ned, starts to lift her shirt. Aronnax 
           leaps up, grabs a blanket off the pile and holds it up to 
           block the view.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Ned, you are incorrigible.

                                 NED
                        That and about a dozen other fancy words.

           Julie steps out from behind the blanket, wearing the new 
           clothes. A little baggy, but all the better to hide her 
           shape. She puts the SAILOR HAT on, hides her hair. 

                                 JULIE
                        How do I look?

                                 NED
                        Guess that depends on how long these boys 
                        have been stuck inside this ship.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - NEXT MORNING 

           Ned, Aronnax, and Julie are asleep on the floor. Julie’s head 
           on Aronnax’s shoulder. 

           Aronnax awakens. Notes Julie’s position. Smiles briefly. 
           Until she rolls over and places her head on Ned’s shoulder. 

           CLANG. The door opens, revealing the same four armed CREWMEN 
           carrying SHACKLES. 

           INT. NAUTILUS - SALON/LIBRARY - LATER

           Ned, Aronnax, and Julie -- hands shackled -- are escorted 
           into a large, ornate room that looks like a library. Or a 
           museum. It is filled with BOOK, SCULPTURES, PAINTINGS. 
           Definitely not what they were expecting to find on a ship.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Incredible. There are enough rare 
                        antiquities in this room to make it the 
                        envy of any museum. 

                                 NED
                        You’re sure we’re on a boat?
           Suddenly a large section of the parlor wall spirals open, 
           revealing a large CONVEX OBSERVATION WINDOW and the ocean 
           depths on the other side.

           Then a panel beneath the floor slides away at the same time 
           revealing a GLASS BOTTOM. Everywhere they look: endless sea.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Quite sure.

           They step up to the window, witness the mysteries of the deep 
           illumined by the ship’s exterior lights.

                                 PROFESSOR
                        All my life I’ve dreamed of such a view.

                                 NEMO (O.S.)
                        If you gaze long into the abyss, the 
                        abyss will eventually gaze back into you.

           The man-we-will-know-as-NEMO descends a SPIRAL STAIRCASE. 
           Step by clanging step. He reaches the bottom of the stairs 
           and stands in front of the opposite window. A silhouette 
           backlit by the light outside.

                                 ARONNAX
                        You speak English.

                                 NEMO
                        When it serves me.

                                 NED
                        I saw you. Out there.
                          (realizes...)
                        You saved me.

                                 NEMO
                        I saved the armor suit. You happened to 
                        be in it. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        Who are you?

           Nemo steps forward into the light and we see he is none other 
           than PRINCE DAKKAR. Ten years older. Hardened. Long hair, 
           beard. Not dressed like a prince, but like a rogue warrior. A 
           SWORD by his side. 

                                 NEMO
                        I am no one. I do not exist. Nor does 
                        this ship exist. It is most unfortunate 
                        that you have seen what you have.
                                 NED
                        Unfortunate!? You destroyed our ship! You 
                        sent two hundred men to their grave!

                                 NEMO
                        Two hundred men of war who attacked me 
                        without provocation. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        I am a scientist, not a soldier, and we 
                        were on a scientific expedition. We 
                        thought you were some predatory creature. 
                        The whole world thought --

                                 NEMO
                        Do not be naive, Professor Aronnax of the 
                        Paris Museum of Natural History. They 
                        were carrying enough explosives to 
                        destroy a city. They knew exactly what 
                        they were looking for.

           Ned and Aronnax both feel like complete suckers. Were they 
           duped? Nemo steps up to Ned, scrutinizing him.

                                 NEMO
                        And what were you looking for?

                                 NED
                        A quick buck, Captain. Nothing more.

                                 NEMO
                        There are no captains on this ship. Here 
                        beneath the sea we are all equal.

                                 NED
                        Well the one who calls all the shots and 
                        has the nicest room on the boat -- I call 
                        that one captain, Captain.

           Nemo glares at him -- this one’s trouble. Then he steps up to 
           Julie. In her baggy clothes and sailor’s hat she is easily 
           mistaken for a young lad. She glances down, avoids his gaze.

                                 NEMO
                        You are a soldier are you not?

           Aronnax quickly steps in front of her, protective.

                                 ARONNAX
                        This is my assistant James. And I assure 
                        you neither he nor the rest of us had any 
                        malicious intent toward you or your ship. 
                        We are guilty of no crimes, and I insist 
                        you release us.
                                 NEMO
                        I am inclined to release you back to the 
                        sea where I found you.

                                 ARONNAX
                        That would be murder! There are laws --

                                 NEMO
                        The laws of nations are meaningless to 
                        me. You have stumbled upon a secret that 
                        cannot be known. Whatever fate I choose 
                        for you, that secret will remain beneath 
                        the sea.

           Nemo issues a command in the foreign language. The crewmen 
           grab the prisoners --

                                 NED
                        I’ll choose my own fate if ya don’t mind.

           -- and with that Ned head-butts Scar in the nose. In the next 
           ten seconds, several things happen:

           Ned grabs a marble BUST and WHACKS Eye-Patch across the head. 
           The tattooed Native fires at Ned...

           Ned leaps up and grabs a steel girder in the ceiling. The 
           pellet just misses him and strikes the wall, electrifies it. 

           Ned swings and kicks the Native, sends him across the room. 
           Then grabs a chair and SMASHES it against the observation 
           window. It bounces right off.

           Nemo BARKS a COMMAND into a VOICE-PIPE. Then draws his sword 
           as Ned pulls over a bookcase, cuts him off.

                                 NED
                          (to Julie and Aronnax)
                        Jump in at any time!

           Ned grabs a another chair and uses it as a ram/shield to 
           charge through the door...

                                 ARONNAX
                        Where does he think he’s going to go?

           INT. NAUTILUS - SAME

           Ned runs down a labyrinthine metal grated corridor...turns a 
           corner and encounters three more ARMED CREWMAN. 

           Pellets ELECTRIFY the walls all around him. Several of them 
           hit the chair, igniting it.
           Ned hurls the chair, runs to the other end of the corridor, 
           more CREWMEN appear. 

           Ned rushes through an open door, out of the frying pan and...

           INT. NAUTILUS KITCHEN - SAME

           ...into the kitchen. Boiling pots. SHARK carcasses. FISH 
           HEADS. LOBSTER tank. OCTOPUS and EELS hangings from hooks. 

           Ned is almost choked by the smell. A startled COOK hurls a 
           MEAT CLEAVER at him. Ned barely avoids the flying blade.

           The Cook reaches for several KNIVES. Ned grabs a hollowed-out 
           GIANT TORTOISE SHELL and uses it as a shield. Knives stick to 
           it like darts to a board.

           Then he hurls the shell like a discus, bringing a shelf full 
           of pans crashing down on the Cook.

           PFFT! An ELECTRIC PELLET strikes the wall next to Ned. Two 
           crewmen have entered the kitchen. 

           Ned grabs a dead HAMMERHEAD by the tail and swings it at 
           them. Knocks over a BOILING CAULDRON of CHOWDER. The crewmen 
           slip, fall into the hanging eels and octopuses.

           Ned dives through the door...

           INT. NAUTILUS CORRIDOR - SAME

           ...and back into the metal corridor. CLANGING FOOTSTEPS 
           approach. Ned climbs up a spiral staircase...

           INT. NAUTILUS - UPPER LEVEL

           ...and emerges inside an oval MAP ROOM. A GIANT GLOBE is in 
           the middle, suspended on a pole. Just past it: a door. Ned 
           swings it open...

           INT. HELM - SAME

           ...and enters the brains of the Nautilus. Two viewing 
           windows. Steering wheel. Gears. And two startled NAVIGATORS. 

                                 NED
                        Don’t mean to interrupt, but could you 
                        point me to the first class cabins?

           The Navigators look at each other then rush forward; Ned 
           slams the door in their faces, grabs an AXE off the wall and 
           jams it in the door handle.

           Three more CREWMEN run down the corridor toward the map room.
           Ned kicks the pole that holds the globe in place. It drops, 
           rolls and sticks in the door blocking the entrance.

           Ned drops down the stairwell...

           INT. NAUTILUS - MAIN LEVEL

           ...and sees the original four crewman coming his way. He 
           continues going down the stairwell. Down, down, down...

           INT. ENGINE/FURNACE ROOM - SAME

           ...and drops onto a metal grated catwalk above the sprawling 
           hellish bowels of the Nautilus. 

           Giant GEARS and SPROCKETS turn and churn, moving the massive 
           PROPELLER SHAFT. Six crewmen shovel coal into a giant 
           FURNACE/POWER GENERATOR.

           Ned works his way across the catwalk as the four Crewmen drop 
           down behind him. Three others appear in front of him. 

           Ned considers his fleeting options...leaps off the catwalk 
           and hooks his shackle chain on a giant sprocket tooth. 

           ON THE CATWALK

           Two crewman take aim, fire. 

           ON NED

           Pellets strike all around him. The sprocket carries him 
           toward another sprocket. The teeth of the two sprockets 
           intersect and slice through Ned’s chain.

           He drops down onto the propeller shaft. Slides/surfs along 
           its slippery surface...

           ...but loses his balance and falls onto a pile of COAL, 
           slides down to the base and sees:

           SERKO. A gigantic African crewman with tribal scars on his 
           face standing over him with a SHOVEL.

           Serko takes a WHACK at Ned. Ned barely avoids the blow. 

           He grabs a shovel of his own and swings it at Serko’s 
           midsection. It’s like hitting a brick wall. 

           Serko grabs Ned’s severed chains and tosses him like a rag 
           doll back into the coal pile. Then he lifts him up over his 
           head and is about to throw him into the FIERY FURNACE when --
                                 NEMO (O.S.)
                        Serko! Barada nikto!

           Serko hesitates, sees Nemo up above, standing on the catwalk.

           INT. NAUTILUS SALON - LATER

           Ned falls to his knees, writhes in agony, engulfed in the 
           blue fingers of electricity. The ocean abyss is visible 
           beneath him through the glass bottom. 

           Aronnax and Julie watch helplessly as the electric fingers 
           slowly dissipates leaving Ned writhing on the floor in agony. 

                                 NEMO
                        Do not test me again. I am not a 
                        barbarous man...by nature.

           Serko grabs Ned, pulls him to his feet.

                                 NEMO
                        There is no escape from this ship. Where 
                        I travel you will find nothing but 
                        unforgiving seas should you be foolish 
                        enough to try. Any further act of 
                        sedition and I will return all of you to 
                        the sea. Expect no more mercy.

           Nemo bellows a command. Crewmen grab the prisoners. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        How long do you intend to keep us?

                                 NEMO
                        Until I’m ready to reveal myself to the 
                        world.

                                 ARONNAX
                        When will you reveal yourself to us?

           Nemo steps up to the window. Faces the sea.

                                 NEMO
                        You may call me Nemo. This ship is the 
                        Nautilus.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - SAME

           Ned, Julie, and Aronnax are tossed back into their cell. 
           Three concealed bunks are lowered from the wall. The escorts 
           leave; the door seals shut. Ned crawls in a bunk.
                                 ARONNAX
                        Were you trying to get us all killed? You 
                        can’t escape from an underwater ship! 

                                 NED
                        Who says I was trying to escape? I wanted 
                        to see as much of it as I could so we 
                        know what we’re dealing with. 

           Aronnax is silenced; Julie is impressed.

                                 JULIE
                        What are we dealing with?

                                 NED
                        I’d say she’s a hundred yards from bow to 
                        stern. Four levels. We’re on number two. 
                        She’s fueled by coal, and the whole 
                        operation requires about twenty crewmen. 
                        Odds I can work with.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Odds that will get us tossed into the 
                        sea! We need to obey his rules and do as 
                        we are told. This is only temporary.

                                 JULIE
                        How can you be so sure? He’s a cold-
                        blooded murderer, professor. He killed my 
                        father. And every other innocent on the 
                        Waylander. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        We have no reason to believe he had 
                        anything to do with that. 

                                 NED
                        Then explain why I found one of his 
                        stinger guns in its hold.

           News to Aronnax. News to Julie. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        But why would he do such a thing?

                                 NED
                        Because he’s a pirate and a villain. 
                        Probably robbed them blind first.

           Julie looks like she knows something else. But keeps silent. 
           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT - LATER

           The Nautilus sails through the ocean. All the lights inside 
           the ship are out except one --

           INT. NEMO’S QUARTERS - LATER

           Candle lit. A large desk overflows with CHARTS, navigational 
           INSTRUMENTS. Two things to note: A SEPIA-TONED PHOTO of 
           Nemo/Prince Dakkar with his family; and a grimy, water-
           damaged WOODEN BOX.

           In front of a large viewing window there’s a GOLDEN STATUE of 
           the Hindu god SHIVA holding a TRIDENT. 

           Nemo, shirt off, prays in front of the statue, holding his 
           son’s NAUTILUS SHELL in his hands. His back is scarred from 
           three bullet wounds. 

           A KNOCK at the door. Nemo rises. 

           The Cook enters carrying a tray that is overflowing with a 
           small DEAD OCTOPUS. He sets it on Nemo’s desk. Exits.

           Nemo picks up a knife and slices through the octopus’s ink 
           bladder. BLACK INK spills into the tray. 

           Nemo then opens the wooden box and removes --

           AN ANCIENT STONE TABLET

           Crumbling, jagged at the bottom. Nemo pours the ink over its 
           surface, and ANCIENT CUNEIFORM WRITING is revealed.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

           A FISHING BOAT. FISHERMEN haul in their NETS. Filled with 
           TUNA...and the blue CORPSE of a NAVY SAILOR. 

           One of the FISHERMEN sees something off the stern. YELLS.

           The Lincoln’s LARGE STEERING WHEEL floats on the water. 
           Sprawled out on top of the wheel: Farragut’s lifeless body.

           The Fishermen pull him onto the ship. Lay him out. Dead.

                                 FISHERMAN #1
                        Poor bastard.

           A very faint MOAN. Not dead.
                                 FISHERMAN #2
                        Lucky bastard!

           They spring into action to revive him...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. OCEAN DEPTHS - WEEKS LATER

           The Nautilus moves through the ocean terrain, its path 
           illuminated by an electric BEACON at the front of the ship. 

           Two curious HUMPBACK WHALES swim along beside it. One of them 
           peers into the observation window...

                                 ARONNAX (V.O.)
                        It has been weeks since we have seen our 
                        mysterious host, and I am no closer to 
                        understanding what drives him.

           INT. NAUTILUS SALON - SAME

           ...where we see Aronnax sitting in a chair in front of the 
           window, observing, writing in a journal. 

                                 ARONNAX (V.O.)
                        During the day, Miss Fleischer --
                          (he scratches something out)
                        -- my assistant James and I are granted 
                        access to the salon. I am not sure to 
                        what we owe this courtesy, but I am 
                        grateful nevertheless. I have seen 
                        remarkable things, and at times forget 
                        that I am a prisoner.

           Julie examines the library’s artifacts as if she were 
           browsing through a museum...or looking for something.

                                 ARONNAX (V.O.) 
                        I cannot say the same for my companions. 
                        And while we at least have the luxury of 
                        this remarkable room...

           INT. ENGINE/FURNACE ROOM - SAME

           Ned, dripping with sweat, shovels coal alongside Serko.

                                 ARONNAX (V.O.)
                        ...Ned is forced to labor in the bowels 
                        of the ship.
           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Aronnax and Julie eat dinner together, alone in the kitchen. 
           Aronnax has his napkin tucked in his shirt. Ned is escorted 
           in, covered with SOOT.

                                 ARONNAX (V.O.)
                        We dine together every evening, but Ned 
                        grows more and more unpleasant with each 
                        passing day. 

           He grabs Aronnax’s napkin, wipes his sooty face, and stuffs 
           it back in the professor’s shirt. Then he grabs a lobster, 
           tears into it like it’s a drumstick. 

           EXT. NAUTILUS - DECK - NIGHT

           Starry night. The Nautilus has surfaced. Crewmen are working. 
           Ned, Aronnax, and Julie are escorted onto the deck. 

                                 ARONNAX (V.O.)
                        The only contact we have with the outside 
                        world is when the Nautilus surfaces to 
                        replenish its air supply. None of us have 
                        seen daylight since we boarded. 

           Ned observes the STARS...while Serko, now Ned’s full-time 
           “guard,” observes him. 

           INT. SALON - ANOTHER DAY

           Julie sits at the window, making faces at some STRANGE FISH 
           while Aronnax sits beside her sketching it.

                                 ARONNAX (V.O.)
                        But I must admit --

                                 JULIE
                          (reading over his shoulder)
                        -- “I am in no hurry to leave this 
                        magnificent laboratory.” Exactly whose 
                        side are you on, professor? 

           Aronnax slams his journal. Indignant, embarrassed.

                                 ARONNAX
                        The side of reason. If we’re going to be 
                        here for awhile we might as well make the 
                        best of it. It would be a crime against 
                        science not to record what I have seen. 

           Julie grabs his ink pen. Looks at the sharp tip.
                                 JULIE
                        It would be a bigger crime to let a man 
                        get away with murder.

           Aronnax quickly and nervously grabs the pen away from her.

           EXT. NAUTILUS DECK - NIGHT

           Ned, covered in soot, watches as Serko and the other boiler 
           room crew smoke cigars. Serko holds one up as if to offer it. 
           Ned walks over, takes it.

                                 NED
                        Much obliged, Serko. 
                          (he lights up, takes a puff)
                        So what’s your story? How’d you end up 
                        with this motley crew?

                                 SERKO
                        Bad men take me from my home many years 
                        ago. Put many of us in chains to take us 
                        to Nedland’s country. On boat we hear 
                        stories of Man Who Rides in Whale and 
                        frees men from bondage. We pray to God to 
                        send this man. God heard our prayers and 
                        Nemo set us free. This is my home now.
                          (beat)
                        Perhaps God also heard Nedland’s prayers.

                                 NED
                        Prayin’s against my religion. I count on 
                        no one but myself.

           ON JULIE AND ARONNAX

           Standing near the tail. Aronnax takes a deep breath.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Ah. Fresh air. It’s the one thing I truly 
                        miss about the surface.

           CIGAR SMOKE envelopes him as Ned approaches. Aronnax coughs.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Must you spoil everything?

           Ned notices several crewmen stealing glances at Julie.

                                 NED
                        Looks like the fish-heads are starting to 
                        take an interest in our pretty boy.
                          (hands the cigar to Julie)
                        Give it a try. Might put some hair on 
                        your chest.
           She takes a drag on cigar. Blow out a smoke ring. Like a pro.

                                 JULIE
                        Where do you think we are?

                                 NED
                        A long way from home. Unless the stars 
                        have been lying to me, I’d say we’re 
                        somewhere in the Arabian Sea. 

           Julie reacts.

                                 JULIE
                        Are you sure?

           Suddenly the sky lights up in the distance. A ROCKET’S RED 
           GLARE; BOMBS BURSTING in air. 

           Several warships are revealed by the light. Firing at the 
           coast. Flying RED FLAGS with a WHITE CRESCENT and STAR. 

           A flurry of activity sweeps across the deck. Nemo rises up 
           out of a hatch, walks right past Aronnax, Ned, and Julie.

                                 ARONNAX 
                        What’s happening?

                                 NEMO
                        War, Professor. Man’s never ending 
                        struggle against himself. This is what 
                        the surface has to offer.

           Nemo bellows a command to the crew. Several of them grab Ned, 
           Aronnax, and Julie. 

                                 NEMO
                        I’m afraid I must confine you all to your 
                        quarters until further notice.

           Crewmen drag them away. Nemo climbs onto the helm, scans the 
           horizon with his SPYGLASS. 

           INT. HOLDING CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Ned, Aronnax, and Julie are sealed inside their cell. 

                                 NED
                        Those were Ottoman warships. And from the 
                        looks of it, we’re heading into the 
                        Strait of Hormuz. We may not get another 
                        chance like this.
                                 ARONNAX
                        You’re not seriously thinking of trying 
                        to escape!?

                                 NED
                        Done thinking. We’ll be no more than 
                        twenty miles from shore.

                                 JULIE
                        Then it’s true. He does have it.

                                 NED
                        Has what? 

                                 JULIE
                        A map. 

           Off their confused looks --

                                 JULIE
                        My father was an archeologist. He was 
                        working in Ceylon and uncovered a stone 
                        map leading to something buried in Iraq. 
                        He had it with him on the Waylander. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        And you think Nemo has it?

                                 JULIE
                        He’s taking us into the Gulf. It can’t be 
                        a coincidence. 

                                 NED
                        Told you, professor. Your poor 
                        misunderstood genius is just a common 
                        pirate trying to get his hands on a 
                        little booty.

                                 ARONNAX
                        If that’s true --

                                 NED
                        -- then he’s taking this tub to land.

           EXT. PERSIAN GULF - SUNRISE

           The cradle of civilization. The rising sun glistens off the 
           still waters. Less then a mile away: LAND.

           And a hundred meters below the surface:
           THE NAUTILUS

           It maneuvers through a GRAVEYARD of SUNKEN SHIPS from bygone 
           eras. Some with gaping wounds. Some standing on end. 

           INT. HOLDING CELL - SAME

           Ned, Aronnax, and Julie are sound asleep. EMPTY PLATES on 
           their table. The cell door slowly opens.

           Scar stands guard as the Cook retrieves the plates. As he 
           exits and the door starts to close behind him -- 

           Ned’s eye open. He throws a FORK across the room. Perfectly 
           timed so the door closes on it...and doesn’t seal.

           Ned, Julie, and Aronnax leap out of bed. Ned pulls the door 
           open. He takes a quick peek. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        Now what?

                                 NED
                        We wait.

                                 ARONNAX
                        For what?

                                 NED
                        For them to drop anchor.

                                 JULIE
                        Then what?

                                 NED
                        We escape.

                                 ARONNAX
                        What you’re saying is: this escape plan 
                        doesn’t actually come with the plan. 

                                 NED
                        It’s a work in progress. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        So is our demise.

           INT. NAUTILUS HELM - SAME

           The Chief Navigator is at the wheel. Nemo stands in front of 
           the helm’s two “eye” windows. He studies the inky imprint 
           taken from the stone tablet.
           As the Nautilus clears the graveyard of ships, it approaches 
           a sheer rocky land mass. 

                                 NEMO
                        Reduce speed.

           (All dialogue between Nemo and his crew will be in the 
           unknown language and subtitled.)

           Nemo examines the terrain, sees: a small opening at the base 
           of the land mass. It looks like an OPEN SERPENT’S MOUTH.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - SAME

           Ned, Aronnax, and Julie listen as the engines stop. They hear 
           the sound of the RATTLING anchor chains unspooling.

           INT. NAUTILUS - LATER

           Deserted. Quiet. Except for Ned, Julie, and Aronnax moving 
           stealthily down a corridor. The ship seems deserted.

           They reach the HATCH LADDER. Ned starts climbing.

                                 NED
                        Six steps to freedom.

                                 JULIE
                        I’m not leaving.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Neither am I. This is too risky.

                                 NED
                        Have both your brains turned to chowder?

                                 JULIE
                        I’m not leaving without my father’s map. 
                        He was willing to die for it --

                                 NED
                        One person dying for it is enough. We’re 
                        all getting off this ship and we’re 
                        getting off now!

           Ned turns the crank to open a HATCH...and WATER starts to 
           pour in around the seal. Ned quickly tightens the crank.

                                 ARONNAX
                        It would appear we’re still submerged.

                                 NED
                        Thank you, Professor Obvious.
           INT. SALON - LATER

           Ned, Aronnax, and Julie stand in front of the observation 
           window, see: a long line of DIVERS in suits with BRONZE 
           HELMETS, ARMOR PLATING, and BRONZE AIR TANKS marching across 
           the sea floor. They look like aquatic Stormtroopers. 

                                 NED
                        You want your map? Odds are it’s right 
                        out there. And so is our way out of here.

           INT. DIVING CHAMBER - LATER

           A dozen DIVING SUITS are lined along the walls. The bulky 
           Iron John suit sits nearby.

           Ned and Julie are suited up sans helmets. Ned grabs two 
           ELECTRIC RIFLES from a rack. 

                                 NED
                        They fire electrically charged pellets. 
                        On the surface they’ll just sting. A lot. 
                        Underwater, they’re lethal.
                          (hands one to her)
                        So try not to point it in my direction.

           Julie nods. Aims it at the professor standing on a platform 
           above the dive chamber. 

                                 JULIE
                        You’re coming with us.

                                 ARONNAX
                        As much as I’d love to follow you to 
                        certain doom, I think I’ll continue on my 
                        present course, thank you very much. And 
                        besides, who would pull all these fancy 
                        levers if I was down there?

           Julie smiles. Lowers the gun.

                                 JULIE
                        Good luck, Professor.

                                 ARONNAX
                        You too, Miss Fleischer.

                                 JULIE
                        You can call me Julie.

                                 ARONNAX
                        And you can call me Pierre.
           Ned’s had enough of that mush. He places Julie’s helmet over 
           her head, locks it on.

                                 NED
                        As soon as we reach civilization we’ll 
                        send someone to find you.

                                 ARONNAX
                        I’ll be sure to leave a light on.

           Ned puts his helmet on. He and Julie each grab a METAL RING 
           that has been lowered from above. Aronnax pulls a lever and 
           the room fills with water.

           ON NED AND JULIE

           Submerged. The floor retracts beneath them and they are 
           lowered into the sea by the rings...

           EXT. SEA FLOOR - SAME

           They reach the sea floor several meters below the Nautilus. 
           They let go of the rings and follow the path of the other 
           divers.

           A HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD

           Nemo and his crew enter the serpent’s mouth. Inside: stairs 
           carved into the stone. Nemo leads the way...

           INT. SHIMMERING POOL - DAY OR NIGHT?

           A still pool. Then hundreds of BUBBLES disturb the surface as 
           Nemo and his crew rise out of the water like humanoids from 
           the deep. 

           Their helmet lights cut through the blackness, giving us 
           brief glimpses indicating they are inside a stone structure.

           They step out of the pool. Two Crewmen carrying a large 
           “searchlight”-size LANTERN set it on the ground and fire it 
           up. It turns night into day and we see that we are -- 

           INT. SUMERIAN TEMPLE - UNDERGROUND

           A massive stone structure. Buried and unseen for thousands of 
           years. Frightening statues are carved into the stone.

           Nemo removes his helmet. Followed by the others. They stand 
           in awe at what they see.

                                 NATIVE CREWMAN
                        What is this place?
                                 NEMO
                        Ancient Sumeria. No human has set foot 
                        here for 5,000 years.

           Nemo leads his men deeper into the structure.

           INT. TREASURE ROOM - SAME

           Nemo and his crew enter a room filled with hundreds of GOLDEN 
           OBJECTS and PRICELESS JEWELS. A storehouse for all the 
           treasures of a lost civilization...

           ...but Nemo seems to have no interest whatsoever. He motions 
           for his crew to keep moving.

           INT. SHIMMERING POOL - SAME

           Ned and Julie rise out of the pool, remove their helmets. 
           Stare in awe at the sights before them.

                                 JULIE
                        The professor’s gonna be mad when he 
                        finds out he missed this.

                                 NED
                        I’m sure we can find a gift shop 
                        somewhere.

           They proceed deeper into the structure.

           INT. THE INNER CHAMBER

           Nemo and his crew arrive at a large circular room. Seven life-
           size stone statues of HALF-MAN/HALF-FISH DIVINE BEINGS (known 
           as THE SEVEN SAGES) are stationed around the perimeter. 

           He approaches one of the statues. It has a breastplate with a 
           UNIQUE SYMBOL carved into it. Nemo presses the symbol...

           ...and the wall behind the Sage slides opens, revealing --

           A HIDDEN VAULT

           Nemo steps inside. A STONE ALTAR in the middle of the room 
           holds a STONE “KEY” (a cylindrical object about eight inches 
           tall with ancient writing carved on its surface). 

           Nemo picks up the stone, holds it like it’s sacred. 

           INT. TREASURE ROOM - SAME

           Ned and Julie enter the treasure room. The jaw-dropping 
           display of wealth stops them dead in their tracks.
                                 JULIE
                        I think we found the gift shop.

                                 NED
                        “X” marks the spot. Looks like your 
                        father’s map was right on the money. 

           Julie picks up a GOLDEN, JEWEL-ENCRUSTED DAGGER. 

           INT. INNER CHAMBER - SAME

           Nemo places the stone key in a METAL CASE. Crewman retrieve 
           the other stones from the other vaults... 

           INT. SEVENTH VAULT - SAME

           The Native crewman stares at the stone altar. It’s EMPTY. No 
           stone key. He looks around as if it may have fallen off...

           INT. TREASURE ROOM - SAME

           Ned examines a LARGE JEWEL. Then shoves it in his dive pouch. 
           He picks up a golden ceremonial mask.

                                 NED
                        Maybe this trip was worth it after all. 
                        We can live like kings just by filling 
                        our pockets.
                          (beat)
                        Question is: why did Nemo come all this 
                        way and walk right past it?

           No response from Julie. Ned turns to look. She’s gone. 

           INT. INNER CHAMBER - SAME

           Six stones in the metal case. One slot left to fill. The 
           Native crewman runs up to Nemo --

                                 NATIVE CREWMAN
                        The seventh key is missing!

                                 NEMO
                        Search the temple! Find that key.

           Crewmen scatter. All but one. Nemo turns to him.

                                 NEMO
                        Take a couple of men and search the 
                        treasure room. 

           The crewmen doesn’t budge.
                                 NEMO
                        Is there a problem?

           The crewman lunges at Nemo with the jeweled DAGGER. Nemo, 
           caught by surprise, deflects the blade but it still manages 
           to make a SMALL CUT across his cheek. 

           Nemo struggles with the crewman. Other crewmen join in to 
           help him. The attacker is overpowered, thrown to the ground. 

                                 NEMO
                        You will pay dearly for this mutiny.

           Nemo removes the crewman’s dive helmet, revealing Julie and 
           her long flowing hair. Nemo and the crew are taken aback.

                                 NEMO
                        This truly is a day of surprises.

                                 NED
                        Here’s another shock for you.

           They turn and see Ned aiming an electric rifle at Nemo.

                                 NED
                        Sorry I’m late to your party, Cap’n. My 
                        invitation must’ve got lost in the mail.

           He reaches down for Julie, helps her to her feet.

                                 NED
                        But we can’t stay long anyway --

           The whole chamber RUMBLES and SHAKES. Like there’s an 
           earthquake. The roof crumbles. RUBBLE falls all around them.

           Then an EXPLOSION ROCKS the chamber.

           Everyone dives for cover. Nemo and his crew put their helmets 
           on for protection. 

           Ned and Julie get separated from the crew...and their 
           helmets.

                                 NED
                        Couldn’t sit still, could you? Had to go 
                        and make this difficult.

           A large section of the ceiling collapses. DAYLIGHT shines 
           down from above....

           ...and a dozen ROPES drop down. Then a dozen ARAB DIGGERS 
           slide down the ropes into the chamber.
           When they reach bottom, they look stunned and horrified to 
           see the men in the futuristic diving suits. 

           Nemo and his men are equally stunned, not so horrified. 

                                 ARAB DIGGER
                        We have awakened the Sea-Gods! 

           The Diggers drop to their knees and bow reverently.

           More people slide down the ropes: this time uniformed OTTOMAN 
           (TURKISH) SOLDIERS. Armed with SWORDS and RIFLES. 

           There leader is KER KARRAJE. A ruthless, nasty, cutthroat 
           sonofabitch. He will kill you just for reading this. 

           The two sides assess the situation. Then --

                                 KER KARRAJE/NEMO
                        Fire!

           A hail of bullets versus a hail of electric pellets. Arab 
           Diggers dive for cover. Ottomans are zapped, stunned. 

           Bullets, for the most part, only ding the diving armor on the 
           Nautilus crew as they retreat toward the treasure room.

           An Ottoman soldier falls near Ned. Ned grabs the soldier’s 
           rifle, strips him of his sword. He hands the sword to Julie. 

                                 JULIE
                        That’s hardly fair!

           He takes the sword, gives her the rifle. Then leaps up to 
           join the battle.

           A GUNSHOT hits his sword blade, sheers it in half. 

           Ned drops back down, hands Julie the broken sword and takes 
           the gun. He pops back up. FIRES two shots. Both strike 
           Ottomans in their gun hands, knocking their rifles away.

           Ned leaps from their cover, grabs their diving helmets, 
           dodges Ottoman bullets and returns safely.

                                 JULIE
                        Why don’t we surrender? They’re not our 
                        enemies.

                                 NED
                        Ottomans aren’t known for taking 
                        prisoners. At least not with their heads 
                        still attached.
                                 (MORE)
                                 NED (CONT'D)
                          (hands her a helmet)
                        Put this on.

           ON THE GUNFIGHT

           Ker Karraje draws his sword, lunges at Nemo’s crewmen, 
           pierces his blade through the exposed areas around their 
           diving armor, killing two of them instantly.

           He sees other crewmen picking up the metal case, carrying it 
           away. He fights his way toward them...

           Another crewman gets shot in an exposed area between his 
           armor plates. He falls. Nemo lumbers through the rain of 
           bullets to retrieve him. Valiantly hauls him up over his 
           shoulder...

           ...and comes face to face with Karraje. Karraje stabs the 
           wounded crewman, killing him. 

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        Give me the stones.

           Suddenly, the entire chamber starts to collapse around them. 
           Karraje barely avoids being crushed.

           Nemo rejoins his crew and they back their way through the 
           treasure room, firing every step of the way. 

           Ned and Julie follow after Nemo. But a pile of rubble cuts 
           them off.

           Another of Nemo’s crewmen -- the YOUNG INDIAN -- gets trapped 
           under the rubble, separated from the others.

           When the dust clears, Ned and Julie discover they have been 
           completely sealed off from Nemo and his crew...and have no 
           way of getting back to the Nautilus.

           Then the chamber wall begins to FISSURE. Water seeps through. 

           Ned pulls Julie toward the dangling ropes. Their only way out 
           now. But Ker Karraje and the Ottomans reach the ropes first 
           and are pulled to the surface.

           Ned and Julie are left alone with the frightened Diggers. As 
           the room rapidly fills with water.

           INT. SHIMMERING POOL - SAME

           Nemo and his crew make it back to the shimmering pool, and 
           return to the water. 
           When the small band of pursuing Ottomans arrive on the scene 
           they are baffled by the sudden disappearance of the Men in 
           Strange Suits...and then crushed by the collapsing temple.

           INT. INNER CHAMBER - SAME

           Ned and Julie are up to their chests in water. The fissure 
           gets wider and wider until --

           The entire wall gives way. Tons of WATER rushes in. We read 
           Ned’s lips through his face plate --

                                 NED
                        Shit.

           Ned and Julie are engulfed, tossed around like clothes in a 
           washer. Drowning soldiers swirl all around them. Ned grabs an 
           ELECTRIC RIFLE that floats past. 

           Another wall caves in. Ned and Julie are blown right through 
           the hole...

           INT. UNDERWATER PASSAGE - SAME

           ...and whisked through a water-filled passage. They bounce 
           off the walls, get spun around, caught in the current.

           Ned grabs Julie, pulls her close to him as they spin through 
           the tunnel like a human torpedo.

           EXT. EXCAVATION SITE - DAY

           A patch of desert where the Euphrates empties into the Gulf. 

           Dozen of tents. Ottoman flags. SCAFFOLDING and WOODEN PLANKS 
           surround the EXCAVATION SITE which is now FLOODED. 

           Arab diggers drag bodies from the water. Including the young 
           Indian from Nemo’s crew who got trapped in the rubble.

           EXT. NEARBY OASIS - DAY

           CAMELS drink. Arab Diggers rinse off, wash their garments.

           The water starts to BUBBLE and GURGLE. 

           A DIGGER peers into the water...and a GLOVED HAND shoots up.

           He jumps back. Grabs a shovel. As do the others.

           Ned’s helmet rises out of the water. The Diggers start 
           YELLING and banging it with the shovels.
           Then the end of the electric rifle appears. FIRES. A pellet 
           hits one of the Arabs in the chest. He convulses, 
           electrified. The others drop their shovels and run away.

           Ned emerges. Grabs Julie’s hand and pulls her out. 

           INT. COMMAND TENT - DAY

           A UNION JACK hangs inside. Two BRITISH SOLDIERS stand guard 
           at the entrance. Two more lounge in chairs, playing cards. 
           Ker Karraje enters. 

                                 BRITISH GENERAL (O.S.)
                        Come on in, Mr. Ker Karraje. Show me what 
                        the years of hard work have brought us.

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        It has brought nothing. Someone got there 
                        before us.

           Reveal the British General to be --

           GENERAL ANSON. The General who ordered the execution of 
           Prince Dakkar’s uncle and cousin. And whom we left for dead.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        How is that possible? We have the only 
                        copy of the tablets. You did destroy 
                        them?

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        They went to the bottom of the sea with 
                        the Waylander and the doctor.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Then how --

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        They came from the sea.

           EXT. OASIS - SAME

           Ned pulls off his helmet. And his air tank. Tosses them 
           aside. He is downright giddy.

                                 NED
                        How was that for an escape? I mean -- 
                        Whoosh! -- here were are. Dry land. Good 
                        ol’ mother earth! Come give us a kiss.

           As he drops to his knees to kiss the ground, a GUNSHOT hits 
           the tree behind him.
           Ned looks up, sees: a DOZEN OTTOMAN SOLDIERS riding toward 
           him, firing their guns.

                                 JULIE (O.S.)
                        Can I interest you in a hump?

           Julie is sitting on a kneeling DROMEDARY CAMEL. Ned runs to 
           the camel as a bullet hits his discarded air tank. KA-BOOM!

           The camel leaps to its feet and sprints across the desert. 
           Ned barely manages to grab onto one of the saddle straps and 
           is pulled along by the fleeing camel.

           Ned pulls himself up to a hump. He grabs a RIFLE out of the 
           camel’s pack and starts firing at the Ottoman pursuers.

           INT. NAUTILUS HELM - SAME

           Aronnax, the whole ship to himself, stands at the wheel, 
           spinning it round and round, pretending to steer.

                                 ARONNAX
                        This is your Captain speaking. Man your 
                        stations! Prepare to dive! 

           The helm door flies open, startling Aronnax. Nemo and his 
           Navigators enter. And Nemo looks really really pissed.

                                 ARONNAX
                        I’m sorry. I can explain.

           Nemo pushes him aside. The Navigators start the engines.

                                 NEMO
                        Never lie to me again.

                                 ARONNAX
                        I never --

                                 NEMO
                        The girl. Your assistant. If that’s who 
                        she is.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Are they okay?

                                 NEMO
                        They’re about to discover the Ottomans 
                        won’t be nearly as accommodating or as 
                        civil as I have been.
                          (to Navigator)
                        Reverse engines!
                                 ARONNAX
                        We can’t just leave them!

                                 NEMO
                        I lost four men today. I do not intend to 
                        lose any more.

           Nemo YELLS out an order. A Crewman enters and grabs Aronnax.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Do what you want to me. But the girl has 
                        suffered enough at your hands. 

                                 NEMO
                        I saved her life. As I did yours. A 
                        mistake I will gladly correct.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Her name is Julie Fleischer! Her father 
                        was the archeologist you murdered. The 
                        one you stole the map from! 

           He now has Nemo’s undivided attention. 

           EXT. DESERT - NEAR THE EUPHRATES - DAY

           Ned and Julie ride across the desert. Ahead of them: a newly 
           constructed TRAIN BRIDGE crosses the Euphrates. 

           Behind them: the Ottoman Soldiers close the gap. 

           And behind the soldiers: General Anson and Ker Karraje riding 
           fine ARABIAN STALLIONS, gaining ground.

           ON NED AND JULIE 

           Faces covered in dust. Ned squints, sees something on the 
           horizon, across the bridge. Looks like...TRAIN SMOKE.

                                 NED
                        Can you make this smelly beast run any 
                        faster!?

           Ned turns, sees Ottomans closing in.

           He takes Julie’s AIR TANK off her back, tosses it onto the 
           ground behind them. Then turns himself around on the camel. 
           Aims the rifle.

           And waits. The tank gets further and further away. The 
           Ottomans get closer and closer. And when they’re right on top 
           of the tank --
           Ned hits it with a well-aimed bullet. KA-BOOM! Perfect shot. 
           Ottoman horses and riders spill in all directions. 

           Ned just bought them a bigger lead. But there’s still the 
           train.

           EXT. EUPHRATES - DOWN RIVER - SAME

           A quiet change of pace. TWO OLD FISHERMEN sit in their boat. 
           Relaxing. One of them gets a TUG on his line.

           He pulls with all his might and the NAUTILUS RISES TO THE 
           SURFACE right in front of them. 

           They watch awestruck as it passes by. Aronnax sheepishly 
           waves at them. The Fishermen timidly wave back.

           EXT. DESERT - NEAR THE EUPHRATES - SAME

           Ned and Julie. The bridge is less than a hundred yards away. 
           They’re gonna beat the train. And they’re way ahead of their 
           pursuers... 

                                 NED
                        We got it beat! We got ‘em all beat!

           ...until the camel abruptly stops at the edge of the bridge. 
           Ned and Julie are thrown from the humps, land on the tracks.

           Ned slowly gets up, sore. 

                                 NED
                        You stupid, ugly, sad excuse of a horse. 
                        That’s the straw that broke your back!

           Ned raises his gun to shoot. The Camel spits on him, covers 
           his face in goo. The TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS.

                                 JULIE
                        Ned! Stop fooling around! We have to go!

           They lumber across the tracks but it’s difficult in their 
           bulky suits. And to make matters worse:

           The Ottomans -- Anson and Karraje now leading the pack -- are 
           nearing the bridge from behind them.

           The TRAIN is less than a hundred yards away in front of them.

           And the Nautilus is coming up the river beside them.

           Ned and Julie stop in their tracks. Literally. 
                                 NED
                        Death by train, death by gunshot, or 
                        death by Nemo. Pick your poison.

           Julie strips away the plating from her dive suit. Ned does 
           the same until they are down to the black rubber underlining. 
           They pull off the boots, step to the edge of the bridge.

                                 NED
                        On the count of --

           A GUNSHOT pings the bridge. They jump into the water... 

           ...and swim toward the Nautilus. BULLETS rain around them.

           They reach the Nautilus, climb onto the deck. More bullets 
           PING around them.

                                 JULIE
                        Right back where we started.

                                 NED
                        Such is my luck.

           Ned opens the hatch. They drop down inside...

           INT. NAUTILUS - SAME

           ... and are greeted by Nemo, Aronnax, Serko, and others.

                                 NED
                        Gotta hand it to you, Captain. You throw 
                        one helluva party.

           Serko drags him away. Then Nemo turns to Julie.

                                 NEMO
                        Miss Fleischer. It is an honor to have 
                        the daughter of such a brilliant man 
                        aboard my ship. 

           She slaps his face. Nemo doesn’t react.

                                 NEMO
                        There will be much for us to discuss. At 
                        another time.
                          (to the crew)
                        Take us home.

           EXT. EUPHRATES RIVER - SAME

           Soldiers fire uselessly at the Nautilus. General Anson and 
           Ker Karraje sit on their stallions, watching as the Nautilus 
           disappears below the surface. 
           General Anson just stares. Doesn’t say a word.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. VOLCANO ISLAND - DAY

           Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. An island that is little more 
           than a SMOKING VOLCANO.

           The Nautilus -- half submerged -- approaches the island. As 
           it gets closer it dives...

           EXT. UNDERWATER TUNNEL - SAME

           ...and passes through an opening at the base of the volcano.

           EXT. CAVERN - LATER

           The Nautilus surfaces inside a cavern. STALACTITES pierce 
           down from above; STALAGMITES rise from below. 

           The Nautilus docks at a man-made WHARF inside the cavern. A 
           string of ELECTRIC LAMPS light the cavern. 

           Hatches open and crewman secure the Nautilus. Ned, Aronnax, 
           and Julie exit. Followed by Nemo and the rest of the crew, 
           four of them carrying the CASE containing the stone keys.

           EXT. CENTER OF THE VOLCANO - LAGOON - DAY

           Crewmen row the DINGHIES into the center of the volcano. Ned, 
           Aronnax, and Julie are blinded by the SUNLIGHT. As their eyes 
           adjust, they see --

           Dozens of abodes are carved into the rock around the lagoon 
           like Anasazi CLIFF DWELLINGS. They have wooden fronts and are 
           decorated with refuse scavenged from lost ships. 

           MINE CARS roll in and out of a series of tunnels, bringing 
           COAL to the surface from an UNDERWATER MINE.

           A COAL REFINERY belches SMOKE into the air, giving the 
           appearance that the volcano is active and smoking. 

                                 NEMO
                        This is our home. In the very heart of an 
                        extinct volcano. Safe, secret, sheltered 
                        from the fury of hurricanes and 
                        humankind. The outside walls are sheer 
                        and insurmountable. 
                          (to Ned)
                        In case you’re wondering.
           They dock the dinghies near the village. A HUNDRED MEN AND 
           WOMEN live here. Everyone with a job to do -- preparing food, 
           clothing, all the needs of this mini-society. 

           Nemo is greeted reverently with smiles and slight bows of the 
           head. He’s a returning hero. 

                                 JULIE
                        These are all your people?

                                 NEMO
                        They belong to no one but themselves. 
                        They are the world’s oppressed and 
                        forgotten. They have chosen to live and 
                        work here, to escape the brutalities of 
                        civilization. Here they want for nothing. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        What is this language you speak?

                                 NEMO
                        The language of the New World.

           Nemo leads them up a flight of stone stairs to a PALATIAL 
           COLUMNED ENTRANCE carved into the stone. Above the entrance, 
           an inscription in Latin: MOBILIS IN MOBILE.

           INT. STONE PALACE - SAME

           Like the dwellings, it has been furnished from items 
           reclaimed from the sea: statues, chandeliers, a PIPE ORGAN.

                                 NEMO
                        Because I am convinced now that it was 
                        fate that brought each of you to me. Even 
                        you, Mr. Land, for reasons that are not 
                        yet clear. As for you, professor --

           Nemo removes a thick book from a library shelf. It is the 
           book Aronnax himself has written.

                                 NEMO
                        -- you were never a stranger to me. It 
                        was your work that first introduced me to 
                        the wonders of the sea. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        You’ve read my book?
           He hands the book to Aronnax. It is well-worn, filled with 
           hand-written notations.

                                 NEMO
                        I hope you don’t mind. I took the liberty 
                        to make a few corrections.

                                 JULIE
                        And why did fate bring me here? So you 
                        can kill me as you did my father?

                                 NEMO
                        I did not kill your father. His ship was 
                        attacked and sank by the Ottoman Navy. 

                                 JULIE
                        And you just happened to find his map.

                                 NEMO
                        I retrieved it from the wreckage.

                                 JULIE
                        You’re a liar.

                                 NEMO
                        Your father was bringing me the map, Miss 
                        Fleischer. He was going to join us. 

           The proverbial bomb. Dropped. Nemo removes a stack of LETTERS 
           from a pouch inside a desk. 

                                 NEMO
                        Although I never had the pleasure of 
                        meeting him face-to-face, your father and 
                        I corresponded for over ten years. We 
                        shared a common interest in certain 
                        antiquities.

           He hands the bundle to Julie. She browses through the 
           letters. Realizes --

                        You were his mysterious benefactor?

           Nemo nods. And Julie sees him in an entirely new light.

                                 JULIE
                        All these years...his excavations, his 
                        work. My father owed everything to you.

           INT. GENERAL ANSON’S COMMAND TENT - NIGHT

           General Anson drinks alone. Finishes a bottle. Then opens a 
           LOCKED BOX. Inside is a PISTOL. And a LEATHER JOURNAL with an 
           ornate “D” on the cover (see page one).

           It is filled with notes and diagrams. Sketches of the Seven 
           Sages. Mathematical equations. And a rough sketch/blueprint 
           of the Nautilus. 

           An Ottoman soldier enters, salutes. Anson closes the book.

                                 OTTOMAN SOLDIER
                        The prisoner has revived.

           INT. MEDICAL TENT - LATER

           Nemo’s young Indian Crewman is strapped to an operating 
           table. His leg bloody and broken. An OTTOMAN DOCTOR stands 
           nearby as Anson enters with Karraje.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        That will be all, doctor. I will assume 
                        full responsibility for his treatment.

           The doctor leaves. Anson turns to the helpless young Indian -- 

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        I have many questions for you. And I hope 
                        you will have many answers.

           Karraje picks up a nasty looking SURGICAL TOOL.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. NEMO’S ISLAND PALACE - NIGHT

           An open roof. Silk curtains blow in the night breeze. Nemo, 
           Ned, Julie, and Aronnax sit on CUSHIONS around a table. There 
           is a bounty of food. BOTTLES of SPIRITS. A HOOKAH.

           Professor Aronnax examines one of the “key” stones.
                                 ARONNAX
                        You say you found these in Sumeria...yet 
                        I don’t recognize the markings.

                                 NEMO
                        They are from a much older culture.

                                 ARONNAX
                        How is that possible? Sumeria is the 
                        oldest civilization known to man.

                                 NEMO
                        Yet it is a mystery to us. Seemingly 
                        overnight they developed an advanced 
                        knowledge of science, astronomy, 
                        medicine...but where did it come from? 
                        According to their myths it was a gift 
                        from an even older civilization, a 
                        civilization perhaps even more advanced 
                        then our own. The Sumerians called them 
                        the “People of the Sea” because they 
                        arrived on ships long before anyone had 
                        ever seen a sea-going vessel. 

           Ned takes a toke on the hookah, blows out smoke, amused.

                        their knowledge now lies buried beneath 
                        the sea.

           Aronnax takes a toke on the hookah, nearly coughs up a lung.

                                 ARONNAX

                        Atlantis is a fantasy. But it derives no

                        Countless civilizations rise, fall, and

                        the seven keys to their library of

                        Why do we wage wars and commit

                        resources, for security. But what if we 
                        had the knowledge to end famine and 
                        poverty, to cure disease, to create an

                        We’ll always find a reason to kill each 
                        other. 

                                 NEMO
                        I believe we are meant for something 
                        greater.
                          (beat)
                        Unfortunately, we only found six keys.

                                 JULIE
                        That’s because Zisudra hid the seventh 
                        key somewhere else. 

           Everyone turns to her.
                                 JULIE
                        There were two tablets. My father only 
                        had one of them with him on the 
                        Waylander. The second one leads to the 
                        seventh key.

                                 NEMO
                        Where is this other tablet?

                                 JULIE
                        Missing. 

                                 NEMO
                        Missing?

                                 JULIE
                        Stolen. I’m pretty sure now it was the 
                        Ottomans. But the good news is: my father 
                        kept a copy hidden in a safe place.

                                 NEMO
                        Where?

           She dips her finger in a sauce, draws several CUNEIFORM 
           FIGURES on the table...

                                 NEMO
                        You have it all? In your head?

           ...then she stops, licks the sauce off her finger. 

                                 JULIE
                        I want my own room this time.

                                 NEMO
                        I believe that can be arranged.

           Ned takes a long drag on the Hookah. He’s not so sure handing 
           over this information will be a wise move. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. EXCAVATION SITE/ANSON’S BASE CAMP - NIGHT

           General Anson and Ker Karraje exit the medical tent; Karraje 
           is holding the Indian’s diving helmet like a trophy as they 
           walk across the base camp.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        How do you know he wasn’t lying?

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        I can tell by the screams. 
                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Then take your men and bring me those six 
                        stones. I’ll get the seventh one myself.

           They reach what appears to be a small BRITISH WARSHIP sitting 
           upright in the sand, far from water.

           Anson walks up the plank to the deck and we see that the ship 
           is an AIRSHIP. A dirigible-shaped HOT AIR BALLOON floats 
           above the body of a ship. A large PROPELLER on the stern 
           provides forward thrust. 

           As Anson’s twelve BRITISH CREWMEN untether the ship, he yells 
           down to Karraje --

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Bring me Nemo alive if you can. If not, 
                        then his head and his ship. 

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        What does it mean? Nemo?

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        It’s Latin. It means “no one.”

           INT. NEMO’S ISLAND PALACE - NIGHT

           Nemo, shirt off, kneels in front of Shiva. Flickering CANDLES 
           provide ominous lighting. 

           FLASHBACK TO:

           Dakkar in Bundlekind. The night of the revolution.

                                 DAKKAR
                        I am Prince Dakkar!

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        You are no one!

           The cannons BLAST. FLASH TO --

           EXT. DAKKAR’S INDIAN PALACE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           In FLAMES. Dakkar -- now with a beard and wearing war-torn 
           clothes -- rides up on his horse, leaps off, and runs inside.

           INT. DAKKAR’S INDIAN PALACE - SAME (FLASHBACK)

           Ransacked, pillaged. FLAMES everywhere. Dakkar runs inside, 
           sees the BODIES of his WIFE and SON. Lying in pools of blood.

                                 DAKKAR
                        Sita! Sagar!
           Dakkar runs toward them and -- BANG! -- a gun fires. He goes 
           down. Behind him: A FIGURE IN SHADOW. He fires two more shots 
           into Dakkar’s back. Leaves him for dead.

           Dakkar crawls across the floor, reaches his wife and son. 
           Sees his son’s NAUTILUS SHELL lying next to him. Dakkar cries 
           out, and the anguish of a thousand oppressed souls escapes 
           from his lungs.

           INT. NEMO’S ISLAND PALACE - NIGHT (NOW)

           Nemo slowly raises his head, his eyes look like those of a 
           wild, blood-thirsty animal. 

           This does not look like a man who wants to save mankind.

           INT. JULIE’S DWELLING - NIGHT

           Julie sits at a candlelit table, drawing the cuneiform 
           symbols on a piece of parchment. 

           She looks up, startled, sees: Nemo standing in the door 
           frame. Something is draped over his arm.

                                 JULIE
                        You frightened me. 

                                 NEMO
                        That was not my intent.

           An awkward beat as they stare at each other. Julie notices 
           the fresh cut on his cheek.

                                 JULIE
                        Sorry about the --
                          (she touches her own cheek)
                        I didn’t know --

                                 NEMO
                        It will heal. I’m quite used to scars.
                          (changing subject)
                        Here. I brought this for you.

           He hands her a GORGEOUS DRESS made of silk. It’s the exact 
           same dress his wife was wearing on the beach in the prologue.

                                 NEMO
                        I thought you might be tired of trousers. 

           Julie holds it up to her body.

                                 JULIE
                        It’s beautiful. Where did you find it?
                                 NEMO
                        It belonged to a princess I used to know. 
                        You remind me of her.

           She blushes a bit. Then --

                                 JULIE
                        Oh! I have something for you too.

           She hands him the parchment with the newly scribed symbols.

                                 JULIE
                        Hot off the press.

           Nemo examines it intently. Looks like a bunch of symbols.

                                 JULIE
                        You can make sense of all that?

                                 NEMO
                        It’s a navigational chart hidden inside 
                        the text of a simple story. Longitudes, 
                        latitudes, they’re all here. But it will 
                        take some time to decipher.
                          (he kisses her hand)
                        Good night, Julie. And thank you.

           As he starts to leave --

                                 JULIE
                        Was she beautiful?

           Nemo turns.

                                 JULIE
                        The princess. Was she beautiful?

                                 NEMO
                        Very.

           EXT. CLIFF DWELLING - SAME

           Ned watches from the shadows as Nemo leaves Julie’s dwelling.

           INT. JULIE’S DWELLING - LATER

           Julie is standing in front of a cracked, salvaged mirror 
           holding the dress in front of her, posing. Ned enters.

                                 NED
                        All I got was a pair of socks.

                                 JULIE
                        Would it hurt you to knock?
           Ned taps the whiskey bottle against the entrance frame. 

                                 NED
                        You and the Captain all chummy now? 

                                 JULIE
                        You still don’t trust him, do you?

                                 NED
                        Not even if he was squirming at the end 
                        of my harpoon. 

           She grabs the bottle from his hand. Takes a drink.

                                 JULIE
                        I think you’re jealous.

           He takes the bottle. Takes a gulp.

                                 NED
                        Then you don’t know me very well. ‘Cause 
                        if there’s one lesson I’ve learned in 
                        this life, it’s that nothing is more 
                        dangerous for a man who values his 
                        freedom than a woman who values hers. 

           She gets right in his face, her lips close to his.

                                 JULIE
                        I dare you.

           A beat. And then they kiss. Mutually. Passionately. As they 
           do, they back toward the entrance. Then Julie gently pulls 
           away. Smiles.

                                 JULIE
                        You’re free to go now.

           She grabs the bottle from his hand and closes the door in his 
           face. Then she smiles, takes a drink.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. NEMO’S ISLAND BASE - NEXT DAY

           Lots of activity as the crew prepares for the next voyage. 

           INT. MINE TUNNEL - SAME

           Ned, Serko, and several of Nemo’s ISLANDERS shovel coal into 
           mine cars. Others push the cars through the tunnel toward the 
           Nautilus dock. Ned is quiet, brooding.
                                 NEMO (O.S.)
                        Mr. Land!

           Nemo, Scar, the Tattoo’d Native, and two others are facing 
           Ned. Armed with REAL RIFLES. Looks like an execution squad. 

                                 NEMO
                        We’re going to gather food for the long 
                        journey ahead. Perhaps you’ll join us.

                                 NED
                        I can feel the bullet in my back already. 
                        No thanks.

                                 NEMO
                        Unfortunate. I thought you might like 
                        some meat during your final voyage.

                                 NED
                        Final --
                          (beat)
                        Did you say meat?

           EXT. CAVERN - LATER

           Ned, Nemo, and the Crewmen are in the dinghy, ready to shove 
           off as Julie runs down the docks wearing the dress.

           The crewmen stare as Nemo takes her hand, helps her on to the 
           dinghy. Ned doesn’t like it one bit. It shows.

                                 JULIE
                        Didn’t think I was going to pass up a day 
                        at the beach did you?

           She sits beside Nemo. The crewmen shove off, row the dinghy 
           into a small cave-tunnel until they reach a dead end.

           Mechanical gears grind and the dead end opens. WATER cascades 
           from a WATERFALL on the other side. They pass through...

           EXT. OCEAN - SAME

           ...and into the ocean. A SMALL TROPICAL ISLAND is on the 
           horizon. The crewmen raise a MAST and set SAIL for it.

                                 NEMO
                        There, Mr. Land. That is where we hunt.

           EXT. TROPICAL ISLAND - LATER

           The dinghy rests on the beach. Nemo and the crewmen grab gear 
           and real rifles. He hands a rifle to Julie.
                                 NEMO
                        Stay close to the shore and you’ll be 
                        fine. The island is uninhabited.

           Julie heads to the surf, waves to Ned and the crew.

                                 JULIE
                        Happy hunting. 

           Nemo grabs supplies. Ned has his eye on the rifles.

                                 NEMO
                        Tell me, is it true you were a deserter 
                        from your Union Army?

                                 NED
                        You lookin’ to bag yourself a reward?

                                 NEMO
                        I wish only to appease my curiosity. You 
                        don’t strike me as the type --

                                 NED
                        Let’s just say I’d seen enough of what 
                        man can do to his fellow man.

                                 NEMO
                        Then you and I are not so very different.

           Nemo hands a rifle to Ned. He can’t believe it. One shot and 
           he’s a free man. Nemo knows exactly what he’s thinking.

                                 NEMO
                        I lost four of my best men in Sumeria. If 
                        you’ll join me on this next voyage and 
                        stop being a nuisance, you’ll be free to 
                        go when we return. I’ll leave you with 
                        enough riches so you can spend the rest 
                        of your life any way you please.

                                 NED
                        Last time someone made me an offer like 
                        that, I ended up with you.

                                 NEMO
                        I would consider that a blessing.

           Ned and Nemo walk through the jungle, followed by the others. 

           They come across the RUSTED REMAINS of old EQUIPMENT and 
           STRUCTURES. Like a small, defunct shipyard.
                                 NED
                        I thought this island was uninhabited?

                                 NEMO
                        It is. Now. This is where I built the 
                        Nautilus. 

                                 NED
                        You built it. 

                                 NEMO
                        With the help of a few of my loyal 
                        countrymen and the island’s natives who 
                        now live with us in the volcano. The 
                        parts were manufactured all over the 
                        world, sent to different addresses under 
                        different names and then brought here, 
                        piece by piece --

           Ned motions for silence. A WILD BOAR is grazing not too far 
           from them. Crewmen raise their rifles; the boar takes off 
           running. Everyone chases after it...

           EXT. TROPICAL ISLAND - BEACH - SAME

           Julie walks along the beach until it comes to a rocky end. 
           She set down her rifle and climbs up the rocks...

           From the top of the rocks she sees -- a WARSHIP. Anchored in 
           a secluded cove.

                                 JULIE
                        A ship?

           She watches as a flag is raised. It’s an OTTOMAN FLAG! She 
           loses her footing, slides down into the cove...and catches 
           the attention of several OTTOMAN SOLDIERS.

           She tries to climb back up the rocky wall but it’s 
           insurmountable from this side. 

           EXT. JUNGLE - SAME

           Ned and Nemo both come to a stop. Facing each other across a 
           small RIVER BED. They’re all alone. The BOAR between them. 
           But they are ignoring the boar and instead staring intently 
           at each other. 

           Then, as if on cue, they both raise their rifles aiming at 
           each other. Their eyes narrow...

           ...and they FIRE simultaneously. When the smoke clears, 
           they’re both standing...and there is a DEAD OTTOMAN SOLDIER 
           behind each of them. They just saved each other’s lives.
           More Ottomans charge out of the jungle. Ned and Nemo shoot 
           and fight their way through them. But more keep coming...

           EXT. COVE - SAME

           Ottoman soldiers are chasing Julie. She runs toward the 
           jungle...just as Ned and Nemo come running out --

                                 JULIE
                        Run! 

                                 NED
                        Run! 

           -- with a dozen Ottomans chasing them! 

           Ned and Nemo practically run into Julie, see the Ottomans 
           chasing her...and the ones chasing them. They are surrounded. 

           ELSEWHERE

           Nemo’s crewmen are hidden in the jungle, watching everything. 
           They sprint back to the dinghy.

           EXT. OTTOMAN SHIP - HOURS LATER

           Julie, Ned, and Nemo are tied to a mast. 

                                 JULIE
                        Here we are again. All tied up and 
                        nowhere to go.

                                 NED
                        Just keep quiet. I have a plan.

                                 JULIE
                          (to Nemo)
                        Ned’s escape plans are notorious for 
                        their lack of escape. 

                                 NED
                        You messed up the last one! Not me!

                                 JULIE
                        Fine. Let’s hear it.

                                 NED
                        I don’t have time to go over it.

                                 JULIE
                        Right. And what if I have a plan?

                                 NED
                        Then I’d like to hear it.
                                 JULIE
                        I don’t have time to go over it.

                                 NEMO
                        Were you two ever married?

                         NED
           She’s not my type!
                                                       JULIE
                                           He’s not my type!

           Ker Karraje walks on deck. Sizes up his prisoners as he walks 
           around the mast. Stops in front of Ned.

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        This one we don’t need.

           He stops in front of Julie. Looks at her lecherously. 

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        This one we can find a use for. 

           Then he stops in front of Nemo.

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        This one...must be no one. I believe we 
                        have something of yours.

           Ottoman soldiers drag the young Indian crewman onto the deck. 

                                 KER KARRAJE 
                        He’s not very good at keeping your 
                        secrets. He lead us right here to your 
                        island in exchange for his life. 

           They drop him in front of Nemo. He is clearly dead.

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        Unfortunately, I’m not very good at 
                        keeping my word.

                                 NEMO
                        You will die for that.

           In a flash, Karraje has a KNIFE at Nemo’s throat. 

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        You’re lucky I need you alive or you 
                        would join him.

           EXT. OTTOMAN SHIP - SAILING - LATER

           The ship is out to sea. The island a speck in the distance. 
           Ned is at the end of a PLANK, tied up. 
           Ottomans are laughing, throwing stuff at Ned. More Ottomans 
           restrain Julie; Nemo is still tied to the mast.

           In the water below are hundreds of deadly bulbous JELLYFISH.

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        They look harmless, but one sting will 
                        cause pain that you could never imagine. 
                        Two will paralyze you. Three will stop 
                        your heart.
                          (beat)
                        So pray that you drown.

                                 JULIE
                        Let him go!

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        You’ll be joining him as soon as we’re 
                        finished with you
                          (to Nemo)
                        Where are the six stones? 

           Nemo remains silent, shows no emotion. 

                                 NED
                        I’ll be more than happy to tell you 
                        myself! Let the girl go, and I’ll take 
                        you to them. 

                                 JULIE
                        No! I’ll take you if you let him go.

                                 NED
                        Julie!
                          (through clenched teeth)
                        I have a plan.

           Karraje draws his sword, cuts the top button off Julie’s 
           dress. Looks at her sadistically.

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        You will take me anyway. 

           Julie spits in his face. Karraje doesn’t flinch or wipe the 
           spittle off his face, he laps it up with his tongue. Then 
           aims his gun at Ned.

                                 KER KARRAJE
                        Walk.

           Ned doesn’t move. Then Karraje puts the pistol barrel up to 
           Julie’s temple.
                                 KER KARRAJE
                        One of you dies. The choice is yours.

           Ned is stuck between a walk and a dead place. Julie and Ned 
           look at each other. We can tell that they really care for 
           each other, but afraid to admit it.

                                 JULIE
                        Ned! 

           He shakes his head, don’t say a word. Offers a slight smile.

                                 NED
                        It was a good plan.

           And with that he steps off the plank. But instead of a splash 
           we hear...CLANK! 

           Karraje and the Ottomans rush to the edge, see --

           Ned standing on the surface of the ocean! 

           Or so it would appear. Until --

           The Nautilus rises up beneath him!

           The Ottoman ship tips to a forty-five degree angle as the 
           Nautilus continues to rise beneath it. 

           Ottomans grab onto anything they can, sliding and falling 
           across the sloping deck. Karraje slides into the open hold.

           Julie grabs hold of a mast rope to keep from falling. As the 
           ship tilts, she pulls herself toward the end of the mast.

           ON THE NAUTILUS

           Hatches open and the entire CREW emerges, armed with the 
           electric guns. 

           As the Ottomans pop up over the edge of their tilting ship, 
           Nemo’s crewmen pick them off with electric pellets.

           Serko, Scar, and the Native throw GRAPPLING HOOKS over the 
           side of the Ottoman ship and scale its tilting hull. 

           Ned is right there with them.

           ON THE OTTOMAN SHIP

           It’s like fighting in a funhouse. Everything at an angle. 
           Almost impossible to move without hanging onto something. 
           The Native slices through Nemo’s ropes, frees him. Then hands 
           Nemo his sword. Nemo ends up face to face with Ned.

                                 NEMO
                        You were willing to betray me. 

                                 NED
                        You were willing to let them kill me! So 
                        let’s call it even --
                          (he fends off an attacker; 
                           takes his sword)
                        -- and teach these thugs some manners!

           Julie SCREAMS. Ned sees her clinging to the end of the mast, 
           out over the water. He swashbuckles his way to her...

           Ker Karraje climbs from the hold, fires his pistol. Almost 
           hits Nemo. Nemo slashes his way toward him...

           ...as Ned works his way toward the mast. He sees an Ottoman 
           coming up behind Serko.

                                 NED
                        Serko!

           Ned throws his sword like a dart. It WHIZZES past Serko’s ear 
           and stabs the Ottoman behind him in the forehead.

           Serko nods to Ned. Thank you, I owe you one.

           Ned grabs another sword from a dead Ottoman, continues...

           ON THE NAUTILUS

           Crewmen continue the electrifying assault. Aronnax appears on 
           deck. Ducks the gunfire, dives into a dinghy...

           ON THE OTTOMAN SHIP

           Nemo makes his way to Ker Kerraje. Ker Karraje tosses his 
           pistol and draws his sword. The two warriors go mano y mano. 
           And in case you’re wondering: Nemo = Badass.

           Elsewhere, Ned climbs onto the mast, tries to get to Julie.

           Meanwhile, other Ottomans hoist a CANNON up the sloping deck. 
           Position it to fire at the Nautilus. The fuse is lit...and 
           then the cannon rolls back down the sloping deck, points 
           straight up...and FIRES!

           Everyone looks up. Wondering where the cannonball will drop. 
           It drops on the mast. Right between Ned and Julie. Julie’s 
           end dangles down, hanging on by a thread... right over the 
           deadly jellyfish. 

                                 JULIE
                        Ned! Help!

           Ned crawls along the mast toward Julie. The ship buckles. He 
           loses his footing, almost falls into the water. 

           An Ottoman isn’t so lucky and falls into the sea. He screams 
           in agony as he is engulfed by the jellyfish. 

           Up above: hand-over-hand, hanging under the mast, Ned 
           shimmies his way toward Julie, risking life and limb...

           ...as the Ottoman ship tilts even further, almost dipping 
           Julie into the jellyfish infested waters.

           Ned struggles valiantly to get to her. Finally makes it to 
           the end of the mast. Reaches down to her...

           ...just as Aronnax rows under her in the dinghy.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Going my way?

           Julie smiles, drops into the dinghy. Gives Aronnax a big hug.

                                 JULIE
                        Pierre! You saved my life!

                                 ARONNAX
                        I’m capable of a little derring-do 
                        myself, you know.

           They row away, leaving Ned dangling thanklessly above them. 

           ON NEMO AND KER KARRAJE

           Swashbuckling like the best of ‘em. As the ship flounders, 
           Nemo gets the upper-hand and stabs Karraje right through the 
           shoulder, nailing him to the ship. 

                                 NEMO
                        A captain always goes down with his ship.

           EXT. NAUTILUS - MOMENTS LATER

           The gunfight is still raging as Nemo, Ned, and the others 
           reach the deck. Aronnax row up on the other side with Julie. 

           Then dozens of surviving Ottomans leap onto the deck.
                                 NEMO
                        Everyone down below!

           INT. NAUTILUS - HELM - SAME

           Nemo, Ned, Aronnax, and Julie stand before the helm windows. 
           Outside: the Nautilus deck is crawling with Ottomans. 

                                 NEMO
                        Vile bloodthirsty animals.

                                 NED
                        Couldn’t agree more. So let’s dive and 
                        let the jellyfish have at ‘em.

           Nemo doesn’t do anything. Almost all of the Ottomans are on 
           deck now. Several of them try to open the hatches.

           Then Ker Karraje appears on deck, bleeding from his wounded 
           shoulder, holding Nemo’s sword.

                                 NED
                        Any day now, Cap’n.

           Karraje walk up to the helm window. Stares at Nemo, POUNDS on 
           the glass, yelling (but we can’t hear him).

                                 NEMO
                        Now.

           A crewman pulls a lever and the outside of the Nautilus 
           becomes ELECTRIFIED! 

           Ottomans start smoking, cooking instantly from the inside out 
           as if strapped to a giant electric chair.

           At the helm window: Ker Karraje screams silently as his body 
           smokes and his flesh melts away...until he is nothing more 
           than a SMOULDERING SKELETON.

           Aronnax gags. Julie and Ned stares in shock. Nemo acts as if 
           he no more than killed some roaches.

                                 NEMO
                        I’m sorry we didn’t have a chance to get 
                        your meat, Mr. Land.

                                 NED
                        S’okay. I think I just lost my appetite.

           KA-BOOM! A blast rocks the Nautilus. Outside one of the “eye” 
           windows they see the second OTTOMAN SHIP approaching.
                                 NEMO
                        Ahead full!

           A Navigator pulls a lever. The speed increases. Ramming 
           speed. They are heading straight for the ship. The Ottoman 
           ship fires more CANON BLASTS.

                                 NEMO
                        Close shield! 

           Another lever is pulled. Steel “lids” close over the eyes. 
           But Nemo’s eyes remain open, focused, unfeeling. Canon balls 
           ping off the hull. 

           Ned, Aronnax, and Julie looks at each other. Surely he’s not--

                                 NEMO
                        Brace yourselves.

           EXT. OTTOMAN SHIP - SAME

           The TURKISH SAILORS scurry around in a panic, watching as the 
           Nautilus speeds toward them and sinks below the surface...

           INT. OTTOMAN HULL - SAME

           The Ottomans try to flee as the Nautilus’s LANCE NOSE pierces 
           through the hull. One unlucky Ottoman is skewered on the end 
           as water rushes in...

           INT. NAUTILUS HELM - SAME

           Ned, Aronnax, and Julie are flung around like they’re in 
           sever turbulence as the ship shudders. A HORRIBLE SOUND fills 
           the ship. Like twisting metal. 

           And then silence. Nemo turns to Julie.

                                 NEMO
                        Now you have your revenge.

           But she’s not so sure she wants it anymore. 

           EXT. SEA - SAME

           The flaming Ottoman ship sinks into the sea as the glowing 
           wake of the Nautilus disappears on the horizon.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

           Not the D.C. we know today. There are no monuments and the 
           CAPITAL BUILDING is under (re)construction; 
           its dome surrounded by scaffolding. Several BLACK and WHITE 
           workers hoist the BRONZE FREEDOM STATUE onto the dome.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME

           Farragut is standing in his room, watching the Capital 
           construction from his window. ADMIRAL MASON enters. 

                                 ADMIRAL MASON
                        You’re looking good, Commander.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        I feel good, Admiral. Any news? How soon 
                        can you get me back out there?

                                 ADMIRAL MASON
                        They’re still debating. The War 
                        Department wants us to try to capture it 
                        so they can build a fleet of their own.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Capture it!? What are we supposed to do, 
                        throw a net over it and reel it in? We 
                        need to destroy it before it attacks 
                        again. 

                                 ADMIRAL MASON
                        I agree. 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Good. Because I know how to find it.

           Farragut close the door and then pulls a map out from under 
           his mattress. It is filled with notations and marks. 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        A ship of that size is going to have to 
                        refuel on a fairly regular basis. But it 
                        can’t just pull into any old port. It has 
                        to have its own source. Based on when and 
                        where it has been seen, the distance it 
                        traveled, and my best estimates of its 
                        size and speed -- 

           He circles an area in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        -- I’ve pinpointed that source.

                                 ADMIRAL MASON
                        That’s a rather large area.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        That’s why I’ll need the entire fleet.
                                 ADMIRAL MASON
                        The entire fleet! You better stay in bed 
                        another month!

                                 FARRAGUT
                        That thing killed my men. Our men, 
                        Admiral. And a very close friend. We need 
                        all the firepower --

                                 ADMIRAL MASON
                        One ship, Commander. But do not engage. 
                        You find this thing’s nest then you can 
                        have the fleet.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. ANTARCTICA - DAY

           Miles and miles of ice, glaciers, and snow. Quiet. Serene. 
           Untouched. Until the Nautilus SHOOTS UP through the ice and 
           comes to a rest on top of a FROZEN LAKE.

           INT. NAUTILUS SALON - SAME

           The inside of the ship is covered with a thin layer of ice. 
           Ned, Julie, and Aronnax are looking out the window, wearing 
           FURS. All that is visible is a solid layer of ice. 

           Nemo enters with a crewman carrying several pairs of boots.

                                 NED
                        This is the island in the south you were 
                        talking about? Antarctica!? 

                                 NEMO
                        Ten thousand years ago it was a tropical 
                        paradise.

                                 NED
                        Then let’s come back when they re-open. 

           The crewman sets the boots on the table. Julie examines one. 
           Very sharp “teeth” protrude from the soles. 

                                 NEMO
                        Shark-teeth, Miss Fleischer. You will 
                        find them quite helpful on the ice.

           EXT. ICE LAKE - LATER

           Nemo, Ned, Aronnax, Julie and a dozen crewmen -- dressed in 
           FUR and goggles, carrying electric rifles -- march across the 
           ice with their shark-tooth boots. They all use walking sticks 
           for balance; Ned carries a HARPOON. 
           Nemo stops when they reach a small HILL OF ICE. He removes 
           his goggles and gloves. Takes some navigational measurements, 
           consults a map. 

                                 NEMO
                        This is it. We’re here.

           Nemo bellows a COMMAND. His men raise their electric rifles 
           and BLAST the hill of ice with hundreds of ELECTRIC PELLETS.

           The ice drips away, partially exposing something underneath 
           until we see the semblance of an ANCIENT SAILING VESSEL --

                                 JULIE
                        Zisudra’s ship. 

           INT. ZISUDRA’S SHIP - LATER

           Nemo, Ned, Julie, Aronnax and the crew step into the ancient 
           ship. We say ancient, but it is both ancient and modern at 
           the same time. Something from a civilization that gave rise 
           to Sumeria, Egypt, India... 

                                 NED
                        This lost world you’re looking for? 
                        They’re the ones who built this?

                                 NEMO
                        As I said, their knowledge was quite 
                        advanced.

                                 NED
                        Where’d they get the knowledge?

                                 NEMO
                        That is a mystery for another day.

           The METAL WALLS are covered with HIEROGLYPHICS. And in the 
           center of what looks like the helm: a FROZEN BODY. Wearing 
           armor. The swirling NAUTILUS SPIRAL on his chest plate.

           And in his hands: the SEVENTH STONE KEY. Nemo breaks it 
           loose. Holds it up to the light.

                                 NEMO
                        The last piece of the puzzle.

           EXT. ANTARCTIC SKY - DAY

           General Anson’s AIRSHIP flies over the frozen continent. 
           Anson and his men, freezing, scan the horizon. One of them 
           spies a TINY BLACK SPOT several miles ahead...
                                 BRITISH SOLDIER
                        Sir! You might want to look at this.

           Anson takes the binoculars, observes. 

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Our Ottoman friends are proving to be 
                        quite useless. Load the cannons.

           EXT. FROZEN LAKE - SAME

           Nemo leads Ned, Julie, Aronnax and his crew away from the 
           ship and across the ice toward the distant Nautilus. 
           Suddenly, the ice EXPLODES in front of them... 

           ...and then a DARK SHADOW falls over the ice. They look up 
           and see: the Airship. Flying a British flag. Four cannons 
           aimed at them. 

           Nemo and his crewmen instinctively raise their guns to fire 
           back...but they used all their ammo “thawing” the ship. 

           They try to run but another EXPLOSION cuts them off. They 
           take cover behind scattered ice formations.

                                 NED
                        Seems like someone is always crashing 
                        your party, Captain.

           The Airship hovers above the ice. General Anson and two Brits 
           (wearing hoods, goggles) walk onto the ice while the other 
           Brits train rifles and cannons on Nemo’s crew. 

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        We do not wish to kill you, but we will. 
                        All we want are the artifacts. 
                          (beat)
                        I know you’re there, Nemo. You have one 
                        minute to make your choice.

           ON NEMO, NED, THE OTHERS

           Bunkered down behind the ice formations. Ned looks at Nemo 
           suspiciously.

                                 NED
                        Looks like the Brits want to make the 
                        world a happy place just like you, 
                        Captain. Maybe we should join forces.

                                 NEMO
                        They are butchers. Do not trust them.
                                 ARONNAX
                        We’ll never make it back to the ship.

           Julie looks at Ned’s harpoon. 

                                 JULIE
                        Are you as good with that as you say you 
                        are?

                                 NED
                        Even better.

           ON ANSON AND HIS MEN

           Waiting. Then Nemo appears, holding the seventh stone key.

           He approaches General Anson. Stands face to face with him, 
           though neither can see each other’s face. 

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Let me see your face.

           Nemo slowly removes his hood and his goggles.

                                 NEMO
                        How do you know my name?

           General Anson removes his own hood and goggles. 

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Because I gave it to you.

           Nemo fills with rage when he sees him. He lunges at Anson. 
           Anson’s men quickly pull him off, clock him in the jaw with 
           the butt of their rifles. Nemo drops to his knees, bleeding.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        I’ll remember to be more thorough the 
                        next time I kill you. 

           Nemo now realizes that it was general Anson who shot him in 
           the back and killed his family. 

           He lunges again like a wild animal and gets hit hard by the 
           Brits’ rifles two more times.

           Nemo is back on his knees, bloodied and bruised. General 
           Anson picks up the stone key while Nemo, undetected, removes 
           a shark tooth from his boot.

                                 NEMO
                        Why my family? They did nothing to you.
                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        You ruined my life, Hin-doo. I was blamed 
                        for your rebellion. My men and I were 
                        stripped of our rank and honor, and now 
                        we’re forced to live like outlaws. Just 
                        like you.

                                 NEMO
                        You and I...are nothing alike.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        We’re after the same thing, aren’t we?

           General Anson removes Dakkar’s journal from his coat. 

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        I know what you’re looking for. And now 
                        you’re going to help me get it.

           At that instant, Ned leaps up and hurls the harpoon. It 
           passes right through the balloon of the Airship. Air HISSES 
           out of the hole, and the ship sways uncontrollably... 

           ...creating enough of a distraction for Nemo to slash the 
           throat of one of the armed Brits with the shark tooth and to 
           slice the leg of the other one with his shark-tooth boot. 

           Nemo grabs one of their rifles, is about to shoot Anson...

           ...when the nose of the Airship SLAMS into the ice, causing a 
           huge FISSURE.

           Nemo loses his balance. The rifle falls into the water. Anson 
           loses his grip on the stone and it rolls across the ice.

           ON NED AND THE OTHERS

           The frozen lake starts to split apart. Three of Nemo’s 
           crewmen are sucked under the ice. 

           The ice splits apart all around Julie and Aronnax. They 
           barely keep their balance. 

                                 NED
                        Get back to the ship!

           Aronnax and Julie start running, leaping from ice chunk to 
           ice chunk. Nemo’s crew stays. Loyal to the end. 

           They see the Brits dropping ANCHORS, getting the Airship back 
           under control. And loading her CANNONS. They run across the 
           cracking ice toward --
           NEMO AND ANSON

           The ice spiderwebs all around them, cracking under their 
           weight. The stone key teeters equidistant between them. 

           They both make a play for it. The stone slides away, teeters 
           on the edge of the shattered ice, ready to fall into the 
           water at any moments.

           Nemo and Anson fight on the ice. Anson falls, Nemo stands 
           over him ready to crush his face with the shark-tooth boot. 

           Anson grabs onto the boot, forces it away from his face...and 
           sends Nemo flying back onto the ice.

           Anson is about to grab the stone when the ice gives way. He 
           falls into the water and is carried away under the ice.

           Nemo grabs the stone key just before it falls into the water. 

           General Anson breaks up through the ice further away. He 
           climbs out. Nemo stares him down. A great divide now prevents 
           him from going after him.

           Ned appears. Aims a rifle at General Anson and then...Nemo 
           pushes the barrel just as Ned fires, causing him to miss.

                                 NEMO
                        He dies by no hand but my own.

           But now he’s too far away. Revenge will have to wait.

           ON JULIE, AND ARONNAX

           Heading toward the Nautilus. ICE breaks apart, shoots up all 
           around it. Then CANNON BALLS land. And BULLETS strike.

           A huge CHASM appears in the ice, growing wider and wider 
           separating them from the Nautilus. 

           Julie loses her balance and is about to fall into the 
           freezing water when Ned shows up and pulls her back. She 
           falls into his arms.

                                 NED
                        Right back where we started.

                                 JULIE
                        Such is my luck.

           He grabs her and leaps across the chasm. Nemo and the others 
           follow. Aronnax is about to leap when a BULLET hits him. He 
           SCREAMS in pain, falls.
                                 JULIE
                        Professor!

           He’s stuck on the other side. The chasm too wide to jump now. 
           But Ned is about to try when another cannon ball BLASTS the 
           ice, knocking him over. A new fissure spreads out, coming 
           right at Ned and Julie like a freight train.

           Ned knows there’s no way to save Aronnax. So does Aronnax.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Go on...without me. I’m afraid...this is 
                        where...I get off.

           He passes out. Dies? We’re not sure. Ned grabs Julie. Has to 
           force her to run as she keeps looking back, upset.

           ON THE NAUTILUS

           Huge chunks of ICE shoot up around the Nautilus. Nemo and his 
           men make it on deck and disappear down the hatches as --

           Ned and Julie run across the ice, trying to beat the fissure.

                                 NED
                        Hold the boat! Hold the boat!

           They leap onto the Nautilus. Ned and Julie take one last look 
           back. See two Brits, rifles in hand, running toward Aronnax.

           Ned and Julie drop into the hatch. Seal it.

           EXT. ICE LAKE - AIRSHIP - DAY

           General Anson, shivering and wrapped in a blanket, is on the 
           deck of the Airship. Watching as the Nautilus disappears 
           beneath the crumbling ice. 

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Get this balloon repaired now!

           Anson looks back out at the ice. Sees his men carrying 
           Aronnax’s lifeless body toward them.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. NAUTILUS HELM - LATER

           Ned and Julie look out the “eyes” as the navigators steer the 
           Nautilus away from the hazardous ice. Both seem quite somber. 
           Nemo enters, followed by crewmen carrying the metal case 
           containing the stone keys.
                                 NED
                        What’s the story with you and the Union 
                        Jackass? 

                                 NEMO
                        He murdered my countrymen and my family, 
                        then he shot me in the back and left me 
                        for dead. It is my blessing and my curse 
                        that I survived.

           Nemo removes the stones, placing them one-by-one on a golden 
           stands that looks like an ancient compass.

                                 JULIE
                        He’s behind everything. He’s the one who 
                        stole the maps...and killed my father.

                                 NED
                        What’s his interest in these? He doesn’t 
                        seem like the saving-the-world type.

                                 NEMO
                        There is more than one way to use 
                        knowledge, Mr. Land. 

                                 NED
                        You’re sure these rocks will help us find 
                        the lost world?

                                 NEMO
                        We don’t have to find it. They take us.

           Nemo places the seventh stone in the center of the spiral. 
           And then, as if they contained some kind of magnetic energy, 
           they begin to vibrate. 

           The rock crumbles, revealing seven GOLDEN OBJECTS underneath. 
           Each has a UNIQUE GLOWING SYMBOL carved into its surface. 

           The Navigators look startled as the Nautilus stops and turns 
           one hundred and eighty degrees...on its own. 

                                 NEMO
                        We are all just along for the ride now.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT

           The Airship’s balloon is repaired and slowly re-inflating. A 
           Brit bandages Aronnax’s leg.
                                 ARONNAX
                        You’re sure there’s no bullet in there? 
                        I’m quite sure I felt it.

                                 BRITISH SOLDIER
                        It just grazed you.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Perhaps there’s one lodged in my back. I 
                        was certain that I was dying. My life 
                        flashed before my eyes.

           General Anson walks on deck.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        I do apologize for the leg, professor. I 
                        had no idea you were a civilian being 
                        held prisoner by that madman.

                                 ARONNAX
                        I wasn’t a prisoner. And he’s not a 
                        madman. He wants to help the world. He 
                        means no harm.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        He is a terrorist! In India, he led a 
                        rebellion that cost thousands of innocent 
                        lives. What he hopes to discover is 
                        something that will cost millions more.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Cures for disease? An end to poverty?

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Do not fall for his lies. 

           General Anson places Dakkar’s journal in front of Aronnax. 
           Opened to a page with a terrifying picture of LORD SHIVA, THE 
           DESTROYER. A beam of energy shoots out of the god’s third 
           eye, incinerating the planet. It’s chilling.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        That is what he wants, professor. The Eye 
                        of Shiva, an ancient weapon that will 
                        bring the civilized world to its knees.

                                 ARONNAX
                        And what do you want?

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Only to make sure it doesn’t end up in 
                        uncivilized hands.
           Aronnax’s not sure who to trust at this point. Anson picks up 
           a sharp medical instrument, examines it rather ominously.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        So if you have any information that might 
                        help, the world will be in your debt.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Will you promise not to harm him? Or any 
                        of his people?

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Of course.

                                 ARONNAX
                        And if there’s no weapon you let him go.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        You have my word.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. UNDER THE SEA - DAY

           The Nautilus sails past a series of active UNDERWATER 
           VOLCANOS spewing lava. 

           INT. NAUTILUS - HELM - SAME

           Ned, Julie, and Nemo are at the window. The whole room is 
           bathed in a RED GLOW. Everyone is sweating, watching the 
           volcanic eruptions outside.

                                 NED
                        You better hurry up and find what you’re 
                        looking for or we’re all gonna start 
                        cooking in this oven.

                                 NEMO
                        Patience, Mr. Land. It’s just ahead.

           The Nautilus passes right between two of the volcano and we 
           get our first good view of --

           THE LOST WORLD

           The RUINS of an entire ancient city designed in concentric 
           circles. Protected by the circle of volcanoes. LAVA flows 
           through what were once canals. 

                                 NEMO
                        What was lost, has now been found. 

           Julie looks out in awe.
                                 JULIE
                        It’s here. It’s really here.

                                 NEMO
                        Your father was right, Julie.

                                 JULIE
                        So were you.

           They pass over the ruins. Strange, never before seen FISH 
           swim in and out of the ruins and crumbling statues. Ned sees 
           the remains of several ships. 

                                 NED
                        I’m seeing it. But I’m still not 
                        believing it. 

                                 NEMO
                        Perhaps you need a closer look.

           EXT. LOST WORLD - UNDER WATER - LATER

           The Nautilus hovers over the lost world. The dive doors open 
           and the brass rings lower the divers.

           Nemo, Ned, and Julie land on a crumbling road. Their helmets 
           are different this time. Each one has a small ANTENNA 
           protruding from it.

           Nemo motions for them to turn small BRASS KNOBS on their 
           chest guard. As they do --

                                 NEMO
                        Can you hear me?

           -- they hear Nemo’s voice. They look duly impressed by the 
           early (and as yet undiscovered) radio technology.

                                 NEMO
                        They don’t have much range so stay close.

           The divers walk through the ruins, like astronauts on a 
           strange planet. The architecture is like an advanced version 
           of Egypt/Ancient India. 

           Their destination is just ahead: a towering ZIGGURAT. 

           Nemo leads. Followed by Ned and Julie. Then Serko and Eye-
           Patch carrying the metal case. The rest follow. All armed 
           with the electric guns. 
           A CRUMBLING STONE BRIDGE

           Leads to the front of the Ziggurat. LAVA flows like a river 
           beneath it, surrounding the Ziggurat like a moat. 

                                 NED
                        Your lost world looks a lot like Hell.

           Nemo crosses first. A few pieces of the bridge crumble 
           underfoot, but he makes it across. The others follow.

           EXT. ZIGGURAT - UNDER WATER

           They climb the steps to the entrance. A sealed door is 
           covered with hieroglyphics. Nemo “reads” them. 

           Nemo removes one of the golden keys from the case, holds it 
           up to its corresponding symbol on the door. Both symbols 
           GLOW. And the door opens. 

                                 NED
                        Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

           INT. ZIGGURAT - GROUND FLOOR

           They enter an enormous, empty chamber. The door seals behind 
           them. No way out. Nowhere to go.

           But there is a symbol on the floor. 

           Nemo holds a second golden key over the matching symbol. Both 
           GLOW and the floor rises, carrying them toward the ceiling. 

           It looks like they might be crushed. But the ceiling opens. 
           The floor stops at the foot of three steps. At the top --

           SIX STATUES

           The half-men/half-fish divine beings (like those in Sumeria). 
           Each wears a breastplate containing their unique symbol.

                                 NED
                        Who are these guys? 

                                 NEMO
                        The Seven Sages, guardians of all 
                        knowledge.

           Nemo places the six stone keys in the corresponding 
           palms...and then the wall opens, revealing --
           THE LIBRARY

           An endless maze filled with thousands of CRYSTAL SKULLS. They 
           all walk inside the enormous chamber.

                                 NEMO
                        Every secret, every answer to every 
                        question man has ever had is within our 
                        reach.

           Ned picks up one of the skulls.

                                 NED
                        Where are all the books?

                                 NEMO
                        Those are the books, Mr. Land. The skulls 
                        of Shiva.

           Nemo places a crystal skull on an ALTAR-LIKE PODIUM. A BRIGHT 
           LIGHT shoots into the crystal and the DOMED CEILING is filled 
           with ANCIENT WRITING projected from within. 

                                 JULIE
                        I wish my father could have seen this.

           Julie examines a skull, peers through it...looks around...and 
           SOMETHING PASSES through her line of site. Too fast for us to 
           see. Julie jumps, drops the skull. 

                                 JULIE
                        There’s something in here.

           Everyone looks around. See nothing. Nemo motions for three 
           crewmen to investigate. 

                                 NEMO
                        Whatever it was, I’m sure we scared it 
                        away. 

           Nemo replaces the crystal skull, motions for them to move on. 

           ON AN INVESTIGATING CREWMAN

           His helmet light shines down a corridor. A SHAPE flies past 
           in a superfast BLUR. Or maybe he just imagined it...

           He turns a corner and something flies right at him. Before he 
           can register what it is, or even scream, it engulfs him.

           ON NEMO AND THE OTHERS

           They reach a spiralling stone staircase. Step by step they 
           wind their way to the upper chamber of the Ziggurat...
           INT. UPPER ANTECHAMBER

           The Seventh Sage stands guard, holding a TRIDENT. On his 
           breastplate is the NAUTILUS SPIRAL. 

                                 NED
                        All your knowledge is downstairs, 
                        Captain. There something else you’re 
                        looking for?

                                 NEMO
                        Knowledge is power, Mr. Land. And the 
                        greatest knowledge of all --

           Nemo places the seventh key in the sage’s palm. The floor 
           rises and the ceiling SPIRALS open above them. When it stops 
           they are --

           INT. SHIVA TEMPLE

           Home to a COLOSSAL SHIVA STATUE. Six arms. Three eyes. 
           Serpent draped over his shoulder. Trident in his hand. 

                                 NEMO
                        -- is the Will of God.

           The statue stands on a six foot tall base. On the base: an 
           engraving of a LARGE EYE. The pupil: a nautilus spiral. 

           Nemo presses his hand against the spiral. A BRIGHT LIGHT 
           blasts out. And then the base opens, revealing --

           THE EYE OF SHIVA

           A green crystal (the size of a football) surrounded by a 
           metallic structure and gyro mechanisms. It does indeed 
           resemble an eye. Or an ancient bomb.

                                 JULIE
                        What is it?

                        The Eye of Shiva. 

           INT. LIBRARY - SAME

           The two other investigating crewmen continue to search.

           One of them finds a HOLE in the crumbling wall. Leans down. 
           Shines his helmet light inside. Sees something. Reaches in 
           and pulls out...a DIVE HELMET. Head still inside. 

           And then a TENTACLE whips out and pulls him into the hole. 
           INSIDE THE HOLE

           Make that: NEST. Filled with dozens of squirming GIANT SQUID. 
           Each with a body ten feet long and twenty more feet of 
           tentacles. And they’re not happy to be disturbed.

           The crewman registers a second of panic before being ripped 
           apart. He lets out a HORRIBLE SCREAM. Then the SQUID swim en 
           mass out through the hole...

           INT. SHIVA TEMPLE

           Everyone hears the SCREAM in their helmets.

                                 NED
                        Whatever was swimming around down there, 
                        I think they found it.

           Serko grabs the Eye...

           ...just as three SQUID swim into the chamber. A crewman is 
           quickly engulfed. 

           Everyone BLASTS away with electric guns...

           The squid wrap their tentacles around the crewman like 
           anacondas...and his oxygen tank BURSTS causing a mini 
           pressurized explosion that blows out the chamber wall.

           The crewmen are scattered, blown all over the place. The 
           seventh sage is shattered. His TRIDENT lands near Ned. Ned 
           picks it up...

           ...as two more SQUID swim into the room. Crewmen fire at 
           them, electrify them. Then see that more are on their way. 

           Crewmen struggle to close the door, but a dozen tentacles 
           work their way through.

                                 NED
                        Nice work, Captain. You brought us right 
                        into a nest of giant squid.

                                 NEMO
                        This way!

           Nemo motions toward the GAPING HOLE in the wall caused by the 
           explosion. They all go through...

           EXT. ZIGGURAT - TOP

           ...and stand on the narrow ledge overlooking the ancient 
           ruins. And the MOAT OF LAVA ten stories below them. 
                                 JULIE
                        There’s no way down! 

           They see the Nautilus in the distance. 

           Nemo boldly leaps off the ledge...and freefalls (more 
           floating then falling since they’re in water) down along the 
           side of the Ziggurat, occasionally bumping off the side. 

           He lands safely, just missing the Lava Moat. 

           Then Ned, Julie, and the others JUMP. Serko and the Native 
           jump while holding the Eye.

           INT. ZIGGURAT UPPER CHAMBER - SAME

           Tentacles flail all over the place as a dozen squid blast 
           into the room, engulfing the crewmen who were trying to close 
           the door on them. 

           The surviving crewmen run for the hole-in-the-wall, dive out 
           headfirst...

           EXT. ZIGGURAT - DOWN BELOW

           Ned and Julie land safely near Nemo. Serko and the Native 
           land on the bridge...but it gives way under the Native. He 
           dangles over the LAVA holding onto the Eye of Shiva...which 
           is held by Serko...

           ...who is losing his footing, about to be pulled in...

           ...until the Native realizes what is happening. He lets go of 
           the Eye and falls into the lava.

           INT. UPPER CHAMBER - SAME

           The Squid finally squeeze through the door...

           EXT. ZIGGARUT - SAME

           ...and blast out of the hole like bats from a belfry. They 
           see their free-falling prey and make for them like dive 
           bombers.

           A DIVE-BOMBING SQUID catches a crewman and wraps its 
           tentacles around him. The crewman struggles...

           ...as they both fall into the MOAT OF LAVA.

           The other squid fly toward the rest of their escaping prey.
           DOWN IN THE RUINS

           Ned and the others see the swarm of dive-bombing squid make 
           mincemeat out of the crewmen.

                                 NED
                        Only thing worse then seafood...is when 
                        you’re the seafood. 

           Ned holds a gun in one hand, the trident in the other.

                        So let’s fry us up a mess of calamari.

           And here come the squid.

           Ned, Nemo, and everyone else open fire. It’s an underwater, 
           electrified alien bug-hunt. 

           INT. NAUTILUS HELM - SAME

           A hundred yards away. The two Navigators see the ELECTRIC 
           BLASTS up ahead. They spring into action, drive the Nautilus 
           forward, dragging anchors...

           EXT. RUINS - SAME

           Blue fingers of electricity are hitting everything. Squid are 
           fried, emitting HORRIBLE SQUEAKING SCREAMS as they go down. 

           BLOOD clouds the water. LAVA bubbles all around. It is Hell.

                                 NEMO
                        Hold them! The Nautilus is on its way!

           Eye-Patch is swarmed, carried away by a squid...right over 
           the lava. He fires his rifle into the squid’s beak. Both he 
           and the beast are engulfed in the electric fingers and 
           plummet into the lava.

           ON THE FRONT LINES

           Ned leads the assault. But a SQUID gets through and wraps its 
           tentacles around him, shakes him around. 

           Serko looks at Ned, wants to help --

                                 NEMO
                        Serko! Leave him! Protect the Eye!

           Serko looks at Nemo, looks at Ned. Then sets the eye down and 
           goes hand-to-hand with the beast. Julie provides cover, 
           firing at other squid. 
           Serko pulls the squid’s beak apart. It shrieks as blood 
           shoots out. 

           Ned is freed. But Julie runs our of ammo. A PAIR of angry 
           SQUID descend upon Serko. 

           Ned grabs the trident, dips it into the lava, creating WHITE 
           HOT weapon.

           He stabs one of the squid in the eye. It smokes, screams. 
           Then Ned stabs the other squid. It floats away, dead. 

           Serko falls to the ground, unconscious. 

                                 NED
                        Hang in their, buddy. I got you.

           Ned grabs him, carries him over his shoulder.

           Up ahead, Nemo is carrying the eye. The surviving crewmen 
           lumber toward the Nautilus, firing away at the squid swarm as 
           they keep coming and coming...

           BENEATH THE NAUTILUS

           Nemo, Ned, Julie and the survivors grab the brass rings and 
           are pulled into the hull, blasting at squid all the way up.

           INT. NAUTILUS - DIVE CHAMBER - SAME

           They make it inside, still firing as the floor hatch closes. 

           Safe.

           Not quite.

           A squid is inside with them. It thrashes about, swiping at 
           everyone as the chamber slowly drains. 

           Its tentacle wrap around Nemo’s throat, choking him. A 
           crewman raises his gun, but Ned knocks it away.

                                 NED
                        You shoot that in here you’ll electrocute 
                        us all!

           Nemo squirms, gasps, the life being strangled out of him. Ned 
           watches, almost as if he wants Nemo to die. Then, at the last 
           second, he impales the beast with a harpoon. 

           The squid screams, releases Nemo. The room drains of water 
           and blood. 
           Ned pulls the helmet off Serko. Blood is sputtering out of 
           his mouth. He stares at Ned, smiles slightly.

                                 SERKO
                        Nedland. Goodman.

           He reaches out his hand in friendship. Ned takes it. Then 
           Serko is gone. Everyone is silent. Nemo removes his own 
           helmet, gasping for air. Turns to Ned.

                                 NEMO
                        You saved my life. I thank you.

           Not meant to be funny. At all.

           INT. NAUTILUS - SALON - LATER

           Ned and Julie watch as surviving crewmen bury Serko and the 
           others on the sea floor. 

           Nemo descends into the salon. Cold. Distant. Followed by two 
           armed crewmen.

           Ned is ready to bring Nemo down right now. But then notices 
           the armed crewman staring at him, fingers on the trigger.

           EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

           Nemo is on deck with the armed crewmen. Julie is locked 
           inside the helm, watching through the eyes as Ned is forced 
           into a dinghy.

                                 NEMO
                        I promised I would set you free after I

                        If it’s primitive nonsense then you have 
                        nothing to worry about. You have enough 
                        supplies to last you a month. And enough 
                        treasure to last a lifetime.

           The crewmen unfasten the dinghy, push it away from the ship.

                                 NEMO
                        May we both find peace, Mr. Land.
           Ned takes one last look at Julie as the eyes close. Then Nemo 
           steps down a hatch. Seals it behind him. 

           The Nautilus slowly moves forward. The Eyes close. Ned looks 
           down at the chest of GOLD COINS in the dinghy. 

           He makes his choice, dives into the water and swims as hard 
           and as fast as he can toward --

           THE NAUTILUS

           Ned climbs on deck just as the ship begins its descent. He 
           tries to open a hatch. Locked. Shit. 

           He looks around. Notes the two nautilus shell designs 
           protruding from the tail fin -- escape pods!

           Ned runs to the back of the ship, climbs the tail as the 
           Nautilus starts to submerge. He finds a small hatch, pries it 
           open and squeezes inside...

           INT. ESCAPE POD - SAME

           A small one-man spherical pod. There is a small seat with two 
           bike peddles attached. Two boxes of supplies. 

           As water pours in, Ned seals the hatch. PITCH BLACK. Then a 
           light flickers on...because Ned is pedalling! Lights and 
           oxygen: all man-powered. It’s going to be a long ride.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The man with the binoculars: Farragut. The LIEUTENANT 
           approaches, unrolls a map of the area.

                                 LIEUTENANT
                        You think it’s about to blow?

                                 FARRAGUT
                        That was my first thought. But what kind 
                        of volcano turns itself on and off all 
                        day?

           The Lieutenant doesn’t catch his drift. 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        These islands are sitting on a large bed 
                        of coal, Lieutenant. I think we’re 
                        looking at a refinery.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. VOLCANO ISLAND - CAVERN - DAY

           The Nautilus docks. Two crewmen rise from the hatch carrying 
           the Eye of Shiva. Nemo, Julie, and the Navigators follow. No 
           one is there to greet them. 

           INT. VOLCANO BASE - MOMENT LATER

           Nemo, Julie and the surviving crewmen (and the Eye in a 
           crate), row a dinghy from the cavern and into the center of 
           the volcano...

           ...where they see: bombed-out destruction all around 
           them...the dead bodies of several of Nemo’s islanders...

                                 JULIE
                        What happened?

           ...and then the round a bend and see the Airship anchored on 
           the lake near the palace stairs, it’s balloon inflated.

           They stop rowing, look behind them. Two Brits step out of the 
           shadows aiming rifles at them. And just ahead, at the dock, 
           six more Brits and a cannon.  

           The dinghy has no choice but to dock.

                                 BRITISH SOLDIER #3
                        Welcome home, your highness.

           They bow, mocking. Two Brits commandeer the Eye.
           INT. NEMO’S ISLAND BASE - LATER

           Nemo, Julie, and what’s left of the Nautilus crew -- hands 
           all bound -- are marched to the palace. They pass the 
           surviving islanders, enslaved in a chain-gang, shovelling 
           coal into the SMOKING FURNACE. Aronnax is chained with them.

           The islanders look at Nemo with pleading eyes; Aronnax looks 
           apologetic. The Nautilus crewmen are forced to join them...

           INT. NEMO’S ISLAND PALACE - SAME

           ...while Nemo and Julie are escorted into the palace. The 
           library has been pillaged and destroyed. General Anson is 
           sitting at the table at the far end, drinking from a goblet 
           as Nemo and Julie are escorted inside.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        It’s good to be king, isn’t it? Much 
                        better than being a prince.

                                 NEMO
                        You have what you want. Release the 
                        others.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        There you go again. Always trying to give 
                        orders. When will you learn --

           He rises, walks up to Nemo, holding a sword...and hits him 
           square in the jaw with the handle.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        -- I don’t take orders from any Hin-doo.

           INT. CAVERN DOCK - SAME

           The escape pod hatch opens. Ned takes a quick look around. 
           Sees two Brits standing guard on the dock.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The Brits hear a LOUD BANG near the tail. They investigate. 
           See the open pod hatch. Look down inside --

           As Ned drops down from the tail behind them and quickly takes 
           them out of commission. Grabs their rifles.

           EXT. NEMO’S ISLAND BASE - MINES - LATER

           Two Brits stand guard over the chain-gang. Ned, wearing a 
           BRITISH UNIFORM and carrying two rifles, approaches.
                                 NED
                        You fellas need a break?

           Ned knocks ‘em out cold, strips them of their guns. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        Ned! It’s me, the professor! This is all 
                        my fault! The General is no General! He’s 
                        a madman! Nemo was telling us the truth.

                                 NED
                        Not exactly. So keep quiet. I’ll be back 
                        for you in two shots.

           Ned sneaks away. Marches past the Airship. Since he’s in 
           uniform they don’t pay a lick of attention to him.

           INT. NEMO’S ISLAND PALACE - SAME

           General Anson’s men set the Eye on the table. 

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        I was expecting something...bigger. 
                        Nevertheless, I thank you for all your 
                        hard work. I promise to take very good 
                        care of it.

                                 JULIE
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 GENERAL ANSON 
                        Because my Britannia has become weak. She 
                        no longer has the guts to rule and is 
                        letting the savages walk all over her. 
                        With this, no one can stand against me. I 
                        will take the reigns of Britannia and 
                        restore her dignity.

                                 JULIE
                        You have no idea the kind of power you’re 
                        playing with. You’ll destroy the world.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Better that then have it taken over by 
                        animals.

           Anson places his sword tip at Nemo’s throat.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Good night, sweet Prince.

           He is about to end Nemo’s life when a GUNSHOT sends his sword 
           flying. Two more gunshots disarm the Brits. 
           Ned enters. A rifle in each hand. He aims one at Nemo --

                                 NED
                        I signed onto this little adventure to 
                        kill a monster.

           -- and the other one at General Anson.

                                 NED
                        Only I’m not so sure which one of you is 
                        the scariest one. So I’m gonna hang both 
                        your heads on my wall.

           He is just about to pull the triggers when -- BAM! -- a huge 
           hole is blown through the palace wall! 

           Ned looks out the hole and sees -- the American warship.

                                 NED
                        You’ve got some bad timing, boys.

           During the distraction, Anson grabs the Eye. But Ned is right 
           there, rifles aimed at him. 

                                 NED
                        Set it down, Happy Jack. I will kill you.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        And I’ll be glad to take you with me.

           He turns the pupil of the Eye. An ENERGY PULSE rocks the 
           volcano, blowing everyone off their feet...and then an 
           endless BEAM OF LIGHT shoots out of the Eye into the sky. 

           EXT. THE AVENGER - DECK - SAME

           Farragut sees the LIGHT SPECTACLE. BLACK CLOUDS begin to 
           swirl above the sea. A WHIRLPOOL in the sky. The sea CHURNS.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        What in God’s name --

           INT. NEMO’S ISLAND PALACE - SAME

           The palace begins to shake, rock falls. Nemo is the first to 
           stir. He’s battered and covered in dust. Then he notices: 
           Anson is missing.

           Nemo grabs a sword from a dead Brit, uses the blade to cut 
           through the rope binding his wrists. 
           EXT. NEMO’S ISLAND PALACE - SAME

           General Anson runs onto the Airship. Two Brits are already 
           there. The balloon flame is stoked and the ship rises...

           INT/EXT. NEMO’S ISLAND PALACE - SAME

           Nemo moves past rubble toward the entrance and sees the 
           Airship balloon rising up outside. 

           He runs, leaps from top of the palace stairs and grabs onto 
           the metal plating on the side of the ship as rises.

           INT. NEMO’S ISLAND PALACE - SAME

           Another BLAST shakes things up. Julie and Ned rise up from 
           the rubble, as the earth shakes under their feet. They stare 
           at the GLOWING EYE and the eerie energy shooting up from it.  

           Ned tries to move toward it, but it’s like walking into a 
           tornado. And it’s hot as hell. 

                                 NED
                        How do you stop that thing!? 

                                 JULIE
                        I don’t know! 

                                 NED
                        Where’s Nemo!?

           EXT. NEMO’S ISLAND PALACE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ned and Julie race outside and see the Airship above them. 
           One of the TETHER ROPES is dangling from the side. They see 
           Nemo climbing into one of the cannon openings in the hull.

           Ned looks out over the base, sees the cavern leading to the 
           Nautilus. Rock is falling all around it.

                                 NED
                        Get the professor and take the Nautilus 
                        out of here before the whole place comes 
                        crashing down.

                                 JULIE
                        What about you?

                                 NED
                        I have a flight to catch.

           The stone palace begins to collapse, rocks falls around them.
                                 NED
                        Go! 

           Julie races down the palace steps...

           ...as Ned climbs up the rocks to the top of the palace...and 
           then to the rim of the volcano.

           The Airship passes over head. Ned is going to leap for the 
           tether rope. If he misses...it’s a long drop down to the sea.

           Ned takes a deep breath, leaps...

           ...and grabs the rope.

           EXT. FARRAGUT’S AVENGER - DECK - SAME

           The Avenger rolls back and forth in growing SWELLS. LIGHTNING 
           FLASHES from the darkened sky. 

           Farragut watches as the Airship floats up out of the volcano. 
           His crew FIRE their cannons at it...

           ...until Farragut sees the UNION JACK flying high.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Hold your fire! She’s flying friendly 
                        colors!

           EXT. AIRSHIP - SAME

           General Anson and the two remaining Brits stare in awe at the 
           energy beam shooting from the volcano. They have no idea what 
           they just unleased.

           Behind them: Nemo rises up out of a hatch. He slits the 
           throats of the Brits. Then approaches Anson from behind.

                                 NEMO
                        I should stab you in the back. But unlike 
                        you, I am no coward.

           General Anson turns, surprised. Then draws his own sword. 

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Good. Then you won’t scream and beg for 
                        mercy the way your family did.

           Nemo lunges at Anson. Anson’s blade meet his and the two 
           enemies attack each other relentlessly, without pity, 
           unleashing ten years of hatred. 
           EXT. NEMO’S ISLAND BASE - SAME

           Julie reaches Aronnax and the chain gang. The entire volcano 
           is literally collapsing all around them.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Julie! Thank God! You have no idea what 
                        I’ve been through.

           She fires a PISTOL at Aronnax’s chains, severs them. She 
           looks at the others. Including the Navigators. 

                                 JULIE
                        We have to leave this island. Now. 

           They nod in complete agreement. Julie blasts their shackles.

           EXT. AIRSHIP - OVER THE OCEAN

           Nemo and Anson are fighting to the death as the ship sways 
           back and forth with no one steering. They’re fighting next to 
           the FLAME BARREL under the balloon. 

           General Anson climbs up the balloon ropes. Nemo follows...

           BENEATH THE AIRSHIP

           Ned struggles to climb the tether rope, hand over hand, inch 
           by inch, as the sea rages below and strong winds blow. He 
           witnesses the volcano splitting apart and falling into the 
           sea one massive chunk at a time. 

           EXT. AIRSHIP - BALLOON/DECK - SAME

           General Anson and Nemo continue to clash in the web of roping 
           that covers the balloon, working their way to the top. They 
           both struggle to maintain their grip while fighting.

           Anson’s foot gets entangled in the rope. He drops his sword, 
           dangles upside down. 

           He’s a fly caught in a spider’s wed as Nemo works his way 
           closer and closer.

           Anson struggles to get loose but Nemo HACKS at the ropes 
           holding him.

           Anson falls... 

           The ropes slow his descent, but he hits the deck hard, 
           breaking his leg, and knocking over the FIRE BARREL, setting 
           the ship on fire. Anson SCREAMS as his face gets burned.
           He crawls across the deck as the FLAMES spread. He grabs a 
           PISTOL from one of the Dead Brits. 

           EXT. CAVERN DOCK - SAME

           Julie, Aronnax, and the remainder of Nemo’s crew run along 
           the dock to the Nautilus as the cavern collapses all around 
           them, shattering the dock.

           At the last second, with the dock crumbling beneath their 
           feet, they leap onto the Nautilus...and drop down the hatch.

           EXT. AIRSHIP - SAME

           The ship slowly “sinks” in the air as the balloon deflates.

           On deck, the FLAMES spread fast. Anson leans against the 
           starboard side, holding his pistol, looking for Nemo.

           He hears something ROLLING across the deck. A LARGE CANNON 
           rolls through the flames, coming right at him. Anson tries to 
           move but the CANNON BARREL pins him to the ship. 

           Then Nemo appears. Walks right through the flames holding his 
           sword. Animal eyes. Anson aims the pistol at him.

                                 GENERAL ANSON
                        Stay right there, Hin-doo.

                                 NEMO
                        I am Prince Dakkar! 

           Nemo keeps walking. Anson fires. The bullet hits Nemo in the 
           stomach. Nemo pauses for a second. Then keeps walking. 

                                 NEMO
                        And you --

           Nemo sticks his sword in the fire, uses the hot tip to light 
           the cannon fuse.

                                 NEMO
                        -- are no one.

           Nemo light the fuse. Anson’s eyes get wide with fear. 

           KA-BOOM! Anson is blown through the side of the ship, ripped 
           to pieces just like Dakkar’s country men.

           Nemo looks out over the sea. He’s in pain. But somehow looks 
           relieved of a great burden. Then he sees the ENERGY BEAM 
           blasting up from the crumbling volcano.

           Ned climbs up on the other side of the ship.
                                 NED
                        How do we stop it, Captain?

           Nemo turns, but before he answers, the FLAMES engulf the 
           ropes connecting the balloon to the ship. The balloon goes up 
           in flames, the ropes SNAP...SNAP...SNAP...

           Ned is so very annoyed. He looks to the Heavens.

                                 NED
                        I just got up here!

           EXT. OCEAN - SAME

           The FLAMING AIRSHIP plummets a hundred feet into the water...

           INT. NAUTILUS HELM - SAME

           Julie, Aronnax, and the Navigators are at the helm watching. 
           They head toward the flaming, sinking airship.

           EXT. THE AVENGER - DECK - SAME

           Farragut and his crew are also watching...

                                 CROW’S NEST SAILOR
                        Submersible astern!

           ...and then see the Nautilus heading to the wounded airship. 
           Farragut almost smiles.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Prepare depth charges!

           EXT. AIRSHIP DECK - SAME

           Good news: the plunge put out the fire. Bad news: the ship is 
           sinking fast. Ned supports Nemo as the Nautilus pulls up 
           right next to them. 

           As they get onto the deck, a LOUD ROAR fills the air --

           The last of Nemo’s Island crumbles and disappears into the 
           ocean. But the ENERGY BEAM is shooting up into the sky.

           INT. NAUTILUS - HELM - MOMENTS LATER

           Nemo, Ned, Aronnax, Julie and the surviving crewmen are at 
           the helm windows as the ship dives. Nemo looks weakened, 
           still bleeding from his wound. His every breath is labored.

           Outside, under the sea, they can see the energy beam shoots 
           up from the ocean floor amidst the remains of the island. 
                                 NED
                        How do we stop it, Captain?

                                 NEMO
                        I thought you...would understand. You 
                        said...you had seen enough of what man... 
                        can do to his fellow man. 

                                 NED
                        I was talking about myself, Captain. 

           His confession hangs there for a second. Maybe he even wishes 
           he hadn’t said it. But there it is.

                                 NED
                        If God has a beef with us, let him pull 
                        the trigger. 

           Nemo looks at Ned...Aronnax...Julie. 

                                 NEMO
                        We can run the Nautilus into it at full 
                        speed, penetrate it with the nose. But 
                        the energy we absorb may be fatal.

           A BLAST suddenly rocks the ship. 

                                 ARONNAX
                        What was that!?

           They look out of the window and see several DEPTH CHARGES 
           falling right outside.

                                 NED
                        Close the windows! Now! 

           A Navigator pulls a lever, but a blast SHATTERS one of the 
           windows. Water flood inside the helm before the window closes 
           and seals it. 

           Another BLAST causes the entire ship to tip on its side and 
           then back up again. It GROANS. Lights FLICKER on and off. Ned 
           pounds the ceiling.

                                 NED
                        Hey, up there! We’re on your side! 

           The Navigators pull levers. Dive deeper. Another BLAST. Nemo 
           looks concerned, turns to his guests. 

                                 NEMO
                        I’m afraid our journey together must end 
                        here. We’re unable to surface. You’ll 
                        have a chance in the escape pods.
           Ned looks at the crewmen.

                                 NED
                        What about them?

                                 CREWMAN
                        We stay. With Nemo.

           Loyal to the end. Nemo takes one last look at his guests.

                                 NEMO
                        Forgive me. I only wanted a better world.

           Julie looks at him sympathetically, touches his face.

                                 JULIE
                        Goodbye, Prince Dakkar.

           Another BLAST. More water.

                                 NED
                        You heard the Captain! Let’s move!

           INT. NAUTILUS CORRIDOR - SAME

           Ned, Julie, and Aronnax are in waist high water. They reach 
           the hatches to the ESCAPE PODS. Ned opens one...and water 
           comes rushing out.

                                 NED
                        Looks like that pod already escaped.

           They look nervous. Ned opens the other hatch. The pod is 
           still there. Another BLAST rocks the ship. Lights FLICKER. 

                                 NED
                        In you go, professor.

           Aronnax climbs into the pod. As Julie starts to climb in --

                                 NED
                        This will launch you to the surface. 
                        Signal the ships as soon as you can.

                                 JULIE
                        You’re not coming!?

                                 NED
                        I have a plan. 

                                 JULIE
                        No you don’t. You’ve never had a plan!
                                 NED
                        This time I do.

                                 JULIE
                        What!? What is it!?

                                 NED
                        To make it back to you.

           Ned kisses her. 

                                 NED
                        I’ll see you on the top side, Julie.

           Ned seals them in the pod, pulls a release lever...

           INT. NAUTILUS HELM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ned wades back into the helm. It is still filling with water. 
           The DEPTH GAUGE needle is at two hundred feet. 

                                 NED
                        God told me you might need a little help. 

                                 NEMO
                        You’re either very brave or very foolish.

           Another BLAST. The engine stops. The light goes out. (The 
           glow of the distant ENERGY BEAM provides the only light.)

                                 NEMO
                        We’ve lost all power and we’re sinking. 
                        Assuming the hull doesn’t rip apart, our 
                        only choices will be drown or suffocate. 

                                 NED
                        Then I’m going with foolish.

           EXT. OCEAN SURFACE -  LATER

           The ESCAPE POD shoots out of the water and bobs like a cork.

           EXT. THE AVENGER DECK - LATER

           Crewmen aim guns at the pod as it is secured to the side of 
           the ship. The hatch opens. Aronnax climbs out.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Professor Aronnax!?

                                 ARONNAX
                        Commander Farragut?

           Then Julie climbs out.
                                 FARRAGUT
                        Miss Fleischer! I can’t believe it! 

                                 JULIE
                        Ned is on that ship, Commander! 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Cease fire!

           INT. NAUTILUS HELM - SAME

           The depth gauge hits five hundred feet. Then there’s a LOUD 
           CRUNCH as the Nautilus hits bottom and tilts at a forty-five 
           degree angle. A hundred yards from the Eye. 

                                 NED
                        We can still go out there and shut it 
                        down manually, can’t we?

                                 NEMO
                        The heat will melt our diving suits.

                                 NED
                        Maybe yours but not mine.

           INT. DIVE CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           Crewmen help Ned into the Iron Duke. The whole ship shakes 
           from the quaking ocean floor outside.

                                 NEMO
                        I knew there was a reason I saved you.

                                 NED
                        I thought you saved the suit?

           Ned and Nemo exchange a brief smile as Ned is sealed inside. 

           EXT. NAUTILUS - OCEAN FLOOR - LATER

           The dive chamber floor opens and Ned slides out in the Iron 
           Duke. The ground is shaking beneath him. 

           Ned approaches the Eye. The LIGHT is blinding. And he’s 
           starting to sweat inside his suit.

           INT. NAUTILUS - NEMO QUARTERS - SAME

           Two crewmen carry Nemo into his room. Books are on the floor. 
           The Shiva statue has fallen over. 

           They leave him alone. He picks his son’s NAUTILUS SHELL off 
           the floor. And a SEPIA-TONED picture of him with his family. 
           A tear runs down his cheek. 
                                 NEMO
                        Almighty God. Enough. Enough.

           A VIOLENT JOLT shakes the ship.

           EXT. OCEAN FLOOR - SAME

           The ground rips apart around Ned. He barely keeps his 
           balance. He looks back and sees the Nautilus teetering on the 
           edge of a deep chasm. 

           But Ned continues, focused on the job at hand. The Eye is 
           right in front of him in the rubble. He glances heavenward.

                                 NED
                        Not that we deserve it. But give us one 
                        more chance. 

           He reaches out his hand...the light and heat is intense...the 
           earths shakes...the Eye drops between two rocks...

           Ned reaches for the Eye...the Iron Duke’s arm barely fits 
           between the rocks...and then gets stuck.

           The earth shakes again. More ground gives way under the 
           Nautilus...

           ...but the rocks move enough for Ned to get the Iron Duke’s 
           arm inside. He struggles to turn the pupil...

           ...until there is a BRIGHT FLASH. Then the beam is gone. And 
           the earth is still. 

           Ned smiles, relieved. Then sees the Nautilus slide into the 
           chasm. 

           Ned hurries toward it as the ship falls all the way in.

           Ned looks down. Sees Nemo through his window. The glass 
           spider-webs as the Nautilus disappears into the Abyss. 

           Then Ned realizes: he’s stranded. Until he sees the Avenger 
           five hundred feet above him. Its ANCHOR on the ocean floor.

           EXT. THE AVENGER - LATER

           Calm sea. Blue sky. Farragut, Julie, and Aronnax are on deck 
           looking out at the water as SAILORS raise the anchor.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        Farewell, old friend.
           As the anchor rises out of the water, we see the Iron Duke 
           standing on it. Everyone yells excitedly. Julie and Aronnax 
           smiles at each other.

                                 ARONNAX
                        Incorrigible.

           EXT. THE AVENGER DECK - MINUTES LATER

           Ned is removed from the suit. Farragut is all smiles.

                                 FARRAGUT
                        I believe I owe you a steak.

           Ned smiles. Farragut reaches out his had...then -- CRACK! -- 
           Ned punches him square in the jaw. 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        What the hell was that for!?

                                 NED
                        For lying to me. The “monster,” the 
                        professor, the harpooner. It was all a 
                        cover-up. You knew all along what you 
                        were hunting. 

                                 FARRAGUT
                        It was a classified mission. And in case 
                        you forgot, I used it to save your life! 

           Ned reaches his hand down for his old friend. Helps him up. 

                                 NED
                        That’s why I’m only hitting you once.

           They smile. Ned throws his arm around him. All is forgiven.

                                 NED
                        Have I got one whale of tale for you, old 
                        friend. One whale of a tale.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO HARBOR - DAY

           A CROWD gathers around the docked AVENGER. A newspaper 
           headline reads: “MONSTER DESTROYED! ARONNAX CONFIRMS IT WAS A 
           GIANT NARWHAL.” An artist has drawn the creature.

           INT. SAN FRANCISCO SALOON - SAME

           A rowdy mix of PROSPECTORS, COWBOYS, and a few tarty, gold-
           loving WOMEN. A waitress carries a plate with a HUGE STEAK on 
           it across the saloon to --
           -- a corner table by the FIREPLACE. Where we see Ned sipping 
           an ale. She slams the plate down on his table.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Sorry about the wait.

                                 NED
                        You have no idea.

           Ned tucks a napkin into his collar. Meticulously lifts his 
           utensils like a high priest handling divine instruments. He 
           cuts into his steak, holds up a bite.

                                 ARONNAX (O.S.)
                        Bon appetit.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL --

           Ned is not dining alone this time. Aronnax, Julie, and 
           Farragut are sitting at the table with him. All with big 
           steaks in front of them.

                                 NED/JULIE/FARRAGUT
                        Bon appetit.

           They all take a bite. Savor every bite. Ned raises his glass.

                                 NED
                        To land.

           They raise their glasses. And then the saloon starts SHAKING.

                                 BAR PATRONS
                        Earthquake!

           People scream and flee from the saloon. A WOODEN BEAM falls 
           near the table. But they don’t flinch. They CLINK glasses.

                                 ARONNAX/JULIE/FARRAGUT
                        To land.

           And then they drink. Ned smiles at Julie.

                                 NED
                        Such is my luck.

           Then they all resume eating their steak as if nothing 
           happened. New friends and old with many adventures to come.

           FADE OUT.
