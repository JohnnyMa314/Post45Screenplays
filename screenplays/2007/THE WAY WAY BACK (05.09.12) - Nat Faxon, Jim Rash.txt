                                                         IN BLACK:

           We hear the faint sound of CAR TIRES running over the 
           CONCRETE SEAMS of a highway.  Eventually,...

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Duncan, are you asleep?

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. STATION WAGON - DAY

           CLOSE ON DUNCAN (14), staring off, lost in thought.  He’s 
           surrounded by a mountain of SUITCASES, COOLERS, etc..  It’s 
           cramped.  

           PULL BACK to reveal he’s sitting in that ill-conceived back 
           bench seat that faces out the rear of a vintage 1971 Buick 
           Estate station wagon.  

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        ... Duncan?

           CLOSE ON REARVIEW MIRROR.  TRENT RAMSEY (MAN’S VOICE) glances 
           back at Duncan. 

                                 TRENT
                        Duncan, are you sleeping?

           Clearly, Duncan wishes he was.

                                 DUNCAN
                        No.

           DUNCAN’S POV of a SUV of TEENAGERS passing by.  They gawk, 
           flip him off. 

                                 TRENT
                        Let me ask you something.  On a 
                        scale from one to ten, what do you 
                        think you are?

           Beat.  No response.

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        Duncan?  I’m asking you how you see 
                        yourself.  On a scale from one to 
                        ten.

                                 DUNCAN
                        I don’t know.
                                 TRENT
                        What?  You need to speak up, buddy.

                                 DUNCAN
                           (louder)
                        I don’t know.

           DUNCAN’S POV of a BILLBOARD on the opposite side of the 
           highway.  It reads, “Turn around!  You missed it!  Wave 
           Country Waterpark!  Two miles back!”

                                 TRENT
                        What don’t you know?  How you see 
                        yourself?  You don’t have an 
                        opinion?

           Duncan doesn’t respond. 

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        I’m just curious.  Pick any number 
                        on a scale...

                                 DUNCAN
                        A six.

                                 TRENT
                        What?

                                 DUNCAN
                        A six!

           Trent takes this in. 

                                 TRENT
                        I think you’re a three.

           Damn.  Duncan definitely doesn’t know how to respond. 

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        Do you know why I think you’re a 
                        three?  Do you know what would make 
                        me say that? 
                           (beat)
                        Duncan...?

                                 DUNCAN
                        No.

                                 TRENT
                        You don’t know why?  You have no 
                        idea?

                                 DUNCAN
                        No.
                                 TRENT
                        You’ve got to speak up.

           Duncan turns all the way around, making eye contact with 
           Trent in the rearview mirror.

                                 DUNCAN
                           (louder)
                        No.

                                 TRENT
                        Well, from what I’ve observed, I 
                        can’t say I see you putting 
                        yourself out there, buddy.  

           From this vantage point, Duncan surveys the landscape.  In 
           the back seat, comfortably stretched out, asleep, and 
           listening to her iPod, is STEPH...

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        Meeting kids your own age.  And, 
                        from what your mom tells me, you 
                        seem content just to hang around 
                        her apartment. 

           ... And, riding shotgun, his mom, PAM.  She’s asleep as well.

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        Is that a fair assessment?  That 
                        you’re happy to just... Not do 
                        anything?  Because, see, that’s a 
                        “three” to me.

           Duncan glances back at Trent in the mirror. 

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        But, the good news is I can tell 
                        you that there’s going to be plenty 
                        of kids, and plenty of 
                        opportunities at the beach for you 
                        to take advantage of this summer.
                        And, it’s a big summer for all of 
                        us, really.  See if we can make 
                        this work... You and your Mom, me 
                        and Steph... All making it work 
                        together.  As a family.
                           (beat)
                        So, what do you say?  Let’s try to 
                        improve that score.  Aim higher 
                        than a three? 

           Duncan sits back down, facing out the back.  He grabs his 
           iPod. 
                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        That sound good?
                           (beat)
                        You up for that, buddy?

           He puts his earphones in, as we...  BEGIN MAIN TITLES

           EXT. HIGHWAY 

           We now see the station wagon in all its glory.  It’s in mint 
           condition.  Strapped to the top, more BAGS.  As for the rest 
           of the cars on the highway, they’re very much 2012.  The 
           station wagon pulls off the EXIT RAMP.  Another BILLBOARD 
           reads, “This is it! This is the exit! Wave Country 
           Waterpark!” 

           EXT. STREET

           The station wagon drives along the main street.  A quaint 
           beach town.  Dated.  TOURISTS/LOCALS, flood the sidewalks.  
           The station wagon arrives at a... 

           STOP SIGN.  A CONVERTIBLE pulls up behind.  The DRIVER is 
           wearing classic Vaurnet sunglasses.  Although retro, they 
           seem to work for him.  The Driver looks right at Duncan, 
           enjoying the awkwardness.  Duncan doesn’t know where else to 
           look.  The Driver nods, smiles.  The station wagon continues 
           straight, as the convertible turns off to the left, 
           screeching away.

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE

           The station wagon pulls into the DRIVEWAY.  Beach front 
           property.  Prime real estate.  The house has a very masculine 
           vibe. 

           END MAIN TITLES

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Trent unpacks.  Duncan takes in his “home” for the summer.  
           Pam steps up behind him, puts her hand on his shoulder.  This 
           is our first good view of Pam.  She’s wearing a stylish HEAD 
           SCARF.  In fact, her whole look is unique.  Her own.  Duncan 
           and Pam notice the retro SURFBOARD hanging over the DOORWAY.  
           On it, the “name” of the house.  “Riptide.”

           Suddenly, BETTY THOMPSON, pops out, wine glass in hand.  Her 
           house’s name: “Booze Cruizin’.”  
                                 BETTY
                        Yoohoo!

                                 TRENT
                           (under his breath)
                        Are you kidding? We just got here.

           Betty descends the stairs.

                                 BETTY
                        Thank God!  One more night of 
                        drinking alone and I was going to 
                        kill myself!
                           (then, re: wine glass)
                        Yes, I’m off the wagon again. 
                        Accept it and move on.
                           (then, re: station wagon)
                        Nice ride, Trent.  Does the eight 
                        track still work?

                                 TRENT
                           (smiling)
                        What?  This is exactly the car my 
                        dad used to drive us in.

                                 BETTY
                        Huh.  Old and shitty.

                                 TRENT
                        You know how much I paid for this? 
                        It’s in cherry condition.

                                 BETTY
                        A car salesman with bad taste. 
                        Shocker.

           Betty turns to Pam, invading her space.   

                     BETTY (CONT’D)
                                                      PAM
           Hi.  I’m Betty.
                                          Hi,... Pam...

                     BETTY (CONT’D)
                                                      PAM
                                          No, um... We were just...  
           Trent’s probably already 
           talked shit about me.  It’s 
           okay if he has.  Has he?  
           What did he say?  

                         BETTY
                (off scarf)
                                                      PAM
                                          Oh, thank you...
           I’m loving this.  I couldn’t 
           pull it off.  My hair seems 
           to hate me.
                         BETTY
                                                      PAM
                (to Trent)
                                             (giving up)
           I like her.
                                          ... Okay.  

           Pam goes to pull a suitcase out of the car.  

                                 TRENT
                        What’s not to like?

           Pam catches Trent, ogling.  Embarrassed, she looks at Betty. 

                                 BETTY
                        Oh, honey.  Get it where you can.  
                        I’d be on my back after a line like 
                        that.

           Just then, we hear a SCREEN DOOR CLOSE.  Betty looks up to  
           find SUSANNA THOMPSON, her daughter, standing on their deck.  
           She’s quite cute.  A very “mature beyond her years” look. 

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        Susanna, Trent’s here.  And this is 
                        his girlfriend, Pam.  Say, “Hi.”

           Duncan, curious, peeks over the top of the car.

                                 SUSANNA
                           (waving)
                        Hi.

           Beat.  Susanna stays put.  Betty waits for more. 

                                 BETTY
                           (sarcastic)
                        Yeah, but don’t come down.
                           (to Pam/Trent, sotto)
                        Just stand there, brooding.
                           (then, noticing Duncan)
                        Oh.  You’ve brought me a man.  How 
                        thoughtful.  Who is this in all his 
                        “awkward stage” glory?

           Duncan embarrassed, leans around Betty, seeing if Susanna 
           heard that. 

           DUNCAN’S POV of Susanna going back inside.

           Pam puts her arm around Duncan, pulls him in.

                                 PAM
                        This is my son.
                                 BETTY
                        Wait, he’s not yours.  There is NO 
                        way you’re old enough... 

                                 PAM
                        Mathematically... Actually, yes.  
                        This is Duncan.

           She brushes the hair out of his eyes.

                                 BETTY 
                        Oh my God.  I was going to name my 
                        youngest “Duncan,” but my ex-
                        husband thought it was nerdy.  So, 
                        we went with “Peter.”  Which, 
                        personally, I think is worse.  But, 
                        it fits my son, so...
                           (then, to Duncan)
                        Don’t worry, you wear the name 
                        well.  Trent, where’s Steph?

                                 TRENT
                        Well, we’ve been here all of two 
                        minutes, so probably changing for 
                        the beach.

                                 BETTY
                           (to Pam)
                        She’s just like me.  Screw cancer. 
                        I want to be an even golden brown. 
                        Everywhere.

           Trent, Pam, and Duncan start lugging stuff inside.  There’s 
           plenty to grab, but Betty doesn’t notice. 

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        Well, everybody’s back this year.
                        The Gales.  The Hutchinsons.  The 
                        Campbells, sans Ben because of the 
                        trial.
                           (then, to Pam)
                        Insider trading. 
                           (then)
                        The Smythes.  Oh, and the Keegans, 
                        who I’m not talking to, but you can 
                        if you want, but just know that 
                        most of us aren’t.

           Pam passes the mailbox, glances at it.

           CLOSE ON mailbox.  The side reads, “The Ramseys.”

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        So, do you think you will?  Pam?
                                 PAM
                        Do I think I will, what?

                                 BETTY
                        Talk to the Keegans.

                                 PAM
                        Oh, I don’t know.  I don’t even 
                        know them. 

                                 BETTY
                        Well, do if you want to, but know 
                        that I’m mad at them.  I don’t even 
                        want to get into why.
                           (then, sotto to Pam)
                        They called me a C-U-N-T.
                           (then, excited)
                        You’re going to love it here!

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Pam puts away groceries.  Trent makes a Bloody Mary.  Duncan 
           sits on a stool at the counter, as does Betty, who is helping 
           herself to a bag of POTATO CHIPS.

                                 BETTY 
                        So, how was your winter? 

           Pam starts to respond, but...

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        Because our year was a challenge. 
                        My niece was raped in October...

                                 PAM 
                        Oh my goodness...

                                 BETTY
                        I know.  Not even food courts are 
                        safe.  Oh, and well, Bob, that’s my 
                        ex-husband, finally came out of the 
                        closet.  Not a shock.  Let’s just 
                        say that, in bed, his favorite view 
                        was the back of my head.  Now, my 
                        oldest, Charlie, is still into the 
                        drugs and psychedelic music.  The 
                        drugs I get.  But, come on, Gary 
                        Garcia’s dead!  Let it go, already!

           Betty laughs.  Pam glances at Trent, mouthing the word 
           “Gary?”  Trent waves it off.
                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                           (to Duncan)
                        Don’t do drugs, Declan...  

                                 DUNCAN
                        ... Duncan...

                                 BETTY 
                           (not hearing)
                        ... They’re just terrible.  Oh, and 
                        Susanna.  Well, you saw. She’s a 
                        walking mood.  Going through an “I 
                        hate my mother phase.”  Taking her 
                        father’s side, as usual. 

           Steph enters, wearing the tiniest of tiny bikinis.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Steph, sweetie, don’t you look 
                        great.  That’s exactly the kind of 
                        suit that got me pregnant the first 
                        time.

                                 STEPH
                        That’s what I’m hoping for.

                                 TRENT
                        Hey,...

                                 STEPH
                           (rolling her eyes)
                        I’m kidding!

           Steph grabs a beer from the six-pack on the counter.  Thrown, 
           Pam glances at Trent, who seems oblivious.  Pam takes her 
           look to Betty, who commiserates.

                                 BETTY
                        I know.  I can’t drink beer 
                        anymore, either. 
                           (then, grabbing her sides)
                        Look at these muffin tops.  Oh, and 
                        my youngest, Peter... He had 
                        surgery to fix his lazy eye. Now, 
                        it’s even worse.  I try to get him 
                        to wear the eye patch, so people 
                        don’t feel uncomfortable. But, what 
                        are you going to do? 

           Betty notices Pam putting some “snack foods” into a cabinet.
                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        No, lower shelf, sweetie.  You’re 
                        going to want snack items 
                        accessible.  Save that space for 
                        these fancy crackers.
                           (off package)
                        5.99?!

           Steph shoves a couple more beers into her beach bag. 

                                 STEPH 
                        I’m outta here.

                                 TRENT 
                        Oh, hey, take Duncan with you. 

           Trent makes a point to look at Duncan, encouraging. 

                                 STEPH
                        Fuck that noise.  I told you I’m 
                        not baby-sitting him all summer.

                                 TRENT
                        You’re taking Duncan with you, 
                        young lady.

           Duncan looks at his Mom. “Do I not get a say?”

                                 PAM
                           (off Duncan)
                        Go to the beach, sweetie.  You’ll 
                        have fun.  We’re just going to be 
                        unpacking here.

                                 TRENT
                           (suggestive, playful)
                        Well,...

           Trent caresses Pam’s ass, pulls her in and kisses her.  She 
           placates, but is definitely blushing.

                                 BETTY
                        That’s our cue, kids.
                           (then)
                        Oh.  Now, I am still having our 
                        annual Fourth of July Clambake even 
                        though Bob’s not here this year. 
                        He’s probably sucking off our 
                        gardener right now.  Okay well, 
                        let’s have a fun summer!

           Betty exits, taking the potato chips with her.  Duncan 
           glances at his mom, hoping to be saved.  But, she’s lost in 
           Trent. 
                                 STEPH
                        ... You coming or what?

           Steph leaves.  Duncan shuffles out the door. 

           EXT. DUNES - MOMENTS LATER

           Steph strides down the WOODEN PATH.  Duncan, still in jeans 
           and a T-shirt, lags behind. 

                                 STEPH
                        Keep your distance.  And, just 
                        don’t die.  I don’t need that shit 
                        over my head.

           EXT. BEACH - A LITTLE LATER

           Steph sits in the sand with her friends, KATY and LAURA. 
           Susanna is there as well, reading.  Although the same age as 
           Steph, Susanna has a maturity level that is leaps and bounds 
           beyond the rest of the girls.  Steph’s boyfriend (or “summer 
           friend”), CHAD, is playing football with some GUYS nearby.  
           Seated off to the side, Duncan. 

                                 LAURA
                        Oh hey, just so you guys know, my 
                        house is out this year for 
                        partying. 

                                 STEPH/KATY
                        What?! Are you kidding?/I’m hating 
                        you right now! I’m serious.

                                 LAURA
                        My grandmother came up with us.  
                        So, my mom’s like, “This could be 
                        her last summer alive.”  And I’m, 
                        like, “Yeah, well, I’m currently 
                        living, so...”

                                 KATY
                        What a selfish bitch.

                                 LAURA
                        I know.  This is, like, my summer.

                                 STEPH 
                        Well, we can absolutely party at my 
                        place.  My dad only gets to see me, 
                        twice a year, so he totally just 
                        wants me to be happy.  
                                 LAURA
                        That’s exactly the type of parent 
                        I’m going to be.

                                 STEPH/KATY
                        It just makes sense./I’m gonna do 
                        drugs with my kids.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh my God.  I forgot.  Willem broke 
                        up with Jessica. 

                                 STEPH/KATY
                        Are you serious?/Good. I don’t get 
                        her face.

                                 STEPH
                        Susanna, you have to get on that 
                        this summer. 

                                 LAURA
                        If I’m not already on it.

           The girls laugh.  

                                 STEPH
                           (jokingly)
                        Don’t be a stupid bitch.

           Susanna rolls her eyes at the lameness, goes back to her 
           book.  Steph hops up.

                                 STEPH (CONT’D)
                           (calling off)
                        Chad!  

           ANGLE ON Chad, preoccupied with his friends.

                                 STEPH (CONT’D)
                        Chad!

                                 CHAD
                        What?!

                                 STEPH
                        I want to go in the water!

                                 CHAD
                        Then, go!

           Steph just takes the moment in stride, brushes off.  She 
           notices Duncan staring at them.
                                 STEPH
                        What are you staring at, perv?

           Steph walks off with Katy and Laura...

                                 LAURA
                        Where is that kid from, anyway?

                                 STEPH
                        Albany.  He and his mom.  They live 
                        in, like, a one bedroom apartment.

                                 LAURA/KATY
                        Eww!/Tragic.

                                 STEPH
                           (noticing)
                        Uh, Susanna.  We’re all swimming!

           Duncan watches Susanna reluctantly jump up, join them. 

           EXT. DUNES - A LITTLE LATER

           Duncan heads back toward the houses.  From the opposite 
           direction, Betty and her son, PETER. 

                                 BETTY
                        Duncan, we were just coming to find 
                        you.  This is Peter.

                                 PETER
                        Hey, Duncan.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Hey.

           Betty wasn’t kidding.  Peter’s eye goes in every direction.  
           Duncan doesn’t know where to look.

                                 BETTY
                        Oh, just stare at the bridge of his 
                        nose.  That’s what I do.

                                 PETER
                        Mom!  Jesus.

                                 BETTY
                        Well, if you wore the patch, I 
                        wouldn’t have to keep telling 
                        people that, would I?!  Duncan, I 
                        was thinking that you and Peter 
                        should hang out this summer.

                                 BETTY (CONT'D)
                        Lord knows he brought enough of his 
                        Star Wars dolls.  You could have 
                        fun with those.

                                 PETER
                        They’re action figures, mom!  And 
                        they’re classics!  
                           (then, to Duncan)
                        I’ve got a rare wookie and the C-
                        3PO with detachable arms.  They 
                        lose value if I take them out of 
                        the boxes, but we can still have 
                        awesome battles with them.

                                 BETTY
                        He needs human contact.  He’s 
                        having too many conversations with 
                        those dolls.

                                 PETER
                        No, I’m not!

                                 BETTY
                        I’ve heard you, Peter!  You called 
                        that “Baby Foot,” or whatever, your 
                        best friend. 

                                 PETER
                           (not worth the effort)
                        Boba Fett...

                                 BETTY
                           (ignoring, to Duncan)
                        So, should we set up a time for you 
                        two to get together tomorrow?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Uh, I should check with my mom.

           Duncan starts off. 

                                 BETTY
                           (calling after)
                        Okay, well, don’t stand us up 
                        because we know where you live!
                           (then, to Peter)
                        See, I told you.  Your eye makes 
                        people uncomfortable.

                                 PETER
                        You’re the worst parent.
           INT./EXT. BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan enters.  From upstairs, PLAYFUL LAUGHING.  Pam and 
           Trent are clearly fooling around.  With that, Duncan turns 
           right around, and heads back out.

           EXT. STATION WAGON - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan is lying on top of the roof, eyes closed, listening to 
           his iPod.  Unfortunately, he’s listening to Journey’s “Don’t 
           Stop Believin’.” AND, he’s singing out loud. 

           He opens his eyes to see...

           Susanna watching him from her deck.  He fumbles with the 
           iPod, drops it.  The earphones stay in, the console falls to 
           the ground.  Embarrassed, he looks up, only to see that...

           ... She’s gone. 

           INT. BEACH HOUSE - DUSK

           Duncan comes down the stairs.  Pam is cooking.  Trent is 
           making drinks.  With them, Trent’s friends, KIP and JOAN 
           SMYTHE.  Music blares on the stereo.  They’re all drinking 
           and trying to sing along, but clearly don’t know all of the 
           words.  Joan is dancing, occasionally tugging on Kip to join 
           her.  But, to no avail.

                                 KIP
                        So, Pam, what do you think of the 
                        house?  Are you rethinking Trent 
                        after getting caught in the...
                           (playing up)
                        “Riptide.”

           Trent smiles, shakes his head.  He takes a lot of shit for 
           that.

                                 PAM
                           (smirking)
                        There is a lot of testosterone.

                                 JOAN
                        I’m into it.

                                 TRENT
                        Hey, I’m up for whatever.  I’m not 
                        set in my ways.

           Kip and Joan, scoff at this notion.
                                 JOAN
                        Tell that to Christine.

           Kip casually taps Joan, but she’s too involved with dancing 
           to realize her faux pas. 

                                 TRENT
                           (moving on)
                        Pam’s already got some great ideas. 
                        I told her I want her to really put 
                        her stamp on the place.

           Trent kisses Pam’s neck.  Joan and Kip take in this Trent.   
           Kip, impressed.  Joan, maybe not as much.

                                 PAM
                           (clarifying)
                        I mentioned rearranging a few 
                        things.

           Pam places two large, empty platters on the counter.  She 
           notices Duncan. 

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Oh hey, sweetie. 

           She kisses him on the forehead.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        You guys, this is Duncan.  These 
                        are Trent’s friends, Kip and Joan.

           Pam starts to arrange hor d’ourves on the platters.  Without 
           even being prompted, Duncan helps out. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        Hey. 

           They ad-lib, “hellos.”  Broken by,...

                                 TRENT
                        Hey, buddy, any chance you were on 
                        top of my car? 

           Duncan takes a moment, then...

                                 DUNCAN
                           (shaking head)
                        No.

                                 TRENT 
                        Cause there was a dent in the roof.
                        It popped back up.  So, it’s okay. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TRENT  (CONT'D)
                        I’m just wondering if you knew 
                        anything about that?

                                 PAM
                           (innocent)
                        Well, we did have bags up there, 
                        honey.

           Not the one he wanted to hear from, but...

                                 TRENT
                        That’s true.  We did.  Fair enough.

           Trent smiles for Pam’s benefit. 

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                           (pointed, to Duncan)
                        So, that’s probably it. 

           He winks at Duncan, smirks. 

                                 JOAN
                        Can I help you with this, too, Pam?

                                 PAM
                        Oh.  No.  Thank you.
                           (then, smiling at Duncan)
                        We’ve kind of got a system. 

           Trent puts his arm around, Pam. 

                                 TRENT
                        We’ve got a good team, here.

           He kisses her cheek.  He seems proud.  Joan puts on a good 
           face, then...

                                 JOAN 
                           (to Duncan)
                        Okay.  We just met, but I can’t get  
                        either one of these guys to dance 
                        with me, so...

           Duncan tries to protest, but... 

                                 PAM
                           (teasing)
                        What?  It’s our job to scar you for 
                        life.

           Joan dances toward Duncan, encouraging.
                                 KIP
                        Joan, don’t creep him out right 
                        away. 

                                 JOAN
                           (laughing)
                        I’m not being creepy. 
                           (then, to Duncan)
                        Do you think I’m being creepy?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Um,... No?

           Joan takes Duncan’s hand.  He slowly starts to comply.  It’s 
           awkward. 

                                 JOAN
                        Whoo!  There you go!

           Pam and Joan enjoy watching Duncan.  Trent and Kip aren’t 
           sure what the hell they’re watching.  Just then, Steph 
           crosses through wearing a very revealing outfit.

                                 STEPH
                        Later.

           She grabs a six pack of beer.  Trent doesn’t bat an eye. 

                                 PAM
                        Oh, but Steph I made us dinner...

                                 STEPH 
                        Oh, shoot.  I promised some friends 
                        I’d meet them.  But, thanks.

                                 JOAN
                           (to Steph)
                        Check out Duncan’s moves.

           She watches for a beat, then...

                                 STEPH 
                        Enjoy therapy.

           Trent/Kip can’t help but laugh.  Steph leaves.  Duncan 
           becomes self-conscious, stops dancing. 

                                 JOAN
                        No, keep going.

                                 TRENT
                        Okay, that’s enough of that.

           Trent changes the music.
                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get that grill going.

           INT. BEACH HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

           Post dinner.  Joan, holding court.  Duncan pushes remnants of 
           food around on his plate.

                                 JOAN
                        No, I can tell you exactly where I 
                        was.  Passed out in the dunes.

           The guys laugh.  Pam is out of the loop, but puts on a 
           gracious face.

                                 TRENT
                        That’s right!

                                 JOAN
                        Because, you left me there!

                                 TRENT
                        No, now wait!  Kip wanted to go out 
                        on his boat.  He said you’d be fine 
                        by the fire. 

                                 JOAN
                        You never came back!  I woke up to 
                        some kids poking me with a stick!

           The guys laugh.  Pam takes a moment to connect with Duncan. 
           She smiles, winks.  Kip starts piling more food onto his 
           plate.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Now, Trent, was it last year that 
                        you and I...?

                                 KIP
                        Okay, I just have to point out that 
                        I’m loading up for the third time 
                        and I’m already full.

           Joan puts on a good face, but clearly not a fan of being 
           interrupted.

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        Pam, this is absolutely incredible.

                                 PAM
                        Thank you.
                                 KIP
                        No, thank you.
                           (then, re: Trent)
                        And sorry this asshole sprung us on 
                        you, last minute.

                                 PAM
                        It’s fine.  I’m a caterer.  I love 
                        cooking for people.

                                 TRENT
                        One of her many talents. 

           Trent kisses her.  Pam smiles, graciously.  She’s not used to 
           being put on a pedestal.  It shows.

                                 JOAN
                        So, you cater, huh?  Well, that 
                        makes sense.

           Joan takes a sip of her wine, smiles.  Trent opens another 
           bottle of wine.

                                 PAM
                        Okay.  I’m sorry, I have to put my 
                        son out of his misery.
                           (smiling, to Duncan)
                        You’re free to go.

           With that, Duncan jumps up from the table.  Finally, relief.

                                 TRENT
                        But, take your plate, buddy.  We 
                        clean up after ourselves in this 
                        house.

           Duncan complies, as Trent pours Pam some more wine.  

                                                      JOAN
                                             (to Trent)
                          PAM
           You know, I once went to this 
           horrible luau-themed party...
                                          Now, was it last summer...?

                          PAM
           Oh, I’m sorry...
                                                      JOAN
                                             (faux sincere)
                                          No.  Go.  Please.  

                                 JOAN
                           (passively)
                        I’ll get this story in at some 
                        point...

                                 PAM
                        No, please.  You were talking...
                                 TRENT
                        Tell your story, babe.

                                 KIP
                        Yeah.  Enough of us, reminiscing...

                                 PAM
                        No.  It’s dumb... 

                                 JOAN
                        Well, now we have to hear it.

                                 PAM
                        Really, it’s...

           They prod her more until...

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                           (quickly, getting it over 
                           with)
                        One time I went to this luau and 
                        passed out in the dunes, too.  
                        That’s basically it.  

           Dead air.  A flop of a story.  But, everyone fanes enjoyment 
           to ease the awkwardness for Pam. 

                                 JOAN
                           (passively)
                        Oh, how funny.

                                 PAM
                           (embarrassed)
                        It was just... A similar thing 
                        to...

           Trent pulls in Pam close, smiling.  He’s very attracted to 
           this side of Pam, endeared even more. 

                                 JOAN
                        Okay.  Trent, was it last summer 
                        that you and I got stuck out on our 
                        boat?

                                 TRENT
                           (pointing to Kip)
                        Yes, cause this bastard buys gas, 
                        three dollars at a time! 

           They all laugh, and continue to reminisce.  Duncan finishes 
           cleaning off his plate, heads down the hallway.  Pam watches 
           him wander off.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan looks around aimlessly for anything to pass the time.  

           - Surveys the BOOKCASES.  Slim pickings.  Mostly romance 
           novels.   

           - Checks out a PLAQUE.  It’s engraved.  “Trent Ramsey, Car 
           Salesman of the Year.”

           - Looks at FRAMED PHOTOS.  Most of them of summers past.  One 
           catches his eye in particular.  It’s a GROUP SHOT.  Among 
           them, Trent, Kip, Joan, and Betty.  AND, there’s one WOMAN of 
           interest.  While everyone else is looking at the CAMERA, 
           she’s looking at Trent.  But, she’s turned at such an angle 
           that we can’t see much of her face, if any at all.  Hanging 
           onto her, Steph, smiling at the CAMERA. 

           - Opens a HALL CLOSET.  Practically empty, save for one old, 
           ratty edition of CANDYLAND and a 500 PIECE PUZZLE (Something 
           lame, like kittens in a basket.)

           - Duncan sits on the FLOOR.  In front of him, the almost 
           completed PUZZLE.  Just two pieces left to put in.  He looks 
           around.  Shakes the box.  No pieces to be found.  Sighs and 
           just starts taking it apart.

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - BACK DECK - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Duncan walks out, looks out over the dunes. 

                                 BETTY (O.S.)
                        Susanna, close the screen door!  
                        I’m getting eaten alive by 
                        mosquitos!

           Duncan looks over at the adjacent deck, noticing Susanna, 
           sitting in a lounge chair.  She gets up, slams the screen 
           door shut. 

                                 BETTY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I don’t like the way you’re acting, 
                        young lady!  You wouldn’t be this 
                        way if your dad was here!

           Feeling Duncan’s stare, Susanna looks over at him.  Caught, 
           Duncan looks away quickly.  Beat.  He looks back to see if... 
           Yep.  Susanna’s still looking at him.

                                 SUSANNA 
                        Hey.
                                 DUNCAN
                        ... Hey.

           Beat.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about... I didn’t mean to...

                                 SUSANNA
                        Oh, I don’t care.  It’s not like we 
                        were using our inside voices.

                                 DUNCAN
                        That’s cool.  That’s cool.

           Beat.  An eternity.

                                 SUSANNA
                        So,... You’re a big fan of Journey? 

                                 DUNCAN
                        ... What?

                                 SUSANNA
                        “Don’t Stop Believin’?”

                                 DUNCAN
                        Oh, no.  My mom must have put that 
                        on there. 

                                 SUSANNA
                        Oh, and you just got to it and 
                        thought, “What the hell. I’m going 
                        to sing the shit out of it, 
                        anyway?”

                                 DUNCAN
                           (trying to play it off)
                        Something like that.

           We hear LOUD LAUGHTER from inside Trent’s house. 

                                 SUSANNA
                        Sucks here, huh?

                                 DUNCAN
                           (shrugging)
                        It’s okay.

                                 SUSANNA
                        It sucks.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Yeah, no.  Totally.  Big time.
           Beat.  Susanna waits for more, then...

                                 SUSANNA 
                        Alright, well...

           She starts back inside.

                                 DUNCAN 
                        Feels like it’s going to be a hot 
                        summer. 

                                 SUSANNA
                        Oh.  I thought we were done.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Oh,... I was thinking about that 
                        earlier... That hot thing... And, 
                        it just came to me again.

                                 SUSANNA
                           (smiling)
                        Okay.  Well, if something else 
                        comes to you,... Again.  I’ll be 
                        inside. 

           Susanna heads in.  Duncan collapses into a lounge chair, 
           making himself as small as he can.

           EXT. DUNES - DAWN

           The sun is just coming over the horizon. 

           INT. HALLWAY 

           Duncan passes by his mom’s room.  Door, closed.  Silence.

           INT. KITCHEN 

           It’s a mess.  Pretty much everything left out from the night 
           before.  Clearly, not everyone cleans up after themselves.  
           Steph is there, scavenging the fridge.  

                                 STEPH
                        They drank all the beer.

           She slams the fridge door, storms out.  Duncan finds a $20 
           BILL on the COUNTER.  Next to it, a NOTE.  It reads, “Up 
           late. Sleeping in. Love you, Mom.”
           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan walks down the stairs.

                                 BETTY (O.S.)
                        Peter, don’t get mad at me.  I 
                        don’t know where you’re looking!

           Duncan stops in his tracks.  Shit.  Betty and Peter are at 
           the base of their front STAIRS.

                                 PETER
                        Forget it!  It’s gone!

                                 BETTY 
                        Well, next time you say, “Look at 
                        the seagull,” you have to remember 
                        to point!

           Duncan makes a quick break for it, ducking behind the station 
           wagon.  He crawls over to the STORAGE SHED, opens it.  A BIKE 
           leans against the back wall, but we can’t quite make it out.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan rides the bike through town.  It’s a girl’s PINK 
           CRUISER, complete with front basket and tassels.  But, he 
           doesn’t care.  For the first time, he seems content. 

           EXT. MARC ANTHONY’S - LATER

           It’s a PIZZA JOINT.  A cool, old school vibe.  Duncan leans 
           the BIKE against the wall.  Parked at the CURB, the 
           Convertible we saw earlier. 

           INT. MARC ANTHONY’S

           Duncan is at the COUNTER, buying a SOFT DRINK.  Behind him, a 
           table of rowdy GUYS, all in BLUE SHIRTS, eating pizza.   We 
           hear the familiar MUSIC of a PAC MAN GAME starting.  Duncan’s 
           attention is drawn to the...

           BACK GAME ROOM. Another BLUE-SHIRTED GUY is playing Pac Man.  
           EXCEPT for the classic PAC MAN upright, the rest of the video 
           games are very 2012.  Duncan approaches, standing right 
           behind the Guy, watching.

                                 GUY
                        Do you mind standing to the side? 
                        I’m getting your reflection in the 
                        screen.
                                 DUNCAN
                        ... Sorry.

           Duncan steps to the side.  As he does, we get our first good 
           look at the guy.  It is, in fact, the DRIVER of the 
           convertible.  

           CLOSE ON LOGO.  It reads, “Wave Country Waterpark.”

                                 GUY
                        I wouldn’t normally care, but I’m 
                        having the game of my life.  I’m on 
                        the cherry level.

                                 DUNCAN
                        But, that’s the first level.

                                 GUY
                        Yeah, and I still have one man 
                        left.  So, like I said, it’s the 
                        game of my life.

                                 DUNCAN
                           (smirks)
                        You like Pac Man?

                                 GUY
                        What?  It’s a classic!
                           (re: other games)
                        Not into all the bells and 
                        whistles, my man.  Too much going 
                        on.

           CLOSE ON Pac Man screen.  Pac Man chases a “blinking ghost”, 
           barely devouring it before it changes back.

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        See, my mistake is that I get  
                        greedy.  Going for all the ghosts 
                        and fruit instead of just clearing 
                        pellets.

                                 DUNCAN 
                        You know, there’s a pattern.

                                 GUY
                        Oh, don’t tell me you’re one of 
                        those guys.  That takes all the 
                        challenge out of it.  Anybody can 
                        learn a pattern.

           Just then, the blue-shirted GUYS start to get up, putting up 
           their TRAYS. 
                                 BLUE-SHIRTED GUY
                        Owen, we gotta go!

           We hear the familiar sound of PAC MAN DYING. 

                                 OWEN (GUY)
                        Well, so much for the game of my 
                        life.

                                 DUNCAN
                        You still have another man left.

                                 OWEN 
                        Naw, I’ve yet to see the second 
                        board.  Gives me something to look 
                        forward to.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Oh, the board’s always the same.

                                 OWEN
                        Well, there’s that.  Thank you. 
                        Now, I can die.  Here.  You play 
                        it.

                                 DUNCAN
                        No, I...

                                 OWEN
                        Go, go.  It’s all you.

           Duncan plays.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        But, it’s still my quarter.  So, if 
                        you end up getting a high score, I 
                        don’t want to see... What’s your 
                        name?

                                 DUNCAN
                        ... Duncan.

                                 OWEN
                        That took a while to remember.  
                        You’re not lying to me, are you?  
                        This isn’t a stranger danger 
                        situation.

                                 DUNCAN
                        No, I know that my name is 
                        Duncan...
                                 OWEN
                        Okay, well, I don’t want to see 
                        that up on the screen.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Oh, they only let you use three 
                        letters.

                                 OWEN
                        Wow.  Nothing’s left to the 
                        imagination with you, huh? 

           Owen starts to walk away.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Oh and hey, no pattern on my 
                        quarter, man.  Cut your own path.

           Duncan watches him leave.  Suddenly, we hear PAC MAN DYING 
           again.

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - LATER

           Duncan pulls up on his bike.  Pam and Trent are loading a  
           large PICNIC BASKET and COOLER into the station wagon.  
           Steph, leaning against the car, putting on suntan lotion. 

                                 PAM
                        There you are.  We were just about 
                        to leave without you.  Where did 
                        you run off to?

                                 DUNCAN
                           (shrugging)
                        Nowhere.

                                 PAM
                        Well, let’s leave notes, okay? 

                                 TRENT
                        Your mom was worried.

                                 PAM 
                        Now, go put on your swim trunks. 
                        Kip and Joan invited us for lunch 
                        on their boat.  And, we’re running 
                        late.

           Duncan heads toward the house. 

                                 TRENT (O.S.)
                        Head’s up, buddy.
           EXT. DOCKS - LATER

           CLOSE ON DUNCAN, catching a life vest.

           PULL BACK to see Duncan standing on the dock.  Everyone is 
           loading stuff onto a large motor boat, all tricked out.  On 
           the back, the boat’s name, “BARELY A WAKE.”  Trent stands on 
           the edge of the boat.

                                 TRENT
                        You need to wear that.

                                 KIP
                        Oh, I think he’s cool without it.

                                 TRENT
                        No, Duncan can’t swim.

                                 PAM
                           (trying to make it better, 
                           clarifying)
                        Trent, he’s just not a comfortable 
                        swimmer.

                                 KIP
                        I really think he’ll be fine.

                                 TRENT
                        No, let’s wear it, buddy.  So, 
                        people don’t have to worry about 
                        you, right?

                                 BETTY (O.S.)
                        Yoo hoo!

           Betty walks down the dock, followed by Peter and Susanna.  

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        Yes, we invited ourselves.  Accept 
                        it and move on.  But, we brought 
                        margaritas!

           Duncan, reluctantly, puts on the vest.

                                 DUNCAN
                           (sotto, to Pam)
                        Why do I have to wear this?  No one 
                        else does!

                                 PAM
                        He just wants you to be safe.

           Susanna walks by, lifting an eyebrow, as Pam tightens the 
           straps on his vest.
                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Is that snug enough?

           Off Duncan’s look...

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. BOAT - LATER

           CLOSE ON Duncan.  He’s miserable.  The life vest is three 
           sizes too big for him.  When seated, it comes halfway up his 
           face.  

           Pam, pulls food out of the picnic basket, creating a 
           beautiful spread on a table.  The food, impeccable.  Kip’s 
           already helping himself to the annoyance of Joan.  Steph and 
           Susanna are sunbathing on the front of the boat.

                                 PAM
                        Basically, he was relentless.  And, 
                        don’t get me wrong.  I was looking. 
                        I had been divorced well over a 
                        year.  It just...

                                 TRENT
                        It just took a little persistence 
                        on my end.

           Pam smiles, caresses Trent’s cheek. 

                                 PAM
                        Well, I wasn’t sure about you.

                                 TRENT 
                        I met her when she was catering 
                        some Halloween party in Albany...

                                 PAM
                           (teasing)
                        He went as a sexy cop. 

                                 TRENT
                           (laughing, defending)
                        No, I was a 70s, bad ass cop.

                                 PAM 
                        He followed me around all night, 
                        saying that he was there to 
                        “protect and serve” me.

           Trent, playfully, tries to put his hand over Pam’s mouth, but 
           she pulls away.
                                 TRENT
                        That was my character!

                                 PAM
                        I don’t think so!
                           (laughing, to adults)
                        That about ended it right there for 
                        me!

                                 BETTY
                           (sotto, to adults)
                        Sadly, I would have been working 
                        his bag by that point.

           They all laugh.

                                 TRENT
                           (to Pam)
                        Now, you did let me help you load 
                        up your van at the end of the 
                        night.

                                 PAM
                        Yes, I did.

                                 TRENT
                        But, it still took three months to 
                        even get her to go out with me. 

           He pulls Pam in.

                                 BETTY
                        Three months?  I didn’t know you 
                        had that kind of stamina.

                                 TRENT 
                        She definitely made me work for it.
                           (then)
                        But, it was worth it.

           Betty raises her glass. 

                                 BETTY 
                        There may be hope for you, yet.

                                 JOAN
                           (to Pam)
                        What finally changed your mind?

                                 PAM
                        He told me that we were already in 
                        this together, so I might as well. 

           They kiss.
                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        It’s been almost a year now. 

           Joan finishes her wine, and walks off to the bar.  Trent, 
           Kip, and Betty start to make plates for themselves.  Pam 
           looks over at Duncan.  His attention on Stephanie and 
           Susanna.  Just then, Stephanie notices Duncan, staring.  She 
           nudges Susanna, whispers something.  They both laugh.  Duncan 
           fumes.  Pam, witnessing all of this, goes over to Duncan. 

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                           (light, jokingly)
                        Could you look a little more 
                        miserable?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Could he be even more of a dick?

           Pam’s smile instantly fades.

                                 PAM
                        Hey.  He’s making an effort. 

           Duncan looks away.  Pam sits next to Duncan.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        He wants this to work.  He wants us 
                        to be a family. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        He says that, but that’s not what 
                        he does. 

                                 PAM
                        Look, I know it’s not easy, but... 
                        You promised, remember?  That you’d 
                        give it a try. 

                                 DUNCAN 
                        I don’t know why I can’t just go to 
                        dad’s for the summer.

           Pam puts on a good face, moving through...

                                 PAM
                        ... Because you’re with me.

           Duncan just looks off.  He doesn’t “feel” like he’s with her.

                                 BETTY (O.S.)
                        Okay, Pam,...

           Betty approaches, a drink in each hand.  She’s trying to 
           steady herself.
                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        ... Whichever drink I spill the 
                        least out of, is mine.
                           (laughs, then)
                        Duncan, if you’re looking for 
                        company, Peter’s down below. His 
                        eye throws his equilibrium off.  
                        So, he gets sea sick easily.

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        Shut up, Mom!  No, I don’t!

                                 BETTY
                        Tell that to the bucket beside you!

           Betty rolls her eyes.  Hands a drink to Pam.  And as 
           promised, it’s the one that’s most empty.  Duncan gets up, 
           goes to the other side of the boat.  Pam watches him leave.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. DOCKS - LATE AFTERNOON

           Everyone is unloading.  Trent is helping the women off the 
           boat offering them a hand as they step down.  Duncan jumps 
           off the side of the boat onto the dock, throws off his life 
           preserver.

                                 TRENT
                        Hey, buddy, the cooler’s not going 
                        to get to the car by itself.

           Just then, Joan steps up to the side of the boat.  It’s her 
           turn to step down.  Trent offers his hand.  She makes a point 
           to reject it, getting down on her own.

           INT. BEACH HOUSE - KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Duncan stands among the remnants of a “destroyed” kitchen. 
           The table, completely trashed.  Half-eaten rolls, corn cobs, 
           opened bottles of wine.  Clearly, the party had moved to the 
           house.

           From OUTSIDE, we hear muffled LAUGHING/TALKING.  Duncan looks 
           out the WINDOW.  The adults stumble along the dunes, singing 
           loudly.  Duncan sighs and starts to clean up.

           INT. DUNCAN’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Duncan is awoken by the muffled sounds of ADULTS TALKING, 
           LAUGHING.
           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan comes down the stairs.  Pam, Trent, Kip, and Joan are 
           making breakfast.  They’re still in their clothes from the 
           night before.  And, the kitchen is once again, a mess.  
           Duncan tries to make a bee-line for the front door.  

                                 PAM
                           (noticing)
                        Good morning, sweetie.

           Duncan gives her nothing.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Do you want any breakfast...?

                                 DUNCAN
                           (short)
                        No.  I’m good. 

           Duncan exits.  Pam watches him leave.

           EXT. STORAGE SHED - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan pulls out the pink cruiser.  Standing on her deck next 
           door, Susanna watches him leave.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan rides the bike, peddling furiously, sweating.  Before 
           he even knows it, he’s made it all the way out to the 
           highway.  Jumping off the bike, he pushes it to the ground. 
           He paces, barely able to catch his breath.  Just then, in the 
           distance, he notices it...

           WAVE COUNTRY WATERPARK.

           Our first glimpse.  A gigantic, neon monster.  Clearly, built 
           in the 80’s and from the looks of it, hasn’t changed a bit.

           INT. WATERPARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan enters, taking it all in.  A giant structural mass of 
           bright, neon tubes.  Rows of checkered flags are strung up 
           along the side of the waterpark wall.  CHILDREN run amok. 
           TEENS congregate around the lounge chairs and snack shop.  
           The wading pool is packed, as are the lines for the slides. 

                                 OWEN (O.S.)
                        How’d we do?
           Duncan finds... Owen, standing on a SMALL DECK over the MAIN 
           OFFICE.  He’s in a ratty BATHROBE, eating breakfast.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Nothing less than highest score I 
                        hope.  I’ve got a reputation to 
                        protect.

           CAITLIN, a fellow coworker, emerges from the office below.  
           Cute.  No nonsense.  Sardonic.  She pretty much runs the 
           place.

                                 CAITLIN
                           (to Owen)
                        Hey, whenever’s convenient for you, 
                        we are open for business. 

                                 OWEN
                           (to Duncan)
                        See?  I’m held in high regard.
                           (then)
                        Caitlin, I’m going on break.

           Caitlin rolls her eyes, heads back into the office. 

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        See what I did?  

                                 CAITLIN (O.S.)
                        Yeah.  It was clever as shit.

           As Owen goes into the apartment, Duncan finds an empty LOUNGE 
           CHAIR near the front entrance, sits.  Dressed in jeans and a 
           T-shirt, Duncan should stand-out among the scantily clad 
           patrons, but somehow he disappears.  As he watches life in 
           the waterpark continue around him, we...

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. WATERPARK - PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

           Duncan, getting on his bike.  Caitlin locks the front gate 
           from the inside.  The last remaining GUESTS are walking to 
           their cars.  Duncan watches as Owen heads into the apartment 
           above the main office.

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - LATER

           Duncan rides up.

                                 GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sweet ride.
           Duncan finds Susanna, on her deck.  In her hands, a 
           CELLPHONE.  Duncan seems to be holding onto a little 
           resentment from the boat incident.  He answers, but it’s 
           halfheartedly.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Oh, it’s not mine. 

                                 SUSANNA
                        Yeah, I figured.

           Susanna smiles, but can’t help but register Duncan’s 
           aloofness.  She tries another tactic.  

                                 SUSANNA (CONT’D)
                        You were right, by the way.  It is 
                        a hot summer.

           Duncan stops, reluctantly smiles.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Yeah, I just call it like I see it.

                                 SUSANNA 
                           (holding up phone)
                        I’m waiting for my Dad to call me 
                        back.  I don’t want to be inside 
                        because my mom will just stare at 
                        me while I’m on the phone.  She’s 
                        all freaked out that I’m gonna want 
                        to live with him, or whatever.

                                 DUNCAN
                        My mom’s the same way.

           Duncan heads toward the bike shed.

                                 SUSANNA
                        So, let me know if you have any 
                        other observations on weather 
                        patterns. 

                                 DUNCAN
                           (smiling)
                        Will do.

           EXT. SHED - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan closes the door.  Pam steps out onto the PORCH, checks 
           her watch.  Duncan stays out of view until she goes back in. 
           Duncan considers, then sneaks off toward the ocean.
           EXT. BEACH - THAT NIGHT

           Duncan sits at the edge of the DUNES, looking out onto the 
           beach/ocean.  He turns, looks back at the house.  The lights 
           in the windows go OFF.

           INT. BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan starts up the stairs.  

                                 TRENT (O.S.)
                        I thought we had a deal about 
                        leaving notes.  Checking in.

           Duncan jumps, slightly startled.  

           ANGLE ON Trent, sitting in a chair, eating a sandwich. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        My mom and I do. 

           He starts up the stairs.

                                 TRENT
                        Hey, Duncan?

           Duncan stops.  Beat.

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        I’m not interested in talking to 
                        the back of your head, so...

           Duncan turns around, full of 14 year old attitude.

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        If we’re going to make this work, 
                        and it is “we,” then there needs to 
                        be trust.  And, respect.  Am I 
                        right?
                           (then)
                        I think that’s something we both 
                        want. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        ... Fine.

                                 TRENT
                        There you go, buddy.

           Duncan turns, and heads upstairs.
           INT. WATERPARK - THE NEXT DAY

           Duncan is back on the edge of the lounge chair, still 
           sporting the jeans and T-shirt look.

                                 OWEN (O.S.)
                        I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask 
                        you to leave.

           Duncan looks back over his shoulder.

                                 DUNCAN
                        ... What?

                                 OWEN 
                        Yeah, you’re going to have to take 
                        off.  I’m getting complaints. 
                        You’re having too much fun.  It’s 
                        making everyone uncomfortable. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        Oh.  ... Okay.

           Duncan actually gets up, starts out.  Owen is genuinely 
           thrown by Duncan’s reaction... Stifles a laugh. 

                                 OWEN
                        Whoa.  Wait...
                           (laughs)
                        I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t be...  I 
                        didn’t think you would actually...

           Duncan’s not sure what’s going on.  Owen gathers himself.  He 
           found that very endearing and funny. 

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                           (gesturing him to follow)
                        Come with me...

           Duncan seems reticent.  More confused, really.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Look, I can tell you’re in complete 
                        awe of our front entrance area, but 
                        there is more park to be seen.

           Finally, Duncan complies, follows.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        First things first, though.  As 
                        much as I’m a fan of Tuff Skins, 
                        we’ve got to get you a swimsuit.
                        Seriously, when’s the last time you 
                        bought jeans?
                                 DUNCAN
                        Oh, my mom buys my jeans...

           Owen laughs again.

                                 OWEN
                        Good.  Always take things 
                        literally.

           INT. WATERPARK - RENTAL BOOTH

           Owen and Duncan approach.  LEWIS is working behind the 
           counter.  He’s quite a dour, curmudgeon fellow.  And, pale as 
           can be.

                                 OWEN
                        Lewis, hook up my man, Duncan, here 
                        with one of our finest rentals.

                                 LEWIS
                        Some kid threw up near Crazy Tubes.

                                 OWEN 
                        Whoa, let’s try not to impress him 
                        all at once.

                                 LEWIS
                        That will not be a challenge.

                                 OWEN
                        Lewis is kind of over this place.

                                 LEWIS
                        I warned you.  I’m not long for 
                        here.

                                 OWEN
                        No, I remember that conversation. 
                        In 2003.

                                 LEWIS
                        You watch.  Cause I’ve got plans.

                                 OWEN
                        Prove it.  Without thinking, rattle 
                        off three.

           Owen smiles at Duncan.  He loves goading Lewis.

                                 LEWIS
                           (complying)
                        Take up Jiu Jitsu.  Invent 
                        something.  Become a storm chaser.
                                 OWEN
                        You had me until number three.  I 
                        think you have to go to school for 
                        that. 

                                 LEWIS
                           (scoffing)
                        No, you don’t.  “Hey, where’s the 
                        storm?”  “It’s over there.”  “Let’s 
                        go get it.”

                                 OWEN
                        Wow.  I stand not corrected.

           Lewis waves him off, pulls out a pair of ragged-looking swim 
           trunks from below the counter, hands them to Duncan.

                                 LEWIS
                        These don’t have any mesh, so 
                        you’re basically going “commando.”
                        Watch sitting.  You’re junk will 
                        fall out.  

                                 OWEN
                        And like that, you’re impressed.  

           Off Duncan,...

           INT. WATERPARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Owen leads Duncan, now wearing the ill-fitting swim suit 
           which is clearly too big, on a continuous “tour of the park” 
           in the spirit of the GOODFELLAS shot.

                                 OWEN
                        Wave Country Waterpark.  Built in 
                        the summer of ‘83, it’s the last 
                        bastion of everything that time 
                        period stood for.  In fact, it was 
                        decreed by its creator that this 
                        place shall never age.  On his 
                        death bed, he said “I don’t want 
                        this place re-painted or updated. I 
                        don’t even want it brought up to 
                        code.  And the minute someone 
                        tries, it needs to be destroyed.”

           Duncan doesn’t even bat an eye to this.  Owen takes that in.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        We actually have a nuclear bomb for 
                        just such an occasion.
           Duncan still doesn’t get the joke.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Bought it off the Russians.

           Still nothing.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Really?  Still good with all that? 
                        Even the Russian thing?  That’s 
                        Cold War.  Kind of dated.

           Duncan’s still blank. 

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  Well, that was a waste of a 
                        bit.

           Caitlin joins them, clipboard in hand.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Some kid threw up near Crazy Tubes.

                                 OWEN
                           (faux pissed)
                        Why is this the first I’m hearing 
                        about this?!  Dammit.
                           (then, introducing)
                        Caitlin, Duncan.  Tony, Mary Beth.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Hi, Duncan.
                           (then)
                        Also, I need you to reorder more T-
                        shirts...

                                 OWEN
                        Did it.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Finish the work schedule for next 
                        week...

                                 OWEN
                        Did it.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Change all of the filters...

                                 OWEN
                        Done.

                                 CAITLIN
                        You know, I’m going to check.
                                 OWEN
                        Oh.  Then, in that case, I didn’t 
                        do any of that.

                                 CAITLIN
                           (slightly bemused)
                        So, I’m doing it.

           Caitlin peels back the way she came.  

                                 OWEN
                           (calling off)
                        It’s called delegation.  I read 
                        about it in a book about it.

           Owen STOPS, watching Caitlin go.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                           (to Duncan)
                        That’s the one you wait for, my 
                        man. 

           He takes a moment, then we CONTINUE ON.... They walk past 
           four SUNBATHING GIRLS, on lounge chairs. 

                                 GIRLS
                        Hiiiiiiii, Owen.

                                 OWEN
                        When you’re of age, ladies, when 
                        you’re of age.

                                 GIRL #1
                        Well, why don’t you add up a couple 
                        of our ages, and see what that does 
                        for you?

                                 GIRL #2
                        Or to you!

           They all giggle.

                                 OWEN
                           (to Duncan,  faux disdain)
                        Ugh, feminists, right?

           Owen and Duncan approach the entrance to DEVIL’S PEAK.  
           Clearly, the main attraction.  There’s a long line.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        This, is Devil’s Peak.  The 
                        longest, fastest waterslide in a 50 
                        mile radius.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t Google that for confirmation.  
                        That fact predates technology.

           Just then, three boys, KYLE, NEIL, and JASON, run up.  These 
           are the nerds of the waterpark, but they don’t see themselves 
           as that.  They all make they’re way up, past the long line of  
           SLIDERS.

                                 KYLE
                        Owen, settle a debate for us. 

                                 OWEN
                        Hello, boys.  Duncan, this is 
                        Monroe, Ismael, and Ming Lee.

                                 KYLE
                        Those aren’t our names!

                                 OWEN
                        Those are the names I’m giving you, 
                        Monroe.
                           (to Duncan)
                        These are my illegitimate sons.  
                        All different mothers, but I want 
                        to make sure I’m a positive 
                        influence in their lives.

                                 JASON
                        You’re such a jackass!

                                 OWEN
                        Ismael, is that any way to speak to 
                        your father!

                                 KYLE
                        You’re not our dad!

                                 OWEN
                        They grow up so fast.

                                 JASON
                        Listen, Owen, Neil says that years 
                        ago some kid figured out how to 
                        pass someone on the water slide.  
                        Is that true?

                                 NEIL
                        He did!

                                 KYLE
                        It’s physically impossible, Neil! 
                        You can’t catch up to someone and 
                        pass them! 
                                 OWEN
                        Actually, Ming Lee’s right.  I was 
                        here when it happened.

                                 JASON
                        Then how’d he do it.

                                 OWEN
                        It happened inside the tube.  So, 
                        no one knows.  Only the kid and the 
                        person he passed,... And, well, 
                        Jesus.  But, he’s hard to get a 
                        hold of.

                                 NEIL
                        Be serious!

                                 OWEN
                        Guys, what happens in the tube, 
                        stays in the tube.  That’s just the 
                        law of the park.

                                 KYLE
                        Bullshit.  We’ll just ask the kid 
                        how he did it.

                                 OWEN
                        Be my guest.  If you can find him. 
                        Last I heard, he went into a deep 
                        depression.  The fame was too much 
                        for him.  He turned to cocaine to 
                        escape the limelight.  Eventually, 
                        turning to a life of male 
                        prostitution.
                           (then, pointing)
                        Oh, no.  Wait.  There he is.

           Owen points at a VERY YOUNG KID.  Couldn’t be more than 8. 

                                 KYLE
                        Screw you, Owen!

           The boys head back down the stairs.  Owen stops, looks at 
           Duncan, dead serious.

                                 OWEN
                        Actually, that crack-addled male 
                        whore... was me.

                                 DUNCAN
                        ... Really?

                                 OWEN
                        Wow.  Duncan.  Do you get comedy?
           END OF “GOODFELLAS” SHOT.

           EXT. DEVIL’S PEAK

           Owen and Duncan have made it to the top.   

                                 DUNCAN
                        So, did he pass by sliding up the 
                        side of the tube?

                                 OWEN
                           (teasing)
                        I’m not telling you.

                                 DUNCAN
                        But, I want to know! 

                                 OWEN 
                        That’s a good thing.  Don’t die 
                        wondering.

           A lifeguard, RODDY (BLUE-SHIRTED GUY from the pizza parlor), 
           is sitting at the mouth of the slide, pacing out the SLIDERS.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        How’s it going, Hot Rod?

                                 RODDY 
                        Awesome times.
                           (then, to next Kid)
                        Hold on.  Alright, go.

           A BOY goes down the slide.  Another BOY steps up.

                                 RODDY (CONT’D)
                        Some kid threw up near Crazy Tubes.

                                 OWEN
                        Damn, pointless news travels fast.
                           (then)
                        Can I get a special ride “with 
                        benefits” for my man, Duncan, here?

                                 RODDY
                        Yeah, hold on.
                           (then, to Boy)
                        Alright go.

           He slides.  A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN steps up. 

                                 RODDY (CONT’D)
                        Hold on.
           RODDY just stares at her butt for way too long.

                                 RODDY (CONT’D)
                        Hold on.  Hold.  Hold.  Hold.  
                        Hold.  Alright...  Hold.  Hold.  

           Roddy milks this for everything it’s worth.

                                 RODDY (CONT’D)
                           (finally, to Woman)
                        Alright, go.

           She goes.

                                 RODDY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Owen, go!

           Owen pushes Duncan down the tube.  He immediately follows.

           INT. WATERPARK - BOTTOM OF DEVIL’S PEAK - MOMENTS LATER

           The three come shooting out of the tube into the water.  
           Owen, acting clumsy, pretends to be all tangled with the 
           Beautiful Woman. 

                                 OWEN
                        Oh, excuse me.  I’m sorry.  Let me 
                        just... I can’t seem to get my 
                        footing.

           By now, the Beautiful Woman can’t help but smile.  It’s the 
           power of Owen. 

                                 BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                           (laughing)
                        Owen, come on! 

                                 OWEN
                        It’s not me!  It’s the punk kid. 
                        He’s like an octopus! 

           Owen notices Duncan just flailing in the water.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Uh, Duncan.  It’s three feet.

           With that, Duncan stops.  Stands, in the waist deep water. 
           Just then, a pair of ratty, old swim trunks pop up to the 
           surface of the water.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        And, uh... Looks like you lost 
                        something.
           Duncan realizes his swimsuit came off.  He grabs them and 
           puts them on.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                           (smiling)
                        Oh.  Too far, Duncan.  You just had 
                        to take it too far.

           Duncan is beet red. 

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Can he get your number?

           EXT. WATERPARK - EARLY EVENING

           Duncan unlocks his bike.  Owen pulls up in his convertible.

                                 OWEN
                        It’s late.  You want a ride.

                                 DUNCAN
                        No, thanks.  I’ve got my bike.

                                 OWEN
                        Where are you staying?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Over by the beach, on Hampton.

                                 OWEN
                        That’s far.  Throw your bike in the 
                        back.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Oh, no.  You don’t have to...

                                 OWEN
                        Come on.

                                 DUNCAN 
                        Yeah?

                                 OWEN
                        Yes.

                                 DUNCAN
                        No, it’s too much trouble....

                                 OWEN 
                        Duncan, we’ve got to start having 
                        faster conversations.  Put it in 
                        the back.
           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           They drive along the main strip. 

                                 OWEN 
                        So, what brought you to the 
                        waterpark?  Not many kids head our 
                        way when the ocean’s their 
                        backyard.

                                 DUNCAN
                        I don’t know... I guess... There’s 
                        not much for me at home. 
                           (then, changing subject)
                        How long have you been working 
                        there?

                                 OWEN
                        The park?  I’ve always been there.

           Owen watches as Duncan closes his eyes, enjoying the late 
           afternoon sun on his face. 

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

           Duncan gets his bike out of the back.  We can see that 
           Betty’s Fourth of July Clam Bake is in full swing.  
           PARTYGOERS are arriving, carrying lawn chairs and plates of 
           food around to the back.  Her house is covered with 
           decorations, to the point of being garish. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        Thanks for the ride.

           Duncan walks the bike up the driveway.

                                 OWEN
                        Hey, I was thinking.  I could use 
                        someone to be a floater at the 
                        park.  Do odd jobs.  If you’re 
                        interested...

           Duncan’s face lights up.

                                 DUNCAN
                           (too much)
                        Definitely.  Awesome.  Yeah.
                           (then, collecting himself)
                        No, totally.  If you need me, sure. 
                        I mean, I could help out...

                                 OWEN
                        Duncan.
                                 DUNCAN
                        Yes.

                                 OWEN
                        There you go.  Tomorrow.  8am.

           With that, Owen drives off.

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan runs up the stairs, just as Pam is exiting, carrying a 
           platter of food.  It’s heavy.

                                 PAM 
                        Who was that with you?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Just a friend.

                                 PAM 
                        A friend who drives?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Mom.

                                 PAM
                        What’s his name?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Owen.

                                 PAM
                        And, how do you know him?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Mom, he’s just a friend.

                                 PAM
                           (suspicious)
                        A friend with a license?  Well, you 
                        should bring him by.  I’d like to 
                        meet him.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Fine. 

           He tries to run past.

                                 PAM 
                        Whoa.  I’m not done.

           Duncan stops, turns.
                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        And, we don’t stay out all night 
                        and disappear all day.  Do you 
                        understand me?

                                 DUNCAN
                           (under his breath)
                        I could say the same to you.

                                 PAM
                        ... What?

           Duncan leaves. 

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                           (calling off)
                        I want you to make an appearance at 
                        Betty’s.

                                 DUNCAN  (O.S.)
                        Okay.

                                 PAM
                        I’m serious. 

                                 DUNCAN (O.S.)
                        Okay. 

           EXT. BETTY THOMPSON’S HOUSE - DUSK

           Duncan meanders through the crowd of PARTYGOERS.  Clearly, 
           Betty’s party bleeds into both houses’ backyards.  Music 
           blares.  People are dancing, including CHARLIE (18), a very 
           strung out looking hippie.  He’s dangerously close to the 
           fire, lost in his own world.  Steph and her “gang” of 
           friends, including  Chad, Katy and Laura, are huddled around 
           a picnic table.  

                                 STEPH
                        Susanna!

           Duncan notices Susanna on her deck.

                                 STEPH (CONT’D)
                        We’re hanging over here.  Grab a 
                        cup, we’re playing quarters!

           Susanna joins.  Steph notices Duncan, makes a point to lay 
           across the rest of the bench, excluding him. 
                                 STEPH (CONT’D)
                           (to Susanna)
                        Sit next to Willem.  He’s being 
                        hilarious.

           Duncan approaches Betty, Pam, Trent, Kip, and Joan.  They’re 
           gathered around the fire, laughing.  He sits in a LAWN CHAIR 
           behind them.

                                 BETTY
                        I think my first hint was catching 
                        Bob coiling our gardener’s hose. 
                        Then, there was our pool boy.  
                        Third strike, was Peter’s 
                        principal.

           Everyone gasps with laughter.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                           (nodding her head)
                        P.T.A. meeting.
                           (then)
                        You can imagine how that 
                        conversation went.  “I’m concerned 
                        about safety in our school. 
                        Violence is on the rise.”  “That’s 
                        not all that’s on the rise.” 

           Betty imitates “porn music.”  They all laugh.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                           (getting up, re: glass)
                        This is empty.  And, that’s just 
                        not right.  
                           (then)
                        Charlie, don’t do your dead dance 
                        so close to the fire!
                           (then, noticing)
                        Oh, hey, Duncan.

           Pam looks back, smiles.  She reaches out for Duncan’s hand. 
           Duncan complies, takes her hand and allows her to pull him 
           closer.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        You should hang out with Peter.  
                        He’s playing under one of these 
                        tables.
                           (calling off)
                        Peter!

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        What?!
           Peter’s voice, in fact, comes from under one of the table-
           clothed folding tables. 

                                 BETTY
                        There you go.

                                 PAM 
                        Do you want me to make you a plate 
                        of food?

                                 DUNCAN
                        No, I can do it.

                                 BETTY
                           (walking off)
                        Be sure to get some clams.  They 
                        were all my doing this year.

                                 PAM
                        Bring your food over here and eat 
                        with me, okay?

                                 DUNCAN
                           (smiles)
                        Okay.

           EXT. BETTY THOMPSON’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Duncan approaches the folding table, starts to make a plate.

                                 DUNCAN
                        What’s up, Peter?

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        Hey, man.

                                 DUNCAN
                        How’s the battle going?

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        Luke and Leia are hooking up.

                                 DUNCAN
                        You know, they’re brother and 
                        sister, right?

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        Yeah.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Cool.

           Susanna approaches.
                                 SUSANNA
                        I’d avoid the clams, if I were you.
                        They’re one of the many casualties 
                        of my father’s absence. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        ... Oh.

           Duncan considers, but then puts a few clams on his plate.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT’D)
                           (shrugging, to Susanna)
                        Just because your mom’s going to 
                        see my plate.

                                 SUSANNA
                        It’s your funeral.

           CHEERING.  Duncan and Susanna look over by the fire.  Charlie 
           is clearly enticing the adults with a large bag of pot. 

                                 SUSANNA (CONT’D)
                        Looks like my brother just made 
                        another sale.

           The adults head off, except for Pam.  Trent takes her hand, 
           pull her up.  She glances over in Duncan’s direction.  
           Clearly, torn.  

                                 PAM
                        ... We’ll be right back.

           And with that, she’s gone.  Duncan dumps his whole plate of 
           food into the garbage can.  Susanna clocks.  Beat. 

                                 SUSANNA
                        Peter, do you want to go chase 
                        ghost crabs?

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        Hell, yes!

           Peter comes out from under the table.

                                 SUSANNA
                        Duncan?  Any interest?

                                 DUNCAN
                           (coming to)
                        Huh?

                                 SUSANNA
                        Want to do something really lame?
                                 PETER
                        It’s not lame.

                                 DUNCAN
                           (beat)
                        Yeah.  Sure.

           EXT.  BEACH - EARLY EVENING

           Susanna and Duncan are walking.  He seems lost in thought.  
           In the distance, Peter, carrying a flashlight, is looking for 
           ghost crabs.

                                 SUSANNA
                        When I was younger, my dad used to 
                        bring me down here to do this all 
                        the time.  He’d fill my head with 
                        all these useless facts about ghost 
                        crabs.  Like, did you know they’re 
                        omnivorous?  Basically, they feed 
                        on both animals and vegetables.
                           (then)
                        My mom jokes, “Leave it to your dad 
                        to be interested in a creature that 
                        goes both ways.”

           Duncan can’t help but smile. Beat.

                                 SUSANNA (CONT’D)
                        So, do you want me to keep talking, 
                        or are you going to say something 
                        eventually?

                                 DUNCAN
                        My mom doesn’t smoke pot. 

           Beat. 

                                 SUSANNA
                        Well, that’s the power of this 
                        place.  It’s like spring break for 
                        adults.

           They smile, connect.

           EXT. BEACH - DUNES

           Duncan and Susanna sit at the top, watching the fireworks 
           explode over the ocean. 
                                 SUSANNA
                        That’s what I think really kills my 
                        mom.  Not that he left, but that 
                        he’s got someone and she doesn’t.

           Duncan nods.

                                 SUSANNA (CONT’D)
                        Is your dad seeing anybody?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Yeah, she’s a lot younger. 

                                 SUSANNA
                        Classic.

                                 DUNCAN 
                        They’re just getting situated in 
                        San Diego.  You know?  New place. 
                        So, he says it’s not a great time 
                        right now. But,... I’m going to 
                        visit him when he gets settled and 
                        stuff.  It’s supposed to be awesome 
                        out there.

                                 SUSANNA
                        California.  That’s cool.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Yeah.

           Beat.  Duncan just looks out at the water.  Susanna watches 
           him.  Just then, Peter runs by, chasing a crab.

                                 PETER
                        Susanna, look!  The crab grabbed 
                        the light saber!  He’s got Luke’s 
                        light saber!  This is the battle of 
                        all battles!

                                 SUSANNA
                           (to Duncan)
                        How are you only a year older than 
                        him?

           EXT. DUNES - A LITTLE LATER

           Susanna and Duncan walk up the DUNES.  Peter runs by, his 
           arms outstretched as if he’s flying.

                                 SUSANNA 
                        So, where is it you go?
                                 DUNCAN
                        Go where?

                                 SUSANNA
                        On your sexy, pink cruiser?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Oh.  Nowhere.

           Susanna smiles.

                                 SUSANNA
                        Oh.  I see...

                                 DUNCAN
                        No, I just...

                                 SUSANNA
                        It’s okay.  Let it be yours.

           She smiles.  They approach...

           BETTY’S HOUSE.

           Pam, Betty, and a group of women, are still sitting around 
           the fire.  They are all clearly high, drunk, all of it.

                                 SUSANNA (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to sneak up the back way, 
                        so I don’t have to deal with that.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Lucky.

                                 SUSANNA
                        Good night.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Yeah, good night.

           Susanna head up the stairs.  Suddenly, MUFFLED ARGUING from 
           the side of the house.  Duncan peeks around the side.  Joan, 
           clearly drunk, is leaning into Trent.  She runs her hand up 
           his stomach and chest.  Trent removes her hand, but she leans 
           in, kisses him.  Although Trent doesn’t “kiss back,” he 
           doesn’t pull away immediately.  Thinking better of it, he 
           finally turns his head away. 

                                 JOAN
                        Oh, I see.  Just not this summer.

           Pissed, she waves him off.  Trent starts walking...
           ...toward Duncan, who throws himself against the side of the 
           house.  Trent walks by, not seeing him.  In his hand, a bag 
           of MARSHMALLOWS.  Trent approaches Pam and the rest.  

                                 PAM
                        You were gone that long and you 
                        only brought the marshmallows?

                                 TRENT
                        Joan has the rest.

           Trent joins Kip, Charlie and some other GUYS, who are clearly 
           smoking pot.  Duncan watches as Pam looks over her shoulder 
           in the direction of where Trent came from, just as Joan is 
           rounding the corner, fixing her hair.  Joan joins them at the 
           fire, handing a box of GRAHAM CRACKERS and CHOCOLATE BARS to 
           Pam without even looking at her.  Pam glances over, noticing 
           Duncan.  She takes a moment, then...

                                 PAM
                           (to Group, upbeat)
                        Who wants a S’more?

           Duncan just shakes his head, and walks off.

           INT. WATERPARK - THE NEXT MORNING

           Duncan enters.  He seems a little out of sorts from the night 
           before.  But, at least he’s in his OWN swimsuit.  Owen is 
           standing at the rental booth with Lewis.

                                 OWEN
                        You’re late!

           Duncan looks like a deer in headlights.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Are you planning on making this a 
                        habit?  If so, we’re done here.  
                        You know what?  I’m tired of your 
                        sass.  You’re fired.

                                 DUNCAN
                        But,... I just...

                                 OWEN
                        You make a valid point.  Welcome 
                        back.  With benefits.

                                 LEWIS
                        You waste an exorbitant amount of 
                        time. 
                                 OWEN
                        Suit up.  

           Owen throws him a blue shirt.  Duncan doesn’t emote much 
           excitement.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Come on, get pumped!  This is a 
                        place where dreams are made. Or, 
                        destroyed.  Depends on how you feel 
                        about working at a waterpark. 

           INT. WATERPARK - A LITTLE LATER

           Duncan, now a “blue-shirted guy” himself, hoses down the 
           TUBES over at Crazy Tubes.  Owen approaches.

                                 OWEN
                        How’s that puke coming?

                                 DUNCAN
                        You probably shouldn’t have let it 
                        harden.

                                 OWEN
                        Easy, ball-buster.

           Just then, Caitlin approaches.

                                 CAITLIN
                        That guy who calls himself “B-boy 
                        Ferocious” is back with his... 
                           (mockingly)
                        ...”break dancing” crew.  I thought 
                        I told you to tell them they 
                        couldn’t do that here.

                                 OWEN
                        I did.

                                 CAITLIN 
                        Well, someone needs to take away 
                        their cardboard.  People are 
                        starting to circle up and it’s 
                        getting too congested.

                                 OWEN
                        Duncan’s going to take care of it. 

                                 DUNCAN
                           (taken aback)
                        Oh, I don’t...
                                 CAITLIN
                        Owen, you need to do this.

                                 OWEN
                           (to Duncan)
                        You read me the riot act over this 
                        whole vomit thing.  You have it in 
                        you.

           Duncan looks over at the Snack Shack, nervous.

           DUNCAN’S POV of a large group of BREAKDANCERS circled around, 
           watching B-BOY FEROCIOUS dance.  A quite imposing fellow.  

                                 DUNCAN
                           (meek)
                        But,... It’s my first day...

                                 OWEN
                        Hey.  Worst case scenario, it goes 
                        horribly wrong.

           Duncan takes a deep breath, walks off...

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                           (off Caitlin’s glare)
                        I’m right here.  I’ll step in.

           Caitlin is clearly annoyed.

           ANGLE ON Duncan, slowly approaching.  The HIP-HOP BLARING 
           from a BOOM BOX getting louder and louder.  Duncan stops just 
           outside the circle, looks back at Owen, who gives him a 
           thumbs up.  Roddy and Lewis join in the viewing party. 

                                 DUNCAN
                           (soft)
                        ... Excuse me.

           No one hears him over the music.  They’re lost in their dance 
           circle.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, uh, guys...?

           Nothing.  Duncan shuffles over to the boom box, turns it off. 

                                 BREAKDANCERS
                        Hey!/What the hell?!

           They all turn and look right at Duncan.  Dead silence.
                                 DUNCAN
                        I’m gonna... need to take your 
                        cardboard.

                                 B-BOY FEROCIOUS
                        Whoa, whoa. 

           B-Boy Ferocious comes forward.  Duncan’s eyes only come up to 
           his chest. 

                                 B-BOY FEROCIOUS (CONT’D)
                        What, now?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Um,.. I was told to take your 
                        cardboard.

           B-Boy takes a moment, but eventually steps to the side. 
           Duncan makes his way through the very intimidating crowd.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me.  I just need to get 
                        the...

           He reaches down, grabs the edge of the cardboard.  A foot 
           SLAMS down onto it.  It’s B-Boy, again. 

                                 B-BOY FEROCIOUS
                        Show us your moves.

           Duncan looks at him, confused.

                                 B-BOY FEROCIOUS (CONT’D)
                        Show us your moves.  Then, you can 
                        take it.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Oh,...  I don’t... I can’t, um, 
                        crunk or any of that.

                                 B-BOY FEROCIOUS
                        Then, you can’t take the cardboard.

           He takes a moment, then starts to “pop ‘n lock” horribly.  
           It’s awkward, and jerky.  This moment seems to go on for an 
           eternity.  Finally, he stops.  No one reacts.  They all just 
           stare at him, blankly.  Beat. 

                                 B-BOY FEROCIOUS (CONT’D)
                           (nodding head)
                        Okay.  Okay.

           B-Boy seems to be signing off.  Duncan, relieved, goes to 
           retrieve the cardboard.
                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Whoa.  We’re not done.

           ANGLE ON a BEAUTIFUL BREAKDANCER emerging from the crowd.  
           She turns the BOOM BOX back on.  Grabs Duncan’s hand, leading 
           him to the center of the cardboard. 

                                 BEAUTIFUL BREAKDANCER
                        Just mirror me.

           The Beautiful Breakdancer does a move, throws it to Duncan.  
           He tries to replicate it.  Terrible.  More moves.  More 
           mirroring.  More butchering.  The CROWD starts to get into 
           it. 

                                 B-BOY FEROCIOUS
                        Spin on your head! 

           Just then, two big BREAKDANCERS pick Duncan up from behind,  
           flip him over.  Duncan is now in a headstand.  The 
           Breakdancers start manually spinning Duncan by his legs, 
           faster and faster, handing him off like a Tetherball. 

           CLOSE ON Duncan’s face, beaming.

           DUNCAN’S POV as he spins around and around.

           Suddenly, the guys let go.  Duncan tumbles to the ground. 

                                 BREAKDANCERS
                        Stick it!  Stick it!

           Duncan awkwardly makes a “pose.”  The crowd goes crazy.  B-
           Boy helps Duncan up.  Everyone claps and cheers, including 
           Owen, Roddy, and Lewis.  Even Caitlin is not immune to the 
           moment.

                                 B-BOY FEROCIOUS
                        Nice moves, Pop ‘n Lock.

           The Beautiful Breakdancer hands Duncan the cardboard.  

           ANGLE ON Owen/Caitlin.  He gives her a “See?” look.

                                 CAITLIN
                        You got lucky.

           Owen puts his arm around her waist, but she removes it.

           ANGLE ON Duncan, carrying the CARDBOARD back over, grinning. 
           He’s also DIZZY AS HELL.  He can barely walk a straight line.  
           In fact, as he tumbles off to the side...

           BEGIN MONTAGE
           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

           Duncan rides up, barely stopping to hop off of it.  He’s too 
           excited.  He heads up the stairs, then realizes... He’s still 
           wearing the blue shirt.  He pulls his other shirt out of his 
           bag, changes.

           INT. BEACH HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan enters, excited.  Trent, Kip, and Joan are out on the 
           deck.  Pam is assembling a platter at the kitchen counter. 

                                 PAM
                        Hey.  Where have you been?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Nowhere.

                                 PAM
                        That’s a long time to be nowhere.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Well, that’s where I was.

           With that, he heads down the hallway.

           INT. WATERPARK - TOP OF DEVIL’S PEAK

           Duncan sits at the mouth of the TUBE.  Beside him, Roddy.  
           He’s  showing Duncan how to run the line.  Like Roddy 
           earlier, Duncan is spacing out the SLIDERS.  Just then, a 
           BEAUTIFUL TEEN steps up.  Duncan instructs her to “hold.”  
           Roddy motions for Duncan to check her out.  He complies, 
           staring at her behind, but can’t help but blush.  Suddenly, a 
           CLEARING OF A THROAT. 

           ANGLE ON the teen’s MOTHER, glaring.

                                 RODDY
                           (mock scolding)
                        Inappropriate, Duncan. 
                        Inappropriate. 

           INT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Trent, Kip, Joan and Pam gathered in the LIVING ROOM.  Joan, 
           clearly holding court.  Pam, collecting everyone’s drinks to 
           “refill.”  Without even breaking from her “story,” Joan hands 
           Pam her glass.  Duncan enters.  Pam watches as he goes to the 
           refrigerator, grabs a soda, and leaves.  Never connecting 
           with her.
           INT. WATERPARK - RENTAL BOOTH

           The whole staff is gathered.  Owen, passing out PAYCHECKS.

                                 OWEN
                        Roddy.

           He hands Roddy his check.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Lewis.

           Owen reaches over the back of him to Lewis.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Pop ‘N Lock!

           Duncan works his way through the crowd as they laugh, 
           cheering. 

           INT. BEACH HOUSE - KITCHEN

           CLOSE ON DUNCAN, woofing down some cereal, chugging orange 
           juice.  He’s hellbent to get on with his day.  A different 
           air to this “Duncan.”  Very tan, healthy-looking.  His hair, 
           shaggy.

           PULL BACK to reveal STEPH just staring at him.  Not sure who 
           the hell this is.  Duncan looks over, winks. 

           INT. WATERPARK - TOP OF DEVIL’S PEAK

           Duncan is now on his own at “Peak Command.”  He’s wearing 
           classic Vaurnets a la Owen, spacing SLIDERS out with the 
           greatest of ease, confident.  Among the kids, Kyle, Jason and 
           Neil.

           INT. WATERPARK - BOTTOM OF DEVIL’S PEAK - MOMENTS LATER

           A variety of SLIDERS come shooting out of the tube one after 
           the other.  Suddenly, the flow of people stops.  Beat.  No 
           activity.  All of the sudden, a LONE FLIP-FLOP comes out of 
           the tube.  We hear a LOUD WHISTLE.

           END OF MONTAGE

           INT. WATERPARK - TOP OF DEVIL’S PEAK - MOMENTS LATER

           Owen and Roddy run up.  Duncan has the whistle in his hand.
                                 OWEN
                        What happened?

                                 DUNCAN
                           (panicked)
                        Sorry.  They rushed me.  They said 
                        it was for the good of science.

           Owen, Duncan, and Roddy look down the tube.

           THEIR POV of Kyle, Neil, and Jason stuck.  They’re arms, 
           legs, everything - tangled.  And, only Kyle’s face is 
           actually facing them.  Water, rushing all around them.

                                 KYLE
                        I told you we shouldn’t all go at 
                        the same time!

                                 NEIL
                        I thought it would work!

           INT. WATERPARK - TOP OF DEVIL’S PEAK - MOMENTS LATER

           Owen hops up on the railing, addresses the sea of kids 
           waiting on the ramp.

                                 OWEN
                        Okay, listen up.  I need a hero. 
                        I’m holding out for a hero ‘til the 
                        end of the night.  He’s gotta be 
                        strong.  And he’s gotta be fast. 
                        And he’s gotta be fresh from the 
                        fight. 
                           (then, off the kids’ blank 
                           stares) 
                        No?  Footloose?  Bonnie Tyler song? 
                        Kevin Bacon drives a tractor in a 
                        game of “Chicken?”

           Still blank stares. 

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                           (giving up)
                        I need someone to throw himself 
                        down the tube and knock some kids 
                        loose.

           A HAND rises from the CROWD.

                                 KID’S VOICE
                        I’ll do it.
           The “volunteer” makes his way through the crowd.  It’s a KID 
           alright.  A quite obese one.

           INT. WATERPARK - TOP OF DEVIL’S PEAK - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan, Owen, and Roddy are now joined by the Obese Kid.

                                 OWEN
                        What’s your name?

                                 OBESE KID
                        Malcolm.

                                 OWEN
                        You probably should get a running 
                        start, Mack.

                                 MALCOLM
                           (confident)
                        I got this.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Owen, I don’t know if that’s a good 
                        idea.  What if we just turn off the 
                        water? They could get their 
                        footing.

                                 OWEN
                        Let’s call that “Plan B.”
                           (then, into tube)
                        I’m not going to lie to you, guys. 
                        This is probably going to hurt.

           Malcolm backs up, and starts running toward the tube.

           INT. TUBE - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON Kyle, Jason and Neil, as they feel the tube ROCK and 
           they hear RUMBLING.

                                 NEIL/JASON
                        What’s happening?!/I can’t see!  

           KYLE’S POV of Malcolm coming at them, full speed.

           Kyle screams.

                                 NEIL/JASON (CONT’D)
                        Why are you screaming?!
           INT. WATERPARK - BOTTOM OF DEVIL’S PEAK - CONTINUOUS

           Kyle, Neil, Jason, and Malcolm come shooting out of the tube 
           in one big ball.  Owen, Duncan, and Roddy run up.  Owen jumps 
           in to help the guys to their feet. 

                                 OWEN
                           (faux concern)
                        Oh my God.  Ming Lee, Ismael, 
                        Monroe.  I thought I lost you.

                                 MALCOLM
                        That was awesome!

                                 NEIL
                        Let’s do it again!

                                 JASON
                           (to Kid)
                        Will you knock us loose?

                                 MALCOLM
                           (excited)
                        Sure!

           Caitlin approaches, intercepts.  Pissed.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Whoa.  Whoa.  We’re done with that. 
                        Thank you. 

           The boys looks disappointed.

                                 CAITLIN (CONT’D)
                           (to Owen)
                        What do think you’re doing! 

                                 OWEN
                        It’s all good.  No one got hurt. 

                                 CAITLIN
                        Don’t just wave it off!  Places get 
                        shut down because of stunts like 
                        this!

                                 OWEN
                           (to boys)
                        Is it just me, or is she very sexy 
                        right now?

                                 MALCOLM
                           (checking her out)
                        She’s certainly got my attention.
           Caitlin takes a breath, shakes her head.

                                 CAITLIN 
                           (exasperated)
                        If you gave me even a glimpse that 
                        you took anything seriously...
                        This is why,...
                           (then, indicates herself 
                           and him)
                        ... This doesn’t happen.  This is 
                        why.

           With that, she walks off.  Duncan looks to Owen, whose 
           clearly affected.  Beat. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        Sorry, I didn’t mean to...

                                 OWEN
                        No.  It’s my fault.

           EXT. WATERPARK - THE NEXT DAY

           It’s pouring rain.  The place is locked up.  The parking lot, 
           empty.  

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE

           No activity here, either.  The only difference is that the 
           station wagon is covered with a tarp.  Clearly, Trent doesn’t 
           like it getting wet.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Duncan stares out the window.  Miserable.  Trent sits on the 
           couch, looking through the newspaper.  Steph is painting her 
           toe nails.  Pam enters.   

                                 PAM
                        The soup needs a little longer.

                                 TRENT
                        There’s a 1:15 and a 3:30.  We 
                        could see one of those.

                                 PAM
                        No, let’s stay in.  Do something we 
                        can all do together.  As a family.
                                 TRENT
                        We can see a movie as a family.  We 
                        could grab Kip and Joan and make an 
                        evening of it.

                                 PAM
                        I don’t feel like hanging out with 
                        Kip and Joan.  I feel like hanging 
                        out with all of you.  

           Pam holds her stare on Trent.  She means it.

           INT. BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON CANDYLAND BOX.  Faded, on it’s last legs.

           PULL BACK to reveal.  The “family” sitting on the floor 
           around the table.  Pam, the only one smiling, trying to sell 
           them on her idea.  She displays the box top. 

                                 PAM
                           (pointing)
                        It’s appropriate for people three 
                        and up.  So, we’re good.

           Tough sell.  Steph studies the top of the box, and reads it.

                                 STEPH
                        “Home Sweet Home.”

                                 PAM 
                        Okay, let’s not hate it right away.
                           (then, holding up game 
                           pieces)
                        What color gingerbread character do 
                        you want to be, Trent?

           Trent doesn’t answer. 

                                 STEPH
                        I have to be yellow!

           She grabs a pawn.

           LATER...

           CLOSE ON a “Gingerbread Character” moving from space to 
           space.  It gets to an area called “Gumdrop Pass.”

           PULL BACK to reveal Duncan.  It’s his turn.
                                 PAM
                        Oh, look, you can take the shortcut 
                        there.

           There is, in fact, a “bridge” that allows you to jump ahead. 
           Duncan moves his “character” over the “bridge.”

                                 TRENT
                        Whoa.  No, he can’t do that.

                                 PAM
                        Yes, he can.  He crosses the 
                        bridge.

                                 DUNCAN
                           (under his breath)
                        This is so stupid.

           Duncan moves back and past the “bridge.”

                                 PAM
                        No, you’re at the shortcut.  So, 
                        take it. 

           Trent picks up the DIRECTIONS.

                                 TRENT
                           (reading, pointedly)
                        “If your Gingerbread Character pawn 
                        lands, by exact count, on the 
                        yellow space below the Gumdrop 
                        Pass, you can take the shortcut.”
                           (then)
                        “Exact count.”  He picked a card 
                        with a blue square on it, so he has 
                        to go to a blue square.

                                 PAM
                        Well, I don’t think it matters. 

                                 TRENT
                        If it didn’t matter, they wouldn’t 
                        put it in the directions.

                                 PAM
                        We can fudge the rule.

                                 STEPH
                           (laughs)
                        “Fudge.”  That’s good.
                                 TRENT
                           (good-natured)
                        Well then, I might as well go 
                        directly to the top of Candy 
                        Mountain with that argument.

           Trent moves his pawn.

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        No rules?  There we go.  I win.

           Pam moves his pawn back. 

                                 PAM
                        Fine.  We’ll play the way you’re 
                        supposed to play.
                           (then)
                        Duncan, move to the correct place. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        I already did.

                                 PAM
                        Great.
                           (getting up)
                        Now, take my turn for me.  I’m 
                        going to set the table for lunch.

                                 TRENT
                        Wait, what?  No, you need to do it.

                                 PAM
                        Duncan can move for me.

                                 TRENT
                        No, you’re the one who wanted to 
                        play.  So, play your turn.

           Pam takes a moment, then comes back to turn a card and slam 
           it down.

                                 PAM
                        Purple.

           Pam moves her pawn toward a purple square with force.  Then, 
           turns to go to the kitchen.

                                 STEPH
                           (cautiously)
                        It’s two.  You need to move two 
                        purple squares. 
                           (off Pam’s look)
                        Sorry.
           Pam takes a moment to collect herself, and then comes to  
           move her pawn.

                                 PAM
                        There.  And, I’ve landed...
                           (for Trent’s benefit)
                        ... By exact count, at the 
                        shortcut, so, I’ll be taking the 
                        “Rainbow Trail.”

           She does. 

                                 TRENT
                        See?  You’re way ahead now.

                                 PAM 
                        It’s Candyland, Trent.

           With that, she walks to the kitchen, starts stirring the 
           soup.  Trent gives Duncan and Steph a “What’s with her look?” 
           But, they don’t commiserate.

                                 TRENT
                        It’s your turn, Steph.

           Long beat of silence.  The only sounds are those of “game 
           play.”  A Gingerbread pawn being moved across the board. 
           Suddenly, Pam slams down a PLATE.

                                 PAM
                           (in tears)
                        It’s fucking Candyland!

           She storms off.

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

           The sun is out.  Remnants of the rain are still evident, 
           puddles on the ground.  The station wagon, now uncovered.

           EXT. SHED

           Duncan boards his bike.  As he rides off, Susanna comes out 
           from behind her house, with her own bike.

           EXT. WATERPARK - A LITTLE LATER

           Duncan locks up his bike.  Susanna watches from afar.  She 
           turns around and heads back the way they came.
           INT. WATERPARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan enters, surprised to find...  OWEN, opening up.  He 
           looks a little more put together than usual, professional.  
           He’s wiping down all the lounge chairs.

                                 OWEN
                           (noticing)
                        It’s your day off.  Why are you 
                        here?

                                 DUNCAN
                        I figured we lost yesterday, so I 
                        thought I’d make it up. 
                           (then, knowingly)
                        Why are you?

                                 OWEN
                        Thought I’d open the place.  See 
                        what all the fuss is about. 

           Duncan smirks.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                           (saving face)
                        Yeah, yeah.  I’m still your 
                        superior.  Cup of coffee.  My hand.  
                        Two minutes.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Okay...

                                 OWEN
                        Ha.  We don’t sell coffee.

                                 DUNCAN
                        We do.

                                 OWEN
                        No, we do not.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Yes, we do.

           Owen’s not sure.

                                 OWEN
                        Good.  You stuck to your guns.  You 
                        passed my test.  It’s hot chocolate 
                        we don’t have.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Nope.  We have...
                                 OWEN
                        No one cares for you.

           Duncan smiles.  Just then, Caitlin walks up to the front 
           gate, her KEYS out.  She seems genuinely surprised to find 
           the place already open AND to see Owen working.  He beams.  
           She strides past him, bemused but it’s not going to be that 
           easy.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Your shirt’s inside out.

           Owen looks.  It, in fact, is. 

           INT. WATERPARK - A LITTLE LATER

           Duncan is stacking MATS.

                                 SUSANNA (O.S.)
                        So, this is where you run off to?

                                 DUNCAN
                           (confused)
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 SUSANNA
                        I followed you earlier.  Then, went 
                        to grab my stuff.

           She holds up her BEACH BAG.  Duncan smiles.

                                 DUNCAN
                        What happened to “let it be yours?”

                                 SUSANNA 
                        Does your mom know that you work 
                        here?

                                 DUNCAN
                        No. 

                                 SUSANNA
                           (impressed)
                        ... Nice.

           Suddenly, over the LOUD SPEAKER...

                                 OWEN (O.S.)
                        Duncan, to the Snack Shack.

           Duncan looks over his shoulder.  Owen, Roddy, and Lewis are 
           standing very nearby.
                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                           (into PA)
                        Duncan, please report to the Snack 
                        Shack.  I have to announce this 
                        over the PA as my voice won’t carry 
                        that far.  My throat suffered major 
                        damage during an intense make-out 
                        session with Lewis’ mom.  She has a 
                        forked tongue...  

                                 LEWIS
                           (calling over)
                        Just come over here already, so the 
                        bit will end.

           Duncan looks back at Susanna.

                                 DUNCAN
                        ... Don’t go anywhere.

                                 SUSANNA
                        I’m cool.

           Duncan walks over to the guys...

                                 OWEN
                           (goading)
                        Who’s that, big guy?

                                 DUNCAN
                           (shrugging)
                        Just a girl.

                                 OWEN
                        Just a girl?  A girl who makes you 
                        blush? 

                                 DUNCAN
                        Susanna.

                                 RODDY
                        You pussy hound.

           Duncan looks down at the ground, shuffling his feet.

                                 DUNCAN
                        I don’t know.  She’s... older than 
                        me.

                                 RODDY
                        Then, why are you here talking to 
                        us and not over there, sealing the 
                        deal with that cougar?
                                 DUNCAN
                        Well,... Maybe if you guys hadn’t 
                        called me over.

           Owen and Roddy react to Duncan’s hint of bravado.  Duncan 
           smiles and walks off.

           INT. WATERPARK - A LITTLE LATER

           Duncan is giving Susanna the tour, a la the one he got from 
           Owen. 

                                 DUNCAN 
                           (excitedly)
                        Okay.  Wave Country Waterpark.  It 
                        was built in the summer of ‘83.  
                        The creator never wanted the place 
                        to change.  So, on his death bed, 
                        he said “The minute someone tries 
                        to repaint or update the waterpark, 
                        it needs to be destroyed.”

           Susanna laughs.  Beat.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT’D)
                           (off laugh)
                        Huh.  I didn’t get that joke as 
                        fast.

           They pass the SUNBATHING GIRLS on their lounge chairs.

                                 SUNBATHING GIRLS
                           (flirty)
                        Hey, Pop ‘N Lock.

           They giggle. 

                                 DUNCAN
                           (off Susanna)
                        It’s a long story.

           INT. WATERPARK - SNACK SHACK - LATER

           Duncan, Susanna, Owen, and Caitlin are eating LUNCH at a 
           PICNIC TABLE.  Nearby, at another table, Roddy and Lewis.  
           Clearly, Owen has been holding court for quite a while.

                                 OWEN
                        Hear me out.... 
                                 CAITLIN
                           (laughing)
                        We have been.  For an eternity.

                                 OWEN
                           (emphatic)
                        I’m sorry.  I look at his face and 
                        I’m absolutely convinced..

                                 LEWIS
                           (over this)
                        I’m not engaging...

                                 OWEN
                        Lewis, admit it.  You.  Should.  
                        Be.  A.  Model.  

           Lewis just shakes his head, giving Owen nothing.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got cheekbones to die for, 
                        porcelain skin, and all I want to 
                        do is dive into those deep, blue 
                        pools you have for eyes...

                                 SUSANNA
                        Is he always like this?

                                 CAITLIN
                           (exhaling)
                        Yes.

                                 SUSANNA
                        Exhausting.

                                 OWEN
                        Or, endearing? 

                                 SUSANNA
                        Exhausting.

           Owen shakes his head.  Not convinced.  

                                 OWEN
                           (to Caitlin)
                        Exhausting or endearing?

           Caitlin raise her eyebrow.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                           (waving her off, 
                           indicating Susanna)
                        You’re just going to say whatever 
                        your best friend says.
                                 (MORE)
                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                           (then, to Lewis)
                        Exhausting or endearing?

                                 LEWIS
                        What do you think I’m going to say?

                                 OWEN
                           (to Roddy)
                        Exhausting or endearing?

                                 RODDY
                        Endearing.

                                 OWEN
                        Thank you.

                                 LEWIS
                           (to Roddy)
                        Sleep with him already.

                                 RODDY
                        What we have is healthy...

                                 OWEN
                        Alright, Duncan, you’re the tie-
                        breaker.

           Duncan takes a moment, glances at Susanna and Caitlin.

                                 DUNCAN
                           (coping to)
                        Endearing.

           Owen gloats.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT’D)
                        But,... It’s cool to just be real 
                        sometimes.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Amen.

                                 OWEN
                        Where’s the fun in that?

           Caitlin exhales.  Same old, same old.  She tosses her stuff 
           into a TRASH CAN and goes back to work.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Maybe she’s not into all the bells 
                        and whistles.
           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

           Duncan and Susanna are walking their bikes up the driveway. 

                                 STEPH (O.S.)
                        Thanks a lot for ditching me, 
                        bitch.

           They both look up.  Steph is sitting on the edge of the deck, 
           her feet hanging over the side. 

                                 SUSANNA
                           (lying)
                        Oh.  I wasn’t aware we had plans. 

                                 STEPH
                        I wasn’t aware you two had plans.

                                 SUSANNA
                        Sorry, we just...

                                 STEPH
                        I’ve got a ton of stuff going on in 
                        my life right now.  So, it would 
                        have been nice to have a friend.

           Just then, Pam comes out of the screen door.  She seems 
           expectant, hoping to see someone who isn’t there.  Realizing 
           it’s just the kids...

                                 PAM
                        Dinner’s almost ready.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Pam, Duncan and Steph are seated at the dining room table.  A 
           whole spread of food, untouched. Duncan looks over at the 
           wall clock.  8:30 PM.

                                 PAM
                        No use in waiting.  Let’s just eat.

           More silence.  Just the sound of UTENSILS CLINKING against 
           the plates.  Beat.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                           (trying to push through)
                        So,... How’s Chad, Steph?

                                 STEPH
                        We broke up.
                                 PAM
                        Oh.  I’m sorry.

           Beat. 

                                 STEPH
                           (off food)
                        This is really good.

           They continue eating in silence.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Pam is at the sink, cleaning dishes.  Duncan is wrapping up 
           the uneaten food.  Steph approaches Pam, carrying plates.  
           Pam motions for her to set them down.  Steph nudges her away, 
           takes over cleaning.

           INT. DUNCAN’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Duncan wakes up in bed.  Something has stirred him.

           From DOWNSTAIRS, he hears the front door OPEN.  Duncan looks 
           over at the alarm clock. 2:40 AM.

           INT. STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan descends, softly.  Peers around the wall. 

           DUNCAN’S POV of Pam, sitting in a chair, arms crossed.  
           Before her, standing, TRENT.

                                 TRENT
                        Look, I’m sorry.  I was out with 
                        Kip on his boat all day.  And, we 
                        lost track of time.  I would have 
                        called, but then it was late and I 
                        didn’t want to wake you.

                                 PAM
                        Just tell me...
                           (beat)
                        ... If there’s something I should 
                        know.

                                 TRENT
                        What are you talking about...?
                                 PAM 
                        Don’t make me feel crazy.  I’ve 
                        been through this.  And, I...

           Trent kneels in front of her.  He puts his hand on her face, 
           gently caressing it.

                                 TRENT
                        I’m right here.  You have me.  You 
                        always have.
                           (beat)
                        We’re in this together.  Remember?

           With that, he puts his head in her lap.  

           INT. KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING

           Duncan comes around the corner to find Pam, happily cooking 
           pancakes. 

                                 PAM
                           (bright)
                        Good morning.  I’ve already made 
                        too many pancakes, so I hope you’re 
                        hungry... 

                                 DUNCAN
                        Where was he?

           Pam pauses.  Smiles a desperate smile and goes back to making 
           pancakes. 

                                 PAM
                        He was with Kip.  But, he’s here 
                        now.  Can you grab the orange 
                        juice?

           Duncan exits, bumping into Trent, coming down the STAIRS.

                                 TRENT
                           (chipper)
                        Morning, buddy.

           Duncan breezes past him.

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        Whoa.  We don’t say, “Good 
                        morning?”

           Duncan locks eyes with him...

                                 DUNCAN
                        Welcome home.
           ... And heads outside.  Trent hesitates, then heads to 
           kitchen.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. JOAN AND KIP’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           It’s another party in full swing.  People are dancing.  
           There’s a giant bonfire.  Tables, set up in the sand.  At 
           one, Trent, Pam, and Steph are eating.  Duncan sits at the 
           end of the table, brooding.  Betty joins, carrying a PLATE.

                                 BETTY
                        How about this spread, huh?  Where 
                        did Joan find the time to order 
                        take-out? 

           Betty winks, Pam smiles.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        And if there’s one thing that 
                        travels really well, it’s fried 
                        food.

           Pam and Betty laugh.  Trent knows better than to chime in. 

                                 PAM
                        I must get Joan’s recipe for Big 
                        Daddy’s menu!

           They laugh even harder, toasting Pam.  Just then, Joan 
           approaches.  She seems a little tipsy AND, oddly, is donning 
           a HEAD SCARF a la Pam.  Pam’s smile fades.

                                 JOAN
                        Is everyone having a good time?  Oh 
                        good, you got some food. 
                           (then)
                        Pam, I don’t know what I was 
                        thinking.  I should of had you 
                        cater my party. 

           Pam gives her best pleasant smile, takes a swig of wine. 

                                 BETTY
                        Well, at least this way, you’re 
                        going to have lots of leftovers.

           Joan gives a forced smile.  Betty returns the favor. 

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        New look?
                                 JOAN
                        No.  Just bad hair day.

           Then, turning her attention to Trent...

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Alright, Mr. Ramsey, you’ve been 
                        avoiding me all night.  And, I 
                        won’t have it.  Not tonight.

           Joan grabs Trent’s arm, playfully trying to pull him up.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        I said I’d get you on that dance 
                        floor!

           Trent resists, but not enough.  They head over to the dance 
           floor.  

                                 BETTY
                        And, they called me a C-U-N-T.

                                 STEPH
                        You don’t have to keep spelling it.

           Just then, Kip joins the table, carrying a plate of food. 

                                 KIP
                           (jokingly)
                        Joan found herself a victim, huh?

           Kip chuckles.  That sits like a lead balloon with the group.

                                 BETTY 
                           (changing the subject)
                        Kip, I expect to be inviting myself 
                        out onto your boat again.  When 
                        should I plan to do that? 

                                 KIP
                        Ah, the motor’s out of commission.  
                        It has been all week.  And will 
                        probably be longer until they get 
                        the parts. 

           Duncan looks right at Pam, as she looks over at Trent and 
           Joan on the dance floor.  Pam’s eyes well up.  She stands,  
           her face drained of life, white. 

                                 PAM
                        I think I’m going to grab a 
                        sweater.  Excuse me.

           She turns and starts to walk away.  Duncan stands. 
                                 DUNCAN
                        How much more do you need?

           Pam stops, but doesn’t turn around.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT’D)
                        Do something, mom.  You know what’s 
                        happening.  He’s sleeping with her. 
                        Do something about it!

           The table has gone silent.  In fact, Duncan has the attention 
           of the whole party, including Trent and Joan, who have 
           stopped dancing. 

                                 PAM
                        Duncan,...

           She starts to walk away again.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Yeah, that’s it!  Walk away!  It’s 
                        easier!  It’s right in front of 
                        your face, mom! 

           Trent comes over, grabs Duncan’s arm. 

                                 TRENT
                        Hey, buddy...

           Duncan whips around, pulls free of Trent’s grasp. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        Let go of me!  I’m not talking to 
                        you.

                                 TRENT
                        Well, I’m talking to you.

                                 DUNCAN 
                           (pointing at Joan)
                        Just go screw her, asshole!  I 
                        mean, you have already. 
                           (points to Pam)
                        And, she’s certainly not going to 
                        stop you!  Are you, Mom?!

                                 TRENT
                        You don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. 

                                 DUNCAN 
                        Everybody knows what I’m talking 
                        about!
           Trent grabs Duncan by the arms.  He breaks free, and pushes 
           Trent back.  There’s some force there.  Trent is definitely 
           thrown off balance, but gets his footing, goes for Duncan 
           again.  Just then, Kip steps in between them.

                                 KIP
                        Whoa, whoa. Trent.  Take it easy.

                                 PAM
                        Enough!  Both of you!  Stop!

                                 DUNCAN
                        Fine.  You don’t want to do 
                        anything about it?  It’s your life, 
                        but it’s not mine.
                           (then)
                        I want to be with dad! 

                                 PAM
                        Duncan,...

           Trent scoffs. Duncan looks at him.

                                 DUNCAN
                        I’m going to live with my father!

                                 TRENT
                        Your father?  Good luck with 
                        that...

           Duncan looks a little thrown, confused. 

                                 PAM
                        Trent, don’t...

                                 TRENT 
                        He doesn’t want you, kid.

           Duncan stricken, looks at Pam.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Is that true?

                                 PAM
                           (pained)
                        Duncan...

           Duncan takes off toward the beach, passing Susanna at the 
           fire.  As Kip turns to Joan, she takes a sip of her wine, and 
           looks right at him.
           EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan sits in the sand.  Susanna approaches, sits.  She 
           checks in with him, but his gaze is set on the water.

                                 SUSANNA
                        I told you this place sucks.

           Susanna smiles, hoping to break the ice.  No luck.

                                 SUSANNA (CONT’D)
                        I talked to my dad today.  I told 
                        him that we had chased ghost crabs. 
                        It made him very happy.  Felt like 
                        he was here.  “Did you tell him 
                        about the eyes?!  You’ve got to 
                        tell him about their eyes!”  He 
                        gets so excited...

           Still nothing from Duncan.  She pushes on. 

                                 SUSANNA (CONT’D)
                        See, their eyes can rotate 360 
                        degrees.  They can see everything 
                        around them.  But, they can’t look 
                        straight up.  Which, makes it easy 
                        for birds to attack them.  So, they 
                        have to gather food at night for 
                        safety.  
                           (then, shrugging)
                        I don’t know.  My dad finds it 
                        cool.  He’s a dork.

           Finally, Duncan looks at Susanna, who smiles.  Impulsively, 
           he leans in, tries to kiss her.  Caught off guard, she pulls 
           back.

                                 SUSANNA (CONT’D)
                        Oh,...

           Beat.  He tries again. 

                                 SUSANNA (CONT’D)
                        Duncan, wait.

           Duncan jumps up.

                                 DUNCAN
                        I just wanted...  Sorry.

           He walks off.
           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan rushes toward the STORAGE SHED.  On the PORCH, Trent 
           and Pam.  Duncan slips under the porch, out of sight.  

           DUNCAN’S POV through the SLATS...

                                 TRENT
                        I’m an asshole.  You deserve 
                        better.  But, I can be that.  I 
                        have to be that.  Because you’re 
                        worth it.  I need you.
                           (beat)
                        We need each other.

           He reaches for her hand.  She makes a fist.  Unwelcome.   
           That said, she doesn’t walk away.  Duncan’s seen enough.  He 
           scurries over to the shed, grabbing bike.  Just as he’s about 
           to hop on...

                                 BOY’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Where are you going?

           Duncan, startled, jumps.  Beneath the stairs, Peter.  He’s 
           wearing his eye patch, holding some action figures.

                                 DUNCAN
                           (hushed)
                        ... Shut up, Peter... 

           ANGLE ON Pam/Trent, looking out into the darkness.

           ANGLE ON Peter, emerging from under the stairs.

                                 PETER 
                           (whispering )
                        Take me with you.

                                 DUNCAN
                        No. I...

                                 PAM (O.S.)
                           (calling out)
                        ... Duncan?

           Peter jumps in front of the bike, blocking.

                                 PETER
                           (hushed)
                        Please!

           Duncan grapples.  Peter pleads...
           EXT. STREET - A LITTLE LATER

           Duncan is riding his bike, with Peter sitting on the 
           handlebars, who is smiling from ear to ear.

           EXT. WATERPARK - LATER

           Duncan and Peter approach the FRONT GATE.  Duncan’s surprised 
           to see a few CARS in the parking lot.  There are lights on in 
           the MAIN OFFICE.  Muted MUSIC from inside. Duncan and Peter 
           start to scale the fence.  Roddy and a group of GIRLS walk 
           up, carrying cases of beer.  He opens one side of the gate.

                                 RODDY
                        Or, you could just try opening the 
                        gate.

           Off Duncan’s look...

           INT. WATERPARK - MAIN OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Roddy enters, followed by Duncan/Peter, surveying the party.  
           The boys definitely stick out as the rest of the room is 
           certainly of age.  As for the decorations, minimal.  Some 
           strung up LIGHTS.  FURNITURE has been pushed to the sides to 
           make room for a dance floor. 

                                 RODDY
                           (to Room)
                        Be cool.  Our boss is here and his 
                        pirate friend.

           ANGLE ON Owen/Caitlin.  Caitlin, out of habit, makes a move 
           to handle the situation.  But, without even being prompted, 
           Owen takes charge.

           ANGLE ON Peter noticing a COOLER.  Grabs a couple BEERS.

                                 PETER
                        Hell, yeah.  I could use a 
                        cleansing ale.

           Just then, Owen intercepts, taking the beers.

                                 OWEN
                        Or, check them out from afar.

                                 PETER
                        I’ve thrown a few back before.
                                 OWEN
                        Yeah, and I’ve been to jail before.        
                        There’s a limit for everything.
                           (to Duncan)
                        What’s your friend’s name?

                                 DUNCAN
                        This is Peter.

                                 OWEN
                        Nice eye patch.

                                 PETER
                        Thanks.

                                 OWEN
                        You don’t sound too cool with it.

                                 PETER
                        My mom makes me wear it.  She says 
                        my eye confuses people. 

                                 OWEN
                        Oh, well now you have to show me.

           Peter takes it off. 

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Wait, she wants you to hide that? 
                        Is she insane?  I’d kill to have 
                        that eye.

                                 PETER
                           (smiles)
                        You’re full of shit.

                                 OWEN
                        Seriously.  You know how many bits 
                        I could do with it?  Daring people 
                        to look me straight in the eye?  
                        That thing’s awesome. 

           Peter beams.  Then, something catches his attention...

                                 PETER
                           (way too excited)
                        No way!  Pizza and chicken wings!

           He takes off.  Owen checks in with Duncan, who seems out of 
           sorts.

                                 OWEN
                        So... What’s up, my man?
                                 DUNCAN
                        You’re having a party?

           There’s an air of disappointment in Duncan’s voice.  Owen 
           senses it.

                                 OWEN
                        It’s a farewell for Lewis.  We have 
                        one every month.

           Duncan nods.  Beat.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        ... Did you need to talk to me?

           Duncan considers, but...

                                 DUNCAN
                        Nah.  Just wanted to hang out.

                                 OWEN
                           (considers, then)
                        How about we say you hang out for a 
                        little bit?  Okay?  I’m sure you’ll 
                        be wanted home at some point.

           Duncan nods.  Owen can tell he’s not himself.  He puts his 
           hand on Duncan’s shoulder, walks him over to the rest of the 
           GANG.  Caitlin can’t helped but be endeared by the sight, as 
           we...

           INT. MAIN OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER

           PARTYGOERS/EMPLOYEES are dancing.  Clearly, more people have 
           arrived.  Duncan surveys the PIZZA, grabs two pieces.

           We TRACK Duncan as he moves through the party.  He shuffles 
           through the “dance floor,” passing Peter, who is thrashing 
           around.  And, he’s clearly been going to town on the CHICKEN 
           WINGS judging by the sauce all over his face.  Caitlin dances 
           nearby.  Peter even tries to “grind” up on her.  She politely 
           pushes him away.

           We continue to TRACK Duncan over to Lewis, who is opening 
           GIFTS.  Duncan hands pieces of pizza to Owen and Roddy.  
           Lewis holds up a POOL LEAF SKIMMER with a giant BOW tied 
           around it.

                                 LEWIS
                           (sarcastic)
                        Owen, you shouldn’t have.
                                 OWEN
                        Hey.  I went to three different 
                        places in the waterpark to find 
                        that.  You can use it to catch 
                        thunder clouds.

           Peter dances by, BEER in hand.  Without missing a beat, Owen 
           takes that one from him, too.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                           (to room)
                        Alright, I think we need to hear a 
                        few parting words from our guest of 
                        honor.

           Owen glances at Roddy, conspiratorially.  Roddy, taking the 
           cue, crosses over to Duncan, as...

                                 LEWIS
                           (protesting)
                        No, no.... I’m not opening myself 
                        up to a parade of bits from you...

                                 RODDY
                           (to Duncan, conspicuously)
                        You want to be part of a tradition?

           Duncan nods, follows Roddy off.

                                 OWEN
                        No, no.  Seriously.  All joking 
                        aside.  We’re going to miss you 
                        Lewis.  You’ve been a good friend.  
                        Plain and simple.  That’s no bit.  

           Lewis takes a moment.  Wondering if the other shoe is going 
           to drop, then...

                                 LEWIS
                        Well,... I won’t say that I won’t 
                        totally miss some aspects of this 
                        place.  It wasn’t completely void 
                        of decent times.  I remember a 
                        couple of days that stick out as 
                        almost memorable.  And, some others 
                        that had hours or so within them 
                        that weren’t painful.
                           (beat, then genuine)
                        I guess if there is one thing I 
                        will miss dearly, it’s...

           Just then, a very powerful STREAM OF WATER nails Lewis right 
           in the face, drenching him.  He’s shocked to say the least.
                                 LEWIS (CONT’D)
                        What the hell man?!

           ANGLE ON Duncan, armed with a major POWER SOAKER water gun.

           As for the room, they appear shocked, too. 

                                 OWEN
                           (disbelief)
                        Duncan,...?  

           Duncan’s a deer in headlights, again.

                                 DUNCAN
                        It’s... part of a tradition...

                                 OWEN
                        What kind of warped tradition is 
                        that?!

           Duncan glances over at Roddy.  He catches him grinning.  
           Duncan smiles.  He’s been duped.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Lewis was pouring his heart out, 
                        and you subjected him to 
                        unparalleled, but well-deserved 
                        humiliation... ?!

           Suddenly, Lewis gets nailed again with another MIGHTY BLOW OF 
           WATER.

           ANGLE ON Roddy, now armed with a POWER SOAKER as well.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                           (really playing it up)
                        No, Roddy, no!  Not you, too!  
                        Lewis has suffered enough!  He was 
                        just about to tell us the one thing 
                        he will miss....

           Another BLAST OF WATER hits Lewis.

           ANGLE ON Caitlin, armed.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        No, Caitlin!  You’re better than 
                        this!  Oh man, the only thing that 
                        could make this worse for Lewis is 
                        if someone in this room...  Someone 
                        known for taking things 
                        literally... Literally, takes me 
                        literally when I say Lewis deserves 
                        one more shot in the face...
           With that, Duncan takes the cue.  Nails Lewis.

                                 LEWIS
                           (getting up)
                        Alright, that’s it.

           Lewis startles Caitlin, taking her Water Gun.  With that, all 
           hell breaks loose.  Lewis nails Owen.  Duncan nails Lewis.  
           Roddy nails everybody.   It’s a free for all....

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. MAIN OFFICE  - A LITTLE LATER

           It has become a full on dance party.  Everybody and 
           everything is SOAKED.  No one is holding back.

           ANGLE ON Peter, sneaking another BEER out of the cooler.  He 
           dances his way over, takes center stage, and dances his ass 
           off. 

                                 PETER
                        Oh shit, I’m feeling the beat.

           The crowd goes crazy, as Peter ends his dance with a 
           flourish.  The crowd CHEERS.  And,... Peter VOMITS.

           INT. WATERPARK - TOP OF DEVIL’S PEAK - DAWN

           Duncan sits on the railing.  The sun just about to come up.  
           Owen approaches, carrying two cups of coffee.  

                                 OWEN
                        I said you could hang out for a 
                        little bit.  And, I meant it. 
                        Sunrise of the next day is where I 
                        have to draw the line. 
                           (then)
                        You need to go home.

           Duncan doesn’t budge.  

                                 DUNCAN
                        I wish I could stay here forever.

           Owen sits.

                                 OWEN
                        Oh well then, you’re going to love 
                        the winters.  They’re pretty 
                        spectacular.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 OWEN (CONT'D)
                        Painting houses until it gets too 
                        cold, bar backing at some dive to 
                        scrape rent together, talking to 
                        inanimate objects... 

                                 DUNCAN
                        I’m serious.

                                 OWEN
                        I am, too.  There’s a whole world 
                        out there for you, Duncan.  Don’t 
                        settle, just yet.

                                 DUNCAN
                        I don’t have anywhere else to go. 

                                 OWEN
                        I bet that’s not true.

                                 DUNCAN
                        This is the only place I’m happy.

           Duncan starts crying.

                                 OWEN
                        Oh, hey. Hey.

                                 DUNCAN 
                        I hate him. 

                                 OWEN
                        Who?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Trent. My mom’s boyfriend.  He said 
                        I was a three.  He asked me what I 
                        thought I was on a scale from one 
                        to ten. He said I was a three. 
                           (beat)
                        Who says that to somebody?

                                 OWEN 
                        Someone who doesn’t know you.

                                 DUNCAN
                        I didn’t even want to answer!  I... 
                        shouldn’t have to answer! 

                                 OWEN
                        Listen to me.  That’s about him, 
                        man. That’s all about him.  It’s 
                        got nothing to do with you. 

           Duncan looks at him.
                                 DUNCAN
                        How do you know?

                                 OWEN 
                        Because my father was the same way. 
                           (then)
                        And that’s why I hate patterns. And 
                        that’s why you can’t buy into that 
                        shit. And that’s why you gotta go 
                        your own way.

           Owen smiles.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        And you, my friend, are going your 
                        own way. 

           INT. WATERPARK - EARLY DAWN

           Peter is passed out on a lounge chair, as is everybody else. 
           Caitlin is cleaning up.  Owen gently shakes Peter.

                                 OWEN 
                        Rise and shine, Patches.

           Peter wakes up, letting out a loud STRETCH.

                                 PETER
                        Last night was awesome.
                        Did I get laid?

           Duncan and Owen shocked, laugh.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I feel like I did.  Did I?

           They laugh even harder. 

           EXT. STREET - A LITTLE LATER

           Duncan is riding his bike, Peter on the handlebars.  Beat, 
           then...

                                 PETER
                        Stop. Stop!

           Peter jumps off, tries to puke.  But, nothing.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I’m okay.

           He hops back on the handlebars.  They ride a few feet.
                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Stop. Stop!

           He jumps off again.  Tries to puke.  Nothing.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                           (jumping on handlebars)
                        Man, I’m never drinking again.

           A few feet.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        That night was epic.
                           (then)
                        Stop. Stop!

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - A LITTLE LATER

           Duncan and Peter ride up on the bike.  The station wagon 
           door’s are open.  There are already bags inside.  Susanna is 
           up on her deck.

                                 SUSANNA
                           (seeing them, calling into 
                           house)
                        Mom, they’re back!

           Suddenly, Betty bursts out, runs down stairs.

                                 BETTY 
                           (to Peter)
                        Where the hell have you been all 
                        night, young man!

                                 PETER 
                        Not now, woman.

           Peter walks right past his mom, heads up the stairs. Betty 
           follows.

                                 BETTY 
                        What did you just say to me?!

                                 PETER
                        We’ll talk when I get up.

                                 BETTY
                        Don’t you walk away... And, where 
                        the hell is your eye patch?!

           With that, they’re gone.  Susanna looks at Duncan, then 
           follows them inside.  
           ANGLE ON Trent exiting his house, carrying bags.

                                 TRENT
                           (calling inside)
                        Pam, he’s here.

           Trent puts down the bags.

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        We were worried about you, buddy.

           Duncan’s confused.  Why the good mood?

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                        Listen.  Let’s forget about last 
                        night.  How does that sound?  Start 
                        fresh.  Clean slate.  What do you 
                        say, buddy?

           Trent pats his head, walks over to the car.  Duncan heads 
           into the house, passing Steph on the STAIRS, who’s exiting 
           with her BAG.

                                 STEPH
                        I hope you’re happy now.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan walks into the doorway.  Pam is packing a suitcase, 
           her back to Duncan.  From her eyes, we can tell it has been a 
           hard night.  She looks exhausted, drained. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        What’s going on?

           Pam doesn’t turn around. 

                                 PAM
                        We’re leaving.  I need you to get 
                        your stuff.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Mom, I’m sorry. 

           The tears come back.  She keeps her back to him.

                                 PAM
                        I know.  Me too.

           Beat.
                                 DUNCAN
                        But, why do you and I have to go?  
                        The summer’s not over...

                                 PAM
                        Duncan,...

                                 DUNCAN
                        We can stay somewhere else.  I 
                        don’t understand...

                                 PAM
                        We want to leave early, so that’s 
                        what we’re doing!

                                 DUNCAN
                        So,... We’re going with them?

           Pam doesn’t respond.  She knows what he’s really asking.  She 
           collects herself, turns to him.

                                 PAM
                        I don’t expect you to understand...  

           His face says it all.  “Unbelievable.”

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        You’re fourteen.  And, I know that 
                        means you think you know everything 
                        but...  We do things...

           Pam struggles.  This doesn’t come easy.

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        ... We do things to... protect 
                        ourselves.  Because we’re scared.  
                        Scared of... Being at a place again 
                        that we don’t know if we can 
                        handle.  So,... We look the other 
                        way.  We convince ourselves that we 
                        can make it work... Because, we 
                        need it to. 

                                 DUNCAN
                           (short, clarifying)
                        We’re leaving with them.

           Pam looks down.  Ashamed.  Duncan’s stare is too hard to 
           face.  Beat.  He leaves.  Pam sits on the edge of her bed.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Everybody’s now out front.  Trent puts the last bag, closes 
           the back to the station wagon. 

                                 TRENT
                        Is that it?

           No one answers.  He goes to lock up.  

           ANGLE ON PAM/BETTY.

                                 PAM
                        Thanks for everything.

           Betty hugs her tightly.

                                 BETTY
                        I think you’re great.

           ANGLE ON SUSANNA/DUNCAN at the station wagon door.

                                 DUNCAN
                        So, I guess... We’re leaving.
                           (beat)
                        Goodbye.

                                 SUSANNA
                        Goodbye.

           Duncan starts to climb into the back.  Susanna taps his 
           shoulder.  He turns.  She leans in, kisses him.  It’s a great 
           kiss. 

                                 SUSANNA (CONT’D)
                        You just surprised me, that’s all.

           She smiles, walks off.  Duncan climbs into the back.  As he 
           does, he notices STEPH, staring.

                                 DUNCAN 
                        What are you looking at, perv?

           He proudly takes his back bench seat.

           INT. STATION WAGON

           The car pulls out the driveway.

           DUNCAN’S POV OF SUSANNA WAVING.  Betty approaches her, puts 
           her arm around her daughter.  Susanna leans into her mother.  
           Now at a good distance, we can no longer see them.
           INT. STATION WAGON - LATER

           They all ride in silence.  The station wagon pulls up to a 
           stoplight.  Duncan looks out the side window.

           DUNCAN’S POV of The Waterpark.

           He considers, looks over his shoulder.

           DUNCAN’S POV of everyone in the front of the car, off in 
           their own worlds.

           He looks back at the waterpark.

           EXT. STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS

           WIDE ON CAR.  Suddenly, the back door flies open.  Duncan 
           jumps out.

                                 PAM
                        Duncan,...?!

           Duncan runs into the parking lot.  Pam jumps out, follows.  

                                 TRENT
                        ... Pam...

           The car behind Trent’s car, HONKS.  He pulls into the parking 
           lot, following them both.

           INT. WATERPARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Duncan, like a man on a mission, heads right up to the Rental 
           Shack.  Owen is there.  As well as Neil, Jason, and Kyle. 

                                 OWEN
                        Hey...

                                 DUNCAN
                        We’re leaving. 

                                 OWEN
                        What? 

                                 DUNCAN
                        I came to say goodbye.  Come on.

           Duncan walks off.  Owen looks to the guys, puzzled. 
           INT. WATERPARK - TOP OF DEVIL’S PEAK - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON DUNCAN.

                                 DUNCAN 
                        We’re going down, Hot Rod.  I’m 
                        passing him.

           PULL BACK to REVEAL Duncan, Owen, Kyle, Jason, Neil, and 
           Roddy at the mouth of the slide.  Kyle runs to the railing. 

                                 KYLE
                           (calling down)
                        Duncan’s going for it!  He’s gonna 
                        try to pass Owen on the slide!

           INT. WATERPARK - BOTTOM OF DEVIL’S PEAK - CONTINUOUS

           A large crowd gathers at the base.  Pam enters, surveying 
           this strange land she has walked into.  She notices a plaque 
           hanging on the rental shack wall.

           CLOSE ON PLAQUE.  It reads, “Employee of the Month.  Pop ‘N 
           Lock.”  And, there a picture of Duncan.

           Pam joins the crowd, not sure what everyone is looking at. 

                                 CROWD
                        Pop ‘N Lock!  Pop ‘N Lock!

           Trent/Steph step up behind Pam, even more lost than she is.

           INT. WATERPARK - TOP OF DEVIL’S PEAK - CONTINUOUS

                                 NEIL
                        So, how do you plan to do it?

                                 DUNCAN
                        I have no idea.

                                 KYLE
                        What makes you think you can?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Hey.  Don’t die wondering, man.

           Owen smiles.  He likes seeing this side of Duncan.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT’D)
                           (to Owen)
                        You go first.  I’ll follow right 
                        behind you.
           Owen sits down at the lip of the slide, water rushing around 
           him.  Duncan backs up a ways.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT’D)
                        One, two, three... Go!

           Roddy gives Owen a push.  Instantly, Duncan starts a full 
           sprint, diving into the tube, face first.

           EXT. WATERPARK - BOTTOM OF DEVIL’S PEAK - CONTINUOUS

           The crowd stares in silence, including Pam and Trent and 
           Steph.  They don’t know what they’re looking for, but they 
           can’t take their eyes off the tube.  Caitlin approaches, 
           standing right next to Pam.  She’s wondering what the hell is 
           going on as well.

           Time seems to have stopped.  Beat, after beat passes.  People 
           strain to see, taut with anticipation.  Only the gentle 
           sounds of LAPPING WAVES can be heard. 

           Until, all of the sudden....

           ...like the tube is giving birth,...

           Duncan comes shooting out, followed by Owen, cradled by waves 
           of water!

           The crowd cheers.  Pam takes this in.  Owen holds up Duncan’s 
           arm in victory, as they start to climb out of the pool.

                                 OWEN
                        Ladies and gentlemen, I give you 
                        the first person to ever pass 
                        someone on the water slide!

           The crowd CHEERS.  Duncan looks up, confused.  Owen winks. 
           Then, Duncan smiles, proud.  Just then, Kyle, Neil and Jason 
           run down.

                                 KYLE
                        How did you do it?!

                                 OWEN
                        Can’t tell you, my man.  That’s our 
                        secret.

           Duncan smiles.  The CROWD swarms.  Just then, Pam breaks 
           through the crowd, locks eyes with Duncan.  She’s beside 
           herself.
                                 DUNCAN
                        Mom, this is Owen.  My friend who 
                        drives. 
                           (then)
                        Owen, my mom.

                                 OWEN
                        It’s a pleasure to meet you. 

           She shakes his hand, but Pam can barely take her eyes off 
           Duncan.

                                 PAM
                        ... Yeah, you too.

                                 OWEN
                        You’ve got a helluva a kid here.

           Trent steps up behind Pam.

                                 TRENT
                        Are we done?

                                 OWEN
                           (exaggerated pleasance)
                        Oh, and this must be Trent.

           Owen shakes Trent’s hand, pulling him in, invading his space.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Hi.  I’m Owen, a good friend of 
                        “the three.”

                                 TRENT
                        Hey.  Let’s go.

           With that, Trent reaches for Duncan.  Owen steps in the way, 
           blocks him.  Trent tries to move to the other side, but Owen 
           shifts and blocks again. 

                                 TRENT (CONT’D)
                           (giving up)
                        I’ll be in the car.

           He turns and walks off.  Pam is still taking in the “new” 
           Duncan.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Mom, can you give us a second?

                                 PAM
                           (coming to)
                        Oh.  Of course.
           As if in a trance, Pam walks off.  

                                 DUNCAN
                        Goodbye, Roddy.

                                 RODDY
                        Pop ‘n Lock.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Caitlin.

                                 CAITLIN
                           (smiling)
                        Take care, Duncan.  We’ll miss you.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Bye, Lewis.

           ANGLE ON Lewis, still in the RENTAL SHACK.  Still at the 
           waterpark.

                                 LEWIS
                        Yeah, yeah.

           Duncan takes beat.  Those were the easy “goodbyes.”  Owen, 
           looks at him, expectant. 

                                 OWEN 
                        Come on, my man.  Shorter 
                        conversations...

           Duncan hugs Owen. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        Thank you.

           Eventually, Duncan breaks away.  As he does, Owen slips his 
           arm around Caitlin’s waist.  This time, she doesn’t remove 
           it.  They watch as  Duncan heads to the front entrance.  He 
           doesn’t look back.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. STATION WAGON

           Like how we began, Duncan is once again in the way, way back.  
           But he’s tan and SOPPING WET.  A smile from ear to ear.  Pam 
           stares out her window, lost in thought.  Beat.  Trent glances 
           into the rearview mirror.
                                 TRENT
                        So, what?  That’s where you’ve been 
                        running off to all summer?  Those 
                        were the friends you made?

                                 PAM
                        Trent...

                                 TRENT
                        I’m just curious...
                           (to Duncan)
                        If that’s aiming higher...?  If 
                        that’s the score you want to settle 
                        on, buddy...?

                                 PAM
                        Stop it. 

           She looks at Trent, daggers. 

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        All you are to us is a ride home.

           With that, as if possessed by something bigger than herself, 
           Pam unbuckles her seat belt.  With one fluid motion, she 
           climbs over the front seat, accidentally(?) hitting the back 
           of Trent’s head with her foot.

                                 TRENT
                        What the hell, Pam...?!

           EXT. STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS

           Pam continues over the front seat. 

           INT. STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS

           Pam pulls down the wall of suitcases separating her from 
           Duncan, falling onto Steph, who’s wearing her iPod earphones, 
           stretched out in the back seat.  Pam climbs over Steph...

                                 STEPH
                        Give me a second.  I’m moving.

           ... And, joins her son.

           They just sit, staring straight ahead.  No need to check in 
           with each other.  They’re on the same page.  For now, they 
           need only enjoy the view from the way, way back.  
           And, just as the slightest hint of a smile comes to Duncan’s 
           face, we....

                                                         FADE OUT.
