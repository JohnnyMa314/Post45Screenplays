                              Los Angeles: Riot to Uprising

                                             by

           BLACK

           OVER THIS WE HEAR THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS, OF GUNFIRE.  WE 
           HEAR THE SOUND OF PEOPLE WAILING IN ANGUISH AND SCREAMING IN 
           ANGER.  

           What we hear are the sounds of a populace standing against 
           the inequitable system that holds them down.  We hear the 
           sounds of the expression of people when every other means of 
           expression - economic and social and political - has been 
           forcibly stripped from them.  This, then is the only manner 
           in which the oppressed can communicate with their oppressors.  

           This is the sound of people rising up.

           NEWSREEL

           We see now the pictures that accompany the sounds.  Yes, it 
           is people rising up, buildings burning down...  However, it 
           is not - as one would expect coming into this film - footage 
           of the 1992 Rodney King beating trial aftermath.  What we see 
           is newsreel footage of the 1965 WATTS RIOTS.

           SUPERIMPOSE: THE WATTS AREA OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA  
           AUGUST 1965.

           There is carnage and death and destruction.  It is all a 
           fairly powerful statement regarding the reaction of people 
           who are stripped of dignity and recourse, and the only voice 
           that remains is one of rage.

           SUPERIMPOSE: OVER FIVE DAYS OF RIOTING:  THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE 
           WERE KILLED.  ELEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE INJURED.  FOUR 
           THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED.  DAMAGE WAS ESTIMATED TO TOTAL 
           MORE THAN $35 MILLION.

           The following VO is from ACTUAL NEWSREEL FOOTAGE OF THE DAY, 
           and puts what(cid:146)s happening on screen in context.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Thirty four people were dead by what will 
                        always be known as insurrection by 
                        hoodlums.  The degree of communist 
                        influence in these riots has been subject 
                        of much discussion and controversy.  For a 
                        solution to this controversy, let(cid:146)s review 
                        the events of recent years both at home 
                        and abroad in light of the communists(cid:146) own 
                        plans for world conquest.

           As we see RESIDENCE OF WATTS - all black, all who look very 
           downtrodden - cueing up to get aid packages, WE HEAR: 

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        As inquiries into the motivation of the 
                        five day rampage continue the Federal 
                        Government announces an allocation of one 
                                 (MORE)
                           LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   2.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        million seven hundred seventy thousand 
                        dollars to the area.  Not for relief, but 
                        for job training and other projects to 
                        lift the desperation of these citizens.

           EXT. SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY

           WE SEE SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES CIRCA 1988.  We see tenement 
           buildings and vacant lots.  We see a good deal of garbage and 
           structures in disrepair.

           SUPERIMPOSE: IN THE TEN YEARS BETWEEN 1980 AND 1990 THERE WAS 
           A (cid:147)CATASTROPHIC(cid:148) ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN LOS ANGELES.

           We see liquor stores and 99 cent stores...  We don(cid:146)t see any 
           Starbucks or GAPs or Home Depots.

           SUPERIMPOSE: WITH THE LOSS OF MORE THAN 150,000 MANUFACTURING 
           JOBS, THE HARDEST HIT AREAS OF THE CITY WERE THOSE THAT(cid:146)S 
           POPULATION WAS MORE THAN 80 PERCENT BLACK AND HISPANIC.

           We see the elderly sitting on stoops and porches, all who 
           look as though they rarely get the medical care they NEED or 
           DESERVE.

           SUPERIMPOSE: AMONG THOSE COMMUNITIES, 13 PERCENT WERE 
           UNEMPLOYED, 29.7 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WERE IN POVERTY, 
           21.1 PERCENT WERE RECEIVING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE.

           We see YOUNG MEN - not gang bangers, young men - with no 
           recourse, no direction....  Young men who should be in school 
           and who should have opportunities - hanging on street 
           corners, sitting on bikes, rolling in cars...  Doing much 
           except rolling ahead in life.

           We see YOUNG GIRLS with babies.  No fathers in sight.  Just 
           girls trying to be women.

           SUPERIMPOSE: NEARLY 30 PERCENT OF PERSONS 25 YEARS AND OVER 
           HAD LESS THEN AN EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION.  ONE-HALF HAD NOT 
           COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL.

           BLACK

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, OF COURSE, SHOULD BE CUT VERY HARSHLY.  
           A VIDEO AND AUDIO JUMBLE.  THE FOLLOWING IS FOR REFERENCE, 
           HOWEVER, AND LAID OUT FAIRLY SUCCINCTLY.

           SUPERIMPOSE: MARCH 3rd, 1991

           We hear the sound of sirens, the sound of tires squealing as 
           they rip against asphalt.  We hear the sound of car engines 
           pulling major revs as they race near their red-lines.  And we 
                           LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   3.

           see a CHP car chasing a white Hyundai along Foothill Blvd. in 
           the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles County.  MELANIE 
           and TIM SINGER are driving the CHP squad (they(cid:146)re a married 
           CHP couple).  This ain(cid:146)t no slow-speed pursuit.  The cars are 
           topping 85 M.P.H. on residential streets.  Both cars are 
           cornering hard, weaving and dodging traffic...  

           An LA Unified squad joins in the chase which has slowed none, 
           become more dangerous.  The Hyundai running a red light and 
           nearly crashing into cross traffic.

           LAPD units now join in the chase, as well as an LAPD police 
           copter which bathes the car in a blinding white light.

           As the chase reaches a crescendo, a PICK UP TRUCK, trying to 
           move out of the way of the approaching vehicles, ends up 
           blocking the road.

           The Hyundai brakes hard, comes to a SKIDDING HALT.  The CHP 
           car, the LA Unified and the LAPD cars stop behind it.

           In the CHP car, Tim Singer begins to scream orders to the 
           occupants of the Hyundai over his car(cid:146)s PA system: (cid:147)Get out, 
           get the hell out of the car. Put your hands up!(cid:148)

           Three more LAPD units arrive.  In them are, OFC. LAURENCE 
           POWELL and TIMOTHY WIND.  THEODORE BRISENO and ROLAND SOLANO.  
           Sergeant STACEY KOON is in the last car by himself.

           The Singers exit their CHP squad and verbally order the 
           occupants of the Hyundai to get out.  

           The two passengers, BRYANT ALLEN and FREDDIE HELMS, comply 
           with the order and lay face down on the ground.

           The third person in the car, the driver, RODNEY KING, remains 
           in the vehicle.

           Melanie Singer focuses on the driver - King - and continues 
           to order him to exit the vehicle, which he finally does.  
           King is disoriented.  Seemingly happy - smiling and laughing - 
           despite the circumstances.  Singer orders King to put his 
           hands on the top of the car.  Finally, King does so.  But, a 
           moment later, as Melanie Singer is trying to get control of 
           the situation, King puts his hands on his butt and wiggles 
           his ass at her.

           KOON, SEES THIS.  From the look on his face, we can tell he 
           doesn(cid:146)t care for King(cid:146)s actions.  Koon quickly goes to get a 
           Taser from his vehicle.

           As he does this, Melanie Singer orders King to lay face down 
           on the ground.  He gets down on all fours, but does not lay 
           flat on the pavement.  Still, thinking the situation is under 
           control, Melanie Singer begins to move toward King with her 
           gun at the ready.  Though it(cid:146)s clear she(cid:146)s trying to cuff 
           King, it(cid:146)s a maneuver Koon doesn(cid:146)t seem to care for.
                           LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   4.

                                 KOON
                        Stand down!  Put your gun away.  I got 
                        this!  Stand down!

           Singer hesitates a moment, then does as told, but doesn(cid:146)t 
           really look that happy about turning her arrest over to the 
           LAPD.

           Quickly, Koon orders DAVID LOVE - the ONLY black cop on the 
           scene - to watch the two occupants of the car.

                                 KOON (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Watch those two.  You hear me?  Keep an 
                        eye on them!

           Koon seems intent on keeping Love away from the action.  Love 
           moves off to guard the occupants of the car.

           Koon then orders Powell, Wind, Briseno and Solano to try and 
           subdue King.  There are maybe 15 other cops standing around 
           (cid:147)doing nothing(cid:148) as the four LAPD officers move in.  They try 
           to get King all the way down by taking hold of his arms and 
           legs...  Not only can they not do that, King actually manages 
           to toss the cops back and off of him.

           Koon now steps up with his Taser.  Fires the darts into King.  
           King grunts, but he does not go down.

                                 POWELL
                        He(cid:146)s dusted.

                                 WIND
                        Hit (cid:145)em again.

                                 BRISENO
                        Get down, now!

           Koon fires the Taser again.  Again King is hit, and he 
           groans, but he does not go all the way down.

                                 KOON
                        Anybody else got a Taser?

           The cops all indicate (cid:147)no.(cid:148)

                                 KOON (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Get your batons out.  Let(cid:146)s go.  Put him 
                        down.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SIMULTANEOUS

           We are interior of an apartment in the Foothill Section of 
           LA.  The noise, the lights from the police helicopter all 
           conspire to wake GEORGE HOLLIDAY, white guy, thirty-one - who 
           sleeps next to his wife MARIA.
                           LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   5.

           Holliday goes to his balcony, looks at the scene on the 
           street two stories below him; the cops, the chaos...

                                 HOLLIDAY
                        Maria...  Hey, Maria.  Go get my camera.

                                 MARIA
                        What is it?

                                 HOLLIDAY
                        I don(cid:146)t know.  All these cops out here.  
                        Get the camera, I want to try it out.

                                 MARIA
                        It(cid:146)s almost one o(cid:146)clock.

                                 HOLLIDAY
                        Just get the camera!

           Maria pulls herself out of bed.  She quickly gets a brand new 
           - era-appropriate - video camera that is still sitting in its 
           box.  She takes it over to her husband.

           He turns the camera on, starts taping.

           AS HOLLIDAY TURNS ON THE CAMERA, WE CUT AMONG FILM, RECREATED 
           VIDEO AND THE ACTUAL HOLLIDAY VIDEO OF THE RODNEY KING 
           BEATING.  WE SEE THE BEATING FROM ALTERNATING PERSPECTIVES: 
           Holliday(cid:146)s camera, on ground level, King(cid:146)s POV of the cops, 
           the cop(cid:146)s POV of King...  It(cid:146)s all very jumbled, confusing.

           Just as Holliday starts taping, King moves very rapidly.  
           Maybe he(cid:146)s moving toward the cops, maybe he(cid:146)s trying to run 
           from them.  Whichever, the resulting action is a devastating 
           blow from officer Powell with his baton which sends King to 
           the ground.

           From there, it(cid:146)s on; the images that were played over and 
           over again: the Rodney King beating.  FIFTY-SIX BATON BLOWS 
           DELIVERED TO THE MAN WITHIN LESS THAN A MINUTE AND A HALF.  
           Through most of it, King is on the ground, rolling from the 
           blows.  Too stunned, too beaten to even defend himself.  
           Powell, in particular, just flails away at King.  Beats him 
           the same way he would beat an animal.    IT IS BRUTAL, 
           VICIOUS, VIOLENT AND UGLY - THE BEATING GOES FROM BEING ABOUT 
           SUBDUING KING, TO PUNISHING HIM.  King fairly BEGS FOR MERCY, 
           but none comes.  The beating will not stop, nor do the cops 
           seem interested in giving King an opportunity to surrender; 
           to lay still.   

           Finally, finally the horror ends with a (cid:147)stomp(cid:148) to King(cid:146)s 
           head from Briseno.
                           LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   6.

           EXT. CEMENT YARD - DAY

           We are in a cement yard in the LA area.  A lot of dirt, a 
           bunch of cement mixers.  WORKERS doing the loading, the 
           mixing.  None of it looks particularly fun, but it is good, 
           solid, honest work.

           Among the workers, we see BOBBY GREEN - 29, black - driving 
           one of the cement mixers.  Backing it into position for a 
           fill.  Again, no big thing.  It(cid:146)s not brain surgery, but he 
           clearly does a very good job of handling what is a large and 
           unwieldy vehicle.

           I/E. CAR - LATER

           We are now in a car with Bobby.  Day done, he(cid:146)s driving home, 
           driving the streets of South Central LA. 

           INT. CORNER MARKET - DAY

           A small, mom and pop-type market you(cid:146)d find on almost any 
           corner in the city.  There is a young KOREAN man - a guy in 
           his twenties - working the counter of the store.  By a door 
           to the backroom there is an OLDER KOREAN MAN - a guy in his 
           fifties, most likely the younger man(cid:146)s dad.

           Bobby enters the store, makes his way around, gets some 
           bread, some milk...  Staple items.  As he collects them, he 
           looks at the price, shakes his head in mild disgust.  

           As he(cid:146)s getting the last of his food, the door to the joint 
           opens and a few, young BANGER-LOOKING BROTHERS roll into the 
           space.  Bobby doesn(cid:146)t pay them much mind as they enter.

           Bobby crosses to the counter, sets down his food and starts 
           to go for his wallet.  As he takes it out, he mutters 
           absentmindedly:

                                 BOBBY
                        Planning on bringing down your prices at 
                        all?  What I(cid:146)m paying for milk, most 
                        people pay for a steak.

           The young Korean working the counter doesn(cid:146)t respond.  Bobby, 
           finally, looks up.  He sees that the young man isn(cid:146)t even 
           paying attention to him, but rather his attention is fixed on 
           something behind Bobby.  Bobby looks behind himself.  The 
           Banger-Looking Brothers are all standing behind Bobby toward 
           the back of the store.  One of them has his hand at his 
           waist, under his shirt.  All of them look like they might 
           mean trouble.

           Bobby looks back to the young man at the counter.  Bobby 
           notices that the young man(cid:146)s hand is below the counter, 
                           LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   7.

           perhaps gripping something.  Something like a gun, but we 
           can(cid:146)t tell for sure.  The guy(cid:146)s got a nervous look to him, 
           like if he(cid:146)s got a gun he might be too jittery to shoot 
           straight.

           Bobby now looks to the older man standing at the back 
           doorway.  He too grips something JUST BEYOND THE FRAME OF THE 
           DOOR.  We can(cid:146)t see what it is, but if you guessed shotgun, 
           you(cid:146)d probably be guessing correct.

           And standing at the heart of this triangle is Bobby.  If 
           things got hectic, he would definitely take a bullet.

           There is a long, tense moment as everybody eyes each other.  
           They(cid:146)re like a bunch of gunfighters waiting for the toll of 
           the noon bell.  Waiting....  Waiting...

           And just then, the door to the store opens.  A couple of 
           uniformed cops - DAN NEE and LISA PHILLIPS (BOTH WHITE) enter 
           the store.  If they at all notice the tension, it doesn(cid:146)t 
           show.  They go to the cooler, get some bottled water.  Nee 
           takes the water to the counter while Phillips hangs back, 
           eyes the Banger-Looking guys.   

                                 PHILLIPS
                        You gentlemen shopping or you(cid:146)re just 
                        hanging out?  (cid:145)Cause if you(cid:146)re just 
                        hanging out you(cid:146)re done for the day.

           At the counter, the Young Korean man reaches for Nee(cid:146)s water.  
           Indicating to Bobby:

                                 NEE
                        You can finish ringing him up.

           The Korean man finishes with Bobby as the Banger-Looking guys 
           exit.  Throughout all of this Nee and Phillips remain cool, 
           professional.  We get the idea, at their best, cops really do 
           keep the peace.

           I/E. CAR - EVENING

           Bobby driving home.  The framing is similar to when he was 
           driving to the store, only now Bobby owns a vacant empty 
           stare.  He knows what kind of shit he just about got in the 
           middle of, and it(cid:146)s an ugly, ugly feeling.

           Bobby pulls into the drive of a house in South Central.  
           Small but nice.  Evidence that some people are trying to make 
           South Central an area worth living in.  Bobby sits a long 
           beat, takes a few deep breaths.  Tries to relax.

           Suddenly there is a loud BANG as a B-ball hits the side of 
           the car.  Bobby gives just the hint of a shudder, but 
           recognizes what it is right away.
                           LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   8.

           Bobby EXITS the car and greets a few YOUNG BOYS who are 
           shooting hoops just off to the side of the drive.  One of the 
           boys, Mr., is Bobby(cid:146)s son.  As Bobby approaches the boys, he 
           seems agitated.

                                 BOBBY
                        What are you doing, Mr.?  What are you 
                        doing?

                                 MR.
                        ...shooting hoops...

                                 BOBBY
                                   (brightening)
                        You call that shooting the ball?  Lemme 
                        have it.

           Mr., now with a matching smile, tosses his father the ball.  
           Bobby, holding the groceries in one hand, takes a shot at the 
           basket and misses badly.  Lightly teasing:

                                 MR.
                        You missed.

                                 BOBBY
                        One hand.  You see I(cid:146)m only using one 
                        hand.  Two hands, I could make that shot 
                        from Santa Monica.  Where(cid:146)s your mom?

                                 MR.
                        Inside.

           As he heads inside:

                                 BOBBY
                        You don(cid:146)t go off the block, alright Mr.?  
                        And when I say it(cid:146)s time to come in, you 
                        come in.

           INT. HOSPITAL/ER - DAY

           We are in a hospital ER.  We see JOSEPH DU - a Korean man in 
           his early thirties - being examined by an ER NURSE who puts 
           the final touches on bandages and wrapping which dress 
           Joseph(cid:146)s wounds.  To say the least, Joseph looks real bad.  
           I(cid:146)m not talking about the cuts, the bruises, the drying 
           blood...  The guy looks like he(cid:146)s got a hole in his soul.  He 
           looks as though, even though the gun pointed at him was never 
           fired, part of him was shot dead.  There are TWO DETECTIVES 
           with him from the 77th ST Station who attempt to question 
           Joseph.  Joseph(cid:146)s so beat up, drugged up as to be barely 
           coherent.  In the BG, close, but not really the center of 
           attention, are Joseph(cid:146)s parents HUNG and SOON JA DU.

                                 77TH DETECTIVE
                        How many of them were there?
                           LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   9.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Ten.  Twelve.  ...At least ten.

                                 77TH DETECTIVE
                        All black guys?  None, uh, Hispanics or--

                                 JOSEPH
                        They were black.  All of them.

                                 77TH DETECTIVE #2
                        All twelve of them come into the store?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Three or four.  Like they were going to 
                        buy something...  Just walked around.  
                        Then, one of them goes to the door and 
                        he...  Then a bunch more of them come 
                        running into the store...

                                 77TH DETECTIVE
                        And then what?

           INT. EMPIRE LIQUORS - FLASHBACK

           Coming into this scene, it seems as though we(cid:146)re shooting 
           AGAINST A WALL.  We see Joseph(cid:146)s face - beaten and bloody - 
           slamming into the wall.  Or so it seems.   But then a foot 
           presses against Joseph(cid:146)s neck.  THE CAMERA ROTATES and we see 
           now Joseph is actually on the floor and a YOUNG MARKET BANGER 
           has got his foot pressing Joseph down.

           THE FRAME WIDENS and we see we are actually in a smallish 
           corner Korean market, the kind you find all over Los Angeles.  
           THIS IS EMPIRE LIQUORS.

           POV - JOSEPH

           He looks up, sees the Market Banger towering over him.  
           Market Banger(cid:146)s got a nine mil gun in his hand pointing right 
           down at Joseph.  To Joseph(cid:146)s eye, it looks like a canon.

                                 MARKET BANGER
                        Stay down.  Motherfuckin(cid:146) choon!  Stay the 
                        fuck down!

           Joseph starts to raise his head.  He gets it shoved down by 
           Market Banger(cid:146)s foot.

                                 MARKET BANGER (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        I ain(cid:146)t fuckin(cid:146) around.  Move, I take your 
                        goddamn fish head right the fuck off!

           There are SEVERAL OTHER BANGERS in the store.  They(cid:146)re not 
           just robbing the place.  They(cid:146)re tearing it apart.  This 
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   10.

           isn(cid:146)t just about stealing money.  This is about committing 
           violence for the sake of violence.

           INT. HOSPITAL/ER - CONTINUOUS

           The conversation continues among Joseph and the Detectives.

                                 77TH DETECTIVE
                        Lemme tell you something about your 
                        neighborhood, about where you(cid:146)re at; 
                        highest crime rate in the city.  In the 
                        entire city of LA.  It(cid:146)s sick with 
                        bangers.

                                 77TH DETECTIVE #2
                        Main Street Crips.

                                 77TH DETECTIVE
                        Almost a thousand felonies...I(cid:146)m talking 
                        in one year: a thousand felonies, five 
                        murders, nine or ten rapes, two hundred 
                        robberies...  That(cid:146)s in thirty two blocks.  
                        Thirty two blocks around your liquor 
                        store.    

           INT. 77TH STREET STATION - DAY

           We see Joseph at a police line up.  Joseph still shows the 
           signs of a beating, BUT HE DOESN(cid:146)T LOOK NEARLY AS BAD AS HE 
           DID IN THE HOSPITAL.  The point being, WE(cid:146)RE FLASHING FORWARD 
           A BIT IN TIME.  Joseph stands with the Detectives looking 
           through a TWO WAY GLASS at a line of young black guys of a 
           similar build and look.  Among them is the Market Banger.

           In the BG, identifiable, but not readily so, BRUCE HAGERTY, 
           head of detectives for 77th St.  He(cid:146)s a white guy, forties.  
           Seems a decent sort.

                                 77TH DETECTIVE (V.O.)
                        We(cid:146)re trying to put a hurt on these guys.  
                        If you could ID a few of them, that would 
                        get us to the rest of them.  We(cid:146)re talking 
                        about an opportunity to put down maybe a 
                        dozen bangers at one time.  
                        That(cid:146)s...that(cid:146)s serious street cleaning.

           INT. HOSPITAL/ER - CONTINUOUS

           We are back in the ER.  The conversation continues among 
           Joseph and the Detectives.

                                 77TH DETECTIVE 
                        How many times has your place been hit up?  
                        Eight times?  Ten times?
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   11.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Maybe...maybe thirty.

           The Detective looks to Hung and Soon Ja.

                                 77TH DETECTIVE #2 
                        That your Mom and Dad?  They work in the 
                        store, too?  Look, these thugs; they(cid:146)re 
                        coming back.  You testify or not, they(cid:146)re 
                        coming back around.  Maybe you can handle 
                        (cid:145)em.  You(cid:146)re young.  You(cid:146)re tough.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I(cid:146)m...I(cid:146)m not tough.

                                 77TH DETECTIVE
                        Your father, your mother; if it had been 
                        one of them instead of you...

           The thought hangs with Joseph.

           INT. KTLA/LOS ANGELES/NEWSROOM - DAY

           We are in the very active newsroom of KTLA, a Los Angeles 
           television station.  

           As we come in we see KTLA newsman STAN CHAMBERS talking with 
           ROSALVA SKIDMORE.  They are approached by WARREN CEREGHINO, 
           the station(cid:146)s News Director.  Warren looks concerned as hell.

                                 CEREGHINO
                        Stan, got a minute?  I want you to look at 
                        something.

                                 CHAMBERS
                        What is it?

                                 CEREGHINO
                        Do me a favor; just take a look.

           INT. KTLA/EDIT ROOM - LATER

           We are in an edit bay at KTLA. On a monitor plays the 
           Holliday tape - the tape of King being beaten by the cops.  
           In the room are Cereghino, Chambers, Skidmore an EDITOR and a 
           FEMALE PA who are all watching the tape.  None can quite 
           believe what they(cid:146)re seeing.

                                 CHAMBERS
                        Where(cid:146)d you get this?

                                 CEREGHINO
                        Guy called up.  Caught it with his home 
                        video camera.  Looking to make a buck.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   12.

                                 CEREGHINO
                        He tried them.  They didn(cid:146)t pick up the 
                        phone.

                                 SKIDMORE
                        Look at the guy on the ground.  He still 
                        has Taser wires in him.

                                 FEMALE PA
                        They Taser him, they beat him...

           Briseno delivers the kick to King(cid:146)s head that keeps him 
           still.

                                 EDITOR
                        ...Jesus...

                                 CHAMBERS
                        Anybody count how many--

                                 FEMALE PA
                        Twenty.  I see about twenty cops--

                                 CHAMBERS
                        How many times the guy gets hit?

                                 SKIDMORE
                        At least forty.

                                 EDITOR
                        It(cid:146)s closer to sixty.

                                 CEREGHINO
                        Roll it back to the top and count.

                                 FEMALE PA
                        I(cid:146)ve seen enough.  I(cid:146)m done.

           As the Editor rolls back the tape, the PA exits.  The tape 
           starts to roll again.  At the head the focus slips in and 
           out.

                                 CHAMBERS
                        What(cid:146)s going on there?

                        Camera(cid:146)s got an auto focus.  Low light, 
                        from a distance; takes a second for the

           The editor rolls it again.

                        Looks like he(cid:146)s rushing the cops.

                        He(cid:146)s just stumbling.  He(cid:146)s drunk.

                        I think we need to give the department a 
                        chance to comment.

                        Can you break off a copy?

                                 EDITOR
                        Yeah.  Warren, how much of this do you 
                        want for broadcast?

                                 CEREGHINO
                        I can(cid:146)t tell what(cid:146)s going on up top.  Give 
                        me everything after focus locks.

                                 EDITOR
                        That(cid:146)s about...ten seconds in.

                                 CEREGHINO

           INT. EMPIRE LIQUORS - DAY

           We see Joseph Du working at the store, stocking shelves...  
           Something innocuous.  The phone rings, and with little 
           thought he answers it.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Empire Liquors.

                                 BANGER (V.O.)
                        Nobody told you to get in our shit, 
                        motherfucker.  You want trouble?  Now we 
                        gonna fuck your bitch ass up!  You dead, 
                        bitch!

           Very abruptly, as if anything could be more abrupt than the 
           previous one-sided conversation, the phone hangs up.  And 
           Joseph, well, he looks as if someone just walked on his 
           grave.

           INT. DU(cid:146)S HOUSE - EVENING

           We are in a modest house in the valley.  Nice, but hardly 
           grand.  We come in on the Du family - Joseph, Hung and Soon 
           Ja in the middle of a heated fight.  Really, it(cid:146)s Joseph and 
           Hung who do most of the fighting.  Soon Ja kinda keeps to 
           herself as the argument rages around her.  Hung slips in and 
           out of English and Korean.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Sell it!  Sell the store!

                                 HUNG
                        I(cid:146)ve tried.  I(cid:146)ve tried for how long, and 
                        nobody wants to buy it.

                                 SOON
                        Stop it!

                                 JOSEPH
                        What does that say?  Nobody else wants to 
                        be down there, but you want to stay.  I(cid:146)m 
                        not going back.  I(cid:146)m not going back to get 
                        robbed again, to get beaten again.

                                 SOON
                        Nobody(cid:146)s going to beat you.  Don(cid:146)t argue.  
                        Please!

                                 HUNG 
                        That store gives us everything.  And 
                        everything we have here is better than 
                        where we came from.  ...If you don(cid:146)t work, 
                        we(cid:146)ll lose it.  We(cid:146)ll lose all this.  You 
                        don(cid:146)t care what happens to us?

                                 JOSEPH
                        You don(cid:146)t care!  You don(cid:146)t care what 
                        happens to me!

                                 SOON
                        I(cid:146)ll work at the store.  We(cid:146)ll close for a 
                        few weeks, and then I(cid:146)ll work there--

                                 JOSEPH
                        So the blacks can come and beat you, kill 
                        you?  

                                 SOON
                        It will be okay.  It will.  I(cid:146)ll work at 
                        the store, you rest some...  Then we(cid:146)ll 
                        decide something after.  No more fighting.  
                        I don(cid:146)t...I don(cid:146)t want this.  Okay?

           Soon, pleading, looks back and forth between her men.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   15.

                                 SOON (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Okay?

                                 JOSEPH
                        You going to let her do it?

           Hung hesitates, but there is no way he(cid:146)s closing down.  
           Joseph gives a look, and if looks could kill his father would 
           be little more than a stain.  Joseph leaves the room.  Hung 
           and Soon Ja remain for a moment.  Finally, Hung turns to Soon 
           Ja.  Accusatorially:

                                 HUNG
                        You see?  You see how you raised him to 
                        be?

           INT. PARKER CENTER - EVENING

           We(cid:146)re in a meeting room in Parker Center, the LAPD police 
           headquarters.  In the room are Chambers, Lt. and  ASSISTANT 
           CHIEF ROBERT VERNON - leader of the infamous LAPD God Squad - 
           and DEPUTY CHIEF MATTHEW HUNT.  There seems to be some 
           competitiveness between Vernon and Hunt, Vernon continually 
           asserting himself over Hunt.  They(cid:146)ve all just finished 
           watching the tape.

                                 VERNON
                        It looks shocking, I admit.  But I want to 
                        stress we don(cid:146)t know anything about the, 
                        the circumstances--

                                 HUNT
                        This is the first we(cid:146)ve--

                                 VERNON
                        I(cid:146)m making that point.  It(cid:146)s impossible to 
                        say if the force used was appropriate or 
                        excessive.

                                 HUNT
                        Stan, the environment you(cid:146)re dumping this 
                        tape into can(cid:146)t absorb it.  I know you(cid:146)re 
                        doing us a favor--

                                 VERNON
                        Quite the favor; broadcasting a tape like 
                        this out of context.

                                 HUNT
                        South Central, Compton, Watts, East LA; 
                        people there already think the PD is 
                        nothing but a hit squad, if we deserve it 
                        or not.  You want to report this, I 
                        understand.  But you show this tape--
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   16.

                                 CHAMBERS
                        The tape(cid:146)s the story.

                                 VERNON
                        What(cid:146)s the story?  Do you know what 
                        happened out there?  Do you know what the 
                        perp did to the cops?

                                 CHAMBERS
                        Do you?  Do you know if he was a 
                        perpetrator, or a victim?

                                 VERNON
                        That(cid:146)s your version of being objective?

                                 CHAMBERS
                        We counted fifty-six blows over a minute 
                        and half.  This man was apparently Tasered 
                        prior to that, and a kick to the head 
                        finished things off.  Unarmed, on the 
                        ground; none of that(cid:146)s excessive to you?

                                 HUNT
                        We(cid:146)d like a chance to rebut the tape in 
                        the broadcast.

                                 CHAMBERS
                        Absolutely.  On camera, if you want.

                                 HUNT
                        We(cid:146)re going to investigate this, Stan.  
                        We(cid:146)re going to take this all the way.  
                        Wherever it goes, it goes.  I mean that.

                                 VERNON
                        And when it comes back to clear our boys, 
                        I expect equal play.

           VIDEO

           We see the KTLA 10 PM news broadcast from March 5th, 1991.  
           We(cid:146)ve got Stan Chambers showing the Holliday tape and 
           commenting on what(cid:146)s being shown.

           INT. MARK FABIANI(cid:146)S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

           We are in the house of MARK FABIANI, the Deputy Mayor.  We 
           see him coming out of his living room, TV ON IN THE BG.  He 
           takes the phone from his WIFE who then floats back into the 
           room to check out what(cid:146)s playing on the news.

           On the other end of the line is one of Fabiani(cid:146)s AIDES.

                                 FABIANI
                        This is Mark.

                        Mark?  Scott.  Did you see it?

                                 FABIANI
                        Just the tail end; the department giving 
                        denials.  What(cid:146)s, what was the--

                                 FABIANI AIDE (V.O.)
                        Cops, at least fifteen of them; they got 
                        this guy on the ground--

                                 FABIANI
                        Black guy?  He was black--

                                 FABIANI AIDE (V.O.)
                        They(cid:146)re beating him.  He(cid:146)s on the ground, 
                        and they(cid:146)re going at him...it(cid:146)s like 
                        target practice.

                                 FABIANI

                        Goes on for almost two minutes, Mark.  All 
                        on video, start to finish.

                                 FABIANI
                        Has the mayor seen it?

                                 FABIANI AIDE (V.O.)
                        We(cid:146)re trying to get a copy for him.

                                 FABIANI
                        Get some copies, get them down to City 
                        Hall.  We(cid:146)ve gotta start putting together 
                        a response...

           Mark checks his watch.

                                 FABIANI (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        It(cid:146)s going to be wallpaper talk show and 
                        there(cid:146)s going to be hell to deal with.

                                 FABIANI AIDE (V.O.)
                        I(cid:146)ll call you as soon as I(cid:146)ve got 
                        something.

                                 FABIANI
                        Call me at the office.

           The Aide hangs up.  Fabiani literally holds the phone for a 
           long beat.  He knows the next move is going to be a difficult 
           one.  Then, calling off to his wife:

                                 FABIANI (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        I(cid:146)ve got to head downtown.

           I/E. FABIANI(cid:146)S CAR - LATER

           Fabiani is driving through the night for Downtown LA.  As he 
           does, he FIDDLES WITH THE CAR RADIO.  There is a quick wash 
           of music, sports...  No talk of Rodney King.  For the moment 
           that seems like a good thing.  Then he switches to AM radio.  
           Again, some music.  Then as he surfs, we hear a Tavis Smiley-
           type radio talk show IN PROGRESS.

                                 CALLER (V.O.)
                        I think this is a good thing.  Nothing 
                        good, you know, about a brother getting 
                        beat.  But we know this stuff is happenin(cid:146) 
                        all the time.  The police are doin(cid:146) it, 
                        and the police ain(cid:146)t doin(cid:146) nuthin(cid:146) about 
                        it.  Then you got that Oriental chick that 
                        got killed in Westwood...

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Karen Toshima.

                        Whatever.  She took a bullet and the cops 
                        are all over that.  But a brother; they 
                        will beat him in the street and not care 
                        nuthin(cid:146) about it.  This been goin(cid:146) on and 
                        goin(cid:146) on and what not, now they got it on 
                        tape. 

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Uh-huh.

                        Now they ain(cid:146)t gonna be able to say it 
                        don(cid:146)t happen.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        I think the bigger thing is; now that we 
                        have this visual evidence...as you said we 
                        know.  People in the community know this 
                        happens all the time.  Now the police have 
                        to admit it, Darryl Gates has to admit it.  
                        Tom Bradley has to admit it.  We elected 
                        him to be our Mayor, you know what I(cid:146)m 
                        saying?  Now we are going to see if he(cid:146)s 
                        up to the job.  And if he(cid:146)s not up to 
                        it...maybe he needs a new job.

           Fabiani turns off the radio.  He keeps driving, looking very 
           vexed as he goes.

                        They beat me so bad I couldn(cid:146)t pay 
                        attention to what they were saying...they 
                        struck me across the face with a billy 
                        club.  I was scared, scared for my life.

           We see LAPD POLICE CHIEF DARYL GATES standing before 
           reporters commenting on the events of the beating.

                                 GATES
                        I recognize it is your policy to come down 
                        out of the hills and shoot the wounded, 
                        but...  What really disturbs me is that 
                        you sound like a group of foreigners.  I 
                        read your editorials and it tells me you 
                        don(cid:146)t know anything about this fine 
                        department.

           We see an angry CITY COUNCILMAN going off on the beatings.

                        We demand that those policemen be fired, 
                        but not only fired but sent to jail.  
                        Prosecuted and sent to jail!

           We now see MAYOR TOM BRADLEY talking with the press.

                                 BRADLEY
                        I can promise that there will be 
                        appropriate action taken against the 
                        officers.  This is something that we

                        Terry(cid:146)s new to SID, but he(cid:146)s good.  I want 
                        him in front of this.  Got us a conviction 
                        on that Priest of Porn.  He learns to 
                        button down his emotions he might end up 
                        sitting in this chair one day.

           White takes this as the backhanded compliment it is.

                                 FABIANI
                        Did you see the Mayor(cid:146)s comments this 
                        morning?

                                 WHITE
                        See him promise the city we(cid:146)re going to 
                        get a conviction?  Might as well have 
                        promised we(cid:146)re going to get rid of 
                        earthquakes and traffic on the four-oh-

                                 FABIANI
                        The Mayor meant what he said.  I didn(cid:146)t 
                        see anything in that tape to convince me 
                        this was anything but a beating.  We 
                        cannot allow the, uh, the people who did 
                        this to just--

                        Beyond that, the FBI(cid:146)s already opened an 
                        investigation on the civil rights end.

                                 FABIANI
                        The Mayor sees this as a city issue.  He 
                        is not going to allow for a, a whitewash 
                        by the police department.  This has got to 
                        be ours, Ira.  We can use this and finally 
                        get that son of a bitch Gates out of his 
                        post.

                                 REINER
                        I think the only intention here is to not 
                        let these cops walk.

                                 WHITE

                                 FABIANI
                        This is about taking control of the police 
                        department.  We can(cid:146)t vote Gates out of 
                        office, we can(cid:146)t pull him out.  It has 
                        become a goddamn hit squad over there.

                                 WHITE
                        All the more reason not to turn Rodney 
                        King into politics.

                                 FABIANI
                        And the only way Gates goes is if we force 
                        him out.

                                 WHITE

                        I think going into this we need to decide 
                        which cops we can make the best case 
                        against.  This can(cid:146)t be another 39th and 
                        Dalton.  And I can promise you whatever 
                        defense the officers involved put up is 
                        going to be an attack of the victim.  What 
                        do we know about this Rodney King...

           We see a quick, RAPID CUT MONTAGE of Rodney King robbing a 
           small, Monterey Park grocery store using nothing but a tire 
           iron - AS WITH THE VIDEO OF KING BEING BEAT, WE SHOULD NOT BE 
           ABLE TO COMPLETELY MAKE OUT THE INDIVIDUAL PORTRAYING KING.  
           We see King threaten the CLERK with the tire iron, and try to 
           grab money from the register.

           Now we see the CLERK BEATING KING BACK with three foot rod.  
           We get the idea that as a crook, King isn(cid:146)t a very good one.

                                 YOCHELSON (V.O.) (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        He(cid:146)s not necessarily going to help himself

           EXT. EMPIRE LIQUORS - DAY

           We see LATASHA HARLINS - a young girl about fifteen year old - 
           walking the street.  She(cid:146)s got a backpack slung over her 
           shoulder.  She(cid:146)s in her own space, lost in her own thoughts.  
           She walks INTO Empire Liquors.

           SUPERIMPOSE: MARCH 16th, 1991

           INT. EMPIRE LIQUORS - CONTINUOUS

           We are inside the store.  Soon Ja is at the counter.  She is 
           helping, young black children - a BOY, 9, and a GIRL, 13 - 
           who are buying a thing of hair gel for their mother.  When 
           Latasha enters, Soon Ja gives her a wary, slightly nervous 
           look.  We get the feeling Soon Ja is perhaps making some pre-
           judgements concerning Latasha.

           No matter what Soon Ja is thinking, her opinions are 
           solidified when she sees Latasha go right to the back of the 
           store, open a cooler, take out a SMALL CONTAINER OF ORANGE 
           JUICE and stuff it into the side pocket of her backpack.

           Latasha then heads toward the front of the store.  She moves 
           at a brisk pace, but to get to the counter or to make her way 
           from the store?  The question really can(cid:146)t be answered 
           because as soon as Latasha gets near the counter Soon Ja says 
           to her quite harshly: 

                                 SOON
                        Are you trying to steal my juice?

                                 LATASHA
                        No.

                                 SOON
                        You trying to steal my juice!

           Latasha demonstrating the money in her hand:
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   24.

                                 LATASHA
                        I(cid:146)m trying to pay for it!

           Soon Ja doesn(cid:146)t seem to notice or care a thing about the 
           money.  She grabs Latasha by her sweater.

                                 LATASHA (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        You better let me go, Bitch!  

                                 SOON
                        Bitch?  You(cid:146)re bitch!  Trying to steal my 
                        orange juice!

           Soon Ja pulls Latasha(cid:146)s backpack free.  In response Latasha 
           PUNCHES Soon in the face.  Hard.  A couple of times.  Soon 
           Ja, calling off:

                        Hung!  Hung, help me!  Hung!

           Soon Ja grabs up a chair from behind the counter, throws it 
           at Latasha.  It(cid:146)s a rather inept throw and Latasha easily 
           sidesteps it.  Latasha moves again for Soon Ja.  

           From behind the counter Soon pulls a gun.

           Latasha, being very wise, starts to move away.  Move away 
           from Soon Ja and out of the store.  And at almost the instant 
           Latasha turns her back, Soon Ja FIRES THE GUN.  Once.  But 
           one BULLET TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD is all that(cid:146)s needed to do 
           the job.  Latasha falls to the ground.  Lifeless.  Money 
           still in her hand.

           Soon Ja looks dazed, confused.  The Boy and the Girl take the 
           opportunity to run the hell away as Hung enters.  

           Soon Ja speaks as though she(cid:146)s lost in a fog:

                                 SOON (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Where is the girl?

           Hung stares at the body on the floor, blood now just 
           beginning to pool, but doesn(cid:146)t reply.

                                 SOON (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        She was just here.  The girl was here.  
                        Where is the girl?

                                 HUNG
                                   (in Korean)
                        (What happened?  Tell me what happened?)

                                 SOON
                        The girl...she was just--

                                 HUNG

                                 SOON
                        (The girl tried to steal the money.  She 
                        hit me.  She hit me...)

           Soon slumps back behind the counter.  Hung stumbles to the 
           phone, dials...

                                 911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Nine-one-one.  What(cid:146)s you emergency?

                                 HUNG
                        We got a hold up.  My wife shot the robber 
                        lady.

           INT. GREEN HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

           We see Bobby Green watching a news broadcast on TV of the 
           Latasha Harlins shooting.  VERA is sitting next to him - 
           Bobby(cid:146)s got his arm around her.  And Vera needs to be held.  
           What she sees on TV repulses her.  Their son wants to know:

                                 MR.
                        What did they do to that girl?

                                 VERA
                        Go in the other room.

                                 BOBBY
                        Stay here, Mr.

                                 VERA
                        What?

                                 BOBBY
                        I want him to stay.

                                 VERA
                        Go to your room.  Go now!

           Mr. looks confusedly from his mother to his father.

                                 VERA (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Your mother says go, you go.

           Mr. moves quickly out of the room.

                                 BOBBY
                        What is that; (cid:147)your mother says go, you 
                        go?(cid:148)  I still have some say in this house.

                                 VERA
                        He doesn(cid:146)t need to see that.

                                 BOBBY
                        The hell he doesn(cid:146)t.  He needs to be 
                        aware.

                        He is ten years old.

                                 BOBBY
                        This girl Latasha Harlins was fifteen. 
                        When trouble comes it don(cid:146)t ask for an ID.  
                        I am not going to raise a black man who 
                        does not know what he(cid:146)s up against every 
                        single--

                        You are going to raise a boy who is going 
                        to be scared to death of everything around 
                        him.

                                 BOBBY
                        Aware.  Not scared, aware.  That girl 
                        walked into a store to buy some juice, 
                        they shoot her in the back of the head.  
                        Do you know...

           Bobby grabs up a copy of the Times.

                                 BOBBY (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Did you read this?  That girl(cid:146)s mom--

                                 VERA
                        Latasha.  She had a name.

                                 BOBBY
                        Her mom was shot same as she was; right in 
                        the head.  Latasha wanted to go to school, 
                        be a lawyer--

                                 VERA
                        I read it.

                                 BOBBY
                        She wanted to be a lawyer so she could put 
                        thugs and killers in jail.  She ended up 
                        laying face down on some dirty floor in 
                        her own blood. 

                                 VERA
                        I read it!  Our son doesn(cid:146)t need that.  He 
                        will get that for the rest of his life.  
                        He doesn(cid:146)t need it now; he doesn(cid:146)t need to 
                        see more blacks getting killed, or Rodney 
                        King getting beat, or black men in

                        can get ahead is rapping or dancing or 
                        putting a ball in a hoop.  He needs--

                                 BOBBY
                        What?  What does he need?

                                 VERA
                        To turn on the TV one time and see 
                        something...something positive.

           Bobby picks up the remote, makes a big show of switching 
           channels.

                                 BOBBY
                        What?  What are we supposed to show him?  
                        What the hell is there?  Want to see some 
                        happy, pretty black people?  You got the

                        getting ready to take that off TV.

           Vera grabs the remote out of Bobby(cid:146)s hand and tosses it down.  
           She(cid:146)s not messing around.

                                 VERA
                        Our son needs to see something real.

                                 BOBBY
                        It(cid:146)s LA.  Blacks getting beat, getting 
                        robbed, getting killed...  That(cid:146)s real, 
                        baby.  That(cid:146)s real.

           I/E. CAR - DAY

           We see PAUL JEFFERSON, a black man wearing a white T-shirt, 
           driving his car.  Just driving, minding his own business.  As 
           he drives, a POLICE CAR with TWO COPS pulls up behind him.  
           It doesn(cid:146)t close on Jefferson, just maintains a relative 
           speed and distance.  But even in that, in the shadow it 
           casts, there is some menace.  Jefferson both takes note of 
           and ignores the police car.  His attitude toward them, it 
           seems, is: if you(cid:146)re going to do something, do something.  
           Otherwise I have things to accomplish.  But it is in ignoring 
           the police car that Jefferson seems to court greater enmity 
           from the occupants.  We get the sense they are almost waiting 
           for Jefferson to make the slightest of infractions so that 
           they can pull him over.  Is this another Rodney King in the 
           making?

           Then, the PASSENGER COP in the COP CAR picks up the mike of 
           the car(cid:146)s radio, talks into it - WE CAN(cid:146)T HEAR WHAT HE(cid:146)S 
           SAYING FROM OUR POV.  The driver hits the LIGHTS AND SIRENS 
           and pulls off.  Jefferson just watches them go with as little 
           concern as he(cid:146)d previously displayed. 

           Jefferson PULLS INTO THE PARKING LOT OF THE FOOTHILL POLICE 
           STATION.  He gets out of the car, goes around to the back and 
           takes a shirt which his laying on the back seat.  The shirt 
           is the top of a police uniform.  As Jefferson puts it on, we 
           see that Jefferson is actually a CAPTAIN WITH THE LAPD.  
           Jefferson begins to move toward the station house.

           INT. FOOTHILL STATION/HALLWAY - DAY

           Hunt is outside of McBride(cid:146)s office along with Jefferson,.  
           Both look a touch aggravated as if they(cid:146)ve been left cooling 
           their heels a bit too long.  As the men wait, UNIFORM COPS 
           pass.  White Cops.  They throw Jefferson a wary look.  
           Jefferson doesn(cid:146)t acknowledge them.  He(cid:146)s used to stares.  
           CAPTAIN TIM MCBRIDE who is in command of Foothill Division 
           opens the door.  To both men:

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Sorry to keep you waiting.  How are you, 
                        Matt.

                                 HUNT
                        Good, thanks.  Tim, this is Captain 
                        Jefferson.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Captain.

           The two men shake hands.  As they do we make a HARD CUT TO:

           INT. FOOTHILL STATION/OFFICE - DAY

           We are in McBride(cid:146)s office.  At the moment he, along with 
           Jefferson, are listening to Hunt.  McBride puts up a game 
           face, but we can tell he doesn(cid:146)t care for the subject of the 
           conversation.

                                 HUNT
                        Changes need to be made; it(cid:146)s that simple.  
                        We have to show the people it(cid:146)s not 
                        business as usual.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        Well, I think the thing--

                                 HUNT
                        Paul being brought in isn(cid:146)t a reflection 
                        on you, or what happened with your cops--

                                 MCBRIDE
                        I think it(cid:146)s about perspective.   All the 
                        media and the activists; they(cid:146)re calling 
                        for this thing and that.  And when you 
                        start second guessing procedure because of 
                        some talk--

                        Twenty cops, they can(cid:146)t arrest one man 
                        without it turning into a lynching?  A cop 
                        like Powell never should have been allowed 
                        on the streets--

                                 MCBRIDE
                        You look at his record over the last eight 
                        months, Powell had led this division in 
                        arrests--

                                 JEFFERSON
                        Excessive force, unprofessional conduct 
                        complaints...  You think I(cid:146)m going to come 
                        up here and not read the jackets?  

                                 MCBRIDE
                        And you(cid:146)re cop enough to know; write a 
                        parking ticket you(cid:146)re asking for a 
                        lawsuit.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        The night of the King beating Powell was 
                        tested on proper use of his baton.  He 
                        failed.  Two hours before he used it on 
                        King, he couldn(cid:146)t use it in a controlled 
                        environment.  And you let him go back in 
                        the bag?  And I(cid:146)ll tell you the same as I 
                        told Matt; I(cid:146)m not coming here for photo 
                        ops the Department can point to and say 
                        problem solved; we(cid:146)ve got one of them up 
                        there.

                                 HUNT
                        Tim, this transfer is coming from the 
                        Chief.

                                 MCBRIDE
                        I understand that.  And appreciate your 
                        suggestions--

                                 JEFFERSON
                        They(cid:146)re not suggestions.  I(cid:146)ve got command 
                        of patrol, and I(cid:146)ve got the backing of the 
                        Chief.  We(cid:146)ve got to make changes to the 
                        way we do policing while we(cid:146)ve still got 
                        any credibility left with the civvies.  
                        Work with me, or watch it happen, so you

           We are in the office of MARK FABIANI, the Deputy Mayor of the 
           City of Los Angles.  Only, he(cid:146)s not in the office right now.  
           Vernon is there.  He looks quite impatient as he sits and 
           waits.  Finally, Fabiani breezes in.

                                 VERNON
                        I asked for a meeting with the Mayor, not 
                        his deputy.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   30.

                                 FABIANI
                        Gates doesn(cid:146)t want to talk with Bradley, 
                        what makes you think Bradley wants to talk 
                        to you?

           Beat.  Fabiani gives a look like (cid:147)what?(cid:148)

                                 VERNON
                        What is all this crap Bradley is throwing 
                        around on TV; he(cid:146)s lost confidence in 
                        Gates?  The Mayor promised the Christopher 
                        Commission would be an independent inquiry 
                        into the Department.  How is there-- 

                                 FABIANI
                        It(cid:146)s the Mayor(cid:146)s opinion--

                                 VERNON
                        How is it going to be independent when the 
                        Mayor is passing judgements?

                                 FABIANI
                        His opinion is his own, not the 
                        Christopher Commissions.  And in his 
                        opinion, for the good of the city Chief 
                        Gates needs to step aside. He doesn(cid:146)t have 
                        the confidence of the people, he doesn(cid:146)t 
                        have the confidence of his own rank and 
                        file--

                                 VERNON
                        You and the Mayor are stabbing him in the 
                        back.  You are planting lies about the 
                        Chief to take away the focus from your own 
                        culpability.

                                 FABIANI
                        How do you link the Mayor to a...a 
                        lynching by a gang of cops--

                                 VERNON
                        You cut the budgets, you nickel and dime 
                        us, then we(cid:146)re to blame for not having the 
                        tools to keep the peace.  In the name of 
                        the Lord, Mark, have some dignity.  Let 
                        the Commission do its work.

           Fabiani, getting hot around the collar:

                                 FABIANI
                        Seventeen choke hold deaths in six years, 
                        thirteen of the victims black.  Let me 
                        tell you something, Vernon: I(cid:146)ve had it up 
                        to here with all the goddamn excessive 
                        force complaints, and all the litigation 
                        against the department...  You all do what 
                                 (MORE)
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   31.

                                 FABIANI (CONT’D)
                        you please at Parker Center, we get stuck 
                        writing the checks.

           Fabiani goes to his desk, snatches up some papers.

                                 FABIANI (CONT’D)
                        We got six months of transcripts of police 
                        messages.  Seven hundred of them are 
                        filled with racist, sexist, homophobic 
                        filth.  

                                 VERNON
                        Out of how many thousands of 
                        communications--

                                 FABIANI
                        Cops talking about raping underage girls, 
                        cops talking about committing torture...

                                 VERNON
                        You come up with a couple of problem cops--

                                 FABIANI
                        How many does it take?  Only took four to 
                        beat Rodney King.  Now, the Mayor called 
                        the Chief in here and gave him a graceful 
                        way out.  Retire.  Step aside.  Gates 
                        didn(cid:146)t want to take it.  That was his 
                        mistake.  We(cid:146)re taking this to the Police 
                        Commission.  Those are our boys. You 
                        better tell the Chief things are about to 
                        get worse. 

                                 VERNON
                        It gets worse when the thugs and the 
                        bangers come to realize the only thing 
                        that(cid:146)s been standing against (cid:145)em lost its 
                        nerve.  When that happens you(cid:146)d do best to 
                        load your family on the first thing 
                        heading east.

           INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY(cid:146)S OFFICES/WHITE(cid:146)S OFFICE - DAY

           White is present along with Yochelson.  The pair are pouring 
           through transcripts.

                                 YOCHELSON
                        (cid:147)Gorillas in the Mist...?(cid:148)  What(cid:146)s he--

                                 WHITE
                        That Sigourney Weaver movie.  She(cid:146)s a, a 
                        naturalist living with gorillas in the 
                        jungle.

                                 YOCHELSON
                        I know the movie.  What(cid:146)s Powell talking 
                        about in this transmission?
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   32.

                                 WHITE
                        A disturbance call he(cid:146)d just been on.  A 
                        party.  All black people.

           Reading from a transcript:

                                 YOCHELSON 
                        (cid:147)Sounds almost as exciting as our last 
                        call.  Right out of Gorillas in the Mist.(cid:148)  
                        He(cid:146)s calling blacks Gorillas?  

                                 WHITE
                        It(cid:146)s a smoking gun; it demonstrates his 
                        racial attitudes toward blacks.  

                                 YOCHELSON
                        Powell sees King, as far as he cares 
                        King(cid:146)s nothing but a, a...    

                                 WHITE
                        An animal that needs to get beat into 
                        submission.  I mean, Jesus, Powell; after 
                        the King arrest, he calls into dispatch:
                                   (reading)
                        (cid:147)I haven(cid:146)t beaten anyone this bad in a 
                        long time.(cid:148)  

                                 YOCHELSON
                        He admits it.

                                 WHITE
                        He admits he beat King, he admits he(cid:146)s 
                        done it before, you can hear him laughing 
                        on tape while he(cid:146)s confessing.  He(cid:146)s got a 
                        jacket full of excessive force complaints, 
                        civil suits...

                                 YOCHELSON
                        You talk to Ira about dropping the charges 
                        against Briseno?

                                 WHITE
                        He won(cid:146)t do it.  Bradley wants blood.  Not 
                        a little, a lot, and he wants it from all 
                        four cops.

                                 YOCHELSON
                        And you?

                                 WHITE
                        ...I don(cid:146)t know.  Koon and Powell; Koon 
                        was in charge.  He ordered the beating, 
                        and Powell(cid:146)s the bad lieutenant looking 
                        for a black man to give one to.

                                 YOCHELSON
                        So we(cid:146)ll get some blood from them.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   33.

                                 WHITE
                        I(cid:146)d be all right if all we got was a 
                        little justice.

           INT. DU HOUSE - DAY

           With the Dus - Joseph and Hung - is their attorney CHARLES 
           LLOYD; black, gregarious and a sharp and expensive dresser.  
           Lloyd remains relatively cool through out.  Joseph and Hung 
           are obviously stressed.  Despite the fact that Lloyd is 
           black, Joseph and Hung are very plain with their racial 
           perceptions.

                                 LLOYD
                        The prosecution isn(cid:146)t going to accept a 
                        plea agreement.

                                 HUNG
                        You told them she would plead guilty?

                                 LLOYD
                        What they(cid:146)re looking for--

                                 HUNG
                        Soon Ja will say she is guilty!  She will 
                        say she did it!

                                 LLOYD
                        The deal we offered was a guilty plea with 
                        no time served.  The prosecution won(cid:146)t 
                        accept a plea lesser than Second Degree 
                        murder.  That has a mandatory prison 
                        sentence.

                                 HUNG
                        Soon Ja can(cid:146)t go back in jail.

                                 LLOYD
                        It(cid:146)s not my intention to allow that.

                                 HUNG
                        You know what they did?  Ten days she was 
                        in jail when they arrested her, and 
                        those...they assaulted her.  They, they--

                                 JOSEPH
                        They(cid:146)re going to make an example out of 
                        mom.  Because of that black man that got 
                        beat, now they(cid:146)re going to use mom to make 
                        blacks happy.  That thug girl beat my 
                        mother.  Nobody even cares.  We(cid:146)ve been 
                        robbed, maybe, thirty, forty times.  I(cid:146)ve 
                        been beaten..  They come into the store, 
                        they take things without paying.  I see it 
                        every day.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   34.

                                 LLOYD
                        And you go around telling that to the 
                        papers, it makes it sound like you have a 
                        problem with African Americans.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Blacks have the problem.  They steal what 
                        they can(cid:146)t pay for, and they can(cid:146)t pay for 
                        anything because they(cid:146)re always drinking 
                        and getting high.  This guy Rodney King; 
                        you all go on and on like he(cid:146)s a victim.  
                        He robbed a store just like ours.  He(cid:146)s 
                        out drinking, he(cid:146)s doing drugs, then gets 
                        in a car and speeds... Could(cid:146)ve killed 
                        somebody, and all you talk about is he got 
                        roughed up some by the cops.

                                 HUNG
                        He doesn(cid:146)t mean that.

                                 JOSEPH
                        We(cid:146)re the minorities down here.  Not the 
                        blacks.  But we work hard, we don(cid:146)t cause 
                        trouble...  So we get pushed around 
                        because the (cid:147)minorities(cid:148) think we(cid:146)re weak.  
                        We(cid:146)re not weak.  People are going to find 
                        that out.

                                 LLOYD
                        Know something?  All your (cid:147)those people(cid:148) 
                        nonsense; you need to keep that to 
                        yourself.  You(cid:146)re paying for me, but you 
                        didn(cid:146)t buy me.  And I(cid:146)m not standing 
                        between you and my race just so I can take 
                        your crap.  This isn(cid:146)t about you.  
                        Understand?  This is about getting your 
                        mother a fair trial.  Because she deserves 
                        that.  Fair.  Right now you got the 
                        goodwill of the DA on your side.  I 
                        garuntee the city wants you to testify 
                        more in that gang trial more than they 
                        want to put your mother away.  So you keep 
                        your mouth shut, you listen to me, and 
                        maybe your momma gets to come home.  You 
                        got that?

           Joseph gives a hard stare to Lloyd, but then he softens.  As 
           human as we(cid:146)ve ever seen him:

                                 JOSEPH
                        Everyday we think we(cid:146)re going to die.  
                        Just for selling food and milk and 
                        fruit...  Everyday, and we(cid:146)re just trying 
                        to work.  White people won(cid:146)t do it.  They 
                        won(cid:146)t go down there.  We do.  But they 
                        don(cid:146)t care.  Every person who walks in I 
                        think; are they going to pay and leave, 
                        are they going to pull a gun and kill me?

                        Everyday.  And every night I go home 
                        and...and vomit because I(cid:146)m so scared.  
                        And every morning I get up, and go back to 
                        work, and every person... Are they going 
                        to pay, or are they going to kill me?

           Lloyd absorbs this for one moment, then:

                                 LLOYD
                        That(cid:146)s what you say on the witness stand.

           I/E. BOBBY(cid:146)S CAR - DAY

           We see Bobby Green driving along a street in South Central.  
           We see all the tale tell signs of poverty and decay.  Boarded 
           up buildings, refuse on the sides of the streets.  YOUNG, 
           ABLE MEN out of work.  It is a representation of little or no 
           opportunity.

                                 SUPERVISOR (V.O.)
                        It(cid:146)s not much.  I admit that.  But right 
                        now, the economic environment...  Hell 
                        there isn(cid:146)t one.  Nobody(cid:146)s hiring, 
                        nobody(cid:146)s got jobs, nobody can afford to 
                        buy anything, so business are shutting, 
                        so...

           INT. TRUCKING COMPANY/OFFICE - DAY

           Bobby is now sitting, talking with his SUPERVISOR - a white 
           guy in his late forties.  The Supervisor seems a sympathetic 
           sort as he lays out the realities of the situation for Bobby.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        So, nobody can afford to hire.  A snake 
                        going at its own tail.  I(cid:146)m being honest 
                        with you.

                                 BOBBY
                        ...Yeah...

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        You haven(cid:146)t missed a day of work, you do 
                        your job good.  If there was one man 
                        around I(cid:146)d pay better it(cid:146)d be you.  I(cid:146)m 
                        not trying to, not trying to beat you down 
                        on a salary.  Just saying; if I could 
                        offer more, I would.  But all I can offer: 
                        another couple of months work at the same 
                        rate.

                                 BOBBY
                        If it was just me...  I got a family, a 
                        new baby now that(cid:146)s only a couple of 
                        months old.  I can(cid:146)t--

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        You can(cid:146)t take what(cid:146)s not fair.  You(cid:146)re 
                        only worth what you say yes to.  If you 
                        didn(cid:146)t take what I was offering, I(cid:146)d 
                        understand that.

                                 BOBBY
                        Sure.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        But you(cid:146)ve got to understand if you don(cid:146)t 
                        take it, the next guy will.

           I/E. BOBBY(cid:146)S CAR - DAY

           We again see Bobby driving, taking in his surroundings.  They 
           remain bleak.  Bobby, ambivalent.  In light of the previous 
           conversation we now know why.

                                 SUPERVISOR (V.O.)
                        So, what do you want to do?

           INT. DA(cid:146)S OFFICE/HALLWAY - DAY

           White is walking down the hall, reading through papers.  
           Yochelson runs to catch up with him.

                                 YOCHELSON
                        Terry...!  Verdict came back in the 
                        Latasha Harlin(cid:146)s trial.  Voluntary 
                        manslaughter.

                                 WHITE
                        Manslaughter?  It was murder.  There(cid:146)s no 
                        way in hell she should be--

                                 YOCHELSON
                        It(cid:146)s still a felony count.  Max sentence 
                        eleven years.

                                 WHITE
                        That was not an accidental shooting!  
                        Latasha Harlins was executed.

                                 YOCHELSON
                        Terry, they got the conviction.  Soon Ja(cid:146)s 
                        going to prison.  That goes a long way to 
                        calming people down.  Be happy for that.

           Yochelson starts to walk away.  White gets his attention 
           with:

                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   37.

           INT. DOWNTOWN COURTHOUSE/COURTROOM - DAY

           We are into the sentencing phase of the trial.

           The courtroom is packed with observers.  Many are PRESS and 
           Media.  They tend to be WHITE.  Beyond that, the court is 
           ALMOST EVENLY SPLIT between BLACK and KOREAN, and they are 
           seated on opposing sides of the court.  Terry White is also 
           present, observing.

           Sitting at the defendant(cid:146)s table is Soon Ja along with Lloyd.  
           Soon Ja is looking like a woman defeated.  Sitting behind her 
           in the gallery are Hung and Joseph.  IN THIS SCENE WE FAVOR 
           THE DUS.  IT IS VERY MUCH TOLD FROM THEIR POV.

           At the bench is Judge JOYCE KARLIN - a woman in her forties, 
           but who looks to be in her late twenties.  As we come into 
           the scene, Karlin takes a moment, then addresses the court.

                                 KARLIN
                        Justice is never served when public 
                        opinion, prejudice, revenge or unwarranted 
                        sympathy are considered by the sentencing 
                        court in attempting to resolve the case.  
                        Soon Ja Du will be punished for the rest 
                        of her life.  She will have to live with 
                        the memory of the crime every day.  No 
                        matter what sentence is imposed. . . Mrs. 
                        Du will not be able to make up for the 
                        loss of Latasha Harlins.

           There is an unease which passes among the assembled.  At 
           least those who are black.  There is a feeling from Karlin(cid:146)s 
           tone the sentence will not go the way people thought.  Terry 
           White can hardly believe what he(cid:146)s hearing.

                                 KARLIN (CONT’D)
                        There is no need to have Mrs. Du 
                        incarcerated in order to protect society.  
                        Soon Ja Du is not a danger; a criminal.  
                        She is the lawful owner of a gun kept for 
                        her own protection.  Her participation was 
                        one of circumstances of great provocation, 
                        coercion and duress.  I am sentencing Soon 
                        Ja Du to a suspended ten year term in the 
                        state penitentiary and five years 
                        probation.  In addition the court seeks 
                        four-hundred hours of community service, a 
                        $500 fine--

           That unease now turns to shock and outrage.  A BLACK MAN in 
           the assembled can(cid:146)t contain his disgust.

                                 BLACK MAN #1
                        What the fuck?
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   38.

                                 KARLIN
                        And the cost of Latasha Harlins’s funeral 
                        and medical expenses.

                                 BLACK MAN #2
                        Five hundred dollars?

                                 KARLIN
                        These proceedings are closed.

           The Koreans begin to applaud.  The Harlins family weeps.  
           Blacks become enraged.

                                 BLACK WOMAN
                        Where(cid:146)s the justice?  You call that 
                        justice?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Didn(cid:146)t go your way, doesn(cid:146)t mean it(cid:146)s not 
                        justice!

                                 BLACK MAN #2
                        It(cid:146)s a lynching!  We(cid:146)re not getting 
                        lynched any more!

           Pushing and shoving breaks out between the SOME blacks and 
           SOME Koreans just ahead of an actual brawl.  Joseph is very 
           much in the thick of it.

                                 BLACK MAN #3
                        Where(cid:146)s the motherfucking justice!

           The court goes crazy even as POLICE and BAILIFFS try to 
           separate the factions.  It(cid:146)s a mini-riot.  A harbinger of 
           what(cid:146)s to come.

           EXT. EMPIRE LIQUOR - DAY

           Under the watchful eyes of some UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS who 
           keep dozens of shouting, taunting, jeering PROTESTERS at bay, 
           Hung, Joseph and a few other KOREANS load boxes into a VAN.  
           The store is boarded up.  Clearly it(cid:146)s closing down and the 
           Du(cid:146)s are getting the hell out of Dodge.

           CU - BOBBY GREEN

           We come in fairly tight on Bobby.  As he talks, it(cid:146)s almost 
           as if he(cid:146)s musing to himself.  THE CAMERA WIDENS as he 
           speaks.

                                 BOBBY
                        I hate myself.  Almost do.  Hate myself 
                        for getting so damn twisted up.  The pay(cid:146)s 
                        just okay, no benefits, the hours are 
                        hell...  But I sit there waiting for the 
                                 (MORE)
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   39.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        supervisor to tell me if they(cid:146)ve got 
                        enough work to keep me on for another 
                        month.  Two months.  And while I(cid:146)m 
                        waiting, that(cid:146)s when I go to hell inside; 
                        am I going to be able to make ends?  Am I 
                        going to be able to support us?  Then I 
                        think: what am I tripping over?  Better I 
                        didn(cid:146)t have the job.  Little as I get out 
                        of it, it(cid:146)s plantation work as much as 
                        real prospects.  

           A HAND SLIDES INTO FRAME, runs along Bobby(cid:146)s shoulder.  AS 
           THE CAMERA WIDENS, we see the hand belongs to Vera.  It is to 
           her Bobby is speaking as he sits on the couch IN THEIR HOUSE.  
           Vera slides in next to Bobby, holds her man tight.

                                 BOBBY (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        If I got put out of the job, I could go 
                        look for something somewhere else.  

                                 VERA
                        Go where?

                                 BOBBY
                        Somewhere that(cid:146)s not LA; not South 
                        Central.  

                                 VERA
                        You(cid:146)re not going to leave.  You were born 
                        and raised here.

                                 BOBBY
                        Un-uh.  It wasn(cid:146)t like this.  Now you 
                        can(cid:146)t even go outside for fear of getting 
                        it from the Bloods, the Crips, from the 
                        police, the Koreans you(cid:146)re trying to buy 
                        groceries from...  This what we want for 
                        our kids?

                        What do you want to do?

                                 BOBBY
                        I don(cid:146)t know.

                        I tell you what I don(cid:146)t want; I don(cid:146)t want 
                        to get run off.  That(cid:146)s not how it should 
                        be.  We pick to leave, then that(cid:146)s our 
                        deciding.  But this is our home, our 
                        neighborhood.

                                 BOBBY
                        Nobody else cares.  All the (cid:147)blacks(cid:148) move

                        left.

           EXT. PARKER CENTER - DAY

           It(cid:146)s change of watch.  UNIFORMED COPS are heading into the 
           building ready to start their tours of duty.  Coming from the 
           building are Vernon and Jefferson.  Vernon(cid:146)s got a real 
           paternalistic manner as he talks down to Jefferson.

                                 VERNON
                        I think we can all agree your transfer was 
                        well intentioned, but good intentions 
                        don(cid:146)t always solve problems.  Tim McBride 
                        is a good man--

                                 JEFFERSON
                        McBride needs to go.

                                 VERNON
                        It(cid:146)s a matter of the best way forward.  
                        And right now Chief Gates feels your 
                        presence would be more affective at 77th 
                        Division.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        Foothill(cid:146)s where the problem is.  Gates 
                        wanted me at Foothill.

                                 VERNON
                        The Chief, God bless him, is sometimes 
                        removed from realties on the ground.  I(cid:146)ve 
                        provided him with a, a reality check.

           Jefferson takes a beat, then very plainly:

                                 JEFFERSON 
                        You(cid:146)re a son of a bitch.  You, the whole 
                        command...

                                 JEFFERSON
                        You(cid:146)re going above your stripes.  You 
                        don(cid:146)t have the meat to deal with things, 
                        and the bad cops you give a pass to are 
                        just putting a gun to the head of 
                        everybody in the bag who(cid:146)s trying to do 
                        the job right.  And you can(cid:146)t even give a 
                        damn about them; about your own cops?

                                 VERNON
                                   (cool)
                        You(cid:146)ll want to check in with Mike Moulin 
                        at 77th.  South Central; that(cid:146)s your area.  
                        You should do fine down there.

           I/E. POLICE CAR - DAY

           Phillips and Nee are out on a casual patrol in the South 
           Central area.  As they cruise, a few YOUNG BLACKS on the 
           sidewalk throw out their set, openly taunt the cops.  They 
           are not overly belligerent, they don(cid:146)t do anything illegal, 
           but they make their disdain of the cops felt.

                                 NEE
                        That(cid:146)s pleasant.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Just blowing off steam.

                        Hell they are.  Know what that is?

                        According to our sensitivity training, 
                        disgruntled African American youths.

                                 NEE
                        That(cid:146)s Koon, and Powell and them; they 
                        beat a black man, and we gotta ride around 
                        eating their shit every mile.

                        And do what?  Write a note to their 
                        homeroom teacher, let (cid:145)em know they(cid:146)ve got 
                        no manners?

                        Let (cid:145)em know they can(cid:146)t get away with that 
                        crap.  Throwing up gang signs right in our 
                        faces?  They need to get respect; they 
                        learn it, or we lose it.

           INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY(cid:146)S OFFICE - DAY

           White talks with Reiner and Yochelson.  White is clearly 
           distress by the turn of events.  He displays much passion.  
           This man truly wants to earn a conviction.  He wants justice, 
           and he sees it slipping away.

                                 WHITE
                        This is crap, Ira.  It(cid:146)s bullshit.

                                 REINER
                        I cannot have a discussion if you--

                        It(cid:146)s an unacceptable change of venue.

                        go to retire and die.  A jury packed with 
                        white suburban ex-cops, or family members 
                        of ex-cops will not--

                                 YOCHELSON
                        The issue is all the media covering, being 
                        able to seat a jury pool that hasn(cid:146)t seen 
                        wall to wall Rodney King coverage.

                                 WHITE
                        It(cid:146)s twenty minutes outside of LA.  How is 
                        Simi Valley going to have any less media 
                        bias than the rest of the goddamn city?

                        Do not tell me to check my emotions.  That 
                        line about a tainted jury pool is crap.  
                        Judge Weisberg is moving the trial because 
                        his wife is sick, he wants to be home at 
                        night, and Simi Valley(cid:146)s got the easiest 
                        commute.  Ira, justice is about to get 
                        subverted because of traffic.

                                 REINER
                        That(cid:146)s speculation.  You know what that 
                        buys me in an appeals court?

                        You(cid:146)ve got the media.  What(cid:146)s going to 
                        happen when you start doing the rounds 
                        hollering miscarriage?

                                 YOCHELSON
                        What is going to happen?  After this 
                        Latasha Harlins debacle do you want to 
                        throw fuel on the fire?

                                 WHITE
                        The fire gets lit when those four cops get 
                        acquitted in Simi Valley.

                                 REINER
                        They will not be acquitted.

                                 WHITE
                        You can guarantee that?

                                 REINER
                        Not all four of them.  You look at that 
                        tape...I don(cid:146)t care who you are; you 
                        cannot look at that video and say Koon and 
                        Powell acted within the color of the law.

                                 WHITE
                        Those ten seconds at the top, when it 
                        looks like King is charging the cops--

                                 YOCHELSON
                        Compared to the eighty seconds of the 
                        beating?

                                 WHITE
                        The jury will never have seen that ten 
                        seconds.  Everything they(cid:146)ve been 
                        wallpapering the news with is just the 
                        beating.  The jury gets into the court, 
                        sees maybe King did charge the cops, then 
                        they come off as thoughtful officers 
                        instead of badge heavy thugs.

                                 REINER
                        Christ, Terry.  You want me to wrap the 
                        case in a bow for you?

                                 YOCHELSON
                        I think we(cid:146)re getting ahead of things.  
                        Let(cid:146)s seat the jury first, then see what 
                        we(cid:146)ve got.

           INT. SIMI VALLEY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           IN SUCCESSION, we will see a number of the JURORS who were 
           seated in the Rodney King trial. 

           CU - A TIGHT SHOT OF JUROR NUMBER THREE.

                                 JUROR NUMBER THREE
                        I(cid:146)m a fifty year old white male.  A park 
                        ranger and a member of the NRA.  I think 
                        cops have a hard job, but they do it well.  
                        I(cid:146)m Juror number three.

           CU - A TIGHT SHOT OF JUROR NUMBER TWELVE.

                                 JUROR NUMBER TWELVE
                        I(cid:146)m a sixty-five year old white woman.  
                        I(cid:146)m also a member of the NRA.  I(cid:146)m Juror 
                        number twelve.

           CU - A TIGHT SHOT OF JUROR NUMBER EIGHT.

                                 JUROR NUMBER EIGHT
                        I(cid:146)m a forty-nine year old white male.  I(cid:146)m 
                        also a member of the NRA.  I(cid:146)ve got 
                        nothing but respect for the hard jobs cops 
                        do everyday.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   44.

           CU - A tight shot of juror number two.

                                 JUROR NUMBER TWO
                        I(cid:146)m a forty year old Latina Female.  I(cid:146)m a 
                        hospital worker, but I used to be a 
                        security guard, and I really like the 
                        police.  I have a twelve year old son who 
                        wants to be a policeman one day.  I(cid:146)m 
                        juror number two.

           CU - A TIGHT SHOT OF JUROR NUMBER NINE.

                                 JUROR NUMBER NINE
                        I(cid:146)m a fifty-nine year old white male.  I(cid:146)m 
                        a retired Air Force military police 
                        officer.  I think the police try to do a 
                        good job in difficult times.  I(cid:146)m juror 
                        number nine.

           CU - A TIGHT SHOT OF JUROR NUMBER SIX.

                                 JUROR NUMBER SIX
                        I(cid:146)m a sixty-five year old white male.  I(cid:146)m 
                        a retired Navy vet and a member of the 
                        Shore Patrol.  I think cops have a hard 
                        and demanding job, and I think the LAPD is 
                        a fine organization.  I(cid:146)m juror number 
                        six.

           CU - A TIGHT SHOT OF JUROR NUMBER ONE.

                                 JUROR NUMBER ONE
                        I(cid:146)m a forty-two year old white male.  My 
                        brother is a retired sergeant with the 
                        LAPD.  I love cops.  I(cid:146)m juror number one.

           CU - A TIGHT SHOT OF JUROR NUMBER FIVE.

                                 JUROR NUMBER FIVE
                        I(cid:146)m a fifty-four year old white female and 
                        the daughter of a police officer.  I know 
                        it takes a special kind of person to make 
                        a good officer.  I(cid:146)m juror number five.

           The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see all twelve jurors seated in 
           the jury box.  We see ten white faces.  One Latina  One 
           Filipino-American.  There is not one single black among the 
           jurors.

           INT. CITY HALL/FABIANI(cid:146)S OFFICE - DAY

           MARK FABIANI - the Deputy Mayor - is on the phone with Robert 
           Vernon.  Fabiani seems a bit anxious as if he(cid:146)s starting to 
           realize, down the road, there could be trouble for the city.  
           Vernon, as always, is aloof.  

                                 FABIANI
                        I(cid:146)ve been talking with the DA(cid:146)s office.  
                        The jury that(cid:146)s been seated is 
                        not...favorable.  The Mayor(cid:146)s 
                        concerned...he wants to know there(cid:146)s a 
                        plan for the city.  If there(cid:146)s trouble 
                        should the verdict in the King trial come 
                        back negative--

                                 VERNON
                        The Mayor(cid:146)s got no faith in Reiner?

                                 FABIANI
                        He(cid:146)s preparing for all eventualities.  Is 
                        the department?

                                 VERNON 
                        We are constantly ready.

                                 FABIANI
                        That(cid:146)s nice for the recruiting ads, but do 
                        you have a plan?  Politics and bullshit 
                        aside--

                                 VERNON
                        I don(cid:146)t care for that kind of--

                                 FABIANI
                        The Mayor heads up the EOO.  He(cid:146)s got a 
                        right to be briefed.  Yes, or no; do you 
                        have a plan.

                                 VERNON
                        We were ready for the Olympics.

                                 FABIANI
                        The plan you(cid:146)re using; it(cid:146)s the Olympic 
                        plan?  That was for a terrorist attack.  
                        Something Munich style.

                                 VERNON
                        Yes.

                                 FABIANI
                        So, you(cid:146)ve got an eight year old plan to 
                        protect the city from twelve crazies with 
                        guns.  What happens when the whole city 
                        goes crazy?
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   46.

                                 VERNON
                        As long as your people do their job, Koon, 
                        Powell, Wind and Briseno are going to 
                        jail, and you(cid:146)ve got precious little to 
                        worry about.

           INT. DA(cid:146)S OFFICE/WHITE(cid:146)S OFFICE - EVENING

           As we come in White and Yochelson are in the middle of an 
           argument.

                                 WHITE
                        We can(cid:146)t put Rodney on the stand.

                                 YOCHELSON
                        He wants his day in court.

                                 WHITE
                        He(cid:146)s going to hurt himself more than help.

                                 YOCHELSON
                        If we don(cid:146)t put King on the stand it looks 
                        like were hiding something.

                                 WHITE
                        We are hiding something.  If he(cid:146)s on the 
                        stand, the defense can open a line of 
                        questioning that will go to his past. 
                        Putting him on confirms everything that 
                        jury(cid:146)s been taught to fear in blacks.  He 
                        cannot go on the stand.  
                                   (beat)
                        I want you to take Koon on the cross.

           Yochelson gives an incredulous look.

                                 YOCHELSON
                        I(cid:146)m second chair on this.

                                 WHITE
                        It(cid:146)s not an ego thing.

                                 YOCHELSON
                        Terry, far as I care, Briseno, Wind; they 
                        shouldn(cid:146)t even be part of this.  Powell 
                        was the attack dog.  Koon was the one who 
                        snapped his fingers and let him do work.

                                 WHITE
                        And I go in there, a black man in a 
                        position of authority and I(cid:146)m trying to 
                        put four white men in jail; you think that 
                        jury(cid:146)s going to return guilty verdicts?  I 
                        want Koon, I want that son of a bitch.  
                        But I want him bad enough to know if we 
                                 (MORE)
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   47.

                                 WHITE (CONT’D)
                        got any chance of getting one conviction, 
                        then I need to step to the side.

           White then tries to make a joke, but it comes off more as 
           gallows humor:

                                 WHITE (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Besides, when he does get acquitted you 
                        can take the blame.

           INT. SIMI VALLEY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           The gallery of the court is filled.  There is PRESS and there 
           are SPECTATORS; THEY ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY WHITE.  

           AMONG THOSE IN THE GALLERY IS MARK FABIANI.  WE WILL SEE HIM 
           THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL.  The cops - Koon, Powell and Wind - all 
           sit together with their counsel.  Briseno and his counsel sit 
           separated from the others.

           As we come in, White is questioning LAWRENCE DAVIS, the head 
           nurse at Pacifica hospital where Rodney King was first 
           treated following his beating.

                                 DAVIS
                        My name is Lawrence Davis.  I(cid:146)m a nurse at 
                        Pacifica Hospital.

                                 WHITE
                        The night that Mr. King was brought to 
                        your emergency room; you were on duty.

                                 DAVIS
                        Yes.  Mr. King was brought in by several 
                        police officers.  He was demonstrating 
                        signs of severe trauma.  Broken bones, 
                        contusions, lacerations.  Mr. King was 
                        very anxious.  I was trying to relax Mr. 
                        King, talk with him.  He mentioned he was 
                        an usher at Dodger stadium.

           INT. PACIFICA HOSPITAL - FLASHBACK

           We see Davis treating King.  As before, we don(cid:146)t hang on, and 
           can(cid:146)t really make out King that well.  This is more about 
           Davis and his anxiety around the COPS, several of whom fill 
           the space.  Powell among them.  Their attitudes are very 
           caviler.

                                 POWELL
                        You(cid:146)re an usher?  Boy, I sure hope we 
                        don(cid:146)t ever go to the game and you have to 
                        usher us down to the seats.

           Laughs all around.  Davis looks nervous as he works on King.  
           I mean, cops laughing around a guy they beat the shit out of?
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   48.

                                 POWELL (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Well, we had a pretty good hardball game 
                        tonight, didn(cid:146)t we?  Don(cid:146)t you remember?  
                        Don(cid:146)t you remember the team we were 
                        playing against?

           King doesn(cid:146)t respond.  Powell sneers.

                                 POWELL (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        We won that game, didn(cid:146)t we?  We had quite 
                        a few home runs.

           Again, more laughs from the cops.

           INT. SIMI VALLEY COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           White continues to question Davis.

                                 WHITE
                        What was he talking about; hardball, home 
                        runs?  Winning that game?

                                 DAVIS
                        He was talking about beating Mr. King.

           INT. SIMI VALLEY COURTHOUSE - LATER

           Koon is on the stand.  The guy is the model of arrogance as 
           he(cid:146)s questioned by Defense Attorney DARRYL MOUNGER.

                                 MOUNGER
                        When you arrived at the scene of the 
                        arrest, what did you see?

                                 KOON
                        I saw King surrounded by officers.  He 
                        looked real buffed out.  Very muscular.

                                 MOUNGER
                        In your mind, what was the significance of 
                        Mr. King(cid:146)s size.

                                 WHITE
                        You honor, approach?

           Weisberg nods.  White and Mounger approach the bench.

                                 WHITE (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        You honor, it(cid:146)s obvious where the defense 
                        is going with this.  (cid:147)Buffed out(cid:148) is cop 
                        slang for guys who(cid:146)ve got size from 
                        working out in prison yard.  They(cid:146)re 
                        trying to interject Rodney King(cid:146)s past 
                        record.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   49.

                                 MOUNGER
                        This goes to state of mind of my client.  
                        He approached the situation believing Mr. 
                        King could be an ex-convict.

                                 WHITE
                        Because he was big and black?

                                 MOUNGER
                        On cross you(cid:146)re free to debate with 
                        Sergeant Koon about whether or not his 
                        assumptions were correct.

                                 WEISBERG
                        I believe the line of questioning says 
                        more about Sergeant Koon than it does 
                        about Rodney King.  You may continue.

           White(cid:146)s clearly not happy about this.  He returns to his 
           table.  Mounger goes back to questioning Koon.

                                 MOUNGER
                        You talked about Mr. King looking buffed 
                        out.  What was the significance of that?

                                 KOON
                        Buffed out is jargon I(cid:146)ve come to 
                        associate with being very muscular.  My 
                        initial response was that he was probably 
                        an ex-con.

                                 MOUNGER
                        And he was in fact an ex-convict.

                                 KOON
                        Yes.  He was.

                                 MOUNGER
                        So, walk me through the arrest.  As it 
                        progressed, as you attempted to take Mr. 
                        King into custody.

           As the video ROLLS on a monitor:

                                 KOON
                        I thought the suspect was under the 
                        influence of PCP.  PCP is a dangerous 
                        drug, it(cid:146)s a kinda like a policeman(cid:146)s 
                        nightmare that the individual that(cid:146)s under 
                        this is super strong and they 
                        exhibit...super strength.  Like a monster.

           Mounger points to the video monitor.

                                 MOUNGER
                        You see the officers giving a tort of 
                        blows to his body.  Have you given any

                        specific direction to Mr. King at this 
                        time?

                                 KOON
                        I(cid:146)ve been yelling at him to get down, to 
                        stay down at this time.  He continues to 
                        rise.  So, I(cid:146)m getting concerned, scared 
                        and a little frightened.  This gentleman 
                        had been subjected to a multitude of blows 
                        from metal PR-24 batons, and there was no 
                        evidence he was going to comply.  I 
                        considered using the choke hold on him, 
                        but in Los Angeles the choke hold is 
                        associated with the death of blacks.

                        So really, you only had two options: you 
                        could try to get Mr. King to submit with 
                        the batons, or you could(cid:146)ve shot him.  You 
                        didn(cid:146)t shoot him.  So, do you believe your 
                        officers did anything improper?

                        I know what people see when they look at 
                        the tape.  It(cid:146)s violent, it(cid:146)s brutal...  
                        But sometime police work is brutal.  It(cid:146)s 
                        a fact of life.

           INT. SIMI VALLEY COURTHOUSE - LATER

           Powell is on the stand.  White, as we come in, is sitting at 
           the prosecutor(cid:146)s table.  He(cid:146)s like a fighter between rounds, 
           waiting for the sound of the bell.  THIS, FOR WHITE, IS LIKE 
           THE MAIN EVENT.  This is what he(cid:146)s been waiting for.  He is 
           sharp, he is shrewd...  He very much uses his intellect to 
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   51.

           cut through the BS and get to what Powell is all about.  THIS 
           IS THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.  White rises, crosses to Powell and 
           begins his questioning.

                                 WHITE
                        Officer Powell, when you type something 
                        into the Mobile Digital Terminals, the 
                        MDTs, do you think about it before you 
                        type it?

                                 POWELL
                        That(cid:146)s correct.

                                 WHITE
                        Your fingers don(cid:146)t just go over that 
                        keyboard involuntarily do they?  Your mind 
                        works before your fingers start working, 
                        is that correct?

                                 POWELL
                        Yes....

                                 WHITE 
                        Now, this disturbance call which involved 
                        African Americans - the one you referred 
                        to in the MDT transmission as (cid:147)Gorillas in 
                        the Mist;(cid:148) was it in a jungle, or a zoo?  
                        Were there any gorillas around?

                                 POWELL
                        I didn(cid:146)t see any.

                                 WHITE
                        And the response: (cid:147)let me guess who the 
                        parties be,(cid:148) that wasn(cid:146)t an attempt to 
                        mock urban dialect?

                                 POWELL
                        No.

                                 WHITE
                        Then why did you respond (cid:147)good guess?(cid:148)

                                 POWELL
                        I don(cid:146)t know.

                                 WHITE
                        You don(cid:146)t know?  You sat at this keyboard 
                        in your police car and typed a message and 
                        you don(cid:146)t know where it came from?

                                 POWELL
                        I don(cid:146)t recall.

                                 WHITE
                        You remember details of the Rodney King 
                        beating.  In the frenzy of an arrest, you

                        but in a calm moment you don(cid:146)t know why 
                        you joined in some racist humor.

                                 POWELL
                        It wasn(cid:146)t racist.

                                 WHITE
                        How do you know?  You don(cid:146)t recall.  
                        Officer Powell, after the arrest, why did 
                        you tell the dispatch officer: "I haven(cid:146)t 
                        beaten anyone this bad in a long time?(cid:148)

                                 POWELL
                        That(cid:146)s common police jargon.  Kind of a 
                        professional jargon.

                                 WHITE
                        Professional jargon? So you go up to 
                        another officer and say, "Hey, man.  
                        What(cid:146)s up?  How many people did you beat 
                        today"?

                                 POWELL
                        I don(cid:146)t do that, no.

                                 WHITE
                        But you did it here?  You used the word 
                        "beaten."  And that(cid:146)s professional police 
                        jargon in your mind?  In your professional 
                        police mind, is Mr. King a human being?

                                 POWELL
                        Yes.  Of course.

                                 WHITE
                        Even though he is a suspect and even 
                        though he is suspected of committing a 
                        crime, this man is still a human being, 
                        isn(cid:146)t he?  He wasn(cid:146)t an animal, was he?

                                 POWELL

                                 WHITE
                        If that arrest was by the book, why in 
                        your police report did you exaggerate Mr. 
                        King(cid:146)s actions?  Why did you leave out the 
                        fact that Mr. King was prone, on the 
                        ground during the majority of the beating?  

                                 POWELL
                        Sergeant Koon had asked that I do so.

                        When he tells me to do things and I feel 
                        they(cid:146)re reasonable, then by all means you 
                        do them or you are in trouble.

                                 WHITE
                        And you don(cid:146)t want to get in trouble.  So 
                        when Sergeant Koon tells you to beat a 
                        man, you beat him!

                                 POWELL
                        That is not a question that can be

                        is it?  If there was excessive force used 
                        that night, you wouldn(cid:146)t testify here in

           We see Bobby outside playing hoops with his son.  As he 
           plays, WE HEAR A RADIO REPORT detailing the trial 
           proceedings.  The news reports says that the trial(cid:146)s going

           MARK JACKSON is a young man of color, twenty-nine years old.  
           He(cid:146)s trying to do right, trying to live right.  Trying to be 
           a father figure to his younger half brother.  Right now he(cid:146)s 
           working at a stereo repair shop and drives a beat up van with 
           the company(cid:146)s name stenciled - poorly - on the side.  He 
           pulls the van up into the drive of the house, gets out, 
           starts to unload his tools. ON THE VAN(cid:146)S RADIO WE PICK UP THE 
           NEWS REPORT ON THE RIOT TRIAL. 

           DAMIAN WILLIAMS, nineteen, is Mark(cid:146)s half brother.  At the 
           moment Damian is across the street from him talking to a 
           banger in a pimped out ride - TRYNON JEFFERSON, AKA PSYCHO.

           As Damian and Psycho talk, Mark throws a couple of looks in 
           their direction.  We get the feeling Mark isn(cid:146)t real happy 
           about Damian hanging with the likes of Psycho.

           Without hesitation, Mark pulls a PIPE out of the back of his

           INT. 77TH STREET STATION/WATCH COMMAND - DAY

           Moulin is at the command with his Assistant Watch Commander 
           TERRY TATREAU - white female, thirties.  Detective Hagerty 
           enters.  He seems just a bit anxious.

                                 HAGERTY
                        Lou, got a sec?  We(cid:146)ve been tracking 
                        some...threats.  A couple of calls, 
                        bangers probably.  They(cid:146)re mouthing off 
                        how if the cops walk there(cid:146)s going to be 
                        trouble; they(cid:146)re going to try and hit us 
                        up.

                                 MOULIN
                        You...you have leads on any--

                                 HAGERTY
                        I think it(cid:146)s mostly bullshit, but I(cid:146)m 
                        saying it(cid:146)s out there.  So do we...is 
                        there any kind of a plan from the top if 
                        things get out of control?

           Moulin thinks a moment.

           INT. 77TH STREET STATION/JEFFERSON(cid:146)S OFFICE - LATER

           Jefferson is at his desk when Moulin enters.

                                 MOULIN
                        Captain, we(cid:146)re getting some rumblings 
                        there might be trouble if the cops walk in 
                        Simi Valley.  Does Parker Center have any 
                        plans?

           Jefferson thinks a moment.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   57.

           INT. 77TH STREET STATION/JEFFERSON(cid:146)S OFFICE - LATER

           Jefferson is on the phone with Hunt.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        We(cid:146)ve got intelligence that indicates gang 
                        bangers are planning to strike back 
                        against cops in response to the King 
                        verdict.  Are you guys doing any riot 
                        preparations

           Hunt thinks a beat.

           INT. METRO DIVISION/HILLMANN(cid:146)S OFFICE

           Hunt enters.  In the office is MIKE HILLMANN, the Command 
           Lieutenant of LAPD(cid:146)s Metro division.  The man is forthright.  
           A good cop.

                                 HUNT
                        Mike, I need to set a meeting with you, 
                        some of the other command staff.  We need 
                        to review any plans that we have 
                        for...unusual occurrences.  

                                 HILLMANN
                        Earthquakes, terror attacks...?

                                 HUNT
                        A riot.

                                 HILLMANN
                                   (beat)
                        Okay.  How soon do you want the meeting?

                                 HUNT
                        Now.

           INT. PARKER CENTER/CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           We(cid:146)ve got Vernon, Hunt, Hillmann, Jefferson, A PD COMMANDER, 
           ANOTHER DEPUTY CHIEF and Fabiani gathered.  There is much 
           factionalism going on here.  On one side are Hillmann, Hunt 
           and Lewis who seem to want to be proactive.  Vernon and 
           Frankle are cautious.  Fabiani just doesn(cid:146)t want any trouble.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        ...In addition to the threats we(cid:146)re 
                        tracking from various gangs, we(cid:146)ve got a 
                        group called the Revolutionary Communist 
                        Party calling for open revolt if there are 
                        any acquittals.  Something called the 
                        Gay/Lesbian Action Network is planning 
                        demonstrations...
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   58.

                                 VERNON
                        What in God(cid:146)s name do the queers have to 
                        be upset about?

                                 JEFFERSON
                        Are you asking a question, or are you 
                        answering your own? 

                                 HILLMANN
                        Look, from Metro(cid:146)s stand point the best 
                        way to handle a riot is to keep it from 
                        getting started.

                                 HUNT
                        A city wide Tac alert on the day?

                                 DEPUTY CHIEF
                        The Chief has already vetoed that.  He 
                        thinks it will put people more on edge 
                        than ease tensions.

                                 FABIANI
                        It(cid:146)s the Mayor and the city council(cid:146)s 
                        contention the Department do as little as 
                        possible to incite people.

                                 HILLMANN
                        The incitement will be the verdicts.  In 
                        response we(cid:146)ve got to have a timely show 
                        of force.  As the verdict approaches, 
                        Metro should be in hard patrols from ten 
                        hundred through eighteen hundred hours.  
                        Both the department(cid:146)s APCs should be 
                        deployed in South Central--

                                 FABIANI
                        Armored personnel carriers; that(cid:146)s what 
                        we(cid:146)re...  You(cid:146)re sending the wrong signal 
                        to the community.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        Exactly how much time do you spend in (cid:147)the 
                        community?(cid:148)  

                                 HUNT
                        I think we need to defer to the uniforms 
                        on this.  We(cid:146)ve got cops on the street, 
                        they understand the mood of the people--

                                 FABIANI
                        Your cops are the reason we(cid:146)re sitting 
                        here right now.

           Reading from a memo:

                                 DEPUTY CHIEF
                        The AR-15s you(cid:146)re requesting--
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   59.

                                 HUNT
                        What page are--

                                 DEPUTY CHIEF
                        Putting your men on patrol with military 
                        hardware...  I think we can agree that(cid:146)s 
                        unacceptable.

                                 HILLMANN
                        You(cid:146)re asking our cops to engage in a 
                        situation where they(cid:146)re going to be at a 
                        severe statistical disadvantage.

                                 FABIANI
                        Automatic rifles are not an appropriate--

                                 HILLMANN
                        Hold on a second.  They(cid:146)re going to be at 
                        a disadvantage, and the show of force has 
                        got to be...no one should question it.

                                 DEPUTY CHIEF
                        We have just one cop pull one of those and 
                        start laying down fire...then we(cid:146)ll be 
                        talking about a riot.  

                                 VERNON
                        I think what would be the wise decision; 
                        keep the heavy weaponry at the Metro Vault 
                        downtown--

                                 HILLMANN
                        So, if there(cid:146)s a situation, you(cid:146)ll have my 
                        Metro cops, my SWAT cops all drive 
                        downtown, sign out their weapons, drive in 
                        mid-day LA traffic back to the incident, 
                        and then start enforcing the law?

           Long beat.  Then Vernon starts to backtrack.

                                 VERNON
                        I would allow the rifles in the patrol 
                        cars, but I want them locked in the 
                        trunks.  I do not want them visible.  I(cid:146)m 
                        with the Mayor(cid:146)s office on that one.  And 
                        deploying Metro before nineteen hundred 
                        hours...riots don(cid:146)t happen during the day. 
                        These people are cowards; they run around 
                        lighting fires at night when they think 
                        they can disappear back into the dark.

                                 HILLMANN
                        We handle tactical emergencies; it(cid:146)s what 
                        Metro Division does.  Crime suppression, 
                        SWAT...  Why have us involved in the 
                        planning if you(cid:146)re going to blunt our

                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   60.

                        effectiveness and override us on every 
                        point?

                                 VERNON
                        Metro is the plan.  

                                 JEFFERSON
                        The cops on the street need more than a 
                        chant for Metro.  You bounced me down to 
                        77th, so at least do me the favor of 
                        listening to what(cid:146)s going on down there.  
                        There is confusion, zero communication 
                        between the Division and Parker Center.

                                 VERNON

                        Metro needs to keep the peace.  They need 
                        to be a calming presence.

                        They(cid:146)re cops.  We need to use them like 
                        cops.  Not, not like some--

                        It(cid:146)s not a joke.

                        It(cid:146)s goddamn not a joke.

                        You do not use that kind of--

                        Thomas, shut up!  Shut up!  I(cid:146)m telling 
                        you, all of you: Soft tactics, trying to 
                        throw a hug on the problem; you(cid:146)re not 
                        putting off trouble.  You(cid:146)re asking for 
                        it.

                        opinions, not make demands.  Bear that in 
                        mind, should it come to crisis, we(cid:146)ll 
                        avoid a world of confusion.  Metro will be

                        in reserve until they(cid:146)re called up.
                                   (pointed, to Fabiani)
                        I speak for the Chief when I say that(cid:146)s 
                        how it(cid:146)s to be done.

           INT. CITY HALL - DAY

           We(cid:146)ve got Fire Chief DONALD MANNING on the phone with 
           Hillmann.  Hillmann is calm, but concerned.

                                 MANNING
                        This is Manning.

                                 HILLMANN
                        Chief, this is Mike Hillmann with LAPD 
                        Metro.

                                 MANNING
                        Mike, how are you?

                                 HILLMANN
                        Well, to be honest, Chief, I(cid:146)ve got some 
                        concerns I want to share with the fire 
                        department.  I think there is a very 
                        strong possibility if there(cid:146)s an acquittal 
                        in Simi Valley there could be...there(cid:146)s a 
                        real chance of some unrest.

                                 MANNING
                        ...All right...

                                 HILLMANN
                        And I(cid:146)m not sure that the PD(cid:146)s going to be 
                        in a containment position.  Do you 
                        understand?

                                 MANNING
                        Yeah, I understand.  And I appreciate the 
                        heads up.  But, if it comes to it, there(cid:146)s 
                        not much we can do except our jobs.

                                 HILLMANN
                        I have no doubt.  But I want you to be 
                        aware there(cid:146)s the potential for, uh, 
                        physical injury.  If there(cid:146)s anything 
                        Metro can do to give your men support, 
                        anything we can do ahead of an event, I(cid:146)ll 
                        make sure you(cid:146)ve got everything you need 
                        to do the job.

           Manning thinks for a beat.

           INT. FIREHOUSE - DAY

           We(cid:146)ve got firefighters - among them Captain CARL BUTLER, 
           KELLY KILMARTIN, and ALONZO WILLIAMS (Williams is a black 
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   62.

           man).  At the moment Butler is opening one of several boxes 
           that have been delivered to the house.  From the box he pulls 
           some body armor.  A flack jacket.  As the rest of the firemen 
           stare at this disquieting delivery with much apprehension, 
           Williams mutters:

                                 WILLIAMS
                        ...Oh, shit...

           INT. SIMI VALLEY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Terry White is delivering his closing arguments.  He is full 
           of passion which he allows to build as he speaks.  He looks 
           for, he seeks justice.

           SUPERIMPOSE: APRIL 20th, 1992 - CLOSING ARGUMENTS IN THE 
           TRIAL OF PEOPLE V. POWELL ET AL

                                 WHITE
                        According to the defense everything Mr. 
                        King did was aggressive.  We went through 
                        this video on cross-examination, every 
                        point aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, 
                        so they continued to use their batons.  
                        What could this man do not to be 
                        aggressive?  Did he have to be 
                        unconscious?  Did he have to melt into the 
                        pavement to not be aggressive?  And at 
                        some point you have to look at that video 
                        and say enough is enough.  Stop.  This is 
                        not right.  But they continued to hit him.  
                        I issue a challenge to the defense to play 
                        this videotape for you and to point out 
                        things in this tape that justify the 
                        continued use of the baton.  I don(cid:146)t think 
                        they(cid:146)ll do it because they are afraid of 
                        the videotape.  They(cid:146)re afraid because 
                        they know what that videotape shows. Now 
                        who are you gonna believe the defendants 
                        or your own eyes?  Koon and Powell hid 
                        behind the very badges that they wear.  
                        What these officers say in here 
                        implicitly, if not explicitly, is that 
                        they are immune from prosecutions.  And 
                        I(cid:146)m here to tell them, and they should 
                        know that no man - not Rodney King, not 
                        Stacey Koon, not Ted Briseno, not Timothy 
                        Wind and not Laurence Powell...

           Stepping from the podium, pointing directly to Powell, filled 
           with righteous emotion:

                                 WHITE (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        This is the man!  Look at him.  This man 
                        laughed, this man taunted...
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   63.

                                 WEISBERG
                        Mr. White, get back to the podium.

                                 WHITE
                        This man--

                                 WEISBERG
                        Confine your arguments to the podium.

                                 WHITE 
                        This man laughed.  What was funny out 
                        there?  You don(cid:146)t need to be an expert to 
                        look at that video and say that is wrong.  
                        That is bad.  That is criminal. 

           INT. SIMI VALLEY COURTHOUSE - LATER

           We now see Stone giving his summation.

                                 STONE
                        There were many opportunities I suppose 
                        for these officers to avoid the risk and 
                        the threat to his own personal safety that 
                        was occasioned by the incident that they 
                        confronted that night.  But they stood 
                        their ground.  And as a result they are 
                        sitting here, as a defendants, before this 
                        jury.  These are not Robocops, ladies and 
                        gentlemen, they hurt, they feel pain, they 
                        bleed and they die just like everyone 
                        else.  And we leave it to them to take 
                        care of the mean streets.  So that we can 
                        safely enjoy our lives.  I decline the 
                        challenge to play the video again.  You 
                        can play the video all you want.  
                        Backwards, forwards, slow motion...  It(cid:146)ll 
                        be available for you as a piece of 
                        evidence.  I(cid:146)ve seen it enough and I think 
                        you have too. 

           MONTAGE

           WE SEE THE SUN RISES to the east of downtown illuminating the 
           city as it lights up downtown Los Angeles.

           SUPERIMPOSE: WEDNESDAY, APRIL 29th, 1992

           We see bits of life in and around Los Angeles.

           We see COMMUTERS stuck in traffic on the 405.

           We see STUDENTS unloading off a school bus, heading for 
           class.

           We see Bobby Green driving his truck.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   64.

           We see a FILM CREW setting up for a shot.

           We see RICHARD RHEE, a Korean store owner, opening his shop 
           for the day.

           We see Mark Jackson working at his stereo repair shop.

           INT. METRO DIVISION/HILLMANN(cid:146)S OFFICE - DAY

           Hillmann(cid:146)s behind his desk, doing paperwork.  A COP enters.

                                 METRO COP
                        Just got the word from Simi Valley.   
                        Jury(cid:146)s got a verdict.  They(cid:146)re going to 
                        read it at three this afternoon.

           Hillmann just kinda nods.  The cop starts to exit.  Hillmann 
           suddenly pulls him back with:

                                 HILLMANN
                        I want to schedule a meeting with the 
                        watch commanders.  I want everybody on the 
                        same page if we(cid:146)ve got issues.  Get it 
                        together by five.  I want the meeting 
                        before sundown.

           INT. SIMI VALLEY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           As we come in, the JURY FOREMAN is responding to the charges 
           as they are read.  Again, and again we hear the words: (cid:147)not 
           guilty(cid:148)  Emotion creeps into the cops(cid:146) expressions, 
           particularly Koon and Powell.  They(cid:146)ve beaten this rap, and 
           they know it.

           INT. 77TH STREET STATION - SIMULTANEOUS

           COPS in the station watch as the verdicts are read on TV.  
           And as they do, as they hear (cid:147)not guilty(cid:148) again and again, 
           the cops get POSITIVELY GIDDY with themselves.  Mike Moulin 
           is there.  He ain(cid:146)t happy about things.  As the cops laugh, 
           Moulin looks on with great apprehension.  Finally:

                                 MOULIN
                        What are you all yelling for?  You think 
                        there(cid:146)s one thing good about them getting 
                        off?  ...Shit!

           EXT. TRUCKING COMPANY - SIMULTANEOUS

           Bobby, along with CO-WORKERS, is listening to the verdicts 
           being read on a small television.  Among the mixed employees 
           there is a muted reaction.  No one is sure what to say, or 
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   65.

           what to do.  Except for Bobby.  He starts to head off with 
           alacrity.

           INT. JACKSON/WILLIAM(cid:146)S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Mark watches with Damian and OTHER YOUNG BLACK MEN.  None of 
           them can believe what they(cid:146)re hearing.  They mock the TV, but 
           Mark is most pointed.  Most direct:

                                 MARK
                        That shit is fucked up.

           INT. PAY-LESS LIQUOR - SIMULTANEOUS

           We are inside one of the many Korean groceries in South 
           Central.  The owner, MR. LEE, watches the as the verdicts are 
           read on TV.

           INT. DA(cid:146)S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Reiner watches the verdicts being read along with a few other 
           STAFF in the DA(cid:146)s office.

           EXT. SIMI VALLEY COURTHOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

           We see Terry White, with Yochelson just over his shoulder, 
           giving a post-verdict press conference.  Though he tries to 
           control himself, we see more passion in him than we have seen 
           previously.  The time for being objective has passed.  White 
           needs to speak his mind.

                                 WHITE
                        My reaction is shock first, then 
                        disappointment.  We feel the evidence 
                        warranted a conviction of the defendants.  
                        The jury disagreed with us.

           INT. 77TH STREET STATION - SIMULTANEOUS

           Moulin is starting to get tense.  We can read it on his face, 
           by his body language.  He crosses to Tatreau.

                                 MOULIN
                        Did Gates put out a tactical alert?

                        The jurors chose to ignore and disregard 
                        the fundamental issue: The issue of a 
                        brutal, vicious felonious assault against 
                        Rodney King, and the defendants are 
                        walking out as heroes.

           An anxious CPD LIEUTENANT crosses to his superior, the PATROL

                        Should we delay shift change; maybe hold 
                        some cops over.  Keep (cid:145)em on duty?

                                 PATROL COMMANDER
                        Did the Chief say anything about it?

                                 WHITE
                        The fact that maybe 12 white jurors are 
                        not going to convict four white cops; it 
                        may be as basic as that.

           Vernon and Hunt watch Bradley(cid:146)s address.  Vernon shakes his

                        He might as well just start singing

           Five young, BLACK KIDS are cruising the store.

                                 WHITE (V.O.)
                        All I can say for sure: This sends out a 
                        message that whatever you saw on that tape 
                        was reasonable conduct.

           The kids start grabbing up a bunch of Malt liquor bottles, 
           they walk for the door.  Clearly with no intention of paying.   
           Lee steps up, blocks the door.

                                 DAVID LEE
                        Hey, you gotta pay for those.  Somebody(cid:146)s 
                        gotta pay.

           One of the youths takes a liquor bottle, swings it, smacks 
           Lee in the HEAD with a sickening thud.  It sends Lee to the 
           floor with a bleeding gash on his head.

           Another Teen - SEANDEL DANIELS - hurls a bottle at the glass 
           door and yells:

                                 DANIELS
                        This is for Rodney King!

           Then it(cid:146)s on.  The Teens start jacking up the joint, throwing 
           around and kicking over and smashing everything in sight.  
           It(cid:146)s so old fashioned wilding as Lee lays on the floor 
           bleeding from a gash to his head.

           Vera is watching a news summation on the verdicts.  As she 
           watches she HEARS the honking of a car horn outside.  
           Quickly, she goes to the door.  Opens it.  

           BOBBY IS OUTSIDE IN HIS CAR.  He yells to Vera:

           block.

           We(cid:146)ve got two LAPD COPS driving on patrol when they get the 
           call for assault going on Pay-Less liquors.

                                 DISPATCH (V.O.)
                        All units in the vicinity: possible 211

                        Two-three victor to dispatch: rolling on 
                        the 211.

           They hit their lights and sirens and roll on the call.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Bobby rolls up on Little Mr. And his FRIENDS who are hanging 
           out on the street.

                                 BOBBY
                        Mr. get in the car.  The rest of you, go 
                        on home to your folks.

           The kids just sit for a moment, not sure what to make of 
           Bobby.  He explodes at the young men:

                                 BOBBY (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Go home!  Go!

           The boys run off for their homes.  Mr. heads for the car.

                                 MR.
                        Why(cid:146)d you do that?

                                 BOBBY
                        (cid:145)Cause there(cid:146)s gonna be trouble.  Get in 
                        the car!

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           The Cops arrive at the scene of the disturbance which has 
           spilled out of Pay-Less into the streets.  What they see is 
           Daniels standing on top of a car beating it with a metal 
           pipe.  He is surrounded by OTHERS who just cheer him on.  

                                 PAY-LESS COP
                        You believe this fucking guy?

           He blips the siren.  Daniels keeps on swinging with his pipe.  
           Finally, Ayala starts to get out of his squad.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   69.

                                 PAY-LESS COP (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Hey!  Hey!

           Now the groups disperse.  Daniels drops the pipe and takes 
           off running.  The first cop runs after him.  The second gets 
           on the Mike.

                                 PAY-LESS COP #2
                        Two-three victor to dispatch, be advised; 
                        we are in foot pursuit heading west on 
                        Halldale.

           He takes off running after the two.

           INT. SOUTHEAST STATION - LATER

           Hillmann arrives for the briefing.  The meeting room, large 
           enough to hold dozens of people, is nearly empty.  A FEW 
           COMMANDERS - among them a JUNIOR GRADE COMMANDER - are in 
           place, but that(cid:146)s it.  Hillmann looks around with 
           incredulity.

                                 HILLMANN
                        What(cid:146)s going on?  Where is everybody?

                                 HILLMANN
                        Get every one of the Commanders back now!

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           The foot chase of Daniels continues until he(cid:146)s finally caught 
           by converging COPS at the corner of Seventy-first St. and 
           Normandie - just blocks from Florence and Normandie.  In all, 
           there are maybe TWENTY-FIVE police officers - black, white, 
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   70.

           Hispanic, male and female - who arrive at the scene of the 
           arrest. 

           Also present a WHITE PHOTOGRAPHER for the NY Times.

           The cops get Daniels down on the ground.  One puts a knee in 
           his back as he cuffs him.  Daniels screams: 

                                 DANIELS
                        I can(cid:146)t breathe.  Hey, yo, I can(cid:146)t 
                        breathe!

           ALL DURING THE ABOVE, a crowd of ON LOOKERS - Black people 
           who live in and around the area - has gradually gathered.  By 
           the time Ayala completes the arrest, there are perhaps one-
           hundred people or more surrounding the cops.  And following 
           the King verdict, they are none too happy and plenty vocal. 

                                 ON LOOKER
                        Don(cid:146)t do him like that!  Hey, you don(cid:146)t 
                        gotta be like that with him!

           Among the crowd, but for the moment being fairly cool, are 
           Mark Jackson and Damian Williams.  One of the BLACK COPS 
           yells to the arresting officers:

                                 BLACK COP
                        Get off him.  Don(cid:146)t make this another 
                        Rodney King!

                                 ON LOOKER #2
                        Get the fuck out of here!

                                 ANGRY TEEN
                        Kiss ass niggas!

           The cops, not in the mood to take shit from the crowd, step 
           up and bust the ANGRY TEEN.  The Teen, screaming at the cops - 
           playing up being roughed up:

                                 ANGRY TEEN (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Kill me!  Why don(cid:146)t you just kill me?

           Looking to make peace, Mark Jackson steps up, tries to get 
           the cops to back off.  They don(cid:146)t care for Jackson getting 
           into things.

           As this is happening, Moulin arrives on the scene with his 
           DRIVER.

                                 MARK
                        He didn(cid:146)t do anything.

                                 ARRESTING COP
                        Back off.

                                 MARK
                        C(cid:146)mon, man.  Let him go!
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   71.

                                 ARRESTING COP
                        You need to step away.

                                 MARK
                        And you need to get off him.

                                 ARRESTING COP
                        You telling me what to do?  You don(cid:146)t tell 
                        me what to do!

           The Cop grabs Mark, starts to cuff him.

                                 MARK
                        What the fuck?  I didn(cid:146)t do nothing.

                                 ARRESTING COP
                        You want to back your homie, you can take 
                        a ride with him.

           The cop is none to pleasant as he secures Mark.  He(cid:146)s 
           downright harsh. Far rougher than he needs to be.  Mark 
           grunts in pain.  That only serves to incite the on lookers 
           all the more.

                                 ON LOOKER #3
                        Cop(cid:146)s gonna die tonight.

                                 ON LOOKER
                        It(cid:146)s Uzi time!

           A GIRL in the crowd, one who has a figurative big mouth on 
           her, starts yelling at Damian.  Begins to taunt him:

                                 BIG MOUTH GIRL
                        Damian, that(cid:146)s your brother!  That(cid:146)s your 
                        brother and you gonna let them do him like 
                        that?  You a bitch!  You a straight up 
                        bitch, Damian!

           We see the girl(cid:146)s words begin to work on Damian like a fist 
           full of razors.

                                 BIG MOUTH GIRL (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        You a bitch!  Nothing but a goddamn bitch!

           That(cid:146)s it for Damian.  Moving like he(cid:146)s fueled by fire, 
           Damian grabs up a rock, hurls it.  It smashes the a police 
           cruiser windshield.  With that, with that bold move, the 
           crowd begins to feel its collective balls.  THE TAUNTING OF 
           THE POLICE IS ELEVATED.  It is joined in physical ferocity by 
           rocks and bottles and...and anything that can be thrown or 
           hurled.  Or spat, from saliva to invectives.  This group is 
           getting real, real nasty.  

           The COPS...  You can see the growing nervousness among them.  
           They are surrounded.  They are out numbered.   They have no 
           riot gear.

           Moulin looks around him.  Things are devolving very, very 
           quickly.  They are going from ugly to horrendous.  Believing 
           he has very little choice, speaking in a slightly trembling 
           voice:

                                 MOULIN
                        ...We need to pull out.

                                 DRIVER
                        We turn our backs, they(cid:146)re gonna go crazy.  
                        We can handle (cid:145)em.

                                 MOULIN
                        We don(cid:146)t have the numbers, we don(cid:146)t have 
                        the equipment.  Pull back!

           The driver doesn(cid:146)t move.  Basically, he(cid:146)s saying (cid:147)no.(cid:148)  Well, 
           then, fuck that.  Moulin goes for his car, for the PA.  Using 
           it to call out to the cops:

                                 MOULIN (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        I want everybody out of the area!  All 
                        personnel, get out of the area!

           The Cops can(cid:146)t believe what they(cid:146)re hearing.  So Moulin tells 
           (cid:145)em one more time:

                                 MOULIN (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Let(cid:146)s go, let(cid:146)s move!

           Moulin gets in his squad car.

           I/E. MOULIN(cid:146)S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Moulin grabs up the radio, puts in a frantic call to Tatreau 
           back at the 77th St. Station.

                                 MOULIN
                        Terry, it(cid:146)s Moulin.  You copy?

                                 TATREAU
                        It(cid:146)s Tatreau.  I copy.

                                 MOULIN
                        We(cid:146)ve got a situation developing.  Get on 
                        the phone to Metro.  We(cid:146)ve got...hundred-
                        fifty, two hundred civvies down here, we 
                        got more coming in and it(cid:146)s getting ugly.

                                 TATREAU
                        Will advise.

                                 MOULIN
                        Terry, make it clear to them: It(cid:146)s going 
                        real south, real fast.  We don(cid:146)t have the, 
                        the equipment to...we(cid:146)re not going to--
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   73.

                                 TATREAU
                        You want a transfer of equipment?  You 
                        want riot gear?

                                 MOULIN
                        I want Metro!  Metro needs to deal with 
                        this.  Get Metro down here.

                                 TATREAU 
                        I(cid:146)m on it.

           EXT. STREET - SIMULTANEOUS

           Cops are loading into their cruisers and RACING off.  They 
           can(cid:146)t get away fast enough.  And the crowd is happy to send 
           them on their way with a shower of rocks and glass as a 
           farewell salutation. 

           But in the exodus the WHITE PHOTOGRAPHER is left behind.  A 
           sole white face among a hostile group.  He realizes the 
           situation is substantially less than good.  He starts to move 
           calmly, but with alacrity to his car.  As he does, he(cid:146)s 
           surrounded by anger members of the crowd.  They taunt him, 
           they taunt him...  Then the Photog gets hit in the face with 
           a two by four.  After that, the crowd fairly attacks him.  

                                 ON LOOKER #4
                        Gimme the camera.  Hey, white boy, gimme 
                        the fucking camera!

           The Photog hands over the camera.  Rather than quell the 
           crowd it just incites them.  THUGS start dancing on his car, 
           start trying to tear the vehicle apart with their hands. 

           Before things can get too much uglier a black man, a 
           SAMARITIN, intervenes; shields Bart from the rest of the 
           crowd.

                                 SAMARITIN
                        You need to keep moving, understand?  Get 
                        in your car and get out of here.

           The Photog does as told, gets in his car and moves off.

           But the crowd is now emboldened with the taste of blood, and 
           Damian is their defacto leader.  He whoops them up, whoops 
           them up.  Drives them to a near frenzy.  FOR THE MOMENT, FOR 
           THE FIRST TIME IN WHO KNOWS HOW LONG, IF EVER, DAMIAN IS A 
           PLAYER AND HE RELISHES HIS MOMENT.  With his troops at his 
           back, Damian moves with the crowd to Florence and Normandie.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Get the Buddha heads and the white boys!  
                        We gonna fuck some people up!

           VIDEO

           It(cid:146)s 5:40 PM.  We see NEWS VIDEO of Chief Daryl Gates 
           speaking to reporters.

                                 GATES
                        ...If we have disturbances, we(cid:146)re 
                        prepared...

           EXT. FLORENCE AND NORMANDIE - SIMULTANEOUS

           We are at the infamous corner of Florence and Normandie.  
           Damian and his troops are now in full effect.  They surround 
           the corner, clock the passing cars.  Any car which is driven 
           by non-blacks becomes the target of vicious fusillades of 
           rocks and bottles...store front signs.  Anything that can be 
           used as a projectile is thrown.  And with each strike there 
           are the requisite whoops and hollers of minor victory.

           INT. METRO/HILLMANN(cid:146)S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Hillmann takes the phone.

                                 HILLMANN
                        It(cid:146)s Hillmann.

                        Lieutenant?  Sergeant Tatreau, 77th.  
                        We(cid:146)ve got a major four-one-five 
                        developing.  We(cid:146)re requesting immediate 
                        deployment of Metro.

                                 HILLMANN
                        C platoon(cid:146)s forming up now.  We can have 
                        them down there within the hour.

                                 TATREAU
                        Lieutenant, I got an urgent call from the 
                        Watch Commander who(cid:146)s at the scene.  He 
                        was real clear that we need Metro now, and 
                        we need more than a platoon.

                                 HILLMANN
                        Who(cid:146)s the Watch Commander down there?

                                 TATREAU
                        Mike Moulin.

                                 HILLMANN
                        This is what I want you to tell Moulin: 
                        SWAT is short by two squads.  One Platoon 
                        is what I can give, and he(cid:146)s going to have 
                        to hold the line until they get there.  
                        And you tell him for me Daryl Gates and 
                                 (MORE)

                        his crew are the reason cops are facing 
                        down a riot with no back up.

           INT. 77TH STREET STATION - SIMULTANEOUS

           6:00 PM - Cops move around like ants with their anthill on 
           fire.  There is chaos, but no control.  In the middle of this 
           a shell shocked Moulin crosses to a panicked Jefferson.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        What happened?  Why did you pull out?  

                                 MOULIN 
                        They had us three to one, we(cid:146)re gonna hold 
                        the line, how?  You need to declare a 
                        tactical alert.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        I can(cid:146)t do that.

                                 MOULIN
                        You(cid:146)re the ranking officer on the scene.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        We activate the entire LAPD...we don(cid:146)t 
                        know what else is going on.  We(cid:146)re 
                        responsible for what(cid:146)s happening down 
                        here.

                                 MOULIN
                        We don(cid:146)t have the men, or the gear to 
                        maintain.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        What the hell is on the side of your hip?  
                        You(cid:146)re telling me your men can(cid:146)t maintain 
                        order with those?

                                 MOULIN
                        We start shooting, it(cid:146)s a massacre.  You 
                        want to authorize that?  

           Tatreau crosses over.

                                 TATREAU
                        Mike...

                                 MOULIN
                        You sure as hell aren(cid:146)t going to hang it 
                        on me!

                        C Platoon(cid:146)s assembling.  It(cid:146)ll take them 
                        an hour to get here.

                                 MOULIN
                        Christ...  I want to start marshalling at 
                        the command post.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        I want you back at the scene--

                                 MOULIN
                        We(cid:146)ll see what kind of numbers we(cid:146)ve got, 
                        then we(cid:146)ll decide what to do.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        Go back there now!  Get your cops and 
                        handle things.  Set up the command post, 
                        but take back that street!

           EXT. 77TH STREET STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Moulin is exiting the meeting with Jefferson.  He looks 
           downright scared.  His driver waits near a squad.

                        What(cid:146)d he say?

                                 MOULIN
                        He...he wants me to assess the situation, 
                        then get the command post operational.

                                 DRIVER
                        Assess?  Stand around, watch people go 
                        crazy?  What good is that?

                                 MOULIN
                        That(cid:146)s what he wants, let(cid:146)s just do it.

           EXT. FLORENCE AND NORMANDIE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Back to Florence and Normandie.  The attacks against passing 
           motorists intensify.  We see NEWS FOOTAGE of a particularly 
           vicious, early attack.  This is followed by the attack on the 
           VACA FAMILY - Manuel, his wife and brother.  Their (cid:145)73 Buick 
           is pelted with rocks and bottles as they try to navigate the 
           intersection.  Manuel, driving, loses control of the car.  
           Crashes it into a pick up truck.  Damian and his crew pulls 
           them from their car and beats them  ALL OF THEM.  Vicious.  
           Blood.  Nasty.

                                 TOM(cid:146)S LIQUOR COP #2
                        That(cid:146)s two miles from here.  This is where 
                        the shit(cid:146)s going down.

                                 TOM(cid:146)S LIQUOR COP
                        Dispatch, where(cid:146)s the order coming from?

                        77th Watch Commander.

           The Cop takes a beat, considers things, then:

                                 TOM(cid:146)S LIQUOR COP
                        Let(cid:146)s go.

                                 TOM(cid:146)S LIQUOR COP #2
                        We go, they’re gonna be right back on 
                        this.

                                 TOM(cid:146)S LIQUOR COP
                        We(cid:146)ve got orders.  Let(cid:146)s go.

           The second cop takes a look around.  On the fringes of the 
           street remain LOOTERS who look as if they are just waiting 
           for the cops to leave so they can get back to...looting.  He 
           doesn(cid:146)t believe for a minute pulling back is the right move.  
           He mutters:

                                 TOM(cid:146)S LIQUOR COP #2
                        ...Shit...

           The cops get back in the squad and pull out.  The moment 
           they(cid:146)re gone, the looters are all over Tom(cid:146)s again.

           EXT. COMMAND POST - MOMENTS LATER

           We are just outside of a large bus yard in the South Central

           EXT. STREET - SIMULTANEOUS

           6:07 PM -  We see a gray car driving.  The driver - a KOREAN 
           WOMAN - moves unaware toward the heart of the growing riot at 
           F&N.  As she does, her car is suddenly thrashed by rocks.  
           They smash into and THROUGH the windshield, showering her 
           with broken glass.  Blinding her, and leaving her with 
           lacerations.  

           The woman, locked in her car, is set upon by a GANG OF 
           YOUTHS, who try to break in, but failing they continue to 
           pelt the car with rocks.

           EXT. STREET - SIMULTANEOUS

           Nee flips the car around, starts heading for Florence and 
           Normandie racing through the streets full tilt boogie.  
           Phillips gets her gun out, has it down, but at the ready.  
           For the cops, it(cid:146)s like running a gauntlet.  Nothing but 
           ROCKS and BOTTLES, PIECES OF CONCRETE coming from everywhere.  
           People actually start chasing the car.  That(cid:146)s how empowered 
           this crowd is.

           As Nee and Phillips roll up on the gray car, as they see the 
           angry mob surrounding it, Nee floors the accelerator.  He 
           literally RUNS PEOPLE OFF WITH THE POLICE CAR before coming 
           to a skidding halt. 

                                 NEE
                        I get the vic, you back me up.  And let 
                        (cid:145)em know you(cid:146)ll kill em.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   81.

           Like a couple of marines hitting a hot landing zone, Nee and 
           Phillips are up and out of the car.  Phillips sweeps her gun 
           before her in an arch ready to put a bullet in any aggressor.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Back off, get back!  I will blow your 
                        fucking head off!  Get the fuck back, now!

           Nee moves quickly for the gray car and rips open the door.  
           Inside is the Korean Woman.  She is a BLOODY MESS.  Head 
           wounds, cuts all over from the trauma.  

                                 NEE
                        Aw, shit...

           Nee grabs her up and moves her from her car as Phillips 
           continues to give cover.  But armed or not, the crowd shows 
           more caution than actual fear of the cops and Phillips cannot 
           keep a gun on all of them at all times.  And the moment she 
           looks away from one section of the crowd, ROCKS and BOTTLES 
           begin flying in.  

           Nee gets HIT BY A ROCK or a piece of concrete.  It catches 
           him in the leg landing with a hard blow.  Nee stumbles, goes 
           down, but maintains his grip on the vic.  Phillips hesitates 
           a second.  Does she keep her gun on the crowd, or does she go 
           to help her partner?

           Phillips holsters her piece.  She lifts Nee, who in turn is 
           still holding on to the vic and gets them both to the car.  
           All the while, the crowd stands ready to strike, but they do 
           not.  

           Phillips gets behind the wheel and tears off.  Nee takes up 
           the mike.

           signs being thrown at passing cars.  The cars swerving to the 
           flying debris, only to crash.  And after they do, the 
           occupants are hauled out and beaten.  

           And leading all this, at the head of the uprising, is Damian.

           EXT. PARKER CENTER - SIMULTANEOUS

           We see an ANGRY CROWD forming outside of Parker Center.  
           Different from the assembled at Florence and Normandie, this 
           crowd is mixed: black, white, Hispanic.  They are angry; 
           chanting, lighting fires...

           EXT. FLORENCE AND NORMANDIE - SIMULTANEOUS

           6:46 PM - A eighteen wheel gravel truck turns toward the 
           intersection.  It moves slowly as it tries to navigate the 
           debris and stopped cars that clog the road before it.  Damian 
           sees the truck approaching, sees that a WHITE MAN is driving.  
           He incites with the cry:

                                 DAMIAN
                        No pity for the white devil!

           A young guy, ANTOINE MILLER, runs for the cab of the truck, 
           pulls open the door and yanks out the driver - REGINALD 
           DENNY.  HENRY WATSON holds down the prone Denny with his 
           foot.  Malcolm X guy, the same one who looted the liquor 
           store, throws a piece of metal at Denny(cid:146)s head.  The impact 
           is violent and ugly.  He then takes a hammer and hits Denny 
           in the head three times.

           really do this to other people in the name of justice?

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Now Damian moves in the for the kill.  As a beaten and 
           confused Denny attempts to crawl to some kind of safety, 
           Damian raises a chunk of concrete into the air.  He holds it 
           up for one nasty moment...  He hurls the chunk dead at 
           Denny(cid:146)s head.  It hits, hits hard.  HITS SO HARD IT LITERALLY 
           BOUNCES OFF OF DENNY(cid:146)S HEAD.  Williams then does what appears 
           to be an (cid:147)end zone(cid:148) dance over the prone Denny.  And 
           following that, various members of Damian(cid:146)s band begin to 
           spit at the downed Denny, shower him with bottles and debris 
           as he lays bleeding.

           INT. GREEN HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Bobby, has seen all he can stomach.  He can not sit by and do 
           nothing no longer.

                                 BOBBY
                        That(cid:146)s enough.

                                 VERA
                        Bobby...

                                 BOBBY
                        You stay here, all right?  Don(cid:146)t leave the 
                        house!

           In a near daze, BOBBY GIVES VERA A HUG, A DEEP KISS, then 
           heads OUT OF THE HOUSE. He gets into his car and starts to 
           drive.  THE CAMERA STAYS WITH HIM AS HE DOES, AND STAYS WITH 
           HIM AS HE DRIVES.

           Bobby heads from his relatively quiet street, through the 
           streets of South Central.  Every block traveled, he sees more 
           and more PEOPLE outside.  At first there are just people 
           standing, looking around.  Then there are people running, 
           both to and from the heart of the action.  Then there are 
           people screaming, yelling whooping and hollering until there 
           is a certain mob mentality that surrounds Bobby.  The 
           situation is beyond queer, as a black man he gets a free pass 
           from the crowd, but as a man on a mercy mission we get the 
           sense the crowd could turn on him in an instant.

           Finally, Bobby arrives at Denny(cid:146)s truck.  He slams on the 
           brakes of his car, gets out, runs passed screaming, taunting 
           ON LOOKERS for the truck...  FOR A BEAT, BOBBY AND DAMIAN 
           SHARE A COLD HARD STARE.  A thug who wants to kill and a man 
           set on being a savior.  Bobby continues for the truck.  Only, 
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   84.

           Denny is no longer there on the ground.  Bobby looks to the 
           cab of the truck.  Denny is slumped inside with a black woman 
           - LEI YULLIE - cradling Denny who is bleeding profusely from 
           his head.

           Screaming at Bobby like she would kill him if he laid a hand 
           on Denny! 

                                 LEI
                        Leave him be!  Don(cid:146)t touch him!

           But Bobby slides behind the wheel of the truck, get the 
           vehicle into gear.  He starts driving the truck, but he CAN(cid:146)T 
           SEE VERY WELL out of the shattered front windshield.  As he 
           drives, Lei prays over Denny.

                                 LEI (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Lord, Jesus, protect this man.  I ask you, 
                        Father God; save your child...

           Just then, a car comes skidding up in front of the truck.  
           There are two people in the car.  A woman - TERRI BARNETT - 
           drives.  A sizeable black man - TITUS MURPHY - gets out of 
           the car, heads for the truck.  For a beat, there seems as if 
           there might be TROUBLE.  But Murphy merely climbs onto the 
           fuel tank of the cab and stands at the window.  To Bobby:

                                 MURPHY
                        C(cid:146)mon, brother.  Follow her.  She(cid:146)ll take 
                        you to the hospital.

           And Barnett drives on.  She zigzags, she flashes her light 
           and honks the car(cid:146)s horn doing all she can to clear a path.  
           Bobby, driving as hard as he can, follows.

           Denny, semiconscious, mumbles.  Lei, as best she can, 
           comforts.

                                 LEI
                        It(cid:146)s all right.  You(cid:146)re going to be all 
                        right.  You(cid:146)re with God(cid:146)s children now.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - LATER

           We come in on a couple of EMS hanging out around their bus, 
           having a smoke with an RN.  Suddenly, there is a LOUD 
           HONKING.  The EMS and the RN look, see the Terri racing up 
           the drive with the truck, being driven by Bobby, right 
           behind.  Titus jumps off the running board, waves the EMS and 
           the RN over to the truck.

                                 MURPHY
                        Hey...  Hey, we need help!  

           Bobby comes down out of the cab, starts to lift Denny down 
           from the truck.  The EMS see this.  As experienced as they 
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   85.

           are, they nearly start to freak out at the sight of the 
           battered man.

                                 EMS
                        Ah, God...
                                   (to the RN)
                        Get some doctors out here!
                                   (to Bobby)
                        Bring him over!

           As Bobby and Titus carry a limp Denny, the EMS guys pull a 
           gurney from their bus.  As Denny is laid on the gurney, the 
           EMS guys begin to stabilize him.  THE FOLLOWING HAPPENS VERY 
           QUICKLY, AND IS VERY HECTIC.

                                 EMS #2
                        Carotid artery pumper.  Need a C-collar.  

                                 EMS
                        Go ahead and intubate.

           At that moment, an ER DOCTOR comes running from the hospital 
           with the RN and a couple of ER STAFF.

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        What happened?

                                 EMS
                        Massive head trauma.  Multiple fractures.  
                        Looks like bone incursion into the cranial 
                        cavity--

           Just then, Denny begins to convulse horribly.

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        He(cid:146)s going into Grand Mal.  Move him, 
                        let(cid:146)s go!

           All the medics move the gurney with deliberate speed for the 
           hospital and into a waiting ER.  

           And just like that, Denny(cid:146)s four rescuers are left alone 
           outside standing in an eerie quiet.

           EXT. COMMAND POST - SIMULTANEOUS

           7:00 PM - Moulin, who at this point is stressed, overwhelmed, 
           moves for a group cops who are making plans.  Among them are 
           Jefferson and Hillmann who(cid:146)s arrived with Metro - the METRO 
           COPS putting on Tac gear in the BG.  Moulin goes directly to 
           a COP WITH A RADIO and takes it from him.  

           ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE IS TATREAU BACK AT THE 77TH.

                                 MOULIN
                        Moulin, over.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   86.

                                 TATREAU
                        Mike?  Terry.  It(cid:146)s going to hell out 
                        there.  What are you doing?

                                 MOULIN
                        We(cid:146)re, uh...meeting.  And planning.

                                 TATREAU 
                        What(cid:146)s Metro doing?

                                 MOULIN
                        They(cid:146)re here.  They(cid:146)re getting dressed.

                                 TATREAU
                        They need to be out!  They(cid:146)re killing 
                        people at Florence and Normandie!  Do you 
                        understand?  They are killing people!

                                 MOULIN
                        Metro is going out.  They(cid:146)re getting 
                        dressed.

           AT THE 77th, Hagerty enters the watch command office.  He 
           looks quite panicked.  Mostly, because he is.

                                 HAGERTY
                        Where(cid:146)s Moulin?

                                 TATREAU
                        He(cid:146)s at the CP.  I(cid:146)ve got him on the line.

                                 HAGERTY
                        What(cid:146)s he doing?

                                 TATREAU
                        Meeting.  They(cid:146)re planning.

           Hagerty grabs the radio from Tatreau.

                                 HAGERTY
                        Moulin, it(cid:146)s Hagerty.  What(cid:146)s going on?

                                 TATREAU
                        We(cid:146)re, we(cid:146)re talking.  Jefferson(cid:146)s here, 
                        Hillmann, and we(cid:146)re putting together a 
                        plan right now.

                                 HAGERTY
                        I got my wife calling me on the phone in 
                        tears because people are dying at Florence 
                        and Normandie.  Fuck your plans, Mike.  
                        Get people out there!  You need to call a 
                        tactical alert.

                                 MOULIN
                        I don(cid:146)t have the authority.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   87.

                                 HAGERTY
                        Shut streets down!  Keep civvies away from 
                        Florence and Normandie.

                                 MOULIN
                        Chief Gates has to--

                                 HAGERTY 
                        Gates is AWOL!  Call a goddamn tactical 
                        alert!

                                 MOULIN
                        ...I think you need to talk to Captain 
                        Jefferson.

           Moulin hands the radio over Jefferson.

                                 MOULIN (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        It(cid:146)s Hagerty.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        This is Jefferson.

                                 HAGERTY
                        Captain, you need to call a tactical 
                        alert.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        I don(cid:146)t have the authority.  Who(cid:146)s in 
                        charge of South Bureau?

                                 HAGERTY
                        Is it Frankle?

           The following comes as a CONFUSING OVERLAPPING CONFLUENCE 
           OF...CONFUSION among the assembled cops.  It(cid:146)s nearly as much 
           babble as it is a conversation.

                                 MOULIN
                        Command gave South to Hunt.

                                 JEFFERSON
                                   (into radio)
                        Can you get Deputy Chief Hunt?

                                 HAGERTY
                                   (to Tatreau)
                        Find Deputy Chief Hunt.  We need to call a 
                        Tac Alert.

                                 HILLMANN
                        Hunt(cid:146)s not in charge of South.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        Yes, he is.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   88.

                                 HILLMANN
                        Hunt is at that...that rally at the 
                        church.  He gave command to Banks.

                                 MOULIN
                        Banks is here.  Isn(cid:146)t he?

                                 JEFFERSON
                        Hagerty, are you there?  I think we 
                        figured out who(cid:146)s in command.

                                 HAGERTY
                        It doesn(cid:146)t matter who(cid:146)s in charge!  Get 
                        out on the street.  They(cid:146)re killing 
                        people!

                                 JEFFERSON
                        She(cid:146)s okay.  We got her.

                                 HAGERTY
                        What?

                                 JEFFERSON
                        The girl in the car, we got her.

                                 HAGERTY
                        The girl?  This isn(cid:146)t just one girl.  Are 
                        you watching TV?

                                 JEFFERSON
                        Where(cid:146)s the TV?

                                 MOULIN
                        We don(cid:146)t have one.  It(cid:146)s a bus yard, we 
                        don(cid:146)t have a TV.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        Get one!

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           We make a hard cut to a couple of UNIFORMED COPS running  
           down the street to beat the devil, looking for a TV.

           INT. 99 CENTS STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           It(cid:146)s a little shop selling a whole lot of junk.  Goods and 
           sundries, all for under a buck.  The cops run into a store.  
           They do a quick look around.  A GUY working a counter.  A 
           couple of CUSTOMERS.  A radio playing.  No TV.  Real quick 
           the cops head out.  
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   89.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Again we see the cops hauling ass down the street.

           INT. SOUL FOOD JOINT - MOMENTS LATER

           The cops now run into the joint.  A few CUSTOMERS eating as 
           they watch a TV on the counter.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           We now see the cops running with the TV back to the command 
           post.

           EXT. COMMAND POST - LATER

           The TV has been set up on the trunk of a squad car.  Cops - 
           DOZENS AND DOZENS OF THEM - stand several deep and in silence 
           as they watch the TV.  Watch as the city of Los Angeles 
           begins to fall apart.  Begins?  Hell, it(cid:146)s already on its 
           way.

                                 HILLMANN
                        We need to deploy--

                                 JEFFERSON
                        You were supposed to stop this.  I told 
                        you to go, to take back the street.

                                 MOULIN
                        You told me to go assess the situ--

                                 HILLMANN
                        Are you listening?  Lock off streets, keep 
                        fresh bodies from feeding into that mob.  
                        Move in, rescue any vics--

                                 MOULIN
                        The Chief is not going to risk individual 
                        action--

                                 HILLMANN
                        You(cid:146)re a cop and you(cid:146)re talking about 
                        risk?

                                 MOULIN
                        I(cid:146)m not putting unequipped men on the 
                        street to get killed.  This is going to 
                        blow over.  They throw some rocks, some 
                        bottles.  They get it out of their system--
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   90.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        We(cid:146)ve gotta talk to Gates, find out what 
                        his plan is for--

           Pointing at the TV.

                                 HILLMANN
                        That(cid:146)s his plan.  Just let it burn while 
                        he(cid:146)s off eating chicken and slapping backs 
                        until there(cid:146)s nothing left.

           Hillmann starts to cross off.

                                 MOULIN
                        Michael...Mike--

                                 HILLMANN
                        We(cid:146)re up to our asses in alligators, and 
                        you want to sit and hope they go away?  
                        Metro is forming up, we(cid:146)re going out.  You 
                        don(cid:146)t want to do anything, then give back 
                        the goddamn uniform!

           EXT. STREET - FIRE

           7:30 PM - We(cid:146)ve got a FIRE CREW driving fast and hard for one 
           of any number of fires burning in the city.  As the lead 
           truck moves, the driver SCOTT MILLER, spots a mob of people 
           up ahead in the street.  He pulls the trucks air brake.  The 
           beast comes skidding to a stop.  He looks to his Captain, 
           FRANCIS HOWARD, who can clearly see that things are not good.

                                 MILLER
                        What do I do?

                                 HOWARD
                        Take it around.  Get us out of here.

           Miller, working hard, turns the truck and pulls off.  Into 
           his mike:

                                 HOWARD (CONT(cid:146)D)

           INT. CITY HALL/FABIANI(cid:146)S OFFICE - EVENING

           Fabiani comes breezing into the office.  An AIDE is waiting 
           for him..

                                 FABIANI
                        What line(cid:146)s he on?

                                 AIDE
                        Two.

           Fabiani turns on speaker phone.

           On the other end of the line, in his office in Sacramento, is 
           GOVERNOR PETE WILSON (WE SEE WILSON.  THIS IS AN ACTOR, NOT A 
           VOICE PORTRAYAL).

                                 FABIANI
                        Governor...

                                 WILSON
                        Tom?

                                 FABIANI
                        No, sir.  This is Deputy Mayor Mark 
                        Fabiani.

                                 WILSON
                        Good to talk to you, Mark.  Where(cid:146)s Tom?

                                 FABIANI
                        The Mayor is at a rally with African 
                        American leaders at a church in South 
                        Central.  It(cid:146)s, uh...Operation Be Cool, 
                        it(cid:146)s called.  And they(cid:146)re hoping to--

                                 WILSON
                        I appreciate his show of faith, Mark, but 
                        does he know what(cid:146)s going on?

                                 FABIANI
                        Mayor Bradley has a cell phone, yes.  
                        We(cid:146)re in constant communication.

                                 WILSON
                        Well, who exactly is minding the store 
                        down there?  I can(cid:146)t get a hold of Gates, 
                        I can(cid:146)t get Tom--

                                 FABIANI
                        We(cid:146)re...again, the Mayor and I are in 
                        constant contact.

                                 WILSON
                        Mark, I(cid:146)ve been around long enough to have 
                        seen politics and ego let situations like 
                                 (MORE)
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   92.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        this get out of control.  Let(cid:146)s not let it 
                        get beyond you; I think that(cid:146)s the, that 
                        needs to be the primary concern right now.  
                        I(cid:146)m ready and willing to mobilize the 
                        Guard if that(cid:146)s going to help stabilize 
                        things.

                                 FABIANI
                        I don(cid:146)t think at this time the Mayor(cid:146)s 
                        requesting the National Guard.

                                 WILSON
                        He(cid:146)s not requesting, I(cid:146)m offering.  Do you 
                        want the Guard?

           Fabiani hesitates.  He doesn(cid:146)t know what he wants, he doesn(cid:146)t 
           know what to do.

                                 FABIANI
                        I(cid:146)m going to talk to the Mayor and we(cid:146)re 
                        going to determine the exact next course 
                        of action.

                                 WILSON
                        You do that, because it seems to me 
                        somebody down there needs to start making 
                        some decisions, and goddamn it, you better 
                        start making (cid:145)em quick.

           INT. CITY HALL - EVENING

           We(cid:146)ve got Manning with his deputy, DAVIS PARSONS.  

                                 DFC PARSONS 
                        The first fire was reported about an hour 
                        ago.  We(cid:146)re up to nine fires now, but most 
                        are in a thirty block radius right here.  
                        The burns we can handle.  But every call 
                        we(cid:146)ve been out on personnel’s encountered 
                        mobs.  They don(cid:146)t care we(cid:146)re trying to put 
                        out fires.  They want blood.

                                 MANNING
                        We getting escorts from the police?

                                 DFC PARSONS
                        South Bureau is marshalling at a command 
                        post.  Every call, all the fire units are 
                        heading there first, getting escorts 
                        before heading out.  But it(cid:146)s insane down 
                        there.  The cops can barely get themselves 
                        out on the street let alone protect us.

                                 MANNING
                        Here(cid:146)s what I want: hit and run tactics; 
                        Fire responds to a call, they knock it 
                        down best they can.  Soon as a crowd 
                                 (MORE)
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   93.

                                 MANNING (CONT’D)
                        starts to form, load up and move on to the 
                        next.

                                 DFC PARSONS
                        Yes, sir.  

                                 MANNING
                        If we can(cid:146)t put them all out, we can slow 
                        the burns down.  But we(cid:146)re not targets.  
                        Head down to the command post, get the 
                        cops rolling.  If they(cid:146)re going to sit on 
                        their asses they can do it while they(cid:146)re 
                        watching us do work.

           I/E CAR - NIGHT

           Inside the car are a couple of black men.  Some very regular, 
           hard working guys trying to make a life in South Central LA.  
           MICHAEL BELL drives.  DWIGHT TAYLOR RIDES.  They(cid:146)re heading 
           home at the end of the day, listening to news radio as they 
           travel.  THE NEWS, OF COURSE, IS OF THE GROWING DISTURBANCE 
           AROUND THE FLORENCE AND NORMANDIE AREA.  The two men talk, 
           but have a difference of opinion about the escalating 
           violence.

                                 BELL
                        That(cid:146)s messed up.

                                 TAYLOR
                        What they did to Rodney King; that was 
                        messed up.

                                 BELL
                        So the brothers start doing what?  Burning 
                        our shit, start beating each other up; 
                        that(cid:146)s gonna do what?

                                 TAYLOR
                        Doing nuthin(cid:146) ain(cid:146)t got us nuthin(cid:146).  I say 
                        burn all this shit down.  Them Santa 
                        Monica fake ass liberals, their hearts(cid:146)ll 
                        start bleeding, they(cid:146)ll come down here and 
                        build it all back up again.  This time 
                        maybe they(cid:146)ll build the shit right, like 
                        they shoulda done after them Watts riots.

           Pulling up at a corner grocery:

                                 BELL
                        Just get your stuff.  Serious, get what ya 
                        gotta get, and let(cid:146)s go.  I ain(cid:146)t fixin(cid:146)ta 
                        be out in this mess all night.

           Taylor goes into the store.  As he waits, Bell gets out of 
           the car to light a cigarette.  As he does, he looks to the 
           sky.  Sees smoke rising in the near BG.  Fires burning.  
           Burning close..
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   94.

           Then comes the sound of GUNFIRE from outside of a swap meet 
           across the street from Bell.

           People run, scatter.  Bell looks, sees LOUIS WATSON - 
           eighteen - a young, black man who is trying to escort a 
           couple of ELDERLY WOMEN from the swap meet to a bus stop.

                                 BELL (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Yo, young brother; you good?

           Watson SIGNALS that he(cid:146)s okay, continues to walk with the two 
           women until they are at the stop. 

                                 WATSON
                        You gonna be okay, here, alright?  First 
                        bus that comes, I want you to get on it.  
                        Doesn(cid:146)t matter where it(cid:146)s going, you just 
                        need to get out of here.  Okay?

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        You(cid:146)re so good to help us.

                                 WATSON
                        This ain(cid:146)t no night for anybody--

           Right then another shot rings out.  A BULLET STRIKES WATSON 
           IN THE HEAD, rendering a violent cranial defect as a result 
           of the impact.  It is not pretty.  It is a representation of 
           violence, and should feel such as Watson drops to the ground 
           very dead.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Jesus.  Sweet Jesus!

           Bell is of course, stunned.  A young man(cid:146)s just been shot 
           before his eyes.  Bells starts to cross the street to help.

           Taylor exits the store, sees Bell crossing the street.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        Hey!  Where you going?  Michael?

           Another shot echoes through the streets.  Taylor takes a SHOT 
           TO THE CHEST.  As with Watson, this is a violent end. 
           Taylor(cid:146)s kicked back, down to the ground.  But he is not 
           instantly dead.

           Bell runs back to his friend who bleeds profusely from his 
           wound.

                                 BELL
                        Oh, shit.  Oh, shit, man...

                                 TAYLOR
                        Fuck...messed up...this shit(cid:146)s...
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   95.

                                 BELL
                        Just be cool, okay...?  Somebody help me!

                                 TAYLOR
                        You tell her...you tell my kids...this 
                        shit(cid:146)s...you gotta get the milk home.  You 
                        gotta get the milk home, okay?

           EXT. COMMAND POST - NIGHT

           8:17 PM - We(cid:146)ve got a group of FIRE FIGHTERS standing around.  
           Yeah, just standing around as the city burns.  Parsons, 
           having finished conferring with Moulin, crosses back to his 
           men.  Among them are Howard, Miller, TOM CARROLL, ALONZO 
           WILLIAMS - a black man - and KELLY KILMARTIN among MANY 
           OTHERS.

                                 DFC PARSONS
                        As soon as they figure out how they(cid:146)re 
                        going to respond to the mobs--

                                 WILLIAMS
                        You serious?

                                 DFC PARSONS 
                        Then they can start supporting us.

                                 HOWARD
                        Two hundred cops standing around not doing 
                        crap, and we(cid:146)ve got how many fires burning 
                        now?  Fifteen?  Thirty?

                                 DFC PARSONS
                        You want to help (cid:145)em with the math, go 
                        try.  It(cid:146)s like explaining blue skies to

                        Hell with them.  Just give us the go.  
                        We(cid:146)ll do our job.

           Parsons takes a half a beat.  As he considers things, a 
           MOLOTOV COCKTAIL comes sailing over the bus yard fence, hits 
           one of the buses and immediately SETS IT ON FIRE.  

           Cops scatter out of the way, run to catch the attacker...

                                 DFC PARSONS
                        Damn...!

                                 WILLIAMS
                        We(cid:146)re targets one way or the other.  Might 
                        as well be moving ones.

           Parsons gives a shake of his head.  Half laughing, half 
           dismissive.

                        Your crew has vests, they wear (cid:145)em.  Chief 
                        says hit and run: you see any people 
                        forming up, you go.

           The fire fighters start heading out.

                        That is no joke.  You see a crowd, you go.

           INT. STATE CAPITAL - NIGHT

           10:13 PM - We are Pete Wilson(cid:146)s office.  He(cid:146)s sitting at his 
           desk, talking on a speakerphone.  On the line are Bradley, 
           Gates and General ROBERT THRASHER of the National Guard 
           (THRASHER, AS WITH WILSON, IS AN ACTOR AND NOT A VOICE 
           PORTRAYAL).

                                 WILSON
                        Tom, you(cid:146)re there?

                                 BRADLEY (V.O.)
                        I am, Governor.

                                 WILSON
                        Chief Gates?

                                 GATES (V.O.)
                        Yeah, I(cid:146)m here.

                                 WILSON 
                        We also have General Thrasher who(cid:146)s in 
                        command of the guard.  General?

                                 THRASHER
                        Yes, sir.  I(cid:146)m here.

                                 WILSON
                        I appreciate everyone could get together 
                        on the phone.  I understand the situation 
                        is, uh...fluid right now.  The purpose--  

                                 THRASHER 
                        Sir, I(cid:146)m having trouble hearing...

                                 WILSON
                        The purpose of this call...I think what we 
                        want, we want to be on the same page 
                        concerning activating the guard.  Tom, at 
                        this time you(cid:146)re requesting guard presence 
                        in the city, yes?

                                 BRADLEY (V.O.)
                        I think the situation...it(cid:146)s definitely 
                        moving in that direction.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   97.

                                 WILSON
                        Chief Gates, do you agree?

                                 GATES (V.O.)
                        Quite frankly, no.  I don(cid:146)t.  The Los 
                        Angeles police department is the single 
                        finest police organization--

                                 WILSON
                        Chief, no one is questioning the integrity 
                        of your officers, just their capabilities.  
                        The Guard will not be supplanting your 
                        men, just supporting them.  General 
                        Thrasher, you have how many--

                                 THRASHER
                        Two-thousand troops already mobilized.  We 
                        just need the okay to deploy, they can be 
                        in the city within the hour.

                                 WILSON
                        One hour.  So, again, the question is are 
                        we at a consensus; is this the move we 
                        want to make?  The mayor wants to make it, 
                        Chief.

                                 GATES (V.O.)
                        As I said I believe this...this 
                        insurrection can be put down by the cops 
                        here in Los Angeles.  Clearly, on some 
                        comfort level, people feel they need the 
                        Guard on the street.  I(cid:146)m willing to 
                        accept that.

           Wilson does everything short of rolling his eyes.

                                 WILSON
                        I appreciate your being understanding of 
                        other people(cid:146)s feelings, Chief.  General, 
                        I(cid:146)m going to ask you to go ahead and 
                        deploy your men as soon as possible, and 
                        give what support you can to the chief.

                                 THRASHER
                        I will, and I will remain in constant 
                        contact, your Honor.

                                 WILSON
                        Thank you gentlemen.

           Wilson hangs up the phone.

                                 WILSON (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Gates acts like he(cid:146)s blessed.  The SOB 
                        better hope he is.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           We(cid:146)ve got a fire truck racing down an LA street.  Full tilt 
           boogie.  Lights and sirens...  Fire fighter shooting.  As 
           before, Miller is driving.  Howard rides next to him.  

           As they drive on Western, a CAR WITH ITS HEADLIGHTS OUT 
           sallies up alongside the truck on the driver(cid:146)s side.  A hand 
           juts from an open window.  The hand holds a GUN.  The gun 
           fires.  Miller takes a BULLET TO THE FACE.  He slumps over 
           the wheel, bleeding badly, but still alive.

                                 HOWARD
                        Shit!

           With Miller down at the wheel, the truck starts to do a 
           severe skid for the side of the street, some parked cars.  
           This is shaping up to be a nasty wreck.  But Howard reaches 
           over, pulls the airbake.  The ladder truck SKIDS TO A STOP 
           just moments short of wrecking.

           Once the truck has stopped, Howard yells to his men:

                                 HOWARD (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Get up here.  I need help!

           One of the Firemen - TOM CARROLL - rushes up, rushes into the 
           cab and starts putting pressure on the wound.  Howard grabs 
           up the radio:

                                 HOWARD (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        We have a fireman shot!  We need a rush on 
                        a RA at thirty-first and Western!

                                 DISPATCH (V.O.)
                        EMS is advised and are en route.

                                 HOWARD
                        Dispatch, ETA?

                                 DISPATCH (V.O.)
                        ETA twelve minutes.

           Howard takes just a moment to think about things, then gets 
           real decisive.

                                 HOWARD
                        Fuck it, we(cid:146)re not waiting.  Hold on to 
                        him!

           Howard maneuvers behind the wheel of the truck, jams the 
           accelerator, drives that bitch as hard as she(cid:146)ll go.
                          LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   99.

           INT. CALIFORNIA MARKET - NIGHT

           In a backroom of the market, Rhee has assembled about a dozen 
           KOREAN men of varying ages around a table.  On the table is a 
           blanket.  Rhee flips back the blanket displaying a collection 
           of guns.  Handguns, a few revolvers, automatics.  Most are 
           kinda cheap looking.  Among them, however, is a very 
           impressive looking assault rifle.

           The men stare at the weapons.

                                 RHEE 
                        Go on.  Take one.

           One of the men does as told; picks up a gun.  As he looks 
           over the gun.

                                 RHEE (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        They(cid:146)re coming, okay?  Those black niggers 
                        out there are coming, and the police are 
                        doing nothing.  Everything I have is here.  
                        Fifteen years.  They(cid:146)re not taking it from 
                        us.

                                 KOREAN GUY
                        What do we...what do we do?

                                 RHEE
                        You see somebody moving for the store, you 
                        shoot their black nigger asses.

           EXT. NICKERSON GARDENS - NIGHT

           Nickerson Gardens is a low-end government housing project in 
           South Central.  Gangs, drugs...  All that.  Cops - among them 
           JOHN ALVIANI arrive at the scene in response to a looting 
           call.  Once there, they are greeted by a CROWD.  One of them - 
           a YOUNG BLACK GUY whips out an assault rifle and starts 
           shooting at the cops.  Bullets rip around the squad, blow out 
           a tire.  Alviani returns fire, wounds the shooter.

           BUT SHOTS KEEP COMING FROM THE BUILDING AND PIN THE COPS 
           DOWN.  Alviani yells to another COP:

                                 ALVIANI
                        Call dispatch!  Get back up!

           INT. HOSPITAL/ER - NIGHT

           Howard and his fire crew sit and wait.  Dejected.  Broken.  
           One of theirs is down, and they(cid:146)ve got no idea if he is dead 
           or alive.  
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   100.

           Also present, outside the ER is Bell.  He, too, sits.  His 
           shirt is covered with blood.  Bell looks up from his stupor, 
           looks to the firemen.  

           Howard looks to Bell.  The two men hold each other(cid:146)s gaze for 
           just a beat.  Not a word spoken, but we know there is some 
           bad, bad shit they have BOTH FELT and only they can SHARE.

           EXT. NICKERSON GARDENS - NIGHT

           As Alviani and his men hunker down, lights and sirens 
           approach.  It(cid:146)s a squad of Metro - led by  SGT. RICHARD 
           BEARDSLEE along with JIM MOODY, JOHN PUIS and OTHERS  - and a 
           FIRE CREW.  Alviani can(cid:146)t believe what he(cid:146)s seeing.  As 
           Dublin gets out of his car.

                                 ALVIANI
                        Get down!  Down!  Get those lights off.

           Beardslee makes his way over.

                                 ALVIANI (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 BEARDSLEE
                        We(cid:146)re escorting FD.  What(cid:146)s going on?

                                 ALVIANI
                        We(cid:146)re in the middle of a fire fight!  
                        Command didn(cid:146)t send you to back us up?

                                 BEARDSLEE
                        We didn(cid:146)t even know you were here.

           Beardslee looks, sees Harrison(cid:146)s on the ground.

                                 BEARDSLEE (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        ...Shit.  Puis, break out the AR-15s.  
                        Jim, take your squad flank the side of the 
                        building.

           Alviani watches as the cops struggle to get their rifles from 
           the trunks of their cars without making themselves targets.

                                 ALVIANI
                        You got your guns in the trunk?

                                 BEARDSLEE
                        I(cid:146)m following orders.  Know what you(cid:146)re 
                        working against?

                                 ALVIANI
                        Couple of bangers.  Three at most, not 
                        counting the one we dropped.  They(cid:146)ve 
                        popped off a few, but they(cid:146)ve been quiet 
                        for awhile.
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   101.

                                 BEARDSLEE
                        Puis, roll the squad in.  Give (cid:145)em a 
                        target, but keep your head down.

           Puis turns on the lights, rolls the squad close to the 
           building.  The car gets SHOT at.  Puis scrambles out as the 
           vehicle is ripped with bullets..  Cops return fire.  For 
           several minutes - THE ACTUAL FIRE FIGHT LASTED TWO HOURS - 
           the gunfire coming from the building is HOT AND HARD.  More 
           like what you(cid:146)d find in a war zone than an urban area.  The 
           cops, with their AR-15s, give as good as they get.  After a 
           few more rounds are exchanged, the Metro cops seem to take 
           the upper hand.  They lay heavy fire at the  windows where 
           the shooting seems to be coming from.  There is a BREAK from 
           the shooting.  Then the GUNFIRE comes again, this time from a 
           forward entrance to one of the buildings.  Again, the Metro 
           cops lay down a fusillade at the front of the building, and 
           again they are answered with silence.

           Then Puis sees two armed BANGERS trying to make their way 
           along the side of the building.  The Bangers start shooting 
           at Beardslee(cid:146)s position.  Puis steps up, empties a clip at 
           one of the Bangers, drops the guy dead.  But as his clip 
           clicks empty, the OTHER BANGER starts shooting at Puis who(cid:146)s 
           gotta go for cover.  Beardslee and his men shoot at the 
           Banger, but the banger takes of running.  Disappears into the 
           night.  

           As the dust quite literally settles, an OLD MAN - as if 
           unconcerned of the goings on - steps from the building, then 
           addresses the cops who hold their guns on him.

                                 OLD MAN
                        There(cid:146)s two bodies inside.  You all can 
                        come get (cid:145)em now.  And hurry up, I(cid:146)m 
                        trying to get me some goddamn sleep.

           Alviani, with a bit a disbelief...

                                 ALVIANI
                        Yes, sir...

           And with that, the old man goes back inside the building.

           INT. GREEN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Vera is sitting in the near dark, lit only by the soft glow 
           of the TV.  She clutches herself as she waits nervous.  
           Finally, she hears the front to start to open.  She gets up, 
           turns for the door.  Bobby enters.  His expression is blank.  
           Empty.  The guy is spent.  Vera stands across from him for a 
           long beat, then Bobby falls into her.  Clutches her.  Vera, 
           somewhere between anger and extreme pain:  
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   102.

                                 VERA
                        What in the hell did you think you were 
                        doing?

                                 BOBBY
                        ...I don(cid:146)t know...

                                 VERA
                        Stupid.  That was...

                                 BOBBY
                        They were killing him.

                                 VERA
                        Stupid...

           Bobby continues to hold Vera.

           CARD:

           BY THE END OF APRIL 29th, THE FIRST NIGHT OF RIOTING:

           EIGHT PEOPLE ARE DEAD.  MORE THAN TWO DOZEN ARE CRITICALLY 
           INJURED.  NEARLY THREE HUNDRED STRUCTURES ARE BURNING WITH 
           ARSONISTS SETTING NEW FIRES AT THE RATE OF THREE PER MINUTE.

           VIDEO

           SUPERIMPOSE: THURSDAY, APRIL 30th, 1992

           We come in on an AERIAL SHOT of the city.  By the plumes of 
           smoke that rise over the city - number, the thickness of the 
           smoke, the geographical spread of the fires - just how vast 
           an area of destruction the uprising has cut to this point.

           We now see daytime NEWS VIDEO of the rioting.  And at this 
           moment it is a riot, having devolved from an uprising into 
           wild looting.  This is no longer about Rodney King.  This is 
           people going crazy.  This should be cut in a VERY HECTIC 
           manner.  Really getting at the craziness of the moment.  We 
           get the sense things have not calmed down one bit

           EXT. CALIFORNIA MARKET - DAY

           Ringing the parking lot of the market - like wagon(cid:146)s circled 
           against (cid:147)invaders(cid:148) of the old west - is an eclectic mix of 
           vehicles.  Fairly new Cadillacs and era-appropriate SUVS.  
           Station wagons...  Richard Rhee, along with his collective of 
           men, is standing guard.  

           A low rider pulls up, stops just up the street.  Several 
           THUGGY LOOKING GUYS spill from the cars, move for the market 
           displaying much braggadocio as they move.
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   103.

                                 LOW RIDER BANGER
                        You see me comin(cid:146) choon, bitch?  You 
                        better move the fuck out my way.

           The Koreans surrounding the store heft their weapons.  More 
           show themselves on the roof of the building.  The Low Rider 
           Banger takes a look around.  Acting tough, but backing down.

                                 LOW RIDER BANGER (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Ariite, that how you wanna play it?  
                        That(cid:146)s cool.  But we be back.  
                        Motherfuckin(cid:146) straight we gonna be back.

           The banger and his crew get back in the car, they peel out.

           VIDEO

           We see news video of Mayor Bradley and Gates holding a joint 
           press conference, reassuring the city that all is well.  

           INT. CITY HALL/MAYOR(cid:146)S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Fabiani is on the phone.  He(cid:146)s more than a little anxious as 
           he talks with Gen. Thrasher.  He(cid:146)s like a guy trying to track 
           on very important package he never received.

           On the other end of the line is AG Thrasher.

                                 FABIANI
                        We were promised two thousand guard troops 
                        last night.  Twelve hours ago.  The 
                        Mayor(cid:146)s about to ask for two thousand more 
                        and we don(cid:146)t have the ones we were 
                        supposed to get yesterday.

                                 THRASHER (V.O.)
                        The troops are in place at their 
                        designated armories.

                                 FABIANI
                        Unless there(cid:146)s some looting going on at 
                        the armories that doesn(cid:146)t help much.

                                 THRASHER (V.O.)
                        We are following procedure.  We 
                        technically cannot put troops--

                                 FABIANI
                        Technically?

                                 THRASHER (V.O.)
                        We cannot deploy them until the police 
                        have utilized and exhausted the services 
                        of the Sheriff(cid:146)s department and the 
                        Highway patrol.
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   104.

                                 FABIANI
                        We had you on the phone, last night, and 
                        you didn(cid:146)t say a goddamn thing about using 
                        Sheriff or CHP. 

                                 THRASHER (V.O.)
                        You all down there have mismanaged the 
                        situation from the beginning.  Do not snap 
                        at me because we can(cid:146)t ride in and save 
                        your hides on cue.  Do your job, hold the 
                        line and we will be there.

           Thrasher hangs up the phone.  Fabiani gets an earful of dial 
           tone, takes a beat...  To the Aide:

                                 FABIANI
                        Get Gates on the phone.  And, try to get 
                        someone from Governor Wilson(cid:146)s office.  
                        And I need to talk to someone from SOES.

                                 AIDE
                        I(cid:146)ve been trying Gates all morning.  I 
                        can(cid:146)t get him.

                                 FABIANI
                        He was just doing a press conference with 
                        the Mayor.  

                                 AIDE
                        I understand, but I can(cid:146)t get to him and 
                        if anyone in the PD knows where he is 
                        they(cid:146)re not saying.

           Fabiani, resigned to the fact that Gates probably isn(cid:146)t going 
           to be a factor in saving the city.

                                 FABIANI
                        Look for him.  Keep looking until you find 
                        him.

           EXT. CALIFORNIA MARKET - DAY

           We come back to the market in the middle of CHAOS.  As 
           promised, Thugs looking to agitate have returned.  Rhee, his 
           men; they are doing all they can to hold them off.  They fire 
           their weapons just over the heads of the looters.

           INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

           As he sits in his room EDWARD LEE, a young, Korean-American 
           college student, is watching the shoot out on TV.  Watching 
           other Koreans hold the line as best they can.  For Edward, 
           it(cid:146)s like he(cid:146)s been sent a vision from on high.  
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   105.

                                 EDWARD
                        That is so fucking cool.

           Real quick he picks up a phone, dials...

                                 EDWARD (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Tony, it(cid:146)s Ed.  You watching TV?  ...I 
                        know, that is so fucking cool.  Yo, call 
                        around.  Get some guys together.  ...We(cid:146)re 
                        gonna go down there, man.  Gonna help our 
                        own out.  Kick some ass.
                                   (beat)
                        Hey, you got a gun?

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           We are interior of a low end apartment in East LA. ROSA - a 
           mild mannered woman in her forties or so - is watching TV, 
           watching people loot at will.  She looks around her place.  
           Sees all the little bit of anything that she has to call her 
           own.  Other than her CRYING CHILDREN, all very young, it(cid:146)s 
           not much.  Rossa says a few words to her SISTER in Spanish, 
           then heads out.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           We see Rosa out walking along the street.  She comes to a 
           large grocery store that is absolutely being ransacked.  
           Despite that, Rosa moves very casually as if out doing her 
           normal shopping.

           INT. VONS - MOMENTS LATER

           Rosa has a shopping cart.  As PEOPLE wildly loot around her, 
           Rosa goes through the aisle picking out whatever she pleases 
           as if she(cid:146)s out shopping on a Sunday.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Rosa is walking the street with her cart.  She stops.  She 
           looks to something which catches her eye.

           We see that to which Rosa is looking:  ACROSS THE STREET is 
           an automotive repair shop which is being looted much like the 
           grocery store was.  Outside of the shop is a pile of TIRES.

           Rosa stares at them for a beat.
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   106.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Rosa is walking with her cart, struggling to push while 
           pulling a SECOND CART brimming with those tires she was just 
           previously eyeing.  Clearly, all this has turned from rioting 
           to crimes of opportunity.

           EXT. COMMAND POST - DAY

           Jefferson and Moulin are talking.  Both looked hacked up from 
           lack of sleep.  Hunt is present as well.  The men are looking 
           over a TACTICAL MAP of the city.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        Right now all of the area between South 
                        Central and the Harbor are under alert.  
                        South Central, Watts, Compton; those are 
                        the areas with the most activity.  But 
                        we(cid:146)ve got flare ups in Culver City, 
                        Hawthorne, as far east as Pamona.

                                 HUNT
                        They(cid:146)re so damn mad at whitey, why don(cid:146)t 
                        these people go burn Beverly Hills?

                                 JEFFERSON
                        These people?

                                 HUNT
                        I(cid:146)m not talking about you.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        You(cid:146)re talking out your ass.  You haven(cid:146)t 
                        done one damn thing--

                                 MOULIN
                        Hey!

                                 JEFFERSON
                        You(cid:146)re command!  Where the hell is the 
                        plan?

                                 MOULIN
                        Hey!  C(cid:146)mon!

           Moulin must nearly physically restrain Jefferson who(cid:146)s ready 
           to let loose all of his frustration directly to Hunt.

           Jefferson takes one angry beat to let himself cool a bit, 
           then:

                                 JEFFERSON
                        We need to start making arrests.
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   107.

                                 HUNT 
                        We(cid:146)ve got no field detention.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        Dispersing people(cid:146)s not doing it.  We have 
                        to get them off the streets.

                                 HUNT
                        And do what with them?  Three thousand 
                        people looting and burning, where do we 
                        put them?  We wait for the guard.  When 
                        they(cid:146)re in place, they can sit on the 
                        arrests.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        How come every plan you(cid:146)ve got involves 
                        waiting?

                                 HUNT
                        Activity should be falling off.  Rioting 
                        is supposed to subside during the day.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        How did you all let this happen?  And all 
                        of you up top, you(cid:146)re going to start 
                        closing ranks, pointing fingers and us 
                        down on the street; we get the blame.

           Pointing to the smoke in the distance.

                                 JEFFERSON (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        That(cid:146)s you, that(cid:146)s the Chief...  You got 
                        exactly what you wanted.

                                 HUNT
                        The hell we did.

                                 JEFFERSON
                        How do you know what Gates wanted?  Nobody 
                        can find him.

           EXT. CALIFORNIA MARKET - DAY

           During a respite between the running gun battles, Rhee and 
           his men hunker down, rest as best they can.  They look worn.  
           THE ASPHALT OF THE PARKING LOT IS LITTERED WITH SHELL CASINGS 
           giving an indication as to exactly how many rounds have been 
           fired.  Quite a lot from the looks of things.  They have been 
           at this for awhile.  And by the looks of it, it doesn(cid:146)t seem 
           they can stand guard much longer.  

           As they wait, one of the men standing guard on the roof calls 
           to Rhee.

                                 ROOF GUY
                        Hey...  Hey!
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   108.

           Rhee gets himself ready to fight off another round of 
           attackers.  Instead, it(cid:146)s a police squad which goes whipping 
           past the parking lot.  Rhee tries to flag them down.

                                 RHEE
                        Hey, we need help here.  Hey!

           The driver of the squad slams on the brakes, stops, then 
           rolls the car back and brakes again hard.  The FOUR WHITE 
           COPS in the squad get out.  Using the car for cover, they 
           draw out on Rhee and his men.

                                 MARKET COP
                        Weapons down!  Put the weapons down!  
                        Hands over your heads!  Now!

           Rhee and the others cautiously do as told.  No sudden moves, 
           thank you.

           The cops advance.  When they get close, they see that Rhee 
           and his men are Korean.

                                 MARKET COP #2
                        They(cid:146)re not blacks, they(cid:146)re Koreans.

           The cops take a beat, holster their weapons.  Without a word 
           more they start to head out.

                                 RHEE
                        Wait!  They(cid:146)re trying to burn the building 
                        down!  They keep coming back!

           The cops get in their squad and start to pull off.

                                 RHEE (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Hey...  Wait!  Help us!

           No good.  The cops are gone.

           INT. CITY HALL/MAYOR(cid:146)S OFFICE

           Hunt is in the office talking to an agitated Fabiani.  Hunt(cid:146)s 
           at about the end of his wire as well.  If one thing has gone 
           right with managing this crisis, it(cid:146)ll be the first thing.

                                 HUNT
                        We are stretched to the limit.  We can 
                        hold the line, but we cannot start being 
                        proactive until we get the guard in place 
                        and start getting rioters off the street.

                                 FABIANI
                        We don(cid:146)t get the Guard until you start 
                        using CHP and Sheriff(cid:146)s deputies.
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   109.

                                 HUNT
                        (cid:147)Start using?(cid:148)  We(cid:146)ve got every man in 
                        every department deployed.

                                 FABIANI
                        General Thrasher is telling me--

                                 HUNT
                        You(cid:146)ve got a Guardsman telling you about 
                        municipal procedure?

                                 FABIANI
                                   (to his Aide:)
                        Get the General.  And have the Governor’s 
                        office standing by.
                                   (to Hunt)
                        You used the deputies and CHP?  You 
                        deployed them?

                                 HUNT
                        There was a miscommunication last night...

                                 FABIANI
                        That(cid:146)s a fucking understatement.

                                 HUNT
                        The EOC asked for deputies but the field 
                        command post countermanded the request 
                        before they could be deployed.  But I was 
                        just down there.  Everything is worked 
                        out.

                                 FABIANI
                        When did the Chief make the second 
                        request?

                                 HUNT
                        This morning.  Ten O(cid:146)clock.

                                 FABIANI
                        So while Gates was standing next to the 
                        Mayor talking about how he was going to do 
                        everything he could to protect the city, 
                        he hadn(cid:146)t even asked for additional 
                        support yet?

                                 HUNT
                        ..I can(cid:146)t say...

                                 AIDE
                        The General(cid:146)s on.

           TURNING ON THE SPEAKERPHONE:
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   110.

                                 FABIANI 
                        General, Mark Fabiani.   We(cid:146)ve got, uh, a 
                        communication issue I want to clarify.  
                        It(cid:146)s my understanding the LAPD hasn(cid:146)t--

                                 HUNT
                        General, this is Deputy Chief Hunt.  Is it 
                        correct you(cid:146)re blaming your lack of 
                        deployment on the PD?

                                 THRASHER
                        We are not playing the blame game.  Right 
                        now we(cid:146)re looking at multiple issues.  My 
                        God, we(cid:146)re seeing unrest spread to 
                        Oakland, San Francisco...we(cid:146)ve got reports 
                        coming in from Seattle, Las Vegas, 
                        Atlanta, New York...  There was an 
                        incident in Toronto, they(cid:146)ve got one dead 
                        there.  Also, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin--

                                 FABIANI
                        General, my sympathies to the folks in 
                        Wisconsin, but I don(cid:146)t give a good goddamn 
                        about Milwaukee.  What the hell does any 
                        of that have to do with us?

                                 THRASHER
                        My point is how quickly these things can 
                        spread, and we need to make sure we follow 
                        procedure. 

                                 HUNT
                        We have followed procedure.  We have made 
                        all the appropriate requests.  Twelve 
                        hours ago you told us in one hour we(cid:146)d 
                        have bodies.  If you(cid:146)re saying there is 
                        something that we did not do, let(cid:146)s all 
                        get on the phone with the Governor and the 
                        SOES and find out what the problem is, 
                        because it(cid:146)s not down here.
                                   (a long, quiet beat)
                        We have people dying, General.  What is 
                        the problem?

                                 THRASHER
                        We don(cid:146)t have ammunition.  We cannot 
                        distribute live ammunition at this point.

                                 HUNT
                        You(cid:146)ve got two thousand men, and no 
                        bullets.

           A POLICE SIREN GOES OFF IN THE BG, then fades off into the 
           distance.

                                 FABIANI
                        Where are the bullets?
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   111.

                                 THRASHER
                        Camp Roberts.  About...two hundred miles 
                        north of the city.

                                 HUNT
                        It(cid:146)s more like two hundred and fifty.

                                 THRASHER
                        We(cid:146)re sending trucks now to get the 
                        ammunition

           A POLICE OFFICER slips into the office, hands Hunt a NOTE.

                                 FABIANI
                        After the bullets get loaded...

                                 THRASHER
                        They(cid:146)re going to the central armory in Los 
                        Alamitos.

                                 FABIANI
                        South of Los Angeles.  So, three plus 
                        hours travel time just to get the ammo to 
                        Alamitos, then you(cid:146)ve got to get it 
                        distributed, get the men on the streets...  
                        You(cid:146)re talking half a day before we see 
                        troops.
                                   (beat)
                        You have access to helicopters, General?

                                 THRASHER
                        Yes.

                                 FABIANI
                        Maybe you should use a couple of those.

           Fabiani hangs up the phone.

                                 HUNT
                        We(cid:146)ve located Chief Gates.  He(cid:146)s at the 
                        hospital.  His son overdosed on drugs.  
                        He(cid:146)s in intensive care.

           A pall hangs over the group.  It(cid:146)s as if they are cursed, and 
           they know it.

           INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

           Ed talking with TONY and a couple of other guys - KIPP and  
           ERIC; KOREAN AMERICANS.  They(cid:146)re looking at a gun Tony(cid:146)s 
           brought over.

                                 EDWARD
                        That(cid:146)s cool.

                                 KIPP
                        That(cid:146)s fucking cool.

                                 EDWARD
                        It(cid:146)s loaded, right?

                                 TONY
                        I brought the bullets.  My dad doesn(cid:146)t 
                        think it(cid:146)s safe to keep it loaded.

                                 ERIC
                        But he leaves the gun and the bullets 
                        laying around unlocked?

                                 TONY
                        What the fuck?  I brought something.  
                        What(cid:146)d you do?

                                 EDWARD
                        Okay, let(cid:146)s go.

                                 TONY
                        I don(cid:146)t know.  There(cid:146)s a lot of shit going 
                        on down there.

                                 EDWARD 
                        Man, they(cid:146)re trying to fuck with us.  
                        Those people(cid:146)re always trying to fuck with 
                        us (cid:145)cause they always get away with 
                        fucking with us (cid:145)cause we always let (cid:145)em 
                        fuck with us.  One time we got our own 
                        standing up for themselves, I(cid:146)m not gonna 
                        let that pass.  You want to stay here, you 
                        want to be the black man(cid:146)s bitch--

                                 KIPP
                        Man, shut up.

                                 EDWARD
                        Stay here.  But give me the gun.

           Tony takes a beat.

                                 TONY
                        It(cid:146)s my dad(cid:146)s gun.  I(cid:146)m going.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - SIMULTANEOUS

           We(cid:146)ve got an ANGRY WHITE GUY - in his late thirties - sitting 
           in a parked car with a HISPANIC GUY who is about the same 
           age.  Both guzzle beers as they listen to radio reports of 
           the uprising.

                                 ANGRY WHITE GUY
                        They(cid:146)re going crazy out there, huh?  Those 
                        niggers(cid:146)ve lost their goddamn minds.

                        People do like they(cid:146)re supposed to do.  
                        That(cid:146)s why whites are where they are, and 
                        niggers are where they are, and your kind 
                        are where they(cid:146)re at.  At least you all 
                        can get your asses across the border.  You 
                        think niggers would even be here if we 
                        wouldn(cid:146)ta brought (cid:145)em over?  And that(cid:146)s 
                        the ironical thing of it all.   

                                 HISPANIC GUY
                        We gonna do this, or what?

                                 ANGRY WHITE GUY
                        The only problem with them is they got a 
                        good deal and they don(cid:146)t know it.  They 
                        can(cid:146)t just play ball and do rap music and 
                        be happy about that.  And I don(cid:146)t get that 
                        shit...

           He downs the last of his beer, gets out of the car.  The 
           Hispanic man does as well.  They cross to a mini-mart.

                                 ANGRY WHITE GUY (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        If I could make money and get pussy I 
                        wouldn(cid:146)t be rapping about killing cops.  
                        I(cid:146)d just take my money and fuck my pussy 
                        and be glad about it.  

                                 HISPANIC GUY
                        La verdad, brother.

                                 ANGRY WHITE GUY
                        If anything that(cid:146)s all I got against (cid:145)em; 
                        they can(cid:146)t be happy just being niggers.

           As they cross, the Angry White Guy pulls a gun from his 
           waistband, as does the Hispanic Guy.  They move into the mini-
           mart with authority.
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   114.

           INT. MINI-MART - CONTINUOUS

           Inside the mart a black man - DONALD JOHNSON - works the 
           counter.  There are a couple of other CUSTOMERS in the joint.  
           They are white and/or Hispanic.  They begin to rob the joint.

                                 ANGRY WHITE GUY 
                        Don(cid:146)t nobody move!  Don(cid:146)t move, you black 
                        fucking piece of shit!  

           The Angry White Guy knocks over some display racks as they 
           ransack the joint.  The pair grab some beers.  This crime 
           seems far more haphazard than planned.  Donald looks pissed 
           but does nothing.  Angry White Guy doesn(cid:146)t like the look he(cid:146)s 
           getting from Donald.  

                                 ANGRY WHITE GUY (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Fuckin(cid:146) coon!  Fuck Rodney King!

           The Angry White Guy starts to swing his gun around.  But 
           Donald shoots first, BLASTS OUT THE COUNTER TOP. He lifts his 
           gun from hiding - a .357 Magnum.  He shoots again.  Angry 
           White Guy takes the bullet.  Drops dead on the floor.  The 
           Hispanic Guy takes off running.

           VIDEO

           We see NEWS FOOTAGE of Bradley announcing a city-wide curfew.

                                 BRADLEY
                        ...At this time I(cid:146)m calling upon people of

                        go.

           VIDEO

           As we come out of the Bradley video, we go into NBC LOCAL 
           NEWS.  PAUL MOYERS is going on about the riots, how bad the 
           riots are, how much property is burning...

           Then he announces the station is going to cut to the SERIES 
           FINALE OF THE COSBY SHOW.  Yes.  They are cutting away from 
           the burning of LA to the Cosby Show. 

           COSBY/UPRISING MONTAGE

           CROSS CUT with each other, we see SCENES FROM THE COSBY SHOW, 
           and NEWS FOOTAGE OF THE UPRISING now in full flower.

           We see buildings burning in South Central, in Compton, in 
           Fairfax...  Hell, in most of LA.
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   115.

           We see Cosby joking and mugging for the cameras.

           We see people looting, grabbing and stealing all they can 
           carry.

           We see the Huxtables yucking it up on TV.

           We see in Los Angeles the city on fire, the police trying to 
           bring back order.  Trying, but, for the moment, failing.

           We see a sitcom full of beautiful black people espousing 
           family unity.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           A building is burning.  Truly, yet another building is 
           burning.  A fire crew pulls up.  Among them are Williams, 
           Captain CARL BUTLER, Kilmartin and RICK REYES.  Immediately 
           they(cid:146)re out of their rigs, hooking up hoses...  They start 
           putting water on the fire, beating it down.

           As they work, a CROWD begins to gather.  Some of the firemen 
           start to get a little anxious.

                                 REYES
                        What are we doing, Captain?

                                 BUTLER
                        Keep on it.

           They hit up the fire a moment longer, but the crowd isn(cid:146)t 
           looking any friendlier.

           Then, a car pulls up.  We(cid:146)ve seen the car before.  PSYCHO 
           gets out.  He(cid:146)s toting a very nasty-looking assault rifle.

           Pyscho puts the gun to Butler(cid:146)s head.

                                 PSYCHO
                        Yo!  Yo, what the fuck you doin(cid:146)?

           The firemen freeze.  Best not to move too quickly around an 
           unstable individual.

                                 PSYCHO (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Motherfuckers, let it burn!  Better let 
                        that shit burn, or I(cid:146)ll blast you.

           Turning toward Kilmartin.

                                 PSYCHO  (CONT’D)
                        What?  What, bitch?

           Now Psycho moves toward Butler.  All the while he chants:
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   116.

                                 PSYCHO (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        The roof, the roof, the roof, is on fire. 
                        We don’t need no water, let the 
                        motherfucker burn.  The roof, the roof, 
                        the roof, is on fire. We don’t need no 
                        water...

           Psycho presses the muzzle of the rifle against Butler(cid:146)s head.

                                 PSYCHO (CONT’D)
                        Let the motherfucker burn!

                                 WILLIAMS
                        Don(cid:146)t do it, brother.

           Now Psycho turns his attention - and by extension his rage 
           and weapon - to Williams.

                                 PSYCHO
                        Brother?  I look like your motherfucking 
                        brother, bitch?  Try to nigga me up like 
                        you know me?

                                 WILLIAMS
                        We(cid:146)re not taking sides.  We(cid:146)re just trying 
                        to put out the fire.

                                 PSYCHO
                        You ain(cid:146)t no motherfuckin(cid:146) Smokey the 
                        Bear.  You ain(cid:146)t gonna do shit, nigga, but 
                        stand there and let the bitch burn the 
                        fuck down.

           Butler(cid:146)s radio goes off.  Again, Psycho returns his attention 
           to Butler as the radio crackles.

                                 PSYCHO (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Lemme have that shit.  Give it over!

           Butler holds out his radio.  Psycho pretty much rips it from 
           his hands.

                                 WILLIAMS
                        Trying to help, man...

           Psycho screaming into the radio:

                                 PSYCHO 
                        You hear me all you motherfuckers?  You 
                        better let that shit burn you all better 
                        let that shit burn!

                                 WILLIAMS
                        Just trying to save our city...
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   117.

                                 PSYCHO
                        You want to do somethin(cid:146), bitch?  Run! 
                        Run, Motherfuckers!

           All the firemen take off running as PSYCHO STARTS SHOOTING UP 
           THE FIRE TRUCKS.

           The firefighters race down the sidewalk running like they(cid:146)re 
           trying to beat the devil.  In a very real sense they are.  

           As they run, at a small house up ahead of them, they are 
           waved over by BERTILA POZO, a Hispanic woman in her late 
           thirties.  

           INT. POZO HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The fire crew is sitting huddled and scared in the smallish 
           house as Pozo and her daughters give the firefighters water.  
           They sit scared.  Finally, from Butler:

                                 BUTLER
                        Shouldn(cid:146)t(cid:146)ve handed over my radio.  Those 
                        things are, like, three grand a pop.  
                        Gonna get my ass chewed for that. 

           The firemen sit for a long beat.

           I/E. CAR - NIGHT

           Tony is driving.  Ed is riding, as are Kipp and Eric.  A 
           KOREAN LANGUAGE STATION PLAYS ON THE RADIO.  THE ADDRESS OF A 
           STORE BEING LOOTED IS GIVEN.

                                 EDWARD
                        Hey, listen...  Western and Olympic.  
                        Let(cid:146)s go man.  Let(cid:146)s hit it up.

                                 TONY
                        This is gonna be cool.

                                 EDWARD
                        Gonna be fucking cool.

           Tony DRIVES ON A BIT until he comes to the address he(cid:146)s heard 
           on the radio.  A mini-mart.  They pull up well short of the 
           mini-mart, but they can see shadows moving around it.

                                 EDWARD (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Yo, there they are.

           Edward flashes the lights, honks the horn.  He screams out of 
           the car window.
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   118.

                                 EDWARD (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Hey...  Hey!  Get away from there!  You 
                        hear me?

           There is movement up the block, but hard to tell what(cid:146)s 
           happening.

                                 EDWARD (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Give me the gun.

           As Tony hands over the gun:

                                 EDWARD (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        Gonna go kick the Brother Man out of here.  
                        This is Koreatow--

           Real suddenly, A COUPLE OF SHOTS RING OUT, SMASH THROUGH THE 
           WINDSHIELD OF THE CAR.  They slam into Edward(cid:146)s chest leaving 
           him dead right there in the driver(cid:146)s seat.  As before, there 
           is nothing pretty about this.  Edward is bleeding out from 
           his massive wounds.

           Tony, Kipp and Eric; they go nuts with fear as the MEN IN 
           SHADOW, start running up from the dark toward them.

                                 TONY
                        Don(cid:146)t shoot!  Don(cid:146)t kill us!

           When they reach the light of the car, we can see the men 
           running up from the shadows are KOREAN, with guns in their 
           hands.  When Tony sees that they are brothers of the skin, he 
           yells at them with full rage:

                                 TONY (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        You killed him!  He was coming to help!

                                 SHOP OWNER
                        Thought he was a looter.  Thought he was 
                        going to burn the store.

           CARD:

           AT THE END OF THE SECOND NIGHT OF THE RIOTING:

           AT LEAST 25 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.  FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO  
           PEOPLE WERE INJURED.  MORE THAN 1,000 FIRES BURNED.  PROPERTY 
           DAMAGE WAS ESTIMATED BETWEEN 200 AND 250 MILLION DOLLARS.

           EXT. CALIFORNIA MARKET/PARKING LOT - MORNING

           SUPERIMPOSE: FRIDAY, MAY 1st, 1992

           Richard Rhee gets out of a sleeping bag.  THERE ARE NOTHING 
           BUT SPENT CASINGS ALL OVER THE GROUND.  He starts to head 
           inside.  To one of his MEN he says:
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   119.

                                 RHEE
                        I gotta go to the bathroom.

           As Rhee heads inside, a guy calls from the roof:

                                 ROOF GUY
                        Richard!  

           Rhee looks, sees LOOTERS moving for the store.  Harder-
           looking, more determined to burn these guys out than the last 
           bunch of looters we saw.  Day three, and it(cid:146)s not letting up.  

                                 RHEE
                        ...Shit...

           Rhee again takes up position with his gun.

           INT. CITY HALL/FABIANI(cid:146)S OFFICE - DAY

           Fabiani, Hunt and Hillmann are slumped in chairs.  All look 
           wasted as though they(cid:146)ve been days without sleep.

                                 FABIANI
                        It(cid:146)s slowing down.

                                 HUNT
                        Yes.  

                                 FABIANI
                        But it(cid:146)s not under control?

                                 HILLMANN
                        The Guard are being used to secure areas 
                        that have already been pacified by the PD.  

                                 FABIANI
                        We didn(cid:146)t call them in to stand watch over 
                        burned out buildings.

                                 HUNT
                        They(cid:146)re caught up in legalese.  The 
                        military(cid:146)s not supposed to perform law 
                        enforcement duties.  They(cid:146)re reviewing 
                        every request we make.  It(cid:146)s easier to 
                        have them stand on street corners than do 
                        anything of substance.  Even at that we 
                        need more bodies.

                                 FABIANI 
                        Everything but the locust, huh?  I think 
                        the thing to do...we need to start 
                        thinking about bringing in Federal troops.

                                 HUNT
                        I think the Chief--
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   120.

                                 FABIANI
                        The Chief(cid:146)s not part of this anymore.  No 
                        more than the Mayor is.  From here on, for 
                        them, it(cid:146)s face time, ass covering and 
                        finger pointing.  It(cid:146)s politics.

                                 HILLMANN
                        But you(cid:146)re better than all that, are you?

                                 FABIANI
                        Just realistic.  I(cid:146)m guessing being number 
                        two in command of a city that(cid:146)s gone to 
                        riot isn(cid:146)t going to do much for my resume.  
                        Same as I(cid:146)d say your chances of ever being 
                        Chief are about done. 

                                 HUNT
                        Vernon left on vacation.  The day the 
                        riots started, he picked up and left for 
                        Florida.  He called once from the beach to 
                        see if we needed a hand.

                                 FABIANI
                        What(cid:146)d you tell him?

                                 HUNT
                        Fuck off.

                                 HILLMANN
                        You think the Governor(cid:146)ll go cap in hand 
                        to the President for troops?

                                 FABIANI
                        I don(cid:146)t know.  But if we start asking now 
                        we(cid:146)re likely to get them by next week.

           VIDEO

           We see NEWS FOOTAGE of Rodney King speaking to a slick of 
           REPORTERS.

                                 KING
                        People, I just want to say...can we get 
                        along?  Can we all get along?  Can we stop 
                        making it horrible for the older people 
                        and the kids?

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           We see HOWARD(cid:146)S CREW, out knocking down a fire.  As they 
           work, they are approached by a large group of HISPANIC GUYS 
           wielding machetes.  This fire crew(cid:146)s already seen much 
           violence, so Howard(cid:146)s reaction is as to be expected.
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   121.

                                 HOWARD
                        ...Shit...

                                 MACHETE GUY
                        Hey...  Hey!

           There is a tense moment, then:

                                 MACHETTE GUY 
                        You go on and do work.  Anybody tries to 
                        mess with you, we gonna fuck (cid:145)em up!

           Howard let(cid:146)s out a long, deep breath.  A bullet(cid:146)s just been 
           dodged.  Cautiously but firmly to his crew as the Hispanic 
           men stand guard:

                                 HOWARD
                        Come on.  Come on, let(cid:146)s go; let(cid:146)s knock 
                        this fire down.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           A car drives toward a police road block.  The COPS wave the 
           car down.  The car stops, sits for a beat, then the driver 
           guns the car dead for the cops.  The cops start shooting.  

           The car - taking hits - swerves, smashes into a light post...  
           It sits for a beat.

           The door swings open.  A man gets out.  He fires at the cops 
           with an automatic weapon.  The cops fire back, shoot the guy, 
           then move cautiously for the body.

           As they move, they HEAR A FIRE BAND RADIO.  As they get 
           close, they see the radio on the floor of the car.  The 
           driver, the dead man: IT(cid:146)S PSYCHO.

           EXT. CALIFORNIA MARKET - NIGHT

           Rhee and his men are still standing guard.  Lights come up in 
           the distance.  Vehicles are moving for the market.  There(cid:146)s a 
           tense moment as Rhee and his men get ready to repel yet 
           another attack.

           But as the vehicles move closer, we can see its not looters, 
           but a small convoy of NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS.  The troops draw 
           close to the market, stop.  A NG LIEUTENANT gets out of a 
           Humvee, crosses to Rhee and his men.  

                                 NG LIEUTEANANT
                        Everybody here all right?  Anybody need 
                        help?

           Rhee can(cid:146)t believe this.  Three days; now help arrives.

           VIDEO

           We see President G.H.W BUSH addressing the nation in regard 
           to the (cid:147)rioting(cid:148) in Los Angeles.

                                 BUSH
                        Tonight I want to talk to you about 
                        violence in our cities and justice for our 
                        citizens, two big issues that have 
                        collided on the streets of Los Angeles.

           We see NEWS FOOTAGE of LAPD COPS - now back in control of the 
           streets - rounding up looters.  They(cid:146)re not being pleasant 
           about it.

                                 BUSH (V.O.) (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        What we saw last night and the night 
                        before in Los Angeles is not about civil 
                        rights. It’s not about the great cause of 
                        equality that all Americans must uphold. 
                        It’s not a message of protest. It’s been 
                        the brutality of a mob, pure and simple. 

           We see NEWS FOOTAGE of National Guard road blocks set up.  
           Blacks, Hispanics are being pulled from their cars and 
           searched.  We also see the MASS DETENTION of minorities.

                                 BUSH (V.O.) (CONT(cid:146)D)
                        The wanton destruction of life and 
                        property is not a legitimate expression of 
                        outrage with injustice. It is itself 
                        injustice....  To the good people of Los 
                        Angeles, caught at the center of this 
                        senseless suffering: The violence will 
                        end. Justice will be served. Hope will 
                        return.  Thank you, and may God bless the 
                        United States of America.

           CARD:

           BY THE END OF THE THIRD DAY OF RIOTING:

           AT LEAST 40 PEOPLE ARE DEAD.  MORE THAN 1,419 PEOPLE ARE 
           INJURED.  THERE HAVE BEEN 4,393 ARRESTS.  SOME 4,536 FIRES 
           ARE BURNING

           CARD:

           OFFICIALLY, THE UPRISING WOULD CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS.  
           AT ITS CONCLUSION:

           AT LEAST 51 PEOPLE WERE KILLED.  MORE THAN 2,328 PEOPLE WERE 
           INJURED.  OF THEM, 228 OF THOSE INJURIES WERE CRITICAL.  
           NEARLY 10,000 PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED.  CLOSE TO 6,405 FIRES 
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   123.

           WERE SET.  THE TOTAL ESTIMATED DAMAGES WERE $717 MILLION 
           DOLLARS.

           EXT. COMMAND POST - MORNING

           We(cid:146)ve got Moulin, Jefferson and Tatreau walking for a police 
           squad car, one of many that is lined up in a bit of a 
           caravan.  The three get in the car along with a DRIVER.  The 
           Driver pulls the car out, and the caravan heads off.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           We now see the caravan driving through the streets of south 
           central.  No lights or sirens.  The group is out cruising, 
           taking a damage assessment tour of the area.  The area itself 
           is mostly quiet now thanks to the NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS who 
           are spiked on just about every corner.  And, sadly, the area 
           does look like a war zone.  There are burned out buildings, 
           wrecked and burned cars, shops that have been looted, what 
           remains of their wares spilled out on to the street.

           I/E. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           We are now in the car with Moulin, Jefferson and Tatreau.  
           The three cops look around them, see all the damage and 
           destruction...  For the first time they can see just how 
           badly the LAPD failed the people of the city.

           VIDEO

           We see NEWS FOOTAGE of Chief Daryl Gates personally leading 
           the arrest of Damian Williams.

           INT. 77TH STREET STATION - DAY

           We see a DETECTIVE talking with Bobby Green.  The speech he 
           gives is vaguely similar to that given to Joseph Du at the 
           top of the show.

                                 77TH DETECTIVE #4
                        You were right there when it happened.  
                        You saved Reginald Denny(cid:146)s life.  You, 
                        those other folks; far as the riots go 
                        you(cid:146)re as close to a hero as the city(cid:146)s 
                        got.  And you saw who beat him.  Saw them 
                        up close.  You help us, these thugs are 
                        going to jail for a long time.  A long 
                        time.

                                 GREEN
                        They(cid:146)re going to know who I am?  I would 
                        have to go to court, right?  
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   124.

                                 77TH DETECTIVE #3
                        Would you have to testify?  We would, we 
                        would need you to testify, yeah.  Yes.  
                        We(cid:146)re not gonna just throw you under the 
                        bus.  The department(cid:146)ll give you all the 
                        protection it can.

                                 77TH DETECTIVE #4
                        Look, Reginald Denny and every other 
                        victim of this...this riot deserves 
                        justice.  If you testify, they(cid:146)ll get it.

           I/E. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The tour with Moulin, Jefferson and Tatreau continues.

           We see SIGNS ON BUILDINGS THAT READ: BLACK OWNED, yet still 
           the buildings are burned.

           We see PEOPLE - people of all colors - out cleaning up, 
           TRYING TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER.

           We see DISPLACED FAMILIES little better than refugees in 
           their own city.

           INT. GREEN HOUSE - DAY

           The phone is ringing.  Vera answers it.

                                 VERA
                        Hello?

                                 NASTY VOICE (V.O.)
                        Nobody told you to get in our shit, 
                        Motherfucker.  You want trouble?  Now we 
                        gonna fuck your bitch ass up!  You dead, 
                        bitch!

           Vera is straight scared, and who wouldn(cid:146)t be by such a call.

           INT. 77TH STREET STATION/WATCH COMMAND OFFICE - DAY

           We are again in the rather cramped and unimpressive watch 
           command office of the 77th St. station.  The Watch Commander 
           is talking with Bobby and Vera.  Again, this scene plays 
           similarly to the scene with Joseph Du at the top of the show.

                                 WATCH COMMANDER
                        Threat and intimidation.  They(cid:146)re 
                        thugs;they know what it means if you 
                        testify, so they lash out the only way 
                        they can. I think the thing you want to do 
                        is not make yourself a target.
                         LET IT FALL - LOS ANGELES: RIOT TO UPRISING   125.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           We are in the middle of the trial of Damian Williams and the 
           rest of the LA 4.  At the moment, Bobby Green is on the stand 
           being examined by the DDA.

                                 WILLIAMS DDA
                        You(cid:146)d never met Reginald Denny before.  
                        You didn(cid:146)t know him.

                                 BOBBY
                        No, I did not.

                                 WILLIAMS DDA
                        But you left the safety of your own home, 
                        your risked your own life to save his.  
                        Why?

                                 BOBBY
                        It(cid:146)s the same as I tell my son: colors on 
                        the outside, not the inside.  I see this 
                        man getting beat, he(cid:146)s a truck driver same 
                        as me.  I felt like I was getting hurt.  
                        The man was already down, and they kept 
                        hitting him.

                                 WILLIAMS DDA
                        Weren(cid:146)t you upset about the Rodney King 
                        verdicts?  Weren(cid:146)t you upset about Latasha 
                        Harlins?

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah, I was pissed.  It was like there was 
                        no justice.

                                 WILLIAMS DDA
                        Then why not beat a white man in the

           We see NEWS FOOTAGE announcing the verdict in the (cid:147)LA 4.(cid:148) 
           Trial.  The gist of things: shockingly, Williams is only 
           convicted of simple mayhem and misdemeanor assault, the least 
           serious of the charges he faced.

           INT. DOWNTOWN COURTHOUSE - DAY

           We are in the courtroom as JUDGE OUDERKIRK passes sentence on 
           Damian Williams.  Williams - sporting a coat and tie - looks 
           nothing like the gang banger who led the uprising.

           As the sentence is read, the CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Bobby Green 
           who(cid:146)s in the gallery with Vera.

                                 OUDERKIRK
                        Based on the convictions returned, the 
                        court sentences Mr. Williams to a term in 
                        an appropriate institution for ten years.

                        be eligible for parole in three years and 
                        eight months.

           As the BLACKS in the gallery CHEER the brevity of the 
           sentence, THE CAMERA MOVES IN TIGHT ON Bobby, who sits with 
           Vera, shaking his head in disbelief.
