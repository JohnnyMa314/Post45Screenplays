           JOE LIEBERMAN - VICE PRESIDENT

           Continue to pull back until the entire ballot fills the 
           frame. Ten candidates are listed on BOTH SIDES OF THE PAGE - 
           Libertarian, Socialist, Constitution, Green (Ralph Nader). 
           It's a messy MAZE of names, numbers and arrows that point 
           toward tiny holes that line down the center of the ballot. 

           In 24 hours, this little document will be known to the world 
           as THE BUTTERFLY BALLOT. 

           A STYLUS, the knob-like pointer used to punch holes into 
           ballots, hovers between the #4 hole for Buchanan and the #5 
           hole for Gore...tentative...unsure which one to punch. 

           PAN UP TO - THE VOTER. An elderly JEWISH WOMAN with a gold 
           mezuzah dangling from her neck stares down at the ballot. She 
           looks a touch confused.  

           PAN ACROSS THE VOTING BOOTHS.

           Filled with mostly ELDERLY VOTERS, they all share the Jewish 
           Woman's slightly confused expression. One man lines the 
           stylus up to Al Gore's name and guides it to the 
           corresponding hole.

           A woman leans right up to the ballot to make sure she's about 
           to punch a Gore vote. Everyone is tentative, afraid to punch. 

           The Jewish Woman finally punches the ballot. Click. 

           SERIES OF CUTS: Another stylus punches a vote (click) and 
           another (click) and another (click) and another (click)... 

           BACK TO THE JEWISH WOMAN. She hasn't pulled her stylus out, 
           wondering...”Did I just vote for the wrong person?” 

           SLOW PAN from her stylus to the corresponding candidate that 
           she just voted for... 

           Pat Buchanan. 

           INT. GORE CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - NASHVILLE - DAY

           A large warehouse that has been converted into a wide open 
           office. Gore/Lieberman posters cover the walls. A banner 
           hangs - “Welcome to Nashville!”

           The middle of the room is a giant bullpen that bustles with 
           life - staffers frantically make phone calls, trade off 
           faxes. Pure adrenaline pumps the energized room.   

           In a ring around the bullpen are larger offices filled with 
           SENIOR CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS (Mark Fabiani, Chris Lehane, Donna 
           Brazile...) all working the phones. We hear snippets of: 

                                 SENIOR CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL #1
                        ...need to satellite Lieberman to

                        ...I haven't read a poll in at 
                        least fifteen minutes.  

           We travel through the hectic bullpen into THE BOILER ROOM, 
           the election day nerve center that is a maze of computers, 
           TVs and volunteers in headsets, rolling out calls: 

                                 VARIOUS VOLUNTEERS
                        I'm calling from Gore Campaign 
                        Headquarters to remind you to get 
                        out and vote toda...

           We travel past the volunteers to THE KITCHEN, a small room in 
           the back that used to be the actual kitchen. It's now filled 
           with tiny cubicles where college students and old ladies 
           bustle paperwork. Staplers staple.

           Crammed in the smallest cubicle against the back wall is RON 
           KLAIN, 39. Casually dressed in a black sweatshirt, Klain is 
           the ultimate overachiever - brilliant, successful, focused. 

           He types on his laptop, phone clutched under his chin as 
           reads from the computer screen: 

                                 KLAIN

                        “The foundation of a Democracy...”

           His assistant, GLEN ROTH, 22, shouts from another cubicle:

                        ABC on three. Winning electoral, 
                        losing popular. 

           Klain clicks over to the other line. 

                                 KLAIN
                        Rules are rules and Governor Bush

                        “...is based upon its citizens...”

           Without looking up, he hands off a memo to a passing staffer. 

                                 KLAIN (CONT’D)
                        “...right to vote. It is our duty 
                        as Americans to fulfill our 
                        responsibility...”

                        “...because we must never forget

           On the other line is AP journalist, RON FOURNIER.

           Klain hurries across the Boiler Room, weaving in and out of 
           desks and younger volunteers. He stops at THE CLOSET, a 
           converted janitor's shed that only fits a TV, a computer and 
           the back of a shiny, bald head. Polling data from across the 
           country flashes across Whouley's computer screen.

           MICHAEL WHOULEY (pronounced Hool-ey), 42, spins around.  He's 
           a gaunt, mean-looking guy who sounds like a Boston teamster.

           INT. THERESA LEPORE'S OFFICE - PALM BEACH COUNTY - MORNING 

           The sounds of multiple PHONES RINGING. 

           THERESA LEPORE, 45, a frail, slender woman with a quiet 
           demeanor is on the phone. Her nose is bright red from a 
           chronic sinus infection. Teddy bears fill her shelves. A 
           nameplate on her desk says THERESA LEPORE, SUPERVISOR.

           Out the window, she sees a small CROWD of seniors gather 
           outside the building. They're upset, a few women are crying.

           As Klain enters, DAVID MOREHOUSE, a stocky aide with a bad 
           limp is exiting the hotel.

           Klain walks up to a suite that's flanked by two stone-faced 
           SECRET SERVICE AGENTS. An Agent signals Klain to wait.

           He gets confirmation, opens the door for Klain.

           INT. LOEWS SUITE - NASHVILLE - DAY

           Klain sits in a posh suite across from BILL DALEY. Bald head 
           and thick neck, looks like a 1930's Chicago gangster.

                                 DALEY
                        Look, Ron, we're putting out

                                 KLAIN
                        Maybe it has something to do with 
                        the fact that he let Tony Coehlo 
                        force me out of the campaign. 

           Daley softens, feels bad about what had happened to Klain. 

                                 DALEY
                        Come on, Ron, everyone knows Coehlo 
                        was a big mistake. That's why he's 
                        gone and you're here. 

                                 KLAIN
                        Yeah, writing press releases for 
                        the campaign I used to run...before 
                        you were brought in, that is.

           Daley leans forward, sincerely confides to Klain: 

                                 DALEY
                        The first thing I did when I got 
                        here was bring you back. I did it 
                        because I hate what happened to 
                        you, it was bullshit and I want to 
                        get you back on the inside. 

           Klain gets up to leave. 

                                 KLAIN
                        Please tell the Vice President that 
                        I'm not interested in an eight-year 
                        demotion, but I truly appreciate 
                        the generous offer.

           Klain walks out of the room.

           INT. KLAIN'S HOTEL ROOM - NASHVILLE - LATER

           Changing into a plain gray suit, Klain fumbles with the tie, 
           still angry about the meeting with Daley. His wife, MONICA, 
           38, smart and warm, walks out of the bathroom in a robe.

           Klain continues fumbling with the tie, getting more 
           frustrated with it. Monica takes over, ties it smoothly.

           INT. BUSH CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - AUSTIN, TX - DAY

           A plain-looking office with cubicles and kitchenettes. If it 
           weren't for the BUSH/CHENEY posters and campaign 
           paraphernalia everywhere, it'd look like an insurance office.

           Holding court with a group of early-twenties VOLUNTEERS is 
           BEN GINSBERG, 49, short and bald with a thin gray beard. 
           Ginsberg has a dry-but-playful demeanor.

                        So we're all seated at dinner, and 
                        everyone bows their heads for 
                        prayer. Governor Bush grabs my 
                        hand, and I'm thinking, what's a 
                        Jew from Pennsylvania doing here 
                        praying with the Governor of Texas?

                        “It's about time we got some

           Applause and whoops!! Everyone holds up three fingers in the 
           “W” salute. They love their candidate. 

           The campaign manager, JOE ALLBAUGH, a big lug of a guy with a

           The color completely drained from her face, Theresa LePore is 
           seated in a conference room across from CAROL ROBERTS, 70s, 
           raspy smoker's voice with dyed bright red hair, and JUDGE 
           CHARLES BURTON, 42, a slightly overweight, jovial type who 
           seems undisturbed by the day's events.

           Out the window, the crowd of angry geriatrics has doubled in 
           size. A few people have already made “Re-Vote!” signs. 

           Judge Burton examines the Butterfly Ballot. 

                                 JUDGE BURTON
                        This is what all the fuss is about?

           An annoyed Carol Roberts snaps at him:

                        Your honor, I've had three friends

                           (pointing out the window)
                        They’re very upset.

           Judge Burton takes another look at the messy ballot. Carol 
           Roberts shakes her head, Theresa LePore looks mortified.

                        a hard time reading it. 

           Out the window, a local NEWS VAN pulls up. The three stare at 
           it in silence, realizing that this could blow up into

           Pull away from the TV up to Ron Klain's utterly devastated 
           face. In a conference room littered with coffee cups and 
           pizza boxes, campaign STAFFERS stare at the TV in shock. 

           A female STAFFER (Jill Alper) bursts out in tears, others 
           start to follow suit. Klain hugs Jill as he stares at the TV, 
           his earlier anger washed away. All that's left is defeat.  

           INT. BUSH CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - AUSTIN - SAME

           A WOMAN standing beside Ginsberg is crying as well, but these 
           are tears of joy. Confetti on the ground, it's clear they've 
           been celebrating. Joe Allbaugh hurries into the room.

           another cell phone.

           EXT. LOEWS HOTEL - UNDERGROUND PARKING - NASHVILLE - NIGHT

           A motorcade of limousines are parked in the underground 
           structure of the Loews. The senior members of the Gore team 
           hurry into separate cars with David Morehouse struggling 
           behind everyone else, limping badly. 

           AL and TIPPER GORE (shot from behind) hurry from the hotel 
           into their limo.

           INT. KLAIN'S HOTEL ROOM - NASHVILLE - NIGHT

           Klain gently wakes up his wife who’s fallen asleep on the 
           couch. Her groggy face anxiously looks up at him.

           He slowly shakes his head, “no.” She sits up, gives him a 
           huge hug. Tears roll down her face.

                                 MONICA
                        I'm so sorry. 

           Klain clutches his wife. This meant more to him than he'd 
           like to admit. 

           EXT. NASHVILLE - NIGHT

           Rain pours down on the motorcade as it drives through the 
           dark and misty night, only penetrated by the flashing reds 
           and blues from the police cars. A funeral procession.

           INT. THE CLOSET - NASHVILLE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Whouley sits in The Closet, stares in disbelief at the 
           official website for the Secretary of State of Florida. 

           The vote total shows Bush leading Florida by 52,346 votes. 
           Whouley is stunned, shocked, upset...he just can't believe 
           they lost. He takes off his headset, getting up to leave. 

           Then...

           The number on the screen drops to 47,638. 

           Whouley looks back at the website. “Did that just happen?” 

           The number drops again to 42,091.

           INT. KLAIN'S HOTEL ROOM - NASHVILLE - NIGHT

           RAIN STREAKS the window as Klain picks up items off the desk. 
           His cell phone RINGS. He stares at it for a second, not even 
           sure if he wants to answer. He reluctantly picks it up: 

                                 KLAIN
                        Yeah?

           On the other end is Ron Fournier, the journalist from the AP.

                                 RON FOURNIER V.O.
                        It's Fournier.

                        Because we lost the election, Ron.

                        nation, has not yet called this 
                        election? 

           Slight beat. This is news to Klain.

                        But...all the networks called it,

                        We still believe Florida’s too

                        what the hell you guys are doing. 

           Fournier hangs up. Klain looks at Monica as he speed-dials a 
           number on his phone. 

                                 MONICA

           someone is trying to reach him.

           INT. THE CLOSET - NASHVILLE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Whouley dials a number, gets a busy signal. Glancing at the 
           computer, he sees... 

           42,091 drop to 38,761. He screams out the door:

                        in Volusia went crazy. It just 
                        added 2,800 votes to Bush's total 
                        and subtracted tons from Gore. Our 
                        total in that county is negative 
                        16,000 votes!

           INT. BOILER ROOM - NASHVILLE - SIMULTANEOUS

           The tension in the Boiler Room has been deflated. People are 
           starting to breathe again, nervous “I can’t believe that just 
           happened” glances. Whouley grabs his chest. 

                                 WHOULEY
                        I swear to God I almost had a 
                        fuckin’ heart attack. 

           On the computer - Bush's lead has shrunk to 5,843 votes. 

           INT. KLAIN'S HOTEL ROOM - NASHVILLE - NIGHT

           He grabs his suitcase from the closet, flings it onto the 
           bed. Monica begins pulling his clothes out of drawers.

           EXT. WAR MEMORIAL PLAZA - NASHVILLE - CONTINUOUS

           Morehouse steps out of the limo, struggling with his knee. Up 
           ahead he sees... 

           Al Gore already out of the car.  Holding hands with Tipper, 
           they make a fast beeline for the backstage entrance. 

           Stunned, Morehouse takes off after them. Limping badly, he 
           bumps into people, dodges others, holding his knee in pain. 

           He collides with a woman, knocking them both to the ground. 
           Morehouse struggles to his feet and limps on.  

           Right as he closes in on Gore, a SECRET SERVICE grabs him. 

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                        Hold it!

           Morehouse quickly sticks out his HARD PIN, a red pentagon-
           shaped lapel pin. 

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, sir. 

           He lets Morehouse go.

           INT. HALLWAY TO STAGE - WAR MEMORIAL - CONTINUOUS

           Gore and Tipper are halfway down a long hallway that leads 
           right onto the stage. 

           Morehouse BURSTS through the back door, breathlessly limping, 
           trying to catch up to them:

                        Mr. Vice President, Daley needs to 
                        speak to you! It’s urgent! He just 
                        needs five minutes! 

           Gore keeps walking.

                                 AL GORE
                        I just spoke to Bush, he's waiting 
                        for me to give this speech.

           Morehouse's knee finally gives in, he grabs it, STUMBLING 
           BACK in pain. Gore and Tipper are now a few feet from the 
           steps to the stage...

           Morehouse grits his teeth and goes for broke. He squeezes 
           past them and JUMPS onto the steps, physically blocking them 
           with his stocky frame. Sweat pours down his red face. 

                                 DAVID MOREHOUSE
                        Mr. Vice President, there's 
                        something wrong with Florida. 

           EXT. CAPITAL BUILDING - AUSTIN, TX - NIGHT

           The excited crowd stands in the rain waiting for Bush to give 
           his victory speech. People look at their watches, wondering 
           what the hold up is. 

           INT. GOVENOR'S MANSION - AUSTIN, TX - NIGHT

           The BUSH FAMILY (minus George W.) sits around the television 
           in the elegant living room, anxiously waiting for Gore to 
           make his concession. 

           Florida Governor JEB BUSH, a tall man with a puckish face, 
           stands in the back with Joe Allbaugh.  

                                 JEB BUSH
                           (whispers to Ginsberg)
                        My people aren't seeing the same 
                        numbers as the networks. 

                                 JOE ALLBAUGH 
                        Neither is Karl.

           If Karl doesn't see it, it's serious.  George W. Bush’s 
           daughter JENNA, perks up in front of the TV.

                                 JENNA
                        Uncle Jeb, when's he going to 
                        concede?

           But GEORGE W. BUSH enters (shot from behind):

                        there.

           INT. BASEMENT - WAR MEMORIAL PLAZA - SIMULATANEOUS

           Gore and his Team (along with family members) huddled in the 
           basement. Excitement in the room as everyone knows something 
           is up. David Morehouse ices his elevated leg, looks like he 
           scored the winning touchdown and is out for the season. 

           The BLURRED figure of Daley rushes past CAMERA and grabs Al 
           Gore (shot from behind)

           Everyone in the room turns to look.

           INT. KLAIN’S HOTEL ROOM - NASHVILLE - LATER

           Klain rushes like hell, throwing things in a bag.  Monica 
           chases, helping as much as possible.

                        Governor, Al Gore is on the phone.

           The room looks confused/worried. 

           INT. ANTEROOM - WAR MEMORIAL PLAZA - NIGHT

           GORE, holding the phone, watched by Daley. Others visible 
           through the doorway in another room.

                                 AL GORE
                        I'm sorry to keep you waiting, 
                        Governor, but circumstances have

           CUT TO - DOWNSTAIRS. Everyone can hear Bush's side of the 
           conversation. They are stunned.

           amusement, “Did he really just say that?” 

           CUT TO - BUSH. He jerks his head back, can't believe Gore 
           just said that.

           EXT. PALM BEACH DEMOCRATIC HEADQUARTERS - MORNING

           Thousands of angry elderly Jews swarm the single-story 
           Democratic Headquarters in Palm Beach County. They line up at 
           a row of tables where lawyers take affidavits. 

           A group of PRIESTS stand in a circle, heads bowed in prayer. 
           Two twelve-year-old BOYS wheel a cooler around, selling 
           bottled water (they made $150 that day). 

           Ragtag groups of Democratic and Republican PROTESTORS stand 
           across the street holding signs - “Dummy-crats,” “Gore = 
           Milosevic,” “Bush is a Drunk,” “Count all the Votes.” Cars 
           drive by, HONKING for both sides. COPS mill about, amused.

           Near the Headquarters, Klain is SWARMED by SENIOR CITIZENS:

           INT. PALM BEACH DEMOCRATIC HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Safe from the geriatric mob, a disheveled Klain is on his 
           cell phone inside the building. 

                                 KLAIN
                        I'm trapped in “Night of the Living

                        don't yell “Bingo.”  

           On a TV in the corner he sees PAT BUCHANAN on the Today Show 
           (actual footage). Klain hurries over. 

                                 KLAIN
                        Turn on Today. I'll call you back. 

           He hangs up. From the TV:

                                 PAT BUCHANAN
                        “When I took one look at that 
                        ballot on election night, I think 
                        one of the networks had it up 
                        there, it's very sim...easy for me 
                        to see how someone could have voted 
                        for me in the belief they voted for 
                        Al Gore.” 

           Klain looks surprised that Buchanan said it. 

           THE TV CUTS TO - JESSE JACKSON, marching through Palm Beach 
           County with African-American and elderly Jewish protestors 
           waving “COUNT ALL THE VOTES!” signs (actual footage).

           A hand taps Klain on the shoulder. He turns around to see 
           MYRIAM, the Jewish Woman from the opening of the film.

                                 MYRIAM

           Establishing shot of TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA. Flying over the 
           tiny downtown area, we see the state's phallic Capitol 
           Building, known as “Eskew's Erection.” It towers over the Old 
           West-themed Adams Street that is crammed with people. 

           EXT. BUSH BUILDING - TALLAHASSEE - DAY

           A town car pulls up in front of a three-story brick building 
           flanked by trees on a quiet Tallahassee street. 

           Baker walks out of the town car, flanked by his long-term 
           associates, MARGARET TUTWILER, 50s, plump, pensive, and BOB 
           ZOELLICK, 50s, intellectual, patrician.

           George H.W. Bush Building. Leather chairs, a long conference 
           table adorned with water, fruit and pastries. Pictures of 
           former president George H.W. Bush cover the walls.

           At the table are Ginsberg, Allbaugh and bearded attorney 
           GEORGE TERWILLIGER, along with three other lawyers. Everyone 
           stands for Baker who is instantly unhappy.

                        to a minimum this time around.

           (Bloomingtails) and a hair salon for people (Nu Dimension).

           Through a dirty window we see the Democrats seated on

           Secretary of State WARREN CHRISTOPHER, 76. Wearing an 
           expensive Oxford suit, Christopher looks out of place.

                        elections must be held on a single 
                        day throughout the nation. There 
                        isn't a court in the state that 
                        would be crazy enough to grant them 
                        a re-vote.

                        I’ve been through a ballot con-
                        figuration dispute on the Connie 
                        Mack recount, there are no legal 
                        remedies.

           Baker leans forward.

                                 BAKER
                        I want to file a lawsuit in federal 
                        court as quickly as possible.

           The lawyers exchange glances, everyone hates the idea. 

                                 GINSBERG
                        It'd get tossed out immediately.  

                                 BAKER
                        You bet it will, but I want us on 
                        track to the U.S. Supreme Court.  

           Now the room is just confused, “this makes no sense.”

                                 GINSBERG
                        I don't think they'd even hear it.

                                 BOB ZOELLICK
                        And we'd get crucified by our own 
                        people for pushing a state issue 
                        into federal court. 

                                 BAKER
                        Listen up, folks -- you know, I 
                        love to call turkeys in the spring. 

           Everyone stares at Baker, confused (except for Margaret who's 
           smiling). Baker lets it sit for a beat. Then:

                        As did Lawton Chiles, the previous 
                        Governor of this great state of 
                        Florida. Although I would contend 
                        that I am the better shot. 

           Baker takes a long swig of Dr. Pepper, letting the room stay 
           confused. Finally: 

                                 BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Now there's no love lost between 
                        Chiles and the Bush family after 
                        that dirty campaign he ran against 
                        Jebbie in '94, but I always liked 
                        Lawton and every year before he 
                        passed on we would have ourselves a 
                        fine time calling turkeys in the 
                        spring.
                           (yells out the door)
                        Can I get another Dr. Pepper, 
                        please?! 

           He casually turns back to the room. 

                                 BAKER (CONT’D)
                        As a two-term Governor, Chiles 
                        appointed the majority of the 
                        Justices currently seated on the 
                        Florida Supreme Court. And I can 
                        tell you positively that he filled 
                        that court with...the BIGGEST 
                        FLAMING LIBERALS IN THE ENTIRE

           They’re slowly getting it. Baker stands up to make his point.

                        If we end up in the Florida Supreme 
                        Court we are dead. The U.S. Supreme 
                        Court is a long shot, but Florida 
                        is a NO SHOT. 
                           (then)
                        So we can drink tea and discuss the 
                        virtues of federalism or we can 
                        start throwin’ punches!

           Baker sits back down.

                        And, yes, we'll take a hit in the

           Christopher holds up the NY Times.

                        R.W. Apple wrote that we have a 
                        week to resolve this before the 
                        American people will lose their 
                        patience. I think we need to heed 
                        his advice. 

           Frustrated, Jack Young jumps in, refers to Klain:

                                 JACK YOUNG
                        We discussed hand recounts. If 
                        we're trailing at the end of the 
                        machine recount, we need to request 
                        a statewide hand recount.  

                                 DALEY
                        No way. 

           Klain is surprised, didn't know this wasn't an option.

                                 KLAIN
                        Why?

                                 DALEY
                        Because in order to get a statewide 
                        we’d have to convince each 
                        individual county to hand recount 
                        one percent of their votes first. 
                        That's sixty-seven hearings. And if 
                        every county agrees --

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        And many won't. 

                                 DALEY
                        -- then we’d have to have another 
                        sixty-seven hearings to convince 
                        them to recount all 67 of their 
                        counties!

                        And many won't. 

           Klain glances at Chris, realizing he doesn't want to recount. 

                                 KLAIN
                        But Chris -- we don’t have any 
                        choice.

                        It’s simple logic: the trailing 
                        candidate in a recount has got to 
                        try to recount as many votes as

                        all sixty-seven counties to agree, 
                        it'll take at least three weeks --
                        we’ve got five days til the

                        surprise, is refusing to extend!

           Klain and Jack Young are silent, it's a powerful argument.

                        I know, I know, but we are down. 
                        I’m afraid we ought to start

                        concede. But if we're only down by 
                        a couple thousand votes --

                        They’re going to come at us with 
                        guns and drums and swords and Chris 
                        - God bless him - is worried about 
                        being a goddamn beacon of light!

                                 JACK YOUNG
                        Does he understand that 175,000 
                        votes weren’t counted because the 
                        machines registered them as “no-
                        votes”?! Punch Card Ballots are 
                        FUCKED, Ron! They leave those 
                        little pieces of cardboard hanging 
                        on the back - so when the ballot 
                        goes through the tabulation 
                        system...

           INT. COUNTING STATION - ELECTION NIGHT FLASHBACK

           Poll workers place batches of ballots into AUTOMATIC 
           TABULATION SYSTEMS (they look like bank money counters). 
           Thousands of ballots FLIP through the machines in an instant. 

                                 JACK YOUNG V.O.
                        ...the little chad gets pushed back 
                        into the hole.

           CUT TO - INSIDE THE TABULATION SYSTEM - SLOW MOTION 

           As the ballot glides through the counting machine, a chad 
           that hangs off the back of the ballot slides back into the 
           empty slot. A tiny laser beam strikes the now-covered hole. 

                                 JACK YOUNG V.O. (CONT’D)
                        The machine reads it as if a hole 
                        was never punched and it's counted 
                        as an “undervote.”

           A ballot with a fully attached chad that PUFFS OUT of the 
           ballot slides through the counting machine. 

                                 MITCHELL BERGER V.O.
                        And what about the one’s that don't 
                        hang at all? They're just dimpled 
                        because the voter didn't push hard 
                        enough! 

           The laser strikes the indented-but-completely-covered hole.

           An African-American hand pushes a stylus into a ballot.

                        Hell, what about the Votomatics 
                        that don't get cleaned out for 
                        years?!

           CUT TO - INSIDE A VOTOMATIC VOTING MACHINE. 

           The interior of the Votomatic is clogged with tiny pieces of 
           cardboard “chads.”

                                 MITCHELL BERGER V.O. (CONT’D)
                        They’re so jammed up with chads 
                        that the voter can't penetrate the 
                        ballot at all, they just leave a 
                        dimpled chad.

           SLOW MOTION - the back of the ballot pushes out as it's 
           struck by the stylus, but the chad is unable to detach 
           because it's blocked by all the loose chads.

                                 JACK YOUNG V.O.
                        And you know where that happens? 
                        Poor communities with outdated

                        The world is watching us, Jim. We 
                        have a tremendous opportunity to 
                        show how a nation of our power can 
                        resolve a conflict as great as this 
                        through diplomacy and compromise.

                        Well...yes, but it was my feeling 
                        that you and I should be able to 
                        devise a way to settle this matter.

                        There's nuthin' to settle. If we're 
                        ahead at the completion of the 
                        machine recount then our position 
                        is this: Governor Bush won the 
                        election and Katherine Harris is 
                        going to certify the election. No 
                        negotiations, no compromises, no 
                        extensions. Bush is President. I go 
                        home. End of story.

           Silence as his words hammer down on the room. Klain is blown 
           away by Baker, stares at him in awe. 

           Christopher knows he's hit a wall, smiles, very friendly.

                        I'm worried about his future. He's 
                        a young man, he can run again, but 
                        not if he destroys his career with 
                        a prolonged legal battle.

                           (reading the statute)
                        It says hand recounts are 
                        allowed...if there is “an error in 
                        the vote tabulation which could 
                        affect the outcome of an election.”

           Everyone exchanges glances, not sure what that means.

                                 MITCHELL BERGER
                        It's vague. 

                                 JACK YOUNG 
                        It’s fucking archaic.

                        No...The key is interpreting “error 
                        in the vote tabulation.”

           Everyone turns to Klain, a known legal genius.

                        the machines were not able to read 
                        because hanging or dimpled chads 
                        blocked the holes, that would be an 
                        “error in the vote tabulation,” 
                        because there would be votes in

                        No. Our position has got to be that  
                        “error in vote tabulation” means 
                        “how the system tabulated them.” So 
                        the only way a hand recount can 
                        proceed is if there is a problem 
                        with the tabulation systems. The 
                        hardware or the software has to 
                        fail for there to be an "error in 
                        the vote tabulation."

                        No. That's incorrect. If the 
                        Legislature wanted “vote 
                        tabulation” to mean “vote 
                        tabulation systems,” it would have 
                        said that because it uses that 
                        exact language later in the 
                        statute.

                        ...I think he probably won this

                        He’s got a real fire now, he’s--

           There's a knock at his door. It opens and a beaming Jeremy

                        OK, guys, I'm gonna read you 
                        something from another state’s 
                        election code...
                           (reads)
                        “A hand recount shall be conducted 
                        in preference to an electronic 
                        recount.” It also says that dimpled 
                        chads should be counted in any hand 
                        recount.

           The excitement quickly deflates with a collective "so what?"

                                 MITCHELL BERGER
                        It's great, Ron, but we can't use 
                        another state’s election code.

                        Oh, yeah. What if it was signed

                        meet to be counted. My gut tells me 
                        that some of them were sent after 
                        election day.

                        and number two we argue that

           EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - A Gavel SLAMMING DOWN!

           JUDGE TERRY LEWIS, 47, thick bushy moustache, on the 
           courtroom bench in his black robe. He speaks into camera:

           TEXT: VOLUSIA COUNTY CANVASSING BOARD v. KATHERINE HARRIS

                                 JUDGE LEWIS
                        Florida law grants to Katherine 
                        Harris, as the chief elections 
                        officer, broad authority to accept 
                        or reject late returns. --  

           INT. BOIES RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - NEW YORK - EVENING

           The brilliant lawyer, DAVID BOIES, 59, tall in a Lincolnesque 
           kind of way, sincere, nicest guy you'll ever meet, is in his 
           kitchen wearing sweatpants, scooping ice cream onto a cone.

                                 JUDGE LEWIS V.O. 
                        -- Based on the limited evidence 
                        presented, this court will not 
                        overturn her decision to enforce a 
                        strict deadline.

           Bois’s wife, MARY, yells from the living room: 

                                 MARY BOIES V.O.
                        David! Ron Klain is on the phone!

           As he reaches for the phone, the ice cream slips off the cone 
           onto the counter. He tries to scoop it back up, but it keeps 
           sliding off the scooper. Boies is torn, does he answer the 
           phone or go for the ice cream? He goes for the ice cream.

                        David! He's waiting!!

           Giving up on the scooper, Boies picks up the ice cream with 
           his hand and flops it onto the cone. Not able to spot a 
           towel, he wipes his hand off on his pants, grabs the phone...

           INT. BUSH BUILDING - BAKER'S OFFICE - TALLAHASSEE - DAY

           Baker and co. watch Boies hold a press conference on a TV:

                                 REPORTER #1
                           (from the TV)
                        “Now that the deadline has passed 
                        and the absentee ballots have

                        going to change his strategy?” 

                                 BOIES
                           (from the TV)
                        “The strategy is the same, Al Gore

           Ginsberg preps Baker: 

                                 GINSBERG
                        David Boies is the best courtroom 
                        lawyer I've ever seen. He can 
                        destroy a witness and make you 
                        think he's a great guy while he's 
                        doing it. 

                                 TERWILLIGER
                        His twenty-hour deposition of Bill 
                        Gates is already legendary.

                                 BAKER
                        I heard he never uses notes.

                                 GINSBERG
                        He's dyslexic, so he has to 
                        memorize everything. 

           Baker's impressed, sees he has a worthy opponent. 

                                 BOIES
                           (from the TV)
                        “Our goal is simply to get the 
                        Florida Supreme Court to extend the 
                        deadline so we can get these votes 
                        counted...with or without the 
                        hurricane.” 

           The press laughs, instantly charmed by Boies. Baker CLICKS 
           the TV off, turns to a sober,45ish, BALDING MAN.

           EXT. FLORIDA SUPREME COURT - TALLAHASSEE - DAY

           Standing with grace and dignity is the Greek revival 
           architecture of the FLORIDA SUPREME COURT. Six tall columns 
           line the entrance way to a dome that sits atop a rotunda. 

           People fill the streets of downtown Tallahassee. It looks 
           like a full-fledged MARDI GRAS. A man wears an UNCLE SAM 
           costume with a noose around his neck, others are in Bush and 
           Gore masks. A Vendor hocks “JUST KEEP BILL” T-shirts. 

           A hot dog cart sells pretzels, links and skewers.  COPS in 
           riot gear carry batons, ready for action. 

           In a sequined red dress with a crown on her head, ANGELINA 
           THE POLKA QUEEN plays the accordion and sings: 

                                 ANGELINA THE POLKA QUEEN

                        by the deadline, then there would

                        without postmarks are common

                        That's correct, Senator Lieberman, 
                        which is why I stated in the memo 
                        that if the ballot is signed and

           Klain stares in disbelief at the dry eraser board where an 
           aide erases Bush's previous lead of 930 and writes 1,104. 

           Klain shuts his eyes in pain. Lieberman cost them 100+ votes. 

           The rest of the board reads:

                        convicted felons and anyone whose

                        so he was told he couldn't vote. 

           Everyone looks at the list, stunned by its insidiousness.

                        the 697 names the state gave him, 
                        only 33 were actual felons.

           Jeremy takes a beat, almost ashamed of the actual figure.

                                 JEREMY BASH
                        20,000 people were inaccurately 
                        placed on the Voter Purge List. 44% 
                        were African-American.

                        It's our margin of victory 10 times 
                        over. 

           This silences the room.

                                 MITCHELL BERGER
                        Can we do anything with this?

           Boies and Klain share a look, they know there's no remedy. 

                                 BOIES
                        You can’t get votes back that were

           TEXT: DAY 15

           Hundreds of CUBAN PROTESTORS stand outside the Clark Center, 
           a forty-story government building. They wave "SORE/LOSERMAN" 
           signs intermixed with "REMEMBER ELIAN" posters. Cuban 
           activist EMILIO CEPERO is up on a stage firing up the crowd:  

                                 EMILIO CEPERO
                        REMEMBER ELIAN! REMEMBER ELIAN!!!

           The crowd chants with him:

                        REMEMBER ELIAN! REMEMBER ELIAN! 

           Intermixed in the crowd are YOUNG REPUBLICANS in ties and 
           pantsuits holding up "SORE/LOSERMAN" signs. 

           An enormous RV is parked near the Clark Center. Republican 
           volunteers bustle in and out carrying more "SORE/LOSERMAN" 
           signs along with fliers, posters and T-shirts with logos such 
           as “HOW TO STEAL AN ELECTION” and “GORE LIES.” They pass them 
           out to Cubans and non-Cubans alike. A Young Republican yells 
           through a bullhorn:

                                 YOUNG REPUBLICAN
                        This is the new Republican party!

           The lobby of the 19th floor is a small, confined space that

           It's jammed with a group of about 50 Young Republicans. They

           INT. CLARK CENTER - TABULATION ROOM (19TH FLOOR) - NIGHT

           In a small enclosed area toward the back of the Tabulation 
           Room, the Canvassing Board is examining ballots as Jack Young 
           and the Republican lawyer, NEAL CONNOLLY, stand behind them. 

           The County Supervisor (David Leahy) holds up a ballot:

                                 DAVID LEAHY/CANVASSING BOARD
                        Punched #7 hole. No-Vote. 

                                 JACK YOUNG
                        I object. It’s obvious the fives 
                        are for Bush and the sevens are for 
                        Gore. We need to devise a fair 
                        system to count these votes. These 
                        voters clearly didn’t insert their 
                        ballots proper--

                                 NEAL CONNOLLY
                        -- That's preposterous. We can't 
                        guess who they intended to vote for 
                        when they punched a blank hole!

                        Let’s get a blank ballot and try to 
                        demonstrate this.

           Jack nods. Joe Gellar heads out the door, passing a sweating 
           COURT CLERK who hurries into the room. 

                                 COURT CLERK
                        Can I have everyone's attention! 

           The room turns to him.

                        The Canvassing Board should know 
                        that there is a full protest out in 
                        the lobby and I think it could 
                        escalate out of control.  

           INT. CLARK CENTER - 19TH FLOOR LOBBY - MIAMI - DAY

           Joe Gellar pushes his way through the protestors, he squirms 
           up to the CLERK’S WINDOW and yells:

                                 JOE GELLAR
                        I'm one of the recount lawyers, I 
                        need to get a sample ballot. 

           The receptionist slides a "sample" ballot under the glass.

           A red-headed PUDGY PROTESTOR sees him slide the ballot into 
           his jacket pocket and screams:

                        HE'S STEALING A BALLOT!!!!

           In this instant, the jokey quality of the protest FLIPS to a 
           genuine angry mob. The entire crowd SWARMS upon Joe Gellar, 
           trying to yank the ballot away. 

                                 PROTESTORS
                        ARREST HIM! HE'S STEALING A BALLOT! 

           Joe Gellar shoves his way toward the elevators. Protestors 
           KICK and PUNCH him as he pushes by.

                                 PROTESTORS (cont’d) (CONT’D)
                        THIEF! ARREST HIM! THIEF!!! 

           A Protestor starts kicking Gellar as he yells:

                                 KICKING PROTESTOR
                        Stop kicking me! Stop kicking me!!

           Being from the Bronx, Gellar shoves him off and slides into 
           the open elevator, his leg killing him from the kicks. 

           He is followed in by a group of Protestors. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - CLARK CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           The elevator descends in thick silence as everyone stares 
           daggers of hate at Joe Gellar. Finally:

                                 PUDGY PROTESTOR
                        The Colonel and I won't let you 
                        leave with that ballot. 

           Slight beat. Then Joe Gellar turns to him: 

                                 JOE GELLAR
                        Who the fuck is the Colonel?

           The elevator stops and the door slides open. Joe Gellar 
           hurries toward the exit. The Protestors stay right on his 
           tail, pointing at him and shouting to everyone in the lobby: 

                                 PROTESTORS
                        He has a ballot! He has a ballot!!

           A group of thirty Young Republicans swarm him from all 
           directions. Joe Gellar is completely surrounded. The Pudgy 
           Protestor BUMPS Joe Gellar with his chest.

                        have to defend myself.

           The crowd moves in closer on Gellar who doesn't know what to 
           do. Right before it gets really ugly...

           A dozen COPS descend upon the scene, separating him from the 
           mob. The Pudgy Protestor points at Gellar. 

                                 PUDGY PROTESTOR (cont’d) (CONT’D)
                        He stole a ballot! He stole a 
                        ballot!!!

           An exasperated Joe Gellar shows the ballot to the cops.

                                 JOE GELLAR
                        It's a sample ballot! It's blank!

           Back on the 19th floor, the Protestors are banging the walls

                        approximately two hours left to go 
                        and perhaps 800 to 1000 ballots

                        Wouldn’t the starting point be what 
                        the Secretary of State, Katherine 
                        Harris might decree for uniformity?

                        I would agree with that, Justice 
                        O'Connor.

           Klain's eyes scream, “No!”

           Justice Breyer jumps back in, really trying to pin this down.

                                 JUSTICE BREYER
                        I'd still like to get your view as 
                        to what would be the fair standard.

                        Well, certainly, at minimum, the 
                        full penetration of the ballot card 
                        would be required...because 
                        indentations or dimples are no 
                        standard at all.

                        I think there is a uniform 
                        standard.

                        The standard is whether or not the 
                        "intent of the voter" is reflected 
                        by the ballot.

                                 JUSTICE O'CONNOR
                        Why isn't the standard the one that 
                        voters are instructed to follow, 
                        for goodness sakes? I mean, it 
                        couldn't be clearer. I mean, why 
                        don't we go to that standard?

           Boies barely hides his frustration at the question. 

                                 BOIES
                        Well, your Honor, because in 
                        Florida law since 1917, Darby v. 
                        State, the Florida Supreme Court 
                        has held that where a voter's 
                        intent can be discerned, even if 
                        they don't do what they're told, 
                        their vote is supposed to be 
                        counted. For the last eighty years, 
                        the Florida Court has always ruled 
                        that the right to participate in 
                        the Democratic process is more 
                        important than the voter’s ability 
                        to follow instructions.

           Justice Kennedy chimes in.

                                 JUSTICE KENNEDY
                        Mr. Boies, would you say that from 
                        the standpoint of the Equal 
                        Protection Clause...

           Boies subtly flinches at the mention of the Equal Protection 
           Clause. Klain instantly looks worried. 

                                 JUSTICE KENNEDY (cont’d) (CONT’D)
                        ...each county could give their own 
                        interpretation to what "intent" 
                        means?

           Before Boies can answer, JUSTICE SOUTER helps him.

                                 JUSTICE SOUTER
                        I think what's bothering Justice 
                        Kennedy is that the rule to 
                        counting dimpled chads varies from 
                        county to county, Broward and Miami-
                        Dade were counting them, Palm Beach 
                        was not. If we were fashioning a 
                        response to a hypothetical Equal 
                        Protection violation, what would 
                        you tell them to do about it?

                        Well...I think that's a very hard 
                        question. 

           The entire courtroom breaks out in laughter. 

                                 JUSTICE SOUTER
                        You'd tell them to count every 
                        vote, Mr. Boies. 

           More laughter.

                                 BOIES
                        Yes, I would tell them to count 
                        every vote. 

           Even more laughter, except for Klain, terrified that Boies is 
           blowing the heart of the matter. But:

                                 BOIES (cont’d) (CONT’D)
                        I think I would say that if you're 
                        looking for a standard, then the 
                        Texas standard, if you wanted to 
                        specify something that was 
                        specific, gives you a pretty good 
                        standard. It says dimpled chads 
                        should be counted. 

           Klain lets out a sigh of relief. 

                                 JUSTICE KENNEDY
                        Mr. Boies, let's assume that at the 
                        end of the day, different counties 
                        have used different standards in 
                        making their counts. At that point, 
                        in your judgment, is it a violation 
                        of the Equal Protection Clause?

           The red light on the podium lights up. Boies looks at it, 
           holy shit, he has to answer this! 

                                 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST

                        violation of the Equal Protection 
                        Clause, then every election in the 
                        nation would be considered an Equal 
                        Protection Violation because it is 
                        literally impossible to have

                        I've ran over twenty-five recounts 
                        and it never ceases to amaze me the 
                        extent that Democrats will lie, 
                        cheat and steal to win an election. 
                        If we hadn't played hardball, they 
                        would've stolen this one, too.  

           Baker laughs, keeps packing.

                        Shit, Ben, I was a Democrat till I 
                        was forty years old. 

           Ginsberg can't believe it. 

                                 GINSBERG
                        Why'd you switch parties?

                        I'm so sorry.

                        Thank you. She was...
                           (still painful)
                        ...too young. 
                           (then)
                        A close friend of mine, who 
                        happened to be a Republican, was 
                        running for Senate, told me to come 
                        work on his campaign to get my mind 
                        off my grief. I told him I had 
                        never worked in politics, and I was 
                        a Democrat to boot. He didn't care, 
                        just didn't want me to be so sad 
                        all the time. 

                                 GINSBERG
                        That's a good friend.

           INT. BERGER LAW OFFICE - LAW LIBRARY - NEXT MORNING

           Klain is in the law library, proofing the petitions. Written 
           on the eraser boards are the names of every court case tried 
           in the last 36 days. They cover all the walls.  

           He stares at the endless list of litigation, troubled at how 
           far this has gone...but also proud. 

           Jeremy walks in. 

                                 JEREMY BASH
                        You wanted to see me?

                                 KLAIN
                        Have a seat. 

           Jeremy sits down, not sure what this is about. 

                                 KLAIN (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted to know what your 
                        plans were when this was over.

                                 JEREMY BASH
                        I'm not really sure.  

                                 KLAIN
                        I've spoken with Warren Christopher 
                        and we both agree that if you'd 
                        like to join O'Melvney & Myers, 
                        we'd love to have you. 

           Jeremy is surprised and flattered, but hesitant. 

                                 JEREMY BASH
                        Wow. That's...quite an honor. 

                                 KLAIN
                        You don't look so sure. 

                                 JEREMY BASH
                        It's just...I’m not sure I want to 
                        be a lawyer anymore. 

           Klain is surprised.  

                                 KLAIN
                        Why not?

           Slight beat. Jeremy isn't sure how to explain. Then -

                                 JEREMY BASH
                        The Supreme Court ruled that we 
                        have to stop counting because we 
                        missed a deadline. But they caused 
                        us to miss it through their 
                        interpretation of the law.

                           (beat between them)
                        And this decision is "limited to 
                        the present circumstances”?! The 
                        entire function of the Supreme 
                        Court is to set legal precedents 
                        for lower courts, but "Bush v. 
                        Gore" only counts once, and after 
                        Bush is President, it never counts 
                        again. 
                           (then)
                        If the umpires aren't going to call 
                        a fair game...

           Long beat. Klain isn't sure what to tell him. Then:

                                 KLAIN
                        When I came back to the campaign, 
                        no one could understand why I was 
                        willing to write press releases for 
                        the campaign I used to run.

                                 JEREMY BASH
                        So why did you come back?

           Slight beat. Klain looks to the walls - the endliss list of 
           litigation.

                                 KLAIN
                        Because...there isn’t anything 
                        else... 
                           (off Jeremy’s look)
                        ...just...the Constitution.

                                 JEREMY BASH
                        Well, it sure let us down, today.

                                 KLAIN
                           (nods)
                        Maybe today. This time.
                           (then, quietly)
                        Because the five people who told us 
                        what it meant...were not as wise as 
                        the people who wrote it.

           A beat. Then Mark Herron sticks his head into the room. 

                                 MARK HERRON

                        Do you think Jeremy should become 
                        the youngest associate at O'Melvney

                        is over?

           Mark thinks about it. 

                                 MARK HERRON
                        I guess I'll have to tell my wife 
                        that my firm fired me.

                                 JEREMY BASH
                        You haven't told her?!

           Mark sheepishly shakes his head. 

           Jeremy and Klain look at each other, then bust out laughing. 
           Mitchell Berger sticks his head in. 

                                 MITCHELL BERGER
                        What's so funny?

           They laugh even harder. 

           INT. BERGER LAW OFFICE - KLAIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Still smiling, Klain walks into his office, grabs the phone. 

                                 KLAIN
                        Hello?

                        Mr. Vice President, I'm sorry to 
                        keep you wait --

                        -- I couldn't sleep last night, 
                        Ron, I couldn't stop thinking. 

           Klain tenses up, sensing where he's going. 

                                 AL GORE V.O. (CONT’D)
                        But then... I remembered what a 
                        wise man once said to me. He said 
                        that... I have to end this war when 
                        I know I can't win.

                        can't win. 

           Time stops as all signs of life drain from Klain's face. 
           Thirty-six days of adrenaline, sweat, anger and frustration 
           wash away in an instant. All that's left is defeat.

           Through the window to Klain's office, Whouley sees Klain 
           slumped over on the phone. He slowly walks toward the office, 
           sensing what is going on. Jeremy sees Whouley walking toward 
           Klain. He slowly walks over too.

           One by one, everyone notices the painful conversation Klain 
           is having in his office. They stop what they're doing and 
           join Whouley and Jeremy.

           As Klain hangs up the phone, he immediately sees that 
           everyone in the office is staring at him through the window.  

           He walks to the door, straightening his tie. Right before he 
           opens the door, he pauses...doesn't know what to say...he is 
           consumed with the overwhelming sense of failure.

           As he opens the door...

           The entire room gives him a wild round of applause. 

           It gets louder and louder and louder until the room begins to 
           shake with the fire and anger that fills their souls.  

           Klain is profoundly touched by the moving gesture. He starts 
           to applaud with them. 

           In V.O. we hear James Baker:

                        That it was down to 154 votes. That 
                        Bush's brother was the Governor. 
                        That the Supreme Court gave it to 
                        us. But I want you all to remember 
                        that we won every single recount. 
                        Never once did we trail Al Gore. 
                        And who knows how many votes we 
                        lost when the networks called 
                        Florida for Gore before all the 
                        polls had closed. 
                           (then)
                        But more important than all that is 
                        that the system worked.  There were 
                        no tanks in the streets. This 
                        peaceful transfer of power, in the 
                        most emotional and trying of times, 
                        is a testament to the strength of 
                        our constitution and to our faith 
                        in the rule of law.

           Klain and Whouley walk across a tarmac to a small jet in the 
           tiny airport. No press, no mobs, no protestors. They're the 
           last to go home. 

                                 KLAIN.
                        We should've asked for a statewide 
                        from the get-go. That was our 
                        biggest mistake.

                        Yeah, sure, and Monica Lewinsky 
                        should've washed her fuckin' dress 
                        and Ralph Nader should've pulled 
                        his head out of his ass and Elian 
                        Gonzales should've stayed in Miami 
                        and Gore should've campaigned with 
                        Clinton who should've kept his dick 
                        in his pants and Palm Beach, Duval 
                        and Gadsen should've designed 
                        ballots that didn't cost us 15,000 
                        votes and Judge Dickhead should've 
                        counted our 800 dimpled chads and 
                        Katherine Harris should've thought 
                        twice about purging 20,000 voters 
                        from the rolls. 
                           (then)
                        There's a lot of things that 
                        should've been different.

                                 KLAIN
                        You think they would have stopped 
                        the recount if George W. Bush had 
                        asked for it?

           He looks Whouley right in the eye. Whouley shakes his head, 
           smiles, boards the plane. 

           As Klain starts up the boarding steps he sees Bakers’ Limo 
           arrive and Baker get out. He stares at the legendary James 
           Baker III as he approaches the Republican jet.

           Spotting Klain, Baker stops. He nods to his recount foe. 

           Klain nods back. A moment.  Then:

                                 KLAIN (CONT’D)
                        So...did the best man win, then?

                                 BAKER
                        You bet.

                                 KLAIN
                        You’re sure?

                                 BAKER
                        Sure as you are about your man.

                                 KLAIN
                        ...I hope you’re right, Mr. 
                        Secretary.

           They hold each other’s gaze.

                                 BAKER
                        You have a safe trip home, Mr. 
                        Klain.

           The now-empty streets of Tallahassee are littered with trash 
           and protest signs. City workers clean up the debris.

                        “I have a lot to be thankful for

           In V.O. is Al Gore's concession speech (actual):

           Thank you very much and God

           We fly down to the steps of the Supreme Court of the United 
           States. Under the dark gray sky, the white marble has lost a 
           touch of its former glory. 

           Written over the courthouse is:

           “Although we may never know with complete certainty the 
           identity of the winner of this year's presidential election, 
           the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the 
           nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of 
           the rule of law.”

           FADE TO BLACK.
