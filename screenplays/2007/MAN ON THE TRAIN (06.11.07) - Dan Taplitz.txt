           FADE IN:

           EXT. AMTRAK VERMONTER - TWILIGHT

           The train threads through a blizzard.  New white snow 
           blankets the rough countryside.   

           INT. TRAIN

           BILLY (49) sitting alone in a half-empty train-car.  His life 
           is stamped clearly on his face: tough-lived, tough-loved and 
           still dangerous.  He stares out the window, watching the 
           world slide by.  

           Suddenly the white-blue snow blooms leaving a slight halo 
           hovering over the landscape.  

           Billy brings his calloused hands up to his eyes.  The 
           beginnings of a migraine.  Reaching into his pocket, he pulls 
           out a plastic medicine bottle.  It reads, Zomig. He flips 
           the lid -- it’s empty of pills.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DOCTOR WAITING ROOM - TWILIGHT

           JACK JONES (70’s) is waiting in a mostly-empty outpatient 
           waiting room.  He is wearing a casual jacket and tie.  His 
           collar is too big.  He is resigned to the wait.  In fact, 
           everything about him is a bit resigned.  On his lap is a 
           book, “Red Harvest”, but he’s not reading.  He is using the 
           last page to write a list.  A list of dreams:  

           1) Go to Rio.  
           2) Score with waitress.  
           3) Bitch-slap son-in-law.  
           4) No more blood-sucking doctor.  

           As he’s writing out the last item, a NURSE appears...  

                                 NURSE
                        The doctor will see you now.

                                 JACK
                        Yes, of course.

           Resignedly, Jack closes his book and follows her into the 
           examining rooms.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. BARRE, VERMONT, TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

           Billy gets off the train with a small bag.  A sign on the 
           empty platform reads -- BARRE, GRANITE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD.  
           Billy’s leather jacket and cowboy-boots are ill-suited for 
           the cold and the snow.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. NORTH MAIN STREET - NIGHT

           A small depressed commercial town with many old stone 
           buildings.  The place is buried deep in snow.  Shops are 
           closing as Billy walks down the street.  Up ahead he sees a 
           pharmacy.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. PHARMACY - NIGHT

           Jack is looking through a spinning display of cheap plastic 
           eye-glasses while waiting for his prescription to be filled.  
           He tries on a pair of +5’s reading glasses.  The eye-chart is 
           sharper -- how depressing.  Looking at himself in the small 
           mirror, he fingers his collar.

                                 JACK
                        Every year the number on my glasses goes 
                        up and the number on my collar goes down.  
                        I will end my days with coke-bottle 
                        glasses sticking out of an empty shirt.   

           The pharmacist shrugs.  The front door opens, setting off 
           chimes.  Jack looks up and sees...

           A BLURRED IMAGE OF A MAN (BECAUSE OF THE READING GLASSES), 

           in the doorway.  Even out of focus, Jack can tell the man is 
           not from around here.  Jack lowers the spectacles and Billy 
           swims into focus -- stubble, long sideburns, leather jacket. 

           BILLY 

           walks up to the counter and hands the pharmacist the empty 
           bottle of medication and his prescription to be refilled.

                                 PHARMACIST
                        Zomig? I’ll have to check.
           Billy sits down on one of the chairs lined up for waiting.  
           Jack, casually, takes the seat next to him.  Billy doesn’t 
           seem to notice his existence -- his head is splitting.

                                 JACK
                          (finally)
                        Migraine?  

           Billy doesn’t answer.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        My wife used to get them, before she 
                        died.  I guess it would be unusual for 
                        her to get them after she died.  Any 
                        colors, lights?  She would get flashing 
                        red lights, like popping balloons.
                          (no answer)
                        I can fix it, you know.  I know this 
                        trick.

           For the first time Billy looks at him.  It’s not a 
           particularly friendly look.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        “Trick” makes it sound shady.  It’s more 
                        of a technique, a process.  I used it at 
                        the high-school I taught in, before I 
                        retired, because we couldn’t give the 
                        kids drugs.  They were all stoned up to 
                        their eyeballs on bud, booze, glue, oxy, 
                        chronic, candy-flipping, yay-yo and-who-
                        knows-what-concoction-of-the-moment -- 
                        but we couldn’t give them a simple 
                        aspirin.  Rules!  I despise rules.  
                        Though I’m slavishly addicted to them.

           Billy stares at the pharmacist who’s talking on the phone.  
           Seeing that he’s losing Billy, Jack re-focuses...

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        But to the point at hand, or head, it can 
                        be a very effective... ah, process.  All 
                        I do is ask you a series of questions 
                        that you answer.

                                 BILLY
                        What sort of questions?

                                 JACK 
                        Descriptive.  Close your eyes.
           Billy just looks at him, hard -- then closes them.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Ok, relax.  What shape is your headache?

           Billy opens his eyes.

                                 BILLY
                        What?

                                 JACK
                        Is it round, square, oblong?  Look, 
                        you’ll see.

           Billy closes his eyes again and looks...

                                 BILLY 
                        Irregular.

                                 JACK
                        Good.  Hot or cold?

                                 BILLY
                        Hot.

                                 JACK
                        Color?

                                 BILLY
                        Green and red.

                                 JACK
                        Hard or soft?

                                 BILLY
                        Hard.

                                 JACK
                        Surface texture?

                                 BILLY
                        Bumpy.

                                 JACK 
                        Now keep that all in mind.  This 
                        irregular, hot, green-red, hard, bumpy 
                        thing.  Now imagine a box around it.  Ok, 
                        got it in a box?  Good.  Now, keeping the 
                        headache inside, shrink the box in half.  
                        Now shrink it again.  And again.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACK  (CONT'D)
                        And again.  Now continue until it’s just 
                        a single spot.  Now make it disappear.  
                        Poof! OK.  Open your eyes.  Your 
                        headache is gone.  

           Billy opens his eyes.  Stares at Jack, who is pleased with 
           himself.  Billy looks up, gauging the condition of his head.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Don’t look for it!

                                 BILLY
                        It’s still there.

                                 JACK
                        No.

                                 BILLY
                        Yes.

                                 JACK
                        Not even a little bit gone? 

                                 BILLY
                        No.

                                 JACK
                        How strange.  It usually works.  For most 
                        people.  Maybe you lack, I don’t know, 
                        the proper... imagination?

           Billy seems quite capable of “imagining” hitting Jack upside 
           the head -- but instead he turns away, back to his land of 
           hot-green-red pain.   

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. PHARMACY - NIGHT

           It’s snowing heavily.  Stepping outside, Billy takes some 
           pills from his new prescription, swallows them, then heads 
           down the street.  Jack comes out of the pharmacy holding a 
           paper bag.  He watches Billy walking away then turns and 
           heads in the opposite direction.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. THE BARRE HOTEL - NIGHT

           The sign reads -- CLOSED FOR SEASON.  Billy is looking in the 
           deserted hulking building.  It looks like there hasn’t been a 
           “season” for many years. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. DINER - NIGHT

           On the main square and commons.  The only place open in this 
           snowed-in, cold, dark town.  A taxi cab is parked outside.   
           Seeing that the cab is empty, Billy heads for the door.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Billy enters and approaches a MAN sitting at the counter.

                                 BILLY
                        Is that your cab?

                                 MAN
                        Yes, sir.

                                 BILLY
                        I need to go to a hotel.

                                 MAN
                        The only hotels open are in Montpelier or 
                        off 89.  I can’t get out there until they 
                        plow the roads.

                                 BILLY
                        When will that be?

                                 JACK (O.C.)
                        6:15.

           Billy turns and sees Jack sitting at a table.  He’s having a 
           tuna sandwich and a cup of tea.  

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        The storm is supposed to blow through 
                        tonight.  They won’t plow until the 
                        morning.   

           Jack motions for Billy to join him.  Billy sits.
                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        How’s your...

                                 BILLY
                        Better.

           A waitress, TAMMY, approaches.  She’s in her 50’s, attractive 
           with a sexy full figure and bottle-red hair.  

                                 TAMMY
                        What can I get you?

                                 BILLY
                        Coffee.

                                 TAMMY
                        Your boots are wet.

           They are.  His cowboy-boots are soaked.  Billy doesn’t 
           comment and Tammy goes to get the coffee.

                                 JACK
                        I’ve come here every night for a year 
                        just to oggle her.  Unrequited lust, yes, 
                        even at my age.  Sadly, she barely 
                        notices that I breathe.  But you walk in, 
                        once, all harsh and silent and she 
                        comments on your... boots.  How rewarding 
                        that must be.

                                 BILLY
                        What?

                                 JACK
                        To cause a stir in a woman by just being.

           Billy doesn’t comment.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        You’re not much of a talker.

                                 BILLY
                        Not much.

                                 JACK 
                        Fortunately I’m capable of talking for 
                        two.  The town has a shelter set up for 
                        people put out by storm and ill luck.  
                        Just down Broad Street.  It’s in the 
                        police station.  
           Billy is not happy about this.  Jack sees this.  

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        I know, not very appealing.  For me it’s 
                        the smell.  They use a very harsh 
                        detergent.  Whenever I go in to pay a 
                        parking ticket I gag. 
                          (longish beat)
                        If you wish, I have an extra bed at my 
                        house.  

           Billy looks at him, trying to gauge his motivation.  But Jack 
           is plainly harmless -- just a lonely old guy.

                                 BILLY 
                        A generous offer.

                                 JACK
                        It’s what people do around here when 
                        conditions demand.  
                          (holds out his hand)
                        Jack Walden-Holt Jones.

           They shake.

                                 BILLY
                        Bill.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

           They are walking down a mainly commercial street.  Jack stops 
           at a large metal gate set in a high brick wall.  He opens it 
           and enters, revealing a large stone mansion that has seen 
           much, much better days.  The house is very old, the town has 
           grown up and surrounded it.  A bit of history caught out of 
           time and place.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. JACK’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jack and Billy enter.  The living room is dark.  There are 
           six table and standing lamps scattered about the room.  Jack 
           walks around clicking them on, one at a time.  What’s slowly 
           revealed is a time-capsule, somewhere short of the 20th 
           century.  Shabby-derelict meets Victorian romantic.  Big 
           fireplace with a leather chair in front of it.  Billy takes 
           it in.
                                 BILLY 
                          (appreciatively)
                        Old.

                                 JACK 
                        I prefer a Japanese style.  Rice paper, 
                        tea cups, anime. You have to respect a 
                        culture that venerates little girls in 
                        short skirts and ribbons as killer-
                        warriors.
                          (motions to the room)
                        But my wife liked all this moldy 
                        ancestral decor and I never had the nerve 
                        to change it. 

           He flips a light on in front of an oil painting of a stern 
           looking man with enormous white mutton-chops.  

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        The glorious patriarch.  Jonathan Jones.  
                        Was present at the Battle of Bunker Hill.  
                        Though what he did, or for what side, is 
                        unclear.  But he did open one of Barre’s
                        first granite quarries before he blew out 
                        his brains showing his mistress how to 
                        properly load a french pistol.  
                        Unfortunately for the family, and the 
                        town, the granite has mostly run out.  
                        The smart ones moved into the tombstones 
                        business.  Smaller pieces.  Barre is now 
                        the “Tombstone Capital of the World” -- 
                        which says a lot about the place.

           Jack looks at Billy’s boots and shakes his head.   

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Those won’t do.  Wet boots give you 
                        bunions.

           Going to a closet by the stairs, Jack starts digging through 
           it... 

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        There are two types of men.  Those that 
                        say, “I have worn out my slippers and I 
                        must buy a new pair.”  They are 
                        adventurers.  And those that already have 
                        an extra pair.
                                 BILLY
                        What are they called?

                                 JACK
                        School teachers.   

           Voila!  Jack pulls out of the closet a box of brand new 
           slippers.  Billy takes the box of slippers but doesn’t open 
           them.  Jack goes to the bar and pours a tumbler of scotch.

                                 BILLY
                        You have two of everything?

                                 JACK
                          (proudly)
                        No.  Three.  A scotch?  It’s 12 years.

                                 BILLY
                        No, thank you.

                                 JACK
                        Drinking alone is one of the saddest 
                        facts of old age.  One I have no talent 
                        for.  My daughter wants me to give up the 
                        house and move into the Fireside 
                        Retirement Suites.  Plenty of wrinkled 
                        company for drinking and moaning.  It’s a 
                        confusing place.  In the brochure not one 
                        of the Fireside suites had a fireplace.

           Billy yawns; he clearly just wants a bed to lie down on.  
           Jack puts the untouched glass of scotch down on the side-
           table.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Let me show you your room.

           They walk into...

           THE LIBRARY

           Shelves of books from floor to ceiling.  Large desk on one 
           side with an unfinished 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle of an 
           ancient Greek monument and a few family photos.  On the other 
           side of the room is a day-bed and dresser.

                                 JACK
                        Most of the upstairs leaks so I set a bed 
                        down here.
                                 BILLY
                          (looking at all the books)
                        What did you teach?

                                 JACK
                        English.  Still do a bit of tutoring.

                                 BILLY
                        Have you read all these?

                                 JACK
                        Most of them.  Here, this is my childhood 
                        favorite.  My grandfather thought he was 
                        buying the ancient Chinese novel Ching
                        P’ing Mei. But unknowingly he bought an 
                        ancient Chinese pornographic novel Ching
                        Pig Mei. It’s about a man who gets a 
                        doctor to graft a dog penis onto his own 
                        and then has many erotic adventures.  It 
                        inspired in me a lifelong love of 
                        literature.  More blankets are in the 
                        chest.  The bathroom is through there.  
                        You’ve never owned a pair of slippers, 
                        have you?   

                                 BILLY
                        No.

                                 JACK
                          (impressed)
                        Ah.  Good night then.

                                 BILLY
                        Good-night.

           Jack leaves the room and closes the door.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           IN THE LIVING ROOM,

           Jack looks at the six illuminated lamps around the room and 
           sighs.  Resignedly, he starts to turn them off, one lamp at a 
           time. 

                                                                 CUT TO:
           IN THE LIBRARY,

           Billy throws his bag on the bed and unzips it.  From under 
           his folded clothes, he pulls out three handguns: two Glock
           17s and a Smith & Wesson 1911.  He places the guns in the top 
           dresser drawer and locks it with the skeleton key.  He puts 
           the key in his jacket pocket.  Lying down on the bed he 
           lights a cigarette and watches as the smoke rises up among 
           the wall of books.  

           For the first time he seems to relax.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

           Brilliant, sunny, warm winter day.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE, KITCHEN

           Jack is reading the paper, brewing a cup of a tea and 
           preparing an injection of Avonex (for Multiple Sclerosis).  
           He mixes water with the white powder in the single-use vial, 
           then sucks the liquid into a syringe.  With a practiced hand, 
           he plunges the needle into his upper butt.  He shows no 
           discomfort.  Looking out the window, he sees...

           A SUV

           pull up in front of the house.  SUSAN (Jack’s 30-something
           daughter) and her big brutish husband, FRANK, get out of the 
           car.  Frank is wearing overalls with a SHELL logo on the 
           back.  Susan is carrying three loaves of bread.

           JACK

           is less than thrilled.

                                 JACK
                        Oh crap!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THE HOUSE, VESTIBULE

           Susan and Frank enter the house.
                                 SUSAN
                        Dad?!  

           Frank has taken out a measuring tape and is measuring the 
           room.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you have to do that now?  

                                 FRANK
                        Need the square footage for an appraisal.  
                        I want this place sold 30 seconds after 
                        he moves to that old-age-hospital place.

                                 SUSAN
                        Retirement Suites.

           Frank shrugs a “whatever”.  He finishes measuring then heads 
           upstairs.  Susan doesn’t want an argument.  She goes into...

           THE KITCHEN

           She sees the tea and the newspaper on the counter.  She puts 
           the loaves of bread on the table.

                                 SUSAN
                        Dad?!

           No answer.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           UPSTAIRS, ROOM

           Frank is measuring one of the rooms.  Jack wasn’t kidding, 
           the upstairs is a mess.  Stains on the walls, fallen plaster 
           and holes in the ceiling from water damage.  

           IN THE ATTIC

           Through one of those holes Jack can see Frank below.  Frank 
           moves to another room and Jack moves to another hole.  

           The attic is vast and empty except for one dry corner that is 
           piled high with boxes, old furniture and the odd flotsam of 
           generations.

           Jack toe-pushes a good size chunk of plaster towards the 
           hole.
           FRANK

           is just finishing up measuring when the chunk of plaster hits 
           him square on top of the head.  

                                 FRANK
                        Owww!  Shit!

           Rubbing his head, he looks up at the crumbling ceiling and 
           hole.  

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Fucking dump.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           DOWNSTAIRS IN THE LIVING ROOM,

           Susan is still looking for her father...

                                 SUSAN
                        Dad?!  

           She stops at the mirror above the mantle and pulls out her 
           lipstick (brand: Stila; color: Dominique).  Just as she’s 
           about to apply the lipstick, she hears a noise.  Cautiously, 
           she opens the door to...

           THE LIBRARY --

           Where she finds Billy putting on his shirt.  Susan is 
           startled, then embarrassed, then suspicious and a bit scared.  
           Billy is unperturbed.

                                 SUSAN 
                        Oh my god!  I’m sorry.  I was looking for 
                        my dad.  Who are you?

                                 BILLY
                        Bill.

                                 SUSAN
                        Bill?

                                 BILLY
                        Yes.

                                 SUSAN
                        What are you doing here?
                                 BILLY
                        I’m a guest of Jack’s.

           Billy looks her over (she’s very attractive) and half-smiles.  
           Susan blushes. 

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        And you are?

                                 SUSAN 
                        I’m... I’m Susan. 

                                 BILLY 
                        Pleasure to meet you, Susan.

                                 SUSAN 
                        So you’re a friend of my father’s?

                                 BILLY
                        Yes.

           Susan waits for more of an explanation, but none is 
           forthcoming.   

                                 SUSAN
                        Do you know where he is?

                                 BILLY
                        No.

                                 SUSAN
                        He’s probably hiding.  He does that when 
                        we come over.  A game he plays.  Not a 
                        very funny one.  Have you known my father 
                        long?

                                 BILLY
                        No.

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re not much of a talker?

                                 BILLY
                        So I’ve been told.  

           Frank has come down the stairs to the vestibule where he can 
           see through the living room into the library.

                                 FRANK
                        Who the fuck is he?
                                 SUSAN
                        A friend of dad’s.

                                 FRANK
                        He has friends?

           Susan looks back at Billy and smiles, sweetly.

                                 SUSAN
                        Apparently.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT.  ATTIC - LATER

           Jack is sitting in a broken down lawn-chair poking through a 
           dusty box.  He finds an old wedding photo.  

           In it he (as a young man) feeds his bride a piece of white 
           cake.  Everyone is laughing.  Another lifetime ago.  

           Hearing voices outside, Jack goes to the small window.  
           Looking out, he sees...

           THE DRIVEWAY

           His daughter and son-in-law have exited the house.  Frank is 
           yelling at Susan.  It’s unpleasant to watch.  They get into 
           their SUV and drive off.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE, UPSTAIRS

           A collapsing staircase unfolds and Jack climbs out of the 
           attic.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Jack stands in middle of room.  The house is very still.

                                 JACK
                        Bill?

           No answer.

           THE LIBRARY

           Jack looks into the library, expecting it to be empty but 
           happily finds that Bill’s bag is still there.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE PARK AND COMMONS - DAY

           Billy is standing inside a Victorian white-wedding-cake 
           gazebo.  A snowplow is circling the park, clearing the road.  
           Two large MEN [TOM DRAGO (45) and LEO DRAGO (25)] approach.  

                                 BILLY
                        You’ve grown fat.

                                 TOM
                        You’ve gone old.

                                 BILLY
                        Who’s this?

                                 TOM
                        My cousin Leo.  He’s the driver.

                                 BILLY
                        What happened to Rico?

                                 TOM
                        Tax problems.

                                 BILLY
                        Is your cousin good?

                                 LEO
                        I’m good.

                                 TOM
                        Where’s Mr. Sam?

                                 BILLY
                        Late.  By a day or two.  He has the flu.
                                 LEO
                        That sucks.

                                 TOM
                        I hate these precious little shitty
                        towns.  

                                 BILLY
                        It is what it is.  

                                 TOM
                        I know Mr. Sam has the big rep.  I don’t 
                        personally know him but I personally do 
                        know us.  And us are good enough for a 
                        little job like this.

                                 BILLY
                        I like four.

                                 TOM
                        Three pays better.  I know you need the 
                        money.   

                                 LEO 
                        And what if this Mr. Sam’s flu turns into 
                        bronchitis or pneumonia or a broken hip.  
                        He’s old, right?

                                 TOM
                        How’s he going to get a broken hip?

                                 LEO
                        Coughing?

                                 BILLY
                        We wait.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. STUDY

           Jack is behind the desk working on the 1000-piece jigsaw 
           puzzle.  He’s having a hard time concentrating.  He keeps 
           looking over at Billy’s beat up western style leather jacket 
           lying on the chair.  Finally, Jack gets up, peeks into living 
           room to make sure that he’s alone, then puts the jacket on.  
           He stands before the vanity’s mirror admiring his new tough 
           look.
                                 JACK 
                          (cowboy-gunslinger)
                        Sure is rough-looking country.  What do 
                        they call this place?  Just over the rise 
                        there.  Town called Tombstone.  Well, 
                        there are some things a man just can't 
                        run away from.  Fill your hands, you son-
                        of-a-bitch!

           He draws with his fingers and shoots his image in the 
           mirror...

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Bang!  Bang!  Bang!

           Smiling, he takes the jacket off.  As he does so, the 
           skeleton key falls out of the pocket.  It goes clinkity-clink
           on the dark wood floor.  

           Landing in a pool of light, the key flashes like a fishing 
           lure.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DARK SEDAN - DAY

           Tom, Leo and Billy are checking out the Merchant Bank from 
           across the street.  It’s an old, ornate granite structure. 

                                 TOM
                        A piece of cake.

                                 BILLY
                        You can choke on cake.

           Leo rolls his eyes.  Billy gets out and walks toward the 
           bank.  Tom puts the car in gear and drives down North Main 
           Street.  

                                 LEO
                        This guy for real?

                                 TOM
                        I once saw him stare-down a punk with a 
                        Beretta. Took it away and beat him with 
                        his own gun ‘til his head was a ripe 
                        tomato.

                                 LEO
                        No joke?
                                 TOM
                        The man doesn’t know how to blink.

                                 TOM
                        They don’t blink?

                        Not to my knowledge, no.

           Billy is pretending to fill out a deposit slip but is really 
           memorizing the lay-out and finding the location of the 
           security cameras.  Suddenly, he finds something pressing into 
           his back...

                                 JACK
                        Freeze.

           Billy turns to find Jack.  Jack is very lit-up.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Small town.

                                 BILLY
                        Very.

                                 JACK

                          (shrugs)
                        Enough.

                                 JACK
                        I’m sorry.  It’s a musty room.  With all 
                        the books.

                                 BILLY
                        I liked the smell.  I found it 
                        comforting.

                                 JACK
                        But you didn’t sleep.
                                 BILLY
                        I haven’t slept since 1983.

           Jack takes his social security check and starts to fill out a 
           deposit slip.

                                 JACK
                        Did you meet my daughter?

                                 BILLY
                        Yes.  She was... nice.

                                 JACK
                        And her Neanderthal husband?

                                 BILLY
                        Less nice.

                        He owns a gas station off the interstate.  
                        The fumes have made him mean and stupid.  
                        You know, I’ve had an account here for 
                        fifty-eight years.  Want to hear a 
                        secret?

                                 BILLY
                        Do I have a choice?

                                 JACK 
                        My greatest fantasy, beside the more 
                        recent one with lovely Tammy, the coffee-
                        shop waitress, has always been to blow 
                        this place up.  BOOM!  Ha! 

           Jack says this a bit too loud for Billy’s comfort -- a few 
           customers look their way.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        My father, a famously difficult man, was 
                        President of this branch.  Complete 
                        workaholic.  As a child, this was the 
                        place that took his love away from me.  
                        Locked it in the vault, no doubt, before 
                        coming home.  If he had any that is.  
                        Dried-up onion.  Very proper New England.     

           Jack yells across the bank to a man behind the counter.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Nathan!  Hello!
           NATHAN waves back.  Billy tries to keep his head down.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        The bank manager.  Shall I introduce you?

                                 BILLY
                        Why would I want that?

                                 JACK
                        I thought maybe you were interested in 
                        the bank... opening an account?  

                                 BILLY
                        No.  

                                 JACK
                        Smart choice.  Bad hours, low interest.  

                                 BILLY
                        I have to go.   

                                 JACK
                        Will I see you back at the house?

                                 BILLY
                        I have to pick up my bag.

                                 JACK
                        Spend the night again, if you wish.  I’m 
                        enjoying the company.

           Billy nods (in a completely noncommittal way) then walks out 
           of the bank.  Jack smiles happily and goes back to his 
           deposit slip.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. BARRE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Billy walks past the old Opera House.  He walks past a large 
           hill of granite scree at the edge of town.  At the bottom of 
           the pile is an old quarry filled with water, now covered with 
           ice.  Picking up a hunk of granite, Billy throws it into the 
           air and catches it.  What a strange town.  His cell phone 
           rings...

                                 BILLY
                        Sam, where the fuck are you? 
           FROM A DISTANCE, 

           we see Billy talking on the phone against the mountain of 
           crazy jumbled-stone.  We can’t hear him but his body language 
           indicates bad news.  Abruptly, he flips the cell phone off.  
           He bows his head -- then in anger, throws the rock as far as 
           he can onto the lake of ice.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. JACK’S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

           The old house seems bigger in the blue failing light.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE, LIBRARY

           Jack and a skinny teenager (NEVIN, 15) dressed in disaffected 
           black are sitting at the large desk in the library.  Jack is 
           tutoring the boy in English studies.  Nevin is busy 
           butchering a Robert Frost poem...

                                 NEVIN
                        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, 
                        And sorry I could not travel both 
                        And be one traveler, long I stood
                        And looked down one as far as I could
                        To where it bent in the undergrowth.

           IN THE LIVING ROOM,

           A pair of wet cowboy boots have been placed next the 
           fireplace where a fire is burning away.  Billy is looking 
           down at the pair of slippers he is wearing.  The slippers 
           seem exotic to him.   

                                 NEVIN (O.C.)
                        Then took the other, as just as fair, 
                        And having perhaps the better claim, 
                        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
                        Though as for that the passing there
                        Had worn them really about the same.

           BACK IN THE LIBRARY,

           Nevin takes a deep bored breath and continues...
                                 NEVIN
                        And both that morning equally lay 
                        In leaves no step had trodden black. 
                        Oh, I kept the first for another day!
                        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
                        I doubted if I should ever come back.

           BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM,

           Billy is walking back and forth in the slippers reveling in 
           their comfort.

                                 NEVIN (O.C.)
                        I shall be telling this with a sigh 
                        Somewhere ages and ages hence: 
                        Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
                        I took the one less traveled by,
                        And that has made all the difference.

           BACK IN THE LIBRARY,

           Nevin has finished.

                                 JACK
                        What do you think it means?

                                 NEVIN
                        He took the wrong path?

                                 JACK
                        Why do you say that?

                                 NEVIN
                        Because he got lost.

                                 JACK
                        Where does it say that?

                                 NEVIN
                        Here.

                                 JACK
                        Where?

           Nevin looks at the poem.

                                 NEVIN
                        He must have left it out.
                                 JACK
                          (frustrated)
                        It’s about choice.  The choices we make.  
                        What choice did he make?

                                 NEVIN
                        To take a walk?

                                 JACK
                        He chose one path rather than the other!  
                        And it made all the difference!  Don’t 
                        you see that!?  

                                 NEVIN
                          (no)
                        Yes.  

                                 JACK
                        Why?

                                 NEVIN
                        He didn’t get lost?

                                 JACK
                        I think that’s enough for today.

           BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM,

           Billy sits in the big chair in front of fire.  He looks at 
           the slippers on his feet resting on the ottoman.  There’s 
           something about this place that speaks to him, something he 
           can’t understand.  He takes a sip of that 12 year-old scotch 
           and picks up a book.  It’s Ching Pig Mei. Opening to the 
           title page, he sees that Jack has scribbled a list below a 
           dirty illustration of a man with large dog penis.  The list 
           reads:

           1) Buy motorcycle.
           2) Ask Tammy out for ride on motorcycle.
           3) Forego helmet.

           Jack and Nevin walk into the room from the library.  Bill 
           quickly puts the book down and stands.

                                 JACK
                        Ah, the slippers.  How do they feel?

                                 BILLY
                          (wryly)
                        Like my entire life is wrong.
                                 JACK
                        Walk, let’s see.

           Billy walks.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        No, no.  A connoisseur drags his feet, 
                        with the heel turned in.  Yes, better.  
                        Here is a man, Nevin, that knows a bit 
                        about paths not taken.  If he had only 
                        bought a pair of slippers in his youth 
                        who knows how his life would have been 
                        changed.

           Nevin has no idea what Mr. Jones is talking about.  Billy 
           gives Nevin a look of solidarity (which Nevin greatly 
           appreciates).  There’s a KNOCK on the door.  

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Come in!

           Nathan, the bank manager we saw earlier, walks into the room.  
           Nevin starts to gather his books and jacket.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Nathan, I want to introduce you to a 
                        friend of mine, Bill.

           Billy is not happy, but shakes hands with Nathan.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Nathan manages our biggest bank, or at 
                        least the one with the most money, and of 
                        course, is Nevin’s father.  Bill is a 
                        visiting English scholar from Syracuse.  
                        He specializes in... Rimbaud.  

           Billy doesn’t say anything.  

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Young Nevin could benefit from a touch of 
                        tutorial from Bill here.  

                                 NATHAN
                        Anything that raises his SAT score I’m 
                        behind.  

                                 NEVIN
                        I’m fine.
                                 NATHAN
                        You can’t even spell “fine”.  

                                 NEVIN
                        F..., wait, I know it, F... u,c,k.

                                 JACK
                        See?  You underestimate the lad!

                                 NATHAN
                        Are you visiting long?

                                 BILLY
                        No.

                                 NATHAN
                        There’s not a lot of tourist attractions,  
                        besides the tombstones in the cemetery. 

                                 JACK
                        Exceptional workmanship.  My daughter 
                        used to give cemetery tours.

                                 NEVIN
                        You don’t look like an English teacher.

                                 JACK
                        He’s not no janky teacher, Nevin, he’s a 
                        “associate professor”.  They’re 
                        different, they’re phat.

           Both Nevin and Billy cringe.

                                 NATHAN
                        Let’s go.  I have to drop you off at your 
                        mother’s.  Nice meeting you.  

           As Nevin and Nathan walk out, Jack sits down behind the piano 
           and begins to play Schumann’s Carnaval.

                                 JACK
                        You know, apart from needlepoint, I have 
                        all the skills of a well-bred early 19th 
                        century young woman.  
                          (still playing)
                        When you play music people think that 
                        you’re enjoying it.  “The happy moments 
                        he must have at the piano.”  In truth, 
                        the piano can be a deadly bore.
                                 BILLY
                          (a bad feeling)
                        Why did you call me a professor?

                                 JACK
                        Cover.

                                 BILLY 
                        Why do you think I need a cover?

           Jack stops playing the piano -- he can barely contain his 
           excitement.

                                 JACK 
                        Because you’re here to rob the bank.

                                 BILLY
                        Why didn’t you tell your friend that?

                                 JACK
                        Isn’t it obvious -- I want to rob it with 
                        you!

           More silence.  Billy breaks into laughter.  Jack joins him.  
           But then Billy suddenly stops.  Jack awkwardly keeps 
           laughing.

                                 BILLY
                        What are you laughing at?

                                 JACK
                          (finally stopping)
                        Because you were laughing?

                                 BILLY
                        I was laughing because you’re a fool.  

                                 JACK
                        Oh.  That’s not so funny.

                                 BILLY
                        No.

                                 JACK
                        I know how it sounds.  But think about 
                        it.  Here I sit.  With suitcases that 
                        will never be packed.  A passport that 
                        will never be stamped.  Filling my days 
                        with puzzles of the Acropolis.  When, 
                        suddenly, a stranger comes to my town.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        To my mausoleum of a house.  And what 
                        does the stranger want?  To rob the very 
                        bank that robbed me of my father.  And 
                        there it is.  A chance to grab at 
                        something so beautifully quixotic.  To do 
                        something so extreme, so unexpected, that 
                        even I won’t recognize myself.   

                                 BILLY
                        You read too many books.

                                 JACK
                        Exactly!

                                 BILLY
                        I don’t rob banks.   

                                 JACK
                        OK, I’m going to level with you...
                          (beat)
                        I’m dying.

                                 BILLY
                          (dryly)
                        Now?

                                 JACK
                        I’m serious.  I have MS, Multiple 
                        Sclerosis.  They’ve given me a couple 
                        more good years, if I’m lucky.  And then 
                        it’s a slow, horrible progression.  
                        Losing my body one nerve at a time.  It’s 
                        why my daughter wants me in the Fireside.  
                        I start in a private room, then a private 
                        room with a nurse, then a room in the 
                        hospice, then the hospital in the 
                        basement, then the graveyard out back.   

                                 BILLY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JACK
                        So you can see why the idea of jail or 
                        dying in a hail of bullets doesn’t sound 
                        so bad to me.

                                 BILLY
                        Not that sorry.
                                 JACK
                        Oh, I have every confidence of us getting 
                        away with it.

                                 BILLY
                        There is no “us”.

                                 JACK
                        What do I need to do? 

                                 BILLY
                        Nothing.

                                 JACK
                        There must be something.  I’m a quick 
                        study.

                                 BILLY 
                        You want a “tutorial”?

                                 JACK
                        Yes.  

                                 BILLY
                          (not unkindly)
                        Look, Jack, it’s a fucked world.  I do my 
                        time by looking out for one person.

                                 JACK 
                        You.

                                 BILLY
                        Me.

                                 JACK 
                        Bit of a cliche, but I understand.  
                        You’re not altruistic by nature.

                                 BILLY
                        If I knew what that meant I would 
                        probably say, yes.

                                 JACK
                        What about money?  After-all, bank 
                        robbery is about securing money, right?  
                        And you must need money.  You probably go 
                        through money like water.  Fast cars, 
                        women, gambling debts, waterbeds.  
                                 BILLY 
                        I need another drink.

           Jack continues to talk as he brings out a bottle of scotch 
           and refills Billy’s glass.

                                 JACK
                        Let’s approaches this strictly as a 
                        business deal.  What’s the most you can 
                        make robbing a bank?  Ah, theoretically.

           Jack hands Billy the drink.  Billy sizes Jack up -- and makes 
           a conscious decision to relax.  He doesn’t know where Jack is 
           going but it’s damn hard to be threatened by the man.

                                 BILLY
                        Theoretically, it depends how you rob it.

                                 JACK
                        How many ways are there?

                                 BILLY
                        Three.  

                                 JACK
                        Really?

                                 BILLY
                        One -- pass a teller a note: “This is a 
                        robbery put money in the bag.”  That’s 2-
                        12,000.  Two -- three men, plus a driver, 
                        take over the bank.  You get into the 
                        open vault.  50-500,000.  Three -- break 
                        in off hours and force open the vault and 
                        the safety deposit boxes.  That can be a 
                        million.

                                 JACK
                        OK, door number two.  Four men, say 
                        200,000 split.  That’s 50,000 a piece. 

                                 BILLY
                        So?

                                 JACK
                        I will give you half that, 25,000, up 
                        front for my training.  And I’ll take 
                        only a 10% cut in the robbery.
                                 BILLY 
                        You’d pay me $25,000 dollars to be part 
                        of a robbery that you will earn less than 
                        that?

                                 JACK
                        I’m a dying man.  What do I need with 
                        money?

                                 BILLY
                        Dying can be expensive.

                                 JACK
                        I can afford to die.  I have a pension.  
                        I’m offering you 25,000.  Legally.  On a 
                        schedule.

                                 BILLY
                        What sort of schedule?

                                 JACK
                        Half up front, and half once I’m inducted 
                        into the fraternity.

           Billy shakes his head.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Come on!  25, 000.  That’s a Toyota
                        Camry. With air-conditioning.  And if I 
                        prove un-trainable you can cut me out.  
                        How can you lose?

           Billy’s head is hurting, again.  He takes out the container 
           of Zomig and chases down a few pills with the booze. 

                                 BILLY 
                        In my experience as soon as someone says, 
                        “how can you lose” -- you’ve already 
                        lost.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE PARK AND COMMONS - DAY

           Billy is again standing in the wedding-cake gazebo, smoking a 
           cigarette.  In the south corner of the commons, a large 
           number of STUDENTS have gathered during noon recess.  Billy 
           sees..
           NEVIN 

           (the boy that Jack was tutoring).  Nevin is trying to talk to 
           a pretty GIRL.  Poor Nevin.  It’s the agony of adolescence in 
           motion.

           TOM AND LEO 

           approach the gazebo.

                                 TOM
                        So?

                                 BILLY
                        We have to wait a week for Mr. Sam.

                                 TOM
                        Shit.

                                 LEO
                        Bronchitis?

                                 BILLY
                        Does it matter?  We’ll meet back here in 
                        one week and do this thing.

                                 TOM
                        This is fucked. What are we supposed to 
                        a do in this wasteland for a week?

                                 BILLY
                        Gamble in Niagara, get drunk, read a 
                        book, I don’t care.

                                 LEO
                          (incredulous)
                        Read a book?

                                 TOM
                        You’re not fucking with us because you 
                        don’t want to do that.   

                                 LEO
                        Truth.

                                 BILLY
                        Very scary.  Next Tuesday 10:00.  Here.

           Tom is totally pissed-off but there’s nothing he can do about 
           it.  
                                 TOM
                        What’s Mr. Sam look like?  How will we 
                        recognize him?

                                 BILLY
                          (thinks)
                        He looks like a retired high-school 
                        English teacher.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. ABANDONED QUARRY - DAY

           Jack (looking very much like a retired high-school English 
           teacher) is trying on his new name, making select words echo 
           off the enormous stone walls.   

                                 JACK
                          (attempted-tough)
                        That’s Mr. Sam, to YOU.  MR. Sam.  Mr. 
                        SAM.  MR. SAM.  

           Behind him, Billy is setting up empty beer cans in row on a 
           rock.

                                 BILLY
                        Jesus, don’t wear it out.

                                 JACK
                        Are you sure he won’t show up?

                                 BILLY
                        Yes.

                                 JACK
                        How?

                                 BILLY
                        He’s in the hospital with a collapsed 
                        lung.

           Billy walks away from the cans.  Jack follows.  They stop 
           about 30 feet from the cans.  Billy takes out a Glock from 
           underneath his jacket.  He pops the clip and loads the gun. 

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Do you know why banks are robbed?

                                 JACK
                        It’s where the money is.
                                 BILLY
                        No.  There are a lots of places that have 
                        money.  Banks are robbed because they’re 
                        easy.

                                 JACK
                        They don’t look easy.

                                 BILLY
                        They are.  For a simple reason.  They let 
                        you rob them.  They encourage you.  Every 
                        bank employee has been trained to do two 
                        things during a robbery.  One, help the 
                        robbers get the money as quickly and 
                        effortlessly as possible.  No one will 
                        try to stop you.  Just the opposite, they 
                        want you to take the money and leave the 
                        bank.  This includes the tellers, the 
                        managers and even the guards.  They are 
                        all working for you.  

                                 JACK
                        How convenient.  And two?

                                 BILLY
                        They hit the silent alarms and cameras.

                                 JACK
                        And that’s bad.

                                 BILLY
                        No.  We wear masks.  And silent alarms 
                        are routed through a security company to 
                        a police station.  It’s impossible for 
                        the police to respond in under two 
                        minutes.  At two minutes you drop 
                        everything, take what you have and leave. 

                                 JACK
                        You can really rob a bank in two minutes?

                                 BILLY
                        Most things in life can be done in less 
                        than two minutes if you focus.

                                 JACK
                        You must be quite the lover.

           Billy jams the clip back into the gun and slides the safety 
           off.
                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever been caught?

                                 BILLY
                        No.

                                 JACK
                        Impressive.

                                 BILLY
                        It’s not.  A chimp can rob a bank.  The 
                        problem is that most people that rob 
                        banks are stupider than chimps.

           Billy hands the gun to Jack.    

                                 JACK
                        What do I do?

                                 BILLY 
                        Point and pull the trigger.

           Jack tries to assume the shooting-stance he’s seen in all 
           those TV cop shows. 

                                 JACK
                        What should I imagine it is?

                                 BILLY
                          (taken aback)
                        Why imagine it’s anything?

                                 JACK
                        I just thought, you know...

                                 BILLY
                        Imagine it’s an empty beer can.

           Jack shoots.  BANG.  Misses by a mile.  He shoots again.  
           BANG And again.  BANG.  The bottles remain whole.  He lowers 
           the gun.

                                 JACK
                        Any tips?

                                 BILLY
                        Don’t shoot your foot.

           He raises the gun and tries again.  BANG.  BANG.  No luck.  
                                 JACK 
                        Closer that time?

                                 BILLY
                        Close doesn’t count.

           BANG.  Miss.

                                 JACK 
                        I suppose practice helps.

                                 BILLY
                        No.

                                 JACK
                        Then what?

                                 BILLY
                          (shrugs)
                        Lack of pity.

           Jack tries on his best pitiless-face.  He looks painfully 
           constipated.  He fires.  BANG.  Then again.  BANG.

           A TIN CAN 

           shudders as the bullet grazes it.  Then, as delicately as 
           leaf in autumn, the can falls over.

           JACK 

           leaps into the air with a shout.  He does a little touchdown 
           dance.

                                 JACK
                        Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah!

           Billy’s deadly-serious face edges toward almost a smile.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Billy is alone at a booth having a cup of coffee and reading 
           “Ching Pig Mei”.  He is a quarter through the Chinese novel 
           and is clearly enjoying it.  Looking out the diner window, he 
           sees...
           SUSAN’S SUV

           pull up.  Susan gets out, opens the back, and reaches far 
           inside to grab something.

           IN THE DINER, BILLY

           takes note of the accentuation of her shapely ass.  Susan 
           enters the cafe carrying two large bags of bread.  She puts 
           them behind the counter for Tammy to pickup.  Turning, she 
           sees Billy at the booth.  Taken by surprise, she blushes, 
           then waves.

                                 SUSAN
                        Hi.

                                 BILLY 
                        Hi.

                                 SUSAN
                        Still here?

                                 BILLY
                        Yes.

                                 SUSAN
                        What are you reading?

           Billy turns the book around.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh.

                                 BILLY
                        Your father let me borrow it.  It’s about 
                        a man who gets a doctor to...

                                 SUSAN
                        Yes, I know.  

                                 BILLY
                        You’ve read it?

                                 SUSAN
                        And how do you know my father?

                                 BILLY 
                        Similar interests.
                                 SUSAN
                        Teaching, I hope.

                                 BILLY
                        What else?

                                 SUSAN
                        You don’t look like a teacher. 

                                 BILLY
                          (as if this explains it)
                        Associate professor.

                                 SUSAN
                          (dubious)
                        Really?  Where?

                                 BILLY
                        Syracuse.  What’s with the bread?

                                 SUSAN
                        I work at a bakery.  

           Billy smiles.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 BILLY
                        The first time we met you smelled like 
                        fresh bread.  I thought it was a perfume.

           Susan blushes again.

                                 SUSAN
                        Why did you come to Barre?

                                 BILLY
                        The normal attractions.

                                 SUSAN
                        There are none.

                                 BILLY
                        There’s the cemetery.

                                 SUSAN
                        Have you been?
                                 BILLY
                        I was hoping for a tour.  

                                 SUSAN
                        You can get a pamphlet at the main gate.

                                 BILLY
                        I’m more of a people person.

           Susan laughs -- he’s so not a people person.

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re trouble.  

                                 BILLY
                        Don’t you ever get into trouble?

                                 SUSAN
                        Where’s my father?

                                 BILLY 
                        He had do some banking.

                                 SUSAN 
                        Has he talked at all about moving to the 
                        Fireside?

                                 BILLY
                        Yes.  

                                 SUSAN
                        I keep scheduling times for him to look 
                        the place over and he keeps not showing 
                        up.

                                 BILLY
                        I could talk to him.

                                 SUSAN
                        Really?  Would you do that? 

                                 BILLY
                          (for you)
                        Yes.

                                 SUSAN
                        That would mean a lot.   
           Susan looks at Jack, hopeful.  Who knows, maybe she’s 
           misjudged him.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. JACK’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Billy is sitting at the table looking at money in an envelope 
           (first payment of 10G).  He’s a lot less pleased with it then 
           he thought he would be.  Jack is behind the counter tossing a 
           salad for dinner.

                                 JACK
                        Do you have tatoos?

                                 BILLY
                        Why do you want to know?

                                 JACK
                        I just thought a man like you would have 
                        tatoos.  Maybe a snake or a broken heart.

           Billy doesn’t answer.  He puts the money away.  

                                 BILLY
                        I saw Susan at the cafe.  I don’t think 
                        she believed I was a professor.

                                 JACK
                          (pleased)
                        You need to be more arrogant.  The only 
                        thing that a professor knows, is that he 
                        knows everything.  

                                 BILLY
                        I don’t know everything.

                                 JACK
                        Neither do professors.  If you get in 
                        trouble just say, “how ironic”.   

                                 BILLY
                          (flat)
                        How ironic.

                                 JACK
                        Good!  A natural.
                                 BILLY
                        She expects to see you Friday at that 
                        retirement place. 

                                 JACK 
                        Are you her messenger now?  

                                 BILLY
                        If you don’t go she’ll get more 
                        suspicious.

                                 JACK
                        You know she’s married.  

                                 BILLY 
                        I know.

           Jack brings the food over and sits down.  He starts to dish 
           it out.

                                 JACK
                        Ever been?  Married.

                                 BILLY
                          (beat)
                        Yes.

                                 JACK
                        Really?  What happened?

                                 BILLY
                        It didn’t.

           They start to eat.  It’s surprisingly peaceful and domestic, 
           like they’ve been doing this for years.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. STONE STREET - NIGHT

           Jack and Billy are walking down a mean looking industrial 
           street of Barre.

                                 JACK
                        After my wife died I took off and went to 
                        New York.  I was going to tear-up the 
                        city. 

                                 BILLY
                        Did you?
                                 JACK
                        It rained.  I saw 12 movies and came 
                        home.  

           They stop at a hole-in-the-wall bar, called THE QUARRY.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Here?

                                 BILLY
                        Ever been?

                                 JACK
                        It has a reputation for being a bit 
                        rough.

           Billy opens the door for Jack to enter.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. THE QUARRY BAR - NIGHT

           Dark.  Very basic.  Crowded.  Jack and Billy are sitting at a 
           table near the end of the bar.  Both are drinking beer. 

                                 BILLY
                        Three of us enter.  I go to the vault.  
                        You and Tom control the bank.  Keep the 
                        customers in order.  You have to be 
                        confident, firm, unafraid.   The most 
                        dangerous part is the unexpected hero.  
                        The employees have all been trained to 
                        rollover but occasionally you find a 
                        customer with strange ideas.  

                                 JACK
                        Even with our... you know...

           Makes a gun with his fingers under the table.

                                 BILLY
                        Yes.  You have to take the idea out of 
                        their head.

                                 JACK
                        How?

                                 BILLY
                        Look at the man at the end of the bar.  
                        See how the others give him space.  
           They are looking at a big young man, drinking alone.

                                 JACK
                        He’s big.

                                 BILLY
                        That’s not it.  It’s how he holds 
                        himself.  But mostly it’s the look in the 
                        eye.  That don’t-fuck-with-me look.

           Jack examines the man then turns back to Billy with his best 
           D.F.W.M look.  The ludicrousness of the situation strikes 
           Billy hard.  He rubs his head.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        You’re scaring me.

                                 JACK
                        In a good way?

                                 BILLY
                        No.

           Two ROWDY FRIENDS are having a scuffle over picking a song on 
           the jukebox.  One pushes the other and he falls back against 
           Jack and Billy’s table, hitting Billy and sloshing his drink.  
           The rowdy guy barely looks back before he’s up and yelling at 
           his friend.  Billy has said nothing.  Jack is surprised that 
           he has let this pass.

                                 JACK
                        You said nothing.

                                 BILLY
                        Know why?

                                 JACK
                        No.

                                 BILLY
                        Because they’re a team.  And one guy 
                        can’t take on two except in the movies.

                                 JACK
                        Aren’t we a team too?

                                 BILLY 
                        Not so long ago he’d have apologized.  
                        That’s how you know you’re getting old.   
           Taking the envelope of money out of his jacket, Billy places 
           it on the table.  He pushes the envelope across the table to 
           Jack.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        And if I’m old, you’re a toothless 
                        fossil.    

           Jack doesn’t touch the money.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Everyone gets old, Jack.  That doesn’t 
                        mean you have to be a fool about it.

           Jack refuses to accept this.  He looks away at the two rowdy 
           guys by the jukebox.  There’s a crazy look in Jack’s eye.

                                 JACK
                        Hey!  You two, shut up!

           THE ROWDY GUYS 

           continue to roughhouse.  They don’t even bother to look back 
           at him.  

           JACK 

           gets up.  Billy stays seated, watching -- some lessons need 
           to be painful.  Jack walks up to the first guy, grabs him by 
           the shoulder and swings him around.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        I said keep it down!

           The guy stares intensely at this angry old man.  It looks 
           like he’s is going to hit Jack when...

                                 ROWDY GUY 1 
                        Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
                        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; 
                        All mimsy were the borogoves, 
                        And the mome raths outgrabe.
                        Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
                        The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
                        Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
                        The frumious Bandersnatch!

           Needless to say, Jack is confused.
                                 ROWDY GUY 1 (CONT’D)
                        You were my teacher in the 9th grade!  
                        Joseph Puissoneau.

                                 JACK
                          (slowly remembering)
                        Ah, Puissoneau.

           Joseph enthusiastically pumps Jack’s hand. 

                                 ROWDY GUY 1
                        I work at Florents’ as a carver.  Are you 
                        still teaching poetry?

                                 JACK
                        No, I’m retired.

                                 ROWDY GUY 1
                        I hated you for making me memorize that.  
                        But now I think it’s the only thing I 
                        took away from school.  I recite it to my 
                        three year-old son at night and it makes 
                        him laugh.  I have you to thank for that, 
                        Mr. Jones.

                                 JACK
                        I give you a B plus. 

           Joseph is very pleased.  Jack nods his head and walks back to 
           his table.  

           SITTING BACK DOWN, JACK 

           looks at the envelope of money on the table, then up to 
           Billy.  At first, Jack is all seriousness -- then he smiles -- 
           then he laughs out loud.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        I picked a fight with the one guy in this 
                        town that likes me!

                                 BILLY
                          (deadpan)
                        How ironic.

           Taking the envelope of money, Billy puts it back into his 
           jacket pocket.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. BARRE - EARLY MORNING

           Small town quiet.  A lone dog wanders through the town 
           square.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT.  BARBER SHOP - EARLY MORNING

           No customers yet.  The BARBER sits in the corner reading a 
           boating magazine.  The door bell tinkles and Jack walks in.  
           He sits down in the chair and barber puts the apron around 
           his neck.

                                 BARBER
                        Beautiful morning.

                                 JACK
                        Is it?  I hadn’t noticed.

           The barber takes up his scissors to give Jack “the usual” 
           haircut he’s been getting in the same place, with the same 
           barber, for 20 years.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        I want something different today.

                                 BARBER
                          (surprised)
                        A different haircut?

                                 JACK
                        Yes.  No part.  And short.  Very short.  
                        Razor short.

           The barber looks like a meteor has slammed into his shop out 
           of the clear blue sky.

                                 BARBER
                        No part?  Razor?

                                 JACK
                        Yes.  Somewhere between ‘heading to 
                        Baghdad’ and ‘fresh out of jail’.

                                 BARBER
                        Are you feeling alright?

                                 JACK
                        Never better.
                                 BARBER
                        Just a... change?

                                 JACK
                        And the sideburns, I’m going to grow them 
                        long.  Maybe even, what do they call it?  
                        A soul patch.

           The barber doesn’t know what to do with his hands.  He picks 
           up the electric razor.

                                 BARBER
                          (shaken)
                        I thought I knew you.

                                 JACK
                          (very happy)
                        Nobody knows me!

           The barber nods and turns on the razor.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE, LIBRARY - MORNING

           Billy, in bed, wakes up.  He stares up at the walls of books. 
           Sitting up, his feet naturally slide into the slippers on the 
           floor.  He looks down and notes this as strange and 
           enjoyable.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Billy has borrowed Jack’s razor and is shaving for the first 
           time since we’ve met him.  True to form, we can see a broken 
           heart tatoo on his forearm.  He examines his long sideburns 
           and impulsively decides to shorten them up.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Jack is walking down the street.  He stops at a shop window 
           and looks at his new haircut in the reflection.  It looks 
           good.  The shop is a men’s clothing store and in the display 
           window are spring coats.  Most are very practical New England 
           but to the side Jack spies a brown leather one...

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. HOUSE, VESTIBULE - DAY

           Billy is heading out.  He reaches for his leather jacket 
           hanging on the coat-rack -- and hesitates.  Next to his 
           leather jacket is one of Jack’s long tweed overcoats.  Billy 
           fingers the texture of the wool coat.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Jack is sitting in his normal spot.  He is wearing the brown 
           leather jacket we saw in the window (and his new haircut).  
           Tammy, the waitress, comes over.  As usual, she’s doesn’t 
           really look at him.

                                 TAMMY
                        Tuna sandwich and tea?

                                 JACK
                        Just coffee.

           Tammy looks up at Jack.  She’s puzzled.  Like she thinks for 
           a second it might be somebody else, but wait, no, it’s the 
           same person -- just changed a bit.

                                 TAMMY
                        Coffee?

           Jack doesn’t say anything.  Tammy hesitates then turns and 
           heads to the counter to get the order.

           Jack breathes deep.  Ah, life.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. HOPE CEMETERY - DAY

           Grey granite tombstones and memorials rising from the white 
           snow ground.  Billy, clean shaven and wearing one of Jack’s 
           tweed overcoats, is standing in front of a large sculpture of 
           an angel.  The angel is sitting, its legs crossed.  The name 
           BRUSA carved above it.  Billy is contemplating the angel’s 
           unusual expression.  Susan walks up from behind.

                                 SUSAN
                          (re: the angel)
                        I always thought she looked hopelessly 
                        bored.
                                 BILLY
                        Like she’s thinking, “Come on, die 
                        already”.  

           Billy turns and sees that Susan has a black-eye.  She waits 
           for him to say something about it -- but he doesn’t.

                                 SUSAN 
                        Did you talk to my father about the 
                        Fireside?

                                 BILLY
                        He’ll be there.  

                                 SUSAN
                        Then you’ve earned your tour.  Are you 
                        ready, sir?

                                 BILLY
                        Yes, ma’am.

                                 SUSAN
                        Hope Cemetery is the newest cemetery in 
                        Barre. Founded in the year 1895.  

           They stop in front of a tombstone graced with a carving of a 
           man smoking a cigarette dreaming of his wife far away from 
           home; emerging from the smoke is an image of his wife.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Donati. He was a master carver in the 
                        30’s. The tradition of Barre is for the 
                        carver to carve his own tombstone.

                                 BILLY
                        Before he dies?

                                 SUSAN
                        It helps.  

           Susan catches Billy looking at her black-eye.  

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Does it look that bad?

                                 BILLY
                          (yes)
                        No.  
                                 SUSAN
                        I walked into a pole.  Really?

                                 BILLY
                        You look beautiful.

           Susan smiles.  Together, they walk off into the snowy depths 
           of the cemetery...

           A tombstone soccer ball, a tombstone race car, a tombstone of 
           an armchair (stuffed), a tombstone airplane.  An exact 
           replica of Michelangelo’s Pieta. Billy and Susan are clearly 
           enjoying each others presence.  Finally, they end at...

           THE HALVOSA TOMBSTONE

           It’s of a couple sitting up in bed in their pajamas, holding 
           hands.  Billy reads the inscription:

                                 BILLY
                        “Set me as a seal upon thine heart for 
                        love is strong as death.”

           AT HIS SIDE, BILLY’S HAND

           is millimeters away from Susan’s hand.  Behind their nearly-
           touching hands are the touching stone hands.  Conscious of 
           their almost-physical-connection, Susan allows her fingers to 
           linger next to Billy’s for a few moments before willing them 
           to slowly drift apart.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The furniture in the living room has been rearranged to 
           approximate the interior of the bank.  The sofa and chair are 
           in line to represent the teller’s counter.  The standing 
           lamps have paper bags over the shades with smiley-faces drawn 
           on them.  Suddenly Jack, with black knit mask over his face 
           and a gun in his hand, storms into the room.  

                                 JACK
                        Ladies and gentlemen your attention, 
                        please!  This is a robbery!  Everybody 
                        must lie on the floor!  NOW!  
           Jack approaches a suspicious lamp and gives the smiley-face
           shade his best D.F.W.M stare.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        YOU!  Yes you, you ugly Tiffany knock-
                        off!  Down on the FLOOR!   

           He pushes the lamp over with the muzzle of the gun then turns 
           to confront a dangerous Victorian lamp behind him.   
           Unfortunately, he’s failed to take into consideration the 
           heroics of a brave little ottoman and trips over it.  Trying 
           to control his fall, he grabs a side-table but it topples 
           along with him.  The gun breaks free of his hand and skitters 
           across the oak floor until...  

           A COWBOY BOOT

           stops it.  Billy has been watching from the corner.  He bends 
           down and picks up the gun.

           JACK 

           is on the floor with the cloth-covering of the side-table 
           wrapped around his face.  He’s banged his shin and grunts in 
           pain.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        It’s not my fault.  I wasn’t expecting a 
                        midget.  But I can assure you, Barre has 
                        only one midget, Mrs. Foster, actually a 
                        dwarf, I think, she has a large head, but 
                        not to worry, she’s at least 82 with 
                        extremely bad arthritis.  

                                 BILLY
                        What’s the matter with your hand?

           Jack’s right hand is shaking and he seems to have trouble 
           closing it.  

                                 JACK
                          (standing)
                        Nothing.

           Billy just looks at him.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        It’s nothing.
           Jack walks out of the living room and into...

           THE KITCHEN

           He takes down his Avonex medication to prepare an injection.  
           Billy appears behind him.

                                 JACK
                        Why Barre?

                                 BILLY
                        What do you mean?

                                 JACK
                        A million banks in 50 states.  Why this 
                        one?

                                 BILLY
                        It’s not fate.

                                 JACK
                        Then what is it?

                                 BILLY
                        Blue collar towns keep more cash on hand 
                        for payrolls.

                                 JACK
                        That’s it?

                                 BILLY 
                        And it’s forty-eight seconds from Route 

           Jack mixes the powder and loads the syringe.

                                 JACK
                        What if someone identifies the car?

                                 BILLY
                        The driver steals a car the night before.  
                        We switch to a safe car before we get on 
                        interstate.   

           Jack sticks the needle into his upper butt, injects the 
           liquid and throws the needle in the sink.

                                 JACK 
                        May I have the gun, please.
                                 BILLY
                        Why?

                                 JACK
                        I’m going to kill the ottoman.

           Billy hands the gun over to Jack.  Jack smiles, like a boy 
           that’s about to be naughty, and exits the kitchen.  Billy 
           goes the sink and fills a glass with water.  He takes out the 
           container of Zomig and shakes out a few tablets.

           BANG! -- a gunshot is heard from the living room. 

           Billy sighs and swallows his pills. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. THE FIRESIDE RETIREMENT SUITES - DAY

           Large structure.  Could be a small hospital.  Not unfriendly.  
           Susan is waiting in front.  She is nervously playing with her 
           lipstick.  Finally, she sees Jack walking down the street 
           toward her.  He kisses her on the cheek, noticing her still 
           bruised eye.

                                 JACK
                        Sorry I’m late.

                                 SUSAN
                          (surprised)
                        You got a haircut.

                                 JACK
                        And you got a black-eye.

                                 SUSAN
                        Walked into a pole.

           They enter the building.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. FIRESIDE, A SINGLE ROOM - DAY

           Jack and Susan are being given a tour by an efficient middle-
           aged CARE-MANAGER.  The room is bright, very small, clean.  
           There’s some minimal furniture.  It couldn’t be more 
           different from the large rambling mansion where Jack 
           presently lives.  
                                 CARE-MANAGER
                        This room is not available, but they all 
                        look pretty much the same.   

                                 SUSAN
                        It’s nice, isn’t it?  

                                 JACK
                        Hmm. No fireplace?

                                 CARE-MANAGER
                        That wouldn’t be to code.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. FIRESIDE, GAME ROOM

           Table with board games.  Two OLD LADIES are watching a soap 
           on TV.  The care-manager shows the room to Jack and Susan.

                                 CARE-MANAGER
                        And this is our game room.

                                 JACK
                        No fireplace?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. FIRESIDE, CAFETERIA

           Jack, Susan, and the care-manager view the hall.  It’s empty 
           except for kitchen staff setting up lunch.  Attempts have 
           been made at making the room cozy and nice but an 
           institutional quality still seeps through.  There is, of 
           course, no fireplace. 

                                 JACK
                        Hmmm. No...

                                 CARE-MANAGER
                          (tight)
                        No.  There isn’t.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. FIRESIDE, HOSPITAL

           Not large but efficient long-term care.  They walk down the 
           single hallway.  They pass patients in most of the rooms.  
           It’s not pretty.  
           People dying slowly with the help of modern medical 
           technology.  Jack stops and looks into one of the rooms.  He 
           sees...  

           AN ELDERLY MAN, 

           drugged-out, possibly in a coma, and hooked to an oxygen 
           tank.  Tubes going everywhere.  

           JACK 

           stares at him.  Very sobering.

                                 CARE-MANAGER
                        We have the most modern equipment and an 
                        excellent medical staff...

           The care-manager’s beeper goes off.  She looks at the 
           message.

                                 CARE-MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Please, excuse me.  But I have to take 
                        this.

           The care-manager walks down the hall, back to reception.  
           Jack has continued to stare at the patient.

                                 JACK
                        I know him.

                                 SUSAN
                        Really?

                                 JACK
                        He used to teach math in Montpelier.

           Jack finally turns away from the sick and dying man and 
           wanders into...

           AN EMPTY ROOM

           He sits down on the narrow hospital bed.  Susan stands at the 
           door.  Jack looks up at her.   

                                 JACK
                        Their only fireplace is a crematorium.

                                 SUSAN
                        Oh, dad.

           Susan sits next to him and tries to comfort him.
                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s not that bad.  

                                 JACK
                        I made my will.

                                 SUSAN
                          (tersely)
                        It’s just a place to live.

           Jack looks at her.

                                 JACK
                        How did we ever get this way?

                                 SUSAN
                        What way?

                                 JACK
                        Remember when we use to tell each other 
                        everything?  Important things.  And now, 
                        it’s the weather or pretty lies so we 
                        don’t offend.  This is not just a place 
                        to live.  

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re upset.

                                 JACK
                        And you married a prick!

           Susan stands, shocked and affronted.

                                 SUSAN
                        I won’t have you say that!

                                 JACK
                        I’ll say it if I want to.  It’s the 
                        truth.  This is a place to die, and Frank 
                        is a prick.  You can say it too.  
                        Frank... is... a... prick.  Go ahead and 
                        say it.

                                 SUSAN
                        I will not.

                                 JACK
                        You’ve thought it for eight years.  Go 
                        on, say it.
                                 SUSAN 
                        What good would it do?

                                 JACK
                        I don’t know.  Let’s find out.  Frank is 
                        a stupid fat prick.

                                 SUSAN
                        No.

                                 JACK
                          (re: her black-eye)
                        Why?  How many poles do you need to walk 
                        into while he was drunk and didn’t mean 
                        it?  Frank is a prick.

                                 SUSAN
                        Stop!

                                 JACK 
                        He’s ruined your life with his dullness 
                        and bowling and bullying.  He won’t even 
                        knock you up!  Is he impotent to boot?   
                        And you’ve never once told him to fuck-
                        off!

                                 SUSAN
                        And you would?

                                 JACK
                        I want you to be better than me.  My life 
                        is an example of what-not-to-do.  Yours 
                        should be so much more.

                                 SUSAN
                        I’ve never seen you like this.

                                 JACK
                        Unfortunately.

           Silence.  Then Susan gently tries to find some familiar 
           footing...

                                 SUSAN
                        I know this is hard.  

           Jack resigns himself to “the weather”.

                                 JACK
                        Or course.
                                 SUSAN
                        But staying in the house doesn’t make 
                        sense.

                                 JACK
                        Yes, I know.

                                 SUSAN 
                        Where is that woman?

           Susan goes to the door.  But she doesn’t leave.  She just 
           stands there.  Frozen.  Long beat, then...

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                          (barely a whisper)
                        He is a prick.

                                 JACK
                          (not sure he heard right)
                        What?

                                 SUSAN
                          (louder)
                        Big.  Fat.  Prick.

           Susan turns, she’s crying.  Jack stands.  They rush to each 
           other and embrace.  Jack holds her tight; she’s his little 
           girl again.

                                 JACK
                          (gently)
                        It’s alright, sweetheart.  It’s 
                        alright...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE, LIBRARY - DAY

           Billy takes a tobacco pipe from a rack of many and knocks it 
           against his palm.  Pulling apart his unfiltered cigarettes, 
           Billy stuffs the tobacco into the wooden pipe.  

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Billy is sitting in the big leather chair by the fire; he is 
           wearing slippers, smoking the pipe and slowly turning the 
           pages of a book on Renaissance painting.  He is extremely 
           content.  A KNOCK on the door is heard...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. VESTIBULE 

           Billy opens the door to find Nevin, the boy that Jack has 
           been tutoring.  

                                 BILLY
                        Yes?

                                 NEVIN
                          (hangdog)
                        I have a lesson with Mr. Jones?

                                 BILLY
                        He’s not here.

           Nevin’s spirts suddenly soar.  A reprieve!  Billy finds this 
           disrespectful and acts impulsively.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m giving your lesson today.

           To Billy’s satisfaction, Nevin visibly deflates.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE, LIBRARY

           Nevin and Billy take seats at the desk.  

                                 BILLY
                        Did you have an assignment?

                                 NEVIN
                        A poem.

                                 BILLY
                        Did you study it?  Be honest.

                                 NEVIN
                        Not really.
                                 BILLY
                        Good.  Let’s hear it.

           Nevin takes out his book.  Clears his throat and proceeds to 
           mangle poor Andrew Marvell.

                                 NEVIN 
                        But at my back I always hear 
                        Time's winged chariot hurrying near; 
                        And yonder all before us lie 
                        Deserts of vast eternity. 
                        Thy beauty shall no more be found, 
                        Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound 
                        My echoing song: then worms shall try 
                        That long preserved virginity, 
                        And your quaint honour turn to dust, 
                        And into ashes all my lust:
                        The grave's a fine and private place,
                        But none, I think, do there embrace.

           Billy seems lost in the language.  

                                 BILLY
                        Let me see it.

           Nevin gives Billy the poem.  Billy looks it over while Nevin 
           waits and waits.  Finally, Billy cracks the meaning of the 
           poem and his face lights up.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Know what it means?

                                 NEVIN
                        No.

                                 BILLY
                        Do you care?

                                 NEVIN
                        No.

                                 BILLY
                        What do you think of girls?

                                 NEVIN
                        What do you mean?

                                 BILLY
                        Do you like them, do you want to get laid 
                        before you’re forty?
                                 NEVIN
                          (turns red)
                        Yeah.

                                 BILLY
                        This poem, that you don’t care about, 
                        tells you how.

                                 NEVIN
                        It does?

                                 BILLY
                        Tells you how to get into their pants.  
                        Plain and simple.  I would think a skinny 
                        little virgin like yourself would find 
                        that interesting.  Oh, well...

           Billy goes to close the book -- but Nevin stops him.

                                 NEVIN 
                        I’m, I’m interested... but I don’t, you 
                        know... get it?

                                 BILLY
                        This guy has a girl who’s not putting 
                        out.  So, he tells her: I don’t have all 
                        year for this waste of time.  And neither 
                        do you.  You’re pretty now but you’re not 
                        getting any younger.  Time is not going 
                        to be kind to those hips.  No way.  Wait 
                        too long and worms will be the only thing 
                        tapping your ass.  So let’s do-it, baby, 
                        before there’s nothing left to do.

                                 NEVIN
                        That works?

                                 BILLY
                        No.  She would tell you to fuck-off.  

                                 NEVIN
                        Oh.

                                 BILLY
                        It’s not what he says, it’s the way he 
                        says it.  “The grave's a fine and private 
                        place, but none, I think, do there 
                        embrace.”  Lord, that will work.  That
                        will set her spinning.  Understand? 
                                 NEVIN
                        Say it... pretty?

                                 BILLY
                          (nods)
                        Poetry... gets... you... sex.    

           Nevin touches the poetry book like it might be Aladdin’s
           lamp.

                                 NEVIN
                        Sick.

           Billy stands indicating that the lesson is over.

                                 NEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Is that all?

                                 BILLY
                        Yeah.

                                 NEVIN
                        Should I write a paper on it?

                                 BILLY
                        Why bother.  

           Billy picks up the copy of “Ching Pig Mei” from the table and 
           tosses it to Nevin.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Here.  The hero uses another strategy.  
                        Not medically legal in Vermont but still 
                        makes a good read.

                                 NEVIN
                        For next week?

                                 BILLY
                          (beat)
                        Yeah, for next week.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Again, the furniture in the living room has been rearranged 
           to approximate the interior of the bank.  Upbeat musak is 
           playing on the stereo.  Again, Jack storms into the room, 
           masked and holding the gun.
                                 JACK
                        Ladies and gentlemen your attention, 
                        please!  This is a robbery!  Everybody 
                        must lie on the floor!  NOW!  

           Jack approaches the smiley-face shade.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        YOU!  Down on the FLOOR!   

           He pushes the lamp over with the gun, then without looking, 
           coolly kicks the ottoman (with a bullet hole in it) out of 
           the way.  Turning with grace and confidence, he confronts the 
           Victorian lamp.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        DOWN!

           The lamp falls.  He stands surveying the room of cowering and 
           subservient furniture -- master of his domain.  

           Jack’s watch beeps.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Two minutes.  I thank you all for your 
                        time and patience.  Good day.

           IN THE LIBRARY

           Billy is sitting behind the desk working on the 1000-piece
           jig-saw puzzle of the Acropolis.  He’s just finishing a row 
           of 13 Doric columns for the Parthenon. On the desk is a 
           photo of Susan smiling.  Next to that photo is one of Frank 
           and Susan.  Billy turns down the photo of Susan and Frank -- 
           leaving just Susan smiling at him.  Jack enters, pulling off 
           his ski-mask.

                                 JACK
                        I slayed ‘em. 

                                 BILLY
                        Figuratively?

                                 JACK
                        Of course.  I’m a furniture pacifistic by 
                        nature.  

                                 BILLY
                        The ottoman would disagree.
                                 JACK
                        The others have been cooperative since I 
                        made an example of him.

           Billy glances at the turned down photo on the desk. 

                                 BILLY
                        Then it’s time for your final test.  

                                 JACK
                          (thrilled)
                        Bring it on.   

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. JACK’S FORD - DAY

           Access road off Route 89.  Jack and Billy are in Jack’s car 
           looking across a vacant lot at a Shell gas station.

                                 JACK
                        You want me to rob my son-in-law’s gas 
                        station?

                                 BILLY
                        Yes.

                                 JACK
                        The fact that you like Susan wouldn’t 
                        have anything to do with this?

                                 BILLY
                        Who said I liked Susan?

                                 JACK
                        You did.

                                 BILLY 
                        You’re afraid of Frank.  That makes it a 
                        good test. 

                                 JACK
                        It’s not good, Bill -- it’s bloody 
                        genius.  Where’s my gun?

           Billy takes out the gun, pop’s the clip and starts ejecting 
           the bullets.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Aww. Is that necessary?
                                 BILLY
                        Does he own a gun?

                                 JACK
                          (sulk)
                        No. 

           Billy snaps back in the empty clip and hands the gun over to 
           Jack. 

                                 BILLY
                        Get the money, get out.

           Pulling down his black-knit ski-mask, Jack salutes his 
           captain and exits the car.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           VACANT LOT - DAY

           Jack walks across the field of crusty snow.  He looks like a 
           Barre version of Lawrence of Arabia: a small, lone man 
           against a big sky marching toward his destiny.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           Typical station: small office connected to a small garage.  
           No cars filling-up.  Jack stops behind the gas pumps to 
           reconnoitre.  He can’t see a soul anywhere.   

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. GAS STATION, OFFICE - DAY

           Jack enters, all business: gun out, mask down.  But nobody is 
           there.  The office is empty.  He swings the gun wildly to the 
           right, the left.  Going to the door separating the office 
           from the garage, he carefully looks through the window.  He 
           sees...

           FRANK (HIS SON IN LAW)

           in the garage under an old car replacing its oil.  

                                 JACK
                          (to himself)
                        Sweet.
           JACK SLIPS BEHIND THE COUNTER

           Lined up on the shelves are rows of bowling trophies.  And 
           here Jack meets his first big obstacle: an old dirty Sharp 
           cash register; which he has no idea how to open.  It’s 
           basically a minicomputer.  Jack starts pushing buttons 
           (Return, Esc, Total).  He gets an occasional BEEP and BURP 
           but the cash-drawer refuses to slide open.  

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Oh crap!

           Then he sees that the drawer itself has a keyhole and below 
           that, on a hook, a key-ring holding a dozen keys.  The first 
           three keys don’t fit.  The forth does.  He turns it and 
           nothing happens.  Frustrated, he slams the butt of the gun 
           down on the keypad -- just as... 

           The window to the garage EXPLODES.  

           Shocked, Jack looks through the jagged glass into the garage 
           and sees... 

           FRANK HOLDING A GUN

           If possible, Frank looks as scared as Jack.  As Frank fires 
           again... 

           JACK DUCKS BEHIND THE COUNTER

           BANG, BANG!  A bullet hits a trophy’s, knocking the bowling 
           ball from the figurine’s hand.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           ACROSS THE VACANT LOT, IN THE FORD,

           Billy hears the shots.  He looks down at the bullets in this 
           hand. 

                                 BILLY
                        Shit.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BACK IN THE OFFICE,

           Jack leaps up and fires his gun back at Frank.  Of course 
           nothing happens.  
           In his excitement, Jack forgot it wasn’t loaded.  He stands 
           there, momentarily confused, then yells out...

                                 JACK 
                        BANG!

           Stupid for sure, but fortunately Frank didn’t notice.  He was 
           too busy diving behind the car.  

           Jack ducks as four more shots are fired -- BANG, BANG, BANG, 
           BANG!  

           One of the bullets slams into the cash register and, 
           miraculously, the drawer slides opens with a DING!.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m going to shoot your ass off, you 
                        mother-fucker! I’m going to shoot your 
                        ass!  Then I’m gong to shoot your mother-
                        fucking dead ass!  

           Jack grabs the money out the drawer, while staying down, and 
           looks desperately toward the door.

                                 JACK
                          (a mantra to himself)
                        Get money, get out.  Get money, get out.  
                        Get money, get out...

           Jack hears a CLICK.  Sneaking a peek into the garage, he  
           sees...

           FRANK PULLING THE TRIGGER

           of his gun without effect.  It’s, praise the Lord, empty.  

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Ha!

           JACK

           jumps up and runs to the door, clutching the money in his 
           hands.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           OUTSIDE THE GAS STATION,  

           Jack bolts from the office.  He makes it just past the gas 
           pumps when Frank comes out of the garage holding a shotgun.
                                 FRANK
                        Run, you motherfucker, run!

           He fires the shotgun.  BOOM!

           LUCKILY FOR JACK, 

           the shot was blocked by the pumps, leaving him unharmed.

           UNLUCKILY FOR FRANK, 

           the shot hits the hose to the gas pump and lights it on fire.  
           Black smoke billows upward as the plastic hose burns.  

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Motherfucker!  Fuck me!

           Frank turns and quickly scrambles back into garage, searching 
           for a fire-extinguisher.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THE ROAD

           Jack runs down the center of the long access road as if his 
           life depended on it (which it does).  This sort of exercise 
           is not advisable for an out-of-shape man in his 70’s.  

           Behind him, in the receding distance, black smoke continues 
           to rise.  It’s looks like Jack’s escaping Armageddon...

           THE FORD

           cuts Jack off at the intersection.  The passenger door swings 
           open and Jack barely manages to crawl inside.  The car 
           instantly accelerates, tires squealing.

           INSIDE THE CAR,

           Jack gasps like a fish out of water, desperately trying to 
           catch his breath.

                                 BILLY
                        You said he didn’t have a gun!  

                                 JACK
                        I...
                          (gasp) 
                        was...
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                          (gasp) 
                        mistaken.

                                 BILLY
                        I’ve seen Utah militias with less 
                        firepower.

           Out the back window, we see...

           THE GAS STATION EXPLODE --

           KA-BOOM!! Black smoke and red shooting flames.  Nicely 
           impressive.  

           BILLY AND JACK,

           both look back to see the destruction.  They also see Frank 
           running away from the burning station, unharmed.

                                 JACK
                        Oh, my bad.

           Billy turns his attention back to the road and concentrates 
           on putting as many miles as he can between them and the 
           burning station.  They ride in silence for awhile.  Then 
           Billy looks over and sees that Jack is smiling.

                                 BILLY
                        What?

           Jack pulls the money out of his pockets and starts to slowly 
           count it. 

                                 JACK 
                          (singing softly)
                        And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown 
                        The baddest man in the whole damned town
                        Badder than a-old King Kong
                        And meaner than a junkyard dog!

           Jack laughs.  Billy tries to keep a straight face but he 
           can’t hold on to it -- his scowl become a smile, which 
           becomes a grin.  Soon he’s laughing along with Jack... 

                                 JACK AND BILLY
                          (together)
                        And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown 
                        The baddest man in the whole damned town
                        Badder than a-old King Kong
                        And meaner than a junkyard dog...
           OUTSIDE, THE FORD

           shoots down the country road making a clean getaway.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Billy is sitting at the piano, tinkering with the keys.  The 
           pipe is between his teeth.   

           IN THE KITCHEN,

           Jack is talking on the phone while drinking a whiskey and 
           stuffing his face with nachos.  

                                 JACK
                        Horrible.  Just horrible.  What’s the 
                        world coming to?

           INTERCUT WITH: INT. SUSAN AND FRANK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Susan is on the phone.  Frank is behind her in a barcalounger
           angrily drinking beer after beer.  His eyebrows are missing.  

                                 SUSAN
                        I know.  He could have been killed.  And 
                        the station is totally destroyed.

                                 JACK
                        But it’s insured?

                                 SUSAN
                        Yes, of course.  But still.

                                 JACK 
                        Was he able to give a description?

                                 SUSAN
                        Frank thinks he was, you know, African-
                        American.

                                 JACK
                        Really?  He didn’t wear a mask?

                                 SUSAN
                        He did.

                                 JACK
                        Then how does he know?
                                 SUSAN
                          (pained)
                        Frank says it was the way he moved.  He 
                        could tell.

                                 JACK 
                        Let’s talk later.

                                 SUSAN
                        Ok, bye.

           JACK 

           hangs up.  He takes his drink and moves into...

           THE LIVING ROOM

           After his long run, Jack can barely walk.  He limps along 
           like a sore old man (which he is).

                                 JACK
                        Apparently I move like Kobe Bryant.

                                 BILLY
                        Hmm.

           Jack tries to stretch; he attempts to touch his toes but only 
           makes it, painfully, to his knees. 

                                 JACK 
                        There are three essential rules for old 
                        men, Bill.  One: never pass a bathroom 
                        without peeing.  Two: never waste an
                        erection -- even if you’re by yourself.  
                        And three:  never, ever, trust a fart.

           Billy smiles but suddenly his smile fades.  He smells 
           something -- something gaseous.

                                 BILLY
                        Oh man!  You didn’t?

                                 JACK
                          (guilty)
                        Did what?

                                 BILLY
                        It’s like something died.
           Billy opens the door to the garden for some needed fresh air 
           and walks outside.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THE TERRACE - NIGHT

           Jack finds Billy staring up at the stars.  They are 
           unnervingly bright.  

                                 JACK
                        Ever see them this bright?

                                 BILLY
                        Yes.

                                 JACK
                        Not in the city.

                                 BILLY
                        I didn’t grow up in the city.

                                 JACK
                        Where?

                                 BILLY
                        Kentucky.

           Billy takes a long pull on his pipe.  Jack follows the smoke 
           as it snakes its way up into the night sky. 

                                 JACK 
                        Do you ever feel, Bill, that who you are, 
                        really are, deep down, is not totally 
                        right with the life you’re living?

                                 BILLY
                        Why?

                                 JACK
                        You make a very good professor.

                                 BILLY
                        You think?

                                 JACK
                        I would go as far as to call it ironic.

                                 BILLY
                        Hmm.
                                 JACK
                        Do you?

                                 BILLY
                          (sad fact)
                        No.  What you do is who you are.  

                                 JACK
                        Aren’t we more than that?

                                 BILLY
                        Often less.

                                 JACK 
                        But if we change.

                                 BILLY
                        We don’t.

                                 JACK
                          (beat)
                        You’re very un-American.  

           Billy doesn’t respond.  He just slowly smokes his pipe and 
           looks at the bright stars.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE AND COMMONS - DAY 

           Pissing rain.  Cold and grey.  Jack and Billy are huddled 
           under the gazebo.  Tom and Leo are approaching -- umbrella 
           free and soaked.  

                                 BILLY
                        Say as little as possible.

                                 JACK
                        You must have me confused with a talker.

                                 BILLY
                        I’m serious. 

                                 JACK
                        But I have a few suggestions.

                                 BILLY
                        About what?
                                 JACK
                        The plan.

                                 BILLY
                        If they don’t shoot you in first ten 
                        minutes you can make whatever suggestions 
                        you want.

           Tom and Leo arrive.  They are wet and miserable.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Sam.  Tom, Leo.

                                 JACK
                        Pleasure to meet you, gentlemen  Forgive 
                        my delay.  It was unavoidable.  Pleasant 
                        weather, no?

           Tom gives him a cockeyed look.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah, real nice.  

                                 BILLY
                        Let’s get out of here.

                                 LEO
                        Wait.

                                 TOM
                        What?

                                 LEO
                        Something ain’t right.

                                 BILLY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 LEO
                          (re: Jack)
                        Something’s not right with him.

           Tom looks at Leo, then at Jack.  Tom’s hand casually enters 
           his jacket pocket -- as does Billy’s hand in his jacket.  

           Jack gets right up in Leo’s mug.  Jack has on his best 
           D.F.W.M face.

                                 JACK
                        You got a problem?
           Jack’s expression is about as intimidating as killer 
           butterfly -- but he does look rather insane; and insane 
           people can be unpredictable, even dangerous.

                                 LEO
                        Maybe.

                                 JACK
                        Maybe what?

           Leo wavers.  Maybe he’s got it wrong.

                                 LEO
                        Nothing.  It’s wet.

                                 TOM
                        You think, moron?  Let’s get back to the 
                        fucking car.

           Leo and Tom make a dash through the hard rain back to the 
           sedan park on the street.  

           Still in the gazebo, Billy glances at Jack -- damn if it 
           isn’t Pygmalion made good.  Jack is very, very pleased with 
           himself.  Jack smiles and takes off, jogging to catch up with 
           Tom and Leo -- his new gang. 

           Alone in the gazebo, Billy lights a cigarette.  The park is 
           now empty -- it’s like the white gazebo is the last dry 
           refuge in a drowned world.  Looking out, Billy sees... 

           A RED FOX 

           trotting across an open, swampy commons.  The fox stops and 
           stares at Billy.  

           BILLY 

           stares back at the fox.  He’s not used to wildlife so close 
           or not behind bars.  It amazes him.   

                                 TOM (O.C.)  (CONT’D)
                          (yelling from the car)
                        ARE YOU FUCKING COMING OR WHAT?!

           The fox runs into the bushes.  Billy watches it go.  Then, 
           turning up his collar, he steps out into the rain and begins 
           to walk to the car.  

                                                                 CUT TO:
           INT. TOM’S CAR - DAY 

           Rain, rain, rain.  Leo driving, Tom next to him.  Jack and 
           Billy in the back.

                                 JACK
                        Take a left.  To the end of the block, 
                        take a right...

                                 BILLY
                        Where we going?

                                 JACK
                        You’ll see.  Left.

                                 TOM
                        I’d like to see now.

                                 BILLY
                        What’s the game, Mr. Sam?

                                 JACK
                          (enjoying himself)
                        What a bunch of punks you all are.

           Billy stares hard at Jack.  He’s not happy.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Stop!

           THE DARK SEDAN 

           stops in front of a nondescript suburban house along a 
           nondescript suburban street.  

           BACK IN THE CAR,

           Tom, Leo, and Billy look at the house.

                                 LEO
                        What are we looking at?

                                 JACK
                        Time.  

                                 TOM
                        Time?
                                 JACK
                        In that house lives a man.  Alone since 
                        his divorce.  He has a kid that lives 
                        with the ex.  They both hate him.  Poor 
                        sod is miserable.  All he’s got to stop 
                        him from slitting his throat is his job.  
                        And his routine...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. NATHAN’S HOUSE - SUNNY DAY - 8:25 AM

           Nathan the bank manager comes out of his house and goes to 
           his car...

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Leaves the house everyday at 8:25.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. BANK - SUNNY DAY - 8:40 AM

           Nathan’s car pulls into the empty parking lot behind the bank 
           building...

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Arrives at work at 8:40.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BANK - 8:43 AM

           Nathan opens the door and punches in his code to deactivate 
           the alarm...  

                                 JACK (V.O.)
                        Deactivates the alarm at 8:43.  The time-
                        lock on the vault opens at 8:45...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THE VAULT -- 8:45

           The time-lock reads 8:45, BEEPS three times and the vault 
           CLICKS open... 
                                 JACK
                        Then he has 15 minutes blissfully alone.  
                        15 minutes to cherish and get his head 
                        ready for the day ahead...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Big empty bank.  Nathan is sitting at his desk, crying.  Big 
           manly full-body sobs.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BACK TO THE CAR - RAINY PRESENT

           Jack, Billy, Tom and Leo are still looking at Nathan’s house.

                                 JACK
                        If we pick Mr. Bank Manager up at his 
                        house and help him to get on with his 
                        routine we will have a clean 15 minutes 
                        in the bank -- not two minutes.

                                 LEO
                        Fucking brilliant.

                                 BILLY
                        I don’t like it.

                                 TOM
                        You haven’t liked anything since the 
                        miracle Mets. I love it.

                                 JACK
                        Then it’s a plan?

           Billy looks like he swallowed a lemon but he nods his head in 
           agreement.

                                 BILLY
                        Thursday.

                                 JACK
                        Thursday?  That’s my birthday!

                                 TOM
                        We’ll make sure to bring a fucking cake.
                                 LEO
                        Careful, you can choke on fucking cake.

           Leo and Tom laugh.  Billy doesn’t.  And Jack has no idea why 
           they’re laughing -- which is unnerving. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. JACK’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A chocolate cake.  Susan is writing on the top with white 
           icing, HAPPY BIRTHDAY JACK.  Billy sipping a whiskey, watches 
           her lean over with intense concentration trying to get the 
           lettering right, or at least readable.  A strand of her hair 
           falls down into the frosting.  Billy reaches out and 
           delicately places it back behind her ear.  She glances at him 
           and smiles.  She’s not used to tenderness.

                                 SUSAN
                        Do you know why we’re celebrating his 
                        birthday the night before his birthday?

                                 BILLY 
                        Did you ask him?

                                 SUSAN
                        He said it was traditional in Sweden.

           Frank comes into the room.  He’s already drunk.  But even 
           drunk he can sense something between Billy and his wife.  He 
           reaches past Billy to grab the bottle of whiskey on the 
           counter.  He’s close enough to Billy for the reach to be an 
           aggressive act.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you should slow down, honey.

                                 FRANK
                        Maybe you shouldn’t tell me what to do.  

           Frank generously refills his glass with whiskey.  Turning to 
           Billy, Frank takes a long hard look.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        So tell me, do you bang a lot of coeds 
                        down there, Professor?
                                 BILLY
                          (beat)
                        Do you think your eyebrows will grow 
                        back, Frank?

                                 FRANK
                        Faster than your head if I knock it off.

                                 BILLY
                        Think you could?

                                 FRANK
                          (dismissive snort)
                        This ain’t no fag college, Professor.  No 
                        it ain’t.   

           To Susan’s great relief, Billy shrugs; Giving a little half-
           smile, Billy lets the words pass.  

           The doorbell CHIMES.

                                 JACK (O.C.)
                        I got it!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           AT THE STAIRCASE

           Jack bounds down the stairs toward the door.  He’s in a suit 
           and looking quite debonair.  Reaching the door he opens it to 
           reveal...

           TAMMY, THE WAITRESS

           New hairdo, nicely made up.  A bit shy. 

                                 TAMMY
                        Hi.

                                 JACK 
                        Tammy.  Come in, come in.  I’m so glad 
                        you came.  Let me take your coat.

           He helps her out of her old overcoat.  She’s wearing a sexy 
           black dress.  

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        You are a vision of rare beauty. 
                                 TAMMY
                        Why thank you, Jack.

                                 JACK
                        This way, my dear  The party is about to 
                        begin.  It’s going to be grand!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BIRTHDAY PARTY MONTAGE:

           Jack brings out a cooked turkey.  Drinks are poured, then 
           poured again.  Susan catches Billy looking at her and smiles 
           to herself.  Frank knocks over a bottle of red wine.  Tammy 
           and Jack dance in the dinning room as Susan, Frank and Billy 
           sit uncomfortably at the table.  Susan nervously plays with 
           her lipstick.  Jack whispers a joke into Tammy’s ear.  She 
           laughs like a ringing bell.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A YELLOW TIE

           is pulled out of a pretty box.  We are back in...

           THE DINNING ROOM 

           Dinner has ended.  Dishes are still on the table along with 
           many dead soldiers of wine.  Bolero is still playing on the 
           stereo.  Jack holds up a present. 

                                 JACK
                          (to Susan)
                        Thank you.

                                 SUSAN
                        I hope you like it.

                                 JACK
                        It’s lovely.  It is.  And what’s this?

           He picks up a little brown box and shakes it.  It’s from 
           Billy. 

                                 TAMMY
                        I feel bad not bringing anything.  Why 
                        didn’t you tell me it was your birthday? 

                                 SUSAN
                        He’s shy.
                                 TAMMY
                        Is he?  I was surprised when he asked me 
                        out.  I never thought he noticed me 
                        before.

                                 JACK
                        Oh please, I order 523 tuna sandwiches 
                        from you.   

                                 TAMMY
                        I thought you just liked tuna.

           Jack opens the lid of the small box and finds a stopwatch.  
           It’s set for a 2 minutes.  Jack laughs.  He clicks the big 
           button and starts the countdown.

                                 BILLY
                        Time.

                                 JACK 
                        It’s perfect.  Thank you.  I would like 
                        to propose a toast.   

           Jack stands up and holds up his glass.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        To beautiful women,
                        And a daughter I love.
                        To new friends,
                        And old slippers.
                        To dangerous pursuits,
                        And the road less traveled.

           They all clink their glasses, except for Frank who couldn’t 
           care less and seems to be falling into a drunken stupor.

                                 SUSAN
                        What dangerous pursuits?

                                 JACK
                        Old age.

                                 TAMMY
                        You’re not that old.

                                 FRANK
                          (under his breath)
                        Old enough to smell like piss.
                                 SUSAN
                        Cake!  Who wants cake?
                          (standing)
                        Frank can you help me in the kitchen, 
                        please.

           Susan walks to the kitchen, Frank stumbles behind her.  The 
           buzzer to stopwatch goes off.  BUZZZZ!

                                 JACK
                        Everyone out of the building!

                                 TAMMY
                        What do you mean?

                                 JACK
                        I mean, would you please accompany me to 
                        the terrace for a breath of fresh air?

                                 TAMMY
                        Of course.

           Tammy stands and taking Jack’s arm they disappear into the 
           living room.  We hear Tammy giggle as if pinched.

                                 TAMMY (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Jack!

           Billy is left alone at the table.  Seeing Susan’s Stila
           lipstick on the table, he picks it up and examines it.  He 
           can hear Susan and Jack arguing in the kitchen -- mostly 
           Jack’s part of the conversation as he’s doing most of the 
           yelling.  

                                 FRANK (O.C.)
                        You let the old fart he’ll be in the 
                        house next year.

                                 SUSAN (O.C.)
                        It’s ultimately his choice.

                                 FRANK (O.C.)
                        Like fuck it is.  And if I see you make 
                        eyes at the fag one more time I’m going 
                        to bust you across the face.

                                 SUSAN (O.C.)
                        What are you talking about?
                                 FRANK (O.C.)
                        You know...  Don’t you turn your back on 
                        me!

                                 SUSAN (O.C.)
                        Let go...  

                                 FRANK (O.C.)
                        Come here...

           There’s a scuffle.  Billy stands up.  He’s moving to the 
           kitchen, lipstick still in his hand, when the door swings 
           open and Frank comes out.  Frank gets right into Billy’s 
           face.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Next time I see you, Professor, I’m going 
                        to knock out all your teeth.   

           Frank pushes past Billy and walks and lurches out of the 
           room.  We hear the front door slams behind him.  Billy 
           pockets the lipstick and enters...

           THE KITCHEN

           Susan is by the sink, facing away from the door.  Billy walks 
           up behind her.  She is suddenly backlit by the SUV’s
           headlights from the driveway as Frank starts the car and 
           drives away. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Dangerous pursuits.

                                 BILLY
                        What is?

                                 SUSAN
                          (lightly)
                        My marriage.  

           Susan turns around to face Billy.  Her cheek is red where 
           she’s been hit.  

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Have any dangerous pursuits, Billy?

           Billy looks her directly in the eye then moves forward and 
           kisses her on the mouth.  Susan responds.  They have an 
           appetite for it.  Finally, Susan breaks off the kiss.  
           Without looking back, she walks out of the kitchen.  
           Billy is surprised.  He waits a few moments then follows 
           her...

           AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE,

           Billy hears Tammy and Jack upstairs laughing and giggling 
           like naughty school children.  He moves into...

           THE LIVING ROOM

           It’s empty.  The fire is burning.  Ravel is still playing on 
           the stereo.  He stops in the doorway to...

           THE LIBRARY

           and sees Susan sitting on his bed, feet on the floor.  He 
           goes and sits next to her, side by side.

                                 SUSAN
                          (softly)
                        I won’t pretend to know what’s going on 
                        between you and my father.  But I hope, 
                        if I ask, you will do something for me.  
                        I need you to promise to protect him.  
                          (beat)
                        Sometimes Jack needs somebody to look 
                        after him.

           Billy doesn’t say anything.  But he reaches out and touches 
           her hand.  

           AND THERE THEY SIT, 

           on the bed, holding hands, staring out --looking like the 
           Holvosa tombstone in the middle of Hope Cemetery.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jack slips out of his bedroom in his bathrobe.  Inside we 
           catch a glimpse of Tammy in his bed, under the strewn covers, 
           asleep.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           IN THE KITCHEN 

           Jack fills a glass with water from the tap.  Next to the sink 
           is his birthday cake, untouched; the dozen candles standing 
           like miniature pink sentries.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           AT THE STAIRCASE,

           Jack is about to head upstairs with his water.  When he 
           notices that all six lamps are still on in the living room.  
           Jack enters...

           THE LIVING ROOM 

           and sees Billy sitting in the big leather chair, fully 
           dressed, smoking a cigarette.   

                                 BILLY
                        Nothing wasted?

           Jack grins.

                                 JACK
                        Nothing wasted.  What are you doing up?

                                 BILLY
                        I called Leo and Tom.

                                 JACK 
                        All lock and loaded?

                                 BILLY
                        No.  It’s off.

           Jack is stunned.

                                 JACK
                        What?

                                 BILLY
                        I called it off.  

                                 JACK
                        Why?

                                 BILLY
                        It doesn’t feel right.
                                 JACK
                        What the hell does that mean?  

                                 BILLY
                        Just what I said.

                                 JACK
                        What did Leo and Tom say?

                                 BILLY 
                        They were pissed.

                                 JACK
                        I don’t understand.

                                 BILLY
                        There’s nothing to understand.

                                 JACK
                        That’s bullshit! You can’t do this.

                                 BILLY
                        Of course I can.

                                 JACK
                        You took my money.  We had an agreement. 

                                 BILLY 
                        We agreed that the final decision was 
                        mine.

                                 JACK
                        If I didn’t measure up!

           Billy stands to face Jack.

                                 BILLY
                        You don’t.  You’re a disaster.

                                 JACK
                        No.

                                 BILLY
                        You’ve got one fantasy checked off your 
                        list.  She’s lying in your bed upstairs.  
                        That should be fun enough.  

                                 JACK
                        You think the bank is about fun?
                                 BILLY
                        Fun, pride, fantasy -- who cares.  
                        There’s only one reason to rob a bank.  
                        One.  And that’s money.  It may be the 
                        stupidest way in America to get it -- but 
                        it’s pure.  No glamour, no fun, no high, 
                        just a bunch of dumb bucks for a bunch of 
                        dumb losers who can’t figure out a legit 
                        way to live and survive.  We do it 
                        because we lack the imagination to do 
                        anything else.  Look at yourself...

           Billy pulls Jack over to mirror above the mantel and forces 
           him to looks at his own image.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Look!  You’ve got learning, style, grace.  
                        You’re magnificent.  You have history and 
                        family.  You have a house full of 
                        memories and shelves full of adventures.  
                        You would trade that in for something 
                        which is less than nothing?

                                 JACK
                        Fuck you.

           Jack pulls away from him.  He’s furious.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        You never planned to rob the bank with 
                        me.

           Billy doesn’t respond.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Answer me!

                                 BILLY
                        Why would I?  You’ve given me enough 
                        money that I don’t have to.   

                                 JACK
                        Welcher!

           Something in Jack snaps.  Words have left him.  He rushes 
           toward Billy in a white rage...

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!
           Billy steps back and trips over the damn (bullet ridden) 
           ottoman.  Jack’s momentum carries him into Billy and they 
           fall together onto the wood and carpet floor.  Jack furiously 
           tries to hurt Billy with a mad flurry of blows but he’s too 
           close to be very effective -- it has becomes more of a 
           wrestling match.  Billy, for his part, is mostly just trying 
           to protect himself.  

           Finally, Jack runs out of steam.  He’s huffing and puffing 
           and barely able to catch his breath.  Billy pushes him back, 
           and stands up.  

           Jack is a total mess.  Besides not being able to breathe his 
           right arm is spasming. Standing above, him Billy watches as 
           Jack curls himself into a miserable ball.  

           Billy walks out of the room and into...

           THE KITCHEN

           He opens a cabinet and takes down Jack’s Avonex medication 
           and a syringe.

           THE LIVING ROOM

           From his fetal position on the floor, Jack watches as Billy 
           walks, unhurried, back into the room.  Jack’s right arm is 
           still spasming.  

           Bending down, Billy lifts Jack’s gown to find a spot to give 
           him the shot.  He cleans a patch of Jack’s upper thigh with a 
           swab.   Billy then pushes the needle in.  The whole process 
           is oddly intimate.  Jack cringes in pain and embarrassment.

           Then grabbing Jack beneath his arms, Billy pulls him into the 
           big chair.  Billy sits on the sofa across from him and waits.  
           Soon Jack looks better.  Color is coming back into his face.  
           His arm and hand have stopped their spasms.  

           The men look at each other.  Neither say a word.  What’s left 
           to say?  Jack slowly gets up.  He walks out of the living 
           room to...

           THE STAIRCASE

           Painfully, he climbs back up the stairs to his room.
           IN THE LIVING ROOM,

           Billy listens to Jack ascending the stairs.  Jack’s slippers 
           scraping the wooden steps.  When he can hear him no more, 
           Billy rises and turns out the lamps.  Six lamps, one at a 
           time, the room slowly pooling darker, until only one lamp is 
           lit -- then night. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. JACK’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Clear skies.  The sun is barely up.   

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE, LIBRARY - MORNING

           Billy is waking up.  His eyes barely open, he reaches to the 
           side table to find a cigarette.  Lighting up, he watches the 
           smoke drift past the shelves of books.  Only then does he 
           notices that the dresser drawer is open a touch.  He 
           immediately goes to check his guns.  

           One is missing.  One of the Glocks.

                                 BILLY
                        Jack?  Jack.  Jack!

           The house is quiet as a tomb.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Billy, now dressed, comes in from the library.  The room is 
           empty.  Billy walks quickly up...

           THE STAIRCASE

           And into...

           JACK’S BEDROOM

           It too is empty.

                                 BILLY
                        Shit.

           He hears a car pulling up outside.  Going to the window, he 
           sees...
           THE SUV

           stopping in the driveway.  Frank gets out.  He looks like he 
           been up all night drinking and getting mean.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE, VESTIBULE

           Frank enters.

                                 FRANK
                        Professor!  

           Frank looks into...

           THE LIVING ROOM

           Empty.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        No use hiding like a little girl.  You 
                        make me go and find you it’s gonna be 
                        bad!

           Frank looks into...

           THE LIBRARY

           Empty.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re making me mad, Professor!

           Then he hears footsteps on the stairs.  He turns.  He sees 
           Billy coming from the vestibule into... 

           THE LIVING ROOM

           Frank walks right at Billy.  But rather surprising (at least 
           to Frank) is that Billy is walking right at Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        You are so fucked!

           Frank balls-up his meaty fist to pound Billy -- but Billy, 
           without stopping, steps inside the blow and sharply elbows 
           Frank in the throat.  Then punches him in the gut, knees him 
           in the face and when Frank falls, viciously kicks him a 
           number of times in the ribs and balls.  
           It’s all happened in a violent blink of an eye: drunken bully 
           to whimpering bloody mess.  Frank is making noises like a 
           leaky radiator.   

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Hhhhhhhssssssss.  

           Billy grabs Frank by the hair and jerks up his face so he can 
           look Frank directly in the eyes.  Through the pain, Frank is 
           still trying to figure out what hit him.  Brought low by 
           higher learning.

                                 BILLY
                        Yeah, I know, Frank, how ironic.

           Billy slams Frank’s head against the floor.  Then taking 
           Susan’s lipstick from his pocket, Billy leans over Frank’s 
           face blocking our view of his actions.  

           Standing up, Billy turns and walks out of the living room.  

           Frank is left on the floor, dazed and hurting.  Billy has 
           given him a pair of lipstick eyebrows.  He looks like a 
           demented Kabuki clown. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

           It’s cold.  Turning up the collar of his leather coat, Billy 
           heads into town to try and find Jack before he does something 
           stupid.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. NATHAN’S (BANK MANAGER’S) HOUSE - MORNING

           A dark sedan is parked across the street from the house.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. CAR

           Tom and Leo are in the car watching the house.  They are 
           waiting for Nathan to leave for work at the bank.  They have 
           obviously decided to go ahead with the robbery without Billy 
           or Jack (aka Mr. Sam).

                                 TOM
                        Fuck Bill.
                                 LEO
                        Fuck Mr. Sam.

                                 TOM
                        Spend almost two weeks in this hick state 
                        and he calls it off.  How do you figure?

                                 LEO
                        Pussy.

                                 TOM
                        He used to be good.  Tough.  Smart.  
                        Lucky.

                                 LEO
                        Not now.

                                 TOM
                        What time is it? 

                                 LEO
                        8:10.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. BARRE BAKERY - MORNING

           Commercial bakery.  Brick building.  Jack is waiting outside.  
           He is wearing his new leather jacket and black knit hat.  By 
           his feet is a small brown traveling bag.  Susan goes out the 
           door.  She has flour on her hands and is wearing a long white 
           apron. 

                                 SUSAN
                        What are you doing here?

                                 JACK
                        I’m going on a trip.

                                 SUSAN
                        Why?

                                 JACK
                        I can’t tell you that?

                                 SUSAN
                        Where are you going?

                                 JACK
                        Can’t tell you that either.
                                 SUSAN
                          (frustrated)
                        When?

                                 JACK
                        Soon.

                                 SUSAN
                          (mad)
                        Not much of a talker this morning, are 
                        you?

           Jack smiles.  He likes that, “not much of a talker” -- how 
           cool.  Susan study him.  She let’s her anger go.  There’s an 
           honesty in their eyes. 

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re not coming back.  Are you?

           Jack can only meet her eyes.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                          (beat)
                        You’ll stay in touch?

                                 JACK
                        Always.

                                 SUSAN 
                        I left Frank.

           Jack is not surprised.

                                 JACK
                        He carved his own stone years ago.

           Susan kisses her father on the cheek then buries her head in 
           his shoulder. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Happy Birthday, daddy.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. BANK, NORTH MAIN STREET - MORNING

           Billy walks past the bank.  It’s still closed and quiet.  He 
           looks around trying to figure out where Jack would go with a 
           gun.
                                 BILLY
                          (to himself)
                        Where are you, Jack?

           Checking his watch, he makes a decision and takes off at a 
           fast walk down the street.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. NATHAN’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Dark sedan still parked across the street.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. CAR

           Tom and Leo are getting impatient.  Leo checks his watch.  
           It’s 8:35.

                                 LEO
                        Maybe he overslept.

                                 TOM
                        Let’s go wake him.

           They check their guns and get out of the car.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. NATHAN’S HOUSE, BACKYARD

           Tom and Leo put on the black ski-masks and move to the back 
           door.  They try the knob and happily find it’s unlocked -- 
           small town hospitality.  They enter...  

           INT. NATHAN’S HOUSE, KITCHEN 

           Guns out, Tom and Leo look around the kitchen.  It’s empty.  
           They move into...

           THE LIVING ROOM

           Also empty.  The move into...

           THE HALLWAY

           Checking out bathrooms and bedrooms as they go.  Finally they 
           end at the last room...
           THE MASTER BEDROOM

           It too is empty.

                                 TOM
                        Fuck.

           Tom and Leo pull off their masks.  

                                 LEO
                        What do you want to do?

           Tom sits on the bed.

                                 TOM
                        Let me think.

           Suddenly, they hear an orgasmic GRUNT followed by the sound 
           of a toilet flushing.  

           Tom jumps up and grabs his gun.  The bathroom door knob 
           turns.  There’s no time for the Tom and Leo to put back on 
           their masks.  The door opens...

           IT’S NEVIN 

           holding Ching Pig Mei, the ancient Chinese porn that Billy 
           gave him.  Seeing Tom and Leo, Nevin stops cold in his 
           tracks.  What are these strange men doing in his father’s 
           bedroom?

           TOM AND LEO

           also stand frozen for a moment, staring at this gangly 
           adolescent.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Don’t just stand there -- grab him.

           Leo steps forward and roughly grabs Nevin by his upper arm 
           and pushes him onto the bed.  Tom aims the gun at Nevin’s 
           face.  Nevin is terrified.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Where’s your father?

                                 NEVIN
                        He left.
                                 TOM
                        What are you doing here?

                                 NEVIN
                        Staff day.

                                 TOM
                        What the fuck is “staff day”.

                                 NEVIN
                        I don’t know, but there’s no school.

                                 LEO
                        What do we do with him?

           Tom has not moved his gun away from Nevin’s head.  He’s 
           considering the situation.  The fact that Nevin is looking at 
           them without their masks and can identify them later is 
           definitely not good.  There seems a real possibility that Tom 
           might just shoot the boy.

           AT THE END OF HALL,

           Billy suddenly appears.  He can see straight down the hall 
           into the bedroom.  Leo turns and sees him.

                                 LEO
                        Hey, looks who’s here.

                                 BILLY
                        What’s going on?

                                 TOM
                        We have a situation.

                                 BILLY
                        Where’s Jack?

                                 TOM
                        Who?

                                 BILLY
                        Mr. Sam.

                                 TOM
                        Don’t know, don’t care.  You change your 
                        mind?

           Billy has been moving forward down the hall until he can see 
           Nevin on the bed.  Nevin sees Billy.
                                 BILLY 
                        It’s time to go, Tom.

                                 TOM
                        Go where?

                                 BILLY
                        Out of this town.   

                                 LEO
                        Don’t tell him what to do.

           As Billy steps into the room, he pulls out his two guns, 
           pointing one at Leo and one at Tom.  Tom turns his gun away 
           from Nevin to point it at Billy.

                                 TOM
                        What the fuck is this?

                                 BILLY
                        Nevin, get out of here.

                                 TOM
                        You know this kid?

           Billy doesn’t answer.  Not taking his gun off Billy, Tom 
           grabs Nevin by the ear and twists it.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        You know this man, kid?

                                 NEVIN
                        Och! He’s my tutor.

                                 LEO
                        Your what?

                                 NEVIN

                                 TOM
                        Tutor of what?

           Tom twists Nevin’s ear again.

                                 NEVIN

                        What kind of poetry?

                        What the fuck does it matter what kind of 
                        poetry?

                                 LEO
                        You got, you know, distinctions.  There’s 
                        your sonnets, your epics, your haiku...

                                 TOM 
                        What’s the game, Billy?

                                 BILLY
                        No game.   

                                 TOM
                        What’s the boy to you?

                                 BILLY
                        Nothing.

           But then there Billy is: a gun in both hands, two men against 
           him, sticking his neck out for... nothing. 

           Nobody wants to get shot.  Leo is looking particularly sweaty 
           and nervous.  But it’s Tom that is looking right into Billy’s 
           eyes.  And what Tom sees is cold -- a D.F.W.M glare that 
           could make ice-cubes.  And Tom was right, Billy doesn’t 
           blink...

                                 LEO
                          (muttering)
                        Fucking Iguana.

           Finally, it’s Tom that does the blinking (literally and 
           figuratively) and lowers his gun.

                                 TOM
                        I’m not getting shot for nothing.
                          (to Leo)
                        Let’s go.

           Leo still has his gun raised.  He seems too scared to put it 
           down.
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Leo!

           Leo hears him and lowers his piece.  Together, Leo and Tom 
           walk out of the room and down the hall, disappearing into the 
           living room.

           Billy is left looking at Nevin sitting stiffly on the bed, 
           not moving.  Billy waits until he hears the front door close, 
           then turns and exits into... 

           THE HALLWAY

           He walks slowly down the hall with his guns still out.  He 
           enters into the...

           LIVING ROOM

           It’s empty.  Going to a front window, he looks out and 
           sees...

           OUTSIDE, TOM AND LEO

           driving away in their car.  

           BILLY

           puts his guns away and slumps into a chair.  He takes a deep, 
           deep breath and a long, long exhale.  He sits there wondering 
           what he just did and why.  

           Suddenly the front door swings back open --

           Billy starts up, going for his guns.  But it’s not Tom and 
           Leo -- it’s Nathan, carrying two grocery bags.  He’s taken-
           back to see Billy in his living room.  Billy is at a loss to 
           help him with an explanation.

                                 NATHAN
                        Hello?

           Fortunately, Nevin has come into the room from the hall.  
           He’s still holding the book, Ching Pig Mei.

                                 NEVIN
                        Here’s that book you wanted back.  
                        Thanks.

           Billy takes the book.
                                 BILLY
                        Did you like it?

                                 NEVIN
                          (truth)
                        Best book ever.

           Nathan is surprised and pleased.

                                 NATHAN
                        You read a book?  
                          (to Billy)
                        Took a sick day.  Hanging with Nevin.  
                        Want some coffee?

           Billy stands.

                                 BILLY
                        I have to go.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. BARRE, NORTH MAIN STREET - MORNING 

           Jack is walking down the street holding his traveling bag.  
           He’s walking toward the Merchant Bank.  He’s walking calmly 
           but with a steady purpose.  People and cars move past him.  
           Including one dark sedan...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DARK SEDAN - MORNING

           Leo is driving.  Tom sits next to him.  Tom is in an angry 
           sulk.  They’re heading out of town toward the interstate.  
           They hadn’t noticed that they just passed Jack on the 
           sidewalk.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. MERCHANT BANK - MORNING

           Just opened.  Jack stops by the front doors.  He opens his 
           jacket.  The gun (Billy’s missing Glock) is tucked into his 
           belt.  He pulls his black ski-hat down to cover his face.  
           Thus prepared, he pushes the doors open and enters.

           There’s no way not to expect disaster.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. INTERSTATE 89 - SAME TIME

           The dark sedan is moving down the highway.

           INSIDE THE CAR,

           Tom is still in a state.

                                 TOM
                        Turn the car around.

                                 LEO
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        Fuck him. 

           Leo is not happy but he takes an exit off the interstate to 
           head back to Barre.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. ELM STREET 

           Billy is walking down a street lined with bare trees.  He’s 
           heading back to the bank, still looking for Jack.   

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BANK

           Sleepy morning.  THREE TELLERS behind the counter.  Only TWO 
           CUSTOMERS.  

           Jack is standing just inside the door.  Masked.  Gun in his 
           right hand.  Stopwatch in his left hand.

           Surreally, nobody has noticed him, yet.  

                                 JACK
                        THIS IS A ROBBERY!

           The three tellers and two customers’ heads finally turn and 
           look at him.

           Jack clicks down on the stopwatch, starting a two minute 
           countdown.  As he does so, the SOUNDS OF THE BANK AND THE 
           WORLD mute.  What we hear is the TICK, TICK, TICK of the 
           stopwatch.
           THE EVENTS PRECEDE LIKE A PERFECT DREAM.  SLOW, PRECISE, LIKE 
           A WELL REHEARSED DANCE:

           Jack orders the two customers to sit on the floor.  They 
           obediently listen. 

           TICK, TICK, TICK.

           Jack orders two of the tellers to put all the large bills 
           from their cash drawers onto the counter.  They instantly 
           obey. 

           TICK, TICK, TICK.

           Jack hands the third bank worker his suitcase and orders him 
           into the vault.  The worker opens a metal latticed door with 
           his key.  

           TICK, TICK, TICK.

           Standing between the vault and counter, Jack  can see 
           everyone -- controlling the action like a puppet master. 

           TICK, TICK, TICK.

           In the vault, the bank worker diligently fills Jack’s 
           suitcase with large bills.  

           TICK, TICK, TICK.

           The tellers having finished putting all the 100 and 50 dollar 
           bills on the counter sits down with the customers.  

           TICK, TICK, TICK.

           The bank worker comes out of the vault with the suitcase.  
           Hands the suitcase to Jack and goes and sits with the rest of 
           them.  

           TICK, TICK, TICK.

           Jack takes the suitcase and slides the money off the counter 
           into the suitcase.

           BUZZZZZZZZ!

           The two minute alarm on the stopwatch has gone off.  All the 
           sounds in the bank return in loud RUSH.
           Like a true professional, Jack leaves the last of money on 
           the counter.  Taking his suitcase, he walks to the exit.  He 
           stops at the door. 

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Thank you all for such a pleasant 
                        experience. 

           Turning away from tellers and customers, he puts his gun away 
           and pulls off his mask.  

           Then Jack Jones, criminal and desperado, calmly walks out of 
           the bank.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           OUTSIDE THE BANK 

           Jack stands for a moment, holding his suitcase of loot.  The 
           world looks brighter to him.  He has no getaway car.  Or for 
           that matter a getaway plan.  He really didn’t expect to get 
           this far.  Well, nothing for it, he begins to walk down North 
           Main street toward the train station.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. NORTH MAIN STREET

           Further down and on the opposite side of the street, Billy is 
           walking back toward Jack’s house.  The dark sedan passes him 
           from behind.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. DARK SEDAN

           Leo is driving to the bank.  Tom is checking his gun, getting 
           ready.  They don’t notice that they just passed Billy.  
           Neither do they notice as they pass Jack on the other side of 
           the street.  The stop in front of the bank.

                                 TOM
                        Ready?

           Leo nods.

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. BANK 

           Leo and Tom get out of the sedan.  They rush toward the 
           bank’s doors as they put on their masks and pull out their 
           guns.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BANK  

           The bank employees and customers are milling together waiting 
           for the authorities to show up.  Instead they turn and see 
           two masked men with guns.

                                 TOM
                        Everyone on the floor!

           No one moves.

                                 CUSTOMER 1
                        Is this a joke?

                        It’s a robbery!

                                 TELLER 2
                        Fuck you.

           Leo and Tom exchange glances -- what the hell is going on 
           here?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. NORTH MAIN STREET

           From east and west three police cars come racing toward the 
           bank.  Their siren are off but their lights are flashing.  
           They squeal to stop...

           IN FRONT OF BANK

           The COPS pour out of the cars and take up defensive 
           positions.  As far as they’re concerned they’ve caught the 
           robbers in the act. 

                                                                 CUT TO:
           FURTHER DOWN NORTH MAIN STREET 

           This, of course, leaves Jack clean and clear to amble away.  
           Untouched and unsuspected.  Jack can see the flashing lights 
           of the police cars at the bank behind him...

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET,

           Billy can see the flashing lights of the police cars at the 
           bank in front of him...  

           JACK AND BILLY

           pass each other -- without ever knowing that they were on the 
           same street, at the same time, moving in opposite directions.

           JACK

           takes a right on Depot Road which leads into the train 
           station.

           BILLY 

           stops at the intersection of North Main and Washington.  
           Ahead, he sees the dark sedan, the police, the rifles -- and 
           then Tom and Leo appearing in the bank’s doors, their hands 
           on top of their heads.  Jack is clearly not there.  

           Behind Billy, in the distance, an Amtrak WHISTLE sounds.  
           Billy partially turns his head toward the whistle.  He 
           hesitates for a long moment -- then turns left on Washington 
           Street, walking away from the bank, away from the train 
           station.  Back toward Jack’s house.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. BARRE TRAIN STATION - MORNING

           Jack is standing on the “south” platform.  He can see an 
           Amtrak train in the distance heading for the station.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. JACK’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Billy enters through the metal gate and walks up the path to 
           the ramshackle mansion.  
           At the end of the drive, Susan is just getting out of her 
           car.  She’s holding three loaves of bread.  Together, without 
           a word, they walk to door. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. BARRE TRAIN STATION - MORNING

           The train has pulled into the station.  Jack waits for the 
           train to make a complete stop. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. JACK’S HOUSE, KITCHEN 

           Billy watches as Susan makes french toast -- slicing one of 
           the loaves, cracking the eggs, mixing in milk and vanilla, 
           soaking the bread in the batter.  It all looks so damn normal 
           and domestic.  Billy slips out of the room.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. TRAIN 

           Jack walks down the aisle.  He puts his bag in the overhead 
           compartment and takes a seat...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - SAME MOMENT

           Billy sits into the big chair by the fireplace.  His slippers 
           are on the floor.  There’s a book on the side-table.  Susan 
           is humming a song in kitchen as she cooks.  It feels right.  
           It feels like he’s been here forever.

                                                                CUT TO: 

           INT. TRAIN

           Jack looks out the window, watching the barren Vermont 
           landscape flash by as the train picks up speed.  Heading 
           south.  He smiles.

           Heading somewhere new.

                                 THE END
