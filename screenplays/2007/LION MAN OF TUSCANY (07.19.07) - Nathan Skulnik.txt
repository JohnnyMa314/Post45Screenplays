                                             DRAFT 7/19/07 
                                                  FADE IN:

           Superhuman legs pump in poetic SLOW-MOTION...

           Spinning the cranks of a racing bicycle which might as well 
           be carved out of stone; three gears pushing forty-five pounds 
           of steel and rubber.     

           GINO BARTALI (26) cranks down a country road in Northern 
           Italy.  The only sound, the ROLL OF HIS TIRES. 

           His Michelangeloesque profile is reflected in shadow on the 
           passing cobble stone wall.  His boxer’s nose, broken more 
           than a few times, lends character to his matinée-idol looks.  

           Slowly, the CHEERING OF THOUSANDS fills his ears.  Then as if 
           fired out of a shotgun--

           The film blasts to normal speed--Bartali streaks past like a 
           bullet--The CHEERING becomes a deafening BOOM--

           EXT. THE VILLAGE OF TURIN

           Thousands of ITALIAN FANS part like the sea as Bartali races 
           through them, towards the fast-approaching FINISH LINE-- 

           AN ITALIAN SPORTS REPORTER screams into his RADIO MICROPHONE 
           as Bartali passes.

                                 SPORTS REPORTER
                        ...With the next rider three k 
                        back, it looks like the great 
                        Campanissimo has done it again... 
                        The captain of the Legano cycling 
                        team...Winner of the Tour de France 
                        last year...Italy’s own champion of 
                        champions has just added another 
                        victory to his legendary career...

           Bartali powers across the finish line unchallenged.

                                 SPORTS REPORTER
                        Gino Bartali has just won the Giro 
                        de Piedmont!

           An OFFICIAL leads Bartali through a SCREAMING MASS OF FANS, 
           onto the WINNER’S PODIUM.  A LONG-LEGGED TROPHY GIRL hands 
           him a three-tier TROPHY...

           Bartali hoists the trophy overhead.  And up on the podium, 
           the winner’s sash around his chest, Bartali looks everybit 
           Italy’s champion of champions.

           INT. HOTEL AMBASCIATORI--TURIN, ITALY--NIGHT

           A lavish ballroom.  Bartali makes his way through a packed 
           victory party.  Hands from everywhere congratulate the 
           Campanissimo.
                                 VOICES
                        Campanissimo...I don’t even think I 
                        saw you break a sweat...My money’s 
                        on you at the Giro d’Italia...

           He finally steps out onto...

           THE FRONT PATIO

           A winding country road curves just beyond the property. 
           Bartali lights a cigarette, stares at the canopy of stars 
           above--

           Then--WHOOSH!--A RIDER speeds past, down the road just beyond 
           and into the night...Bartali arches his eyebrow, watches him 
           ride off...

           ALFREDO BINDA meets him on the stoop.  Just past forty with 
           salt and pepper hair, Alfredo was the greatest cyclist of his 
           day, but that day has long passed.    

                                 ALFREDO 
                        Finally, a moment of peace for the 
                        Campanissimo.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Which was nice while it lasted.

           Bartali offers him a cigarette.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Sofia said if she catches me 
                        smoking once more she’s going to 
                        make me sleep with the cat.

           Alfredo looks over his shoulder, then reaches for the 
           cigarette.  Lights up. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        So keep watch, would you? 

           Alfredo inhales.  Savors.  Bartali motions to the Rider now  
           climbing a sharp hill like it’s flat.

                                 BARTALI
                        Volpi looks fast.  He could give me 
                        trouble in San Remo.

                                 ALFREDO
                        That’s not Volpi.  
                           (points to a MAN inside)
                        Volpi’s there.    

                                 BARTALI
                        Then who is it? 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Must be some blacksock...Gino, 
                        we’ve got a problem.  Garzelli tore 
                        his hamstring.  We’re a rider short 
                        going into the Giro.
           Bartali isn’t listening.  He’s too focused on the Rider 
           disappearing into the night.  Amateurs don’t ride like that.

           INT. CYCLIST’S LOCKER ROOM. NIGHT

           Dim and quiet.  FAUSTO COPPI, twenty and rail-thin with dark 
           Sicilian features, sits on a chair, unlacing his cycling 
           shoes.  We recognize him as the Rider from the last scene.  

           Bartali walks in, sits on the bench across and stares dead in 
           his eyes for a moment.  Saying nothing. 

                                 BARTALI
                        I don’t know you.  What’s your 
                        name?

           Coppi swallows.  Star-struck. 

                                 COPPI
                        Fausto...Coppi.  

                                 BARTALI
                        What team do you ride for?    

                                 COPPI
                        I don’t have a sponsor.  I’m riding 
                        C-Division in Piedmont tomorrow.    

           Bartali looks down at Coppi’s filthy black socks.  

                                 BARTALI
                        So you’re an amateur.  Tell me, do 
                        you ride like that all the time?  
                        Do you always push that hard?  

                                 COPPI
                           (confused)
                        Hard?  I have a race tomorrow.  I’m 
                        saving my legs. 

           Bartali smiles like he’s just discovered gold...  

           EXT. VILLA IN LECCE. NIGHT

           TWO LEGANO CYCLING TEAM TRUCKS are parked in the driveway of 
           the simple villa.  In the front yard, BIKE MECHANICS fine-
           tune the brakes of the Legano team bicycles.

           INT. VILLA. KITCHEN

           Two bottles of red wine already finished on the table, 
           Bartali opens a third.  The table is set for dinner.  

           Alfredo stands before the eight RIDERS of Bartali’s LEGANO 
           CYCLING TEAM.     

                                 ALFREDO
                        Servadi, you take care of the 
                        sprinters.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALFREDO (cont'd)
                        If Tassin takes off, chase him 
                        down, tire him out...
                           (points to another Rider)
                        Storme, you be there for Gino to 
                        draft off when he needs to catch 
                        his wind--

           STORME, a bulky rider, sits up.

                                 STORME
                        Who do I draft from when I’m tired?  

                                 ALFREDO
                        You don’t.

                                 STORME
                        What kind of strategy is that?  If 
                        I don’t have anybody to cut the 
                        wind I’ll be lucky to take a stage.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You’re not here to do anything, but 
                        help Bartali win.  If you have an 
                        issue with that speak up now and 
                        we’ll ride with seven.  

           Storme shrinks in his chair.     

                                 ALFREDO
                        And finally, our rookie, our 
                        gregario...

           Alfredo turns to Coppi who fidgets nervously at the end of 
           the table.  His face is almost as pale as his brand new 
           Legano cycling team jersey.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Just try to make it to the finish 
                        line without breaking your neck.  

                                 ITALIAN RIDER
                        Watch out for altitude sickness in 
                        the Alps.  You black out and you’re 
                        done for.

                                 ANOTHER RIDER
                        Fall off those cliffs and it’s a 
                        thousand meters straight down...
                           (SLAPS THE TABLE)
                        BOOM!

                                 ITALIAN RIDER
                        He looks sick...Here, have a glass 
                        of wine, it’ll calm your nerves.

           The Rider slides Coppi a glass full of a nauseating 
           concoction of wine and cigarette butts...

           INT. HALLWAY--HOURS LATER
           Everyone is asleep.  Bartali walks down the dark hall, a 
           light peeks from behind a cracked door at the end...

           RESTROOM

           He pushes the door open.  Coppi sits on the tile floor, head 
           hung in the toilet.

                                 COPPI
                        I’ve dreamt of riding in the Giro 
                        since I was a boy delivering 
                        flowers on my bicycle.  I knew I’d 
                        be nervous, but not like this.

                                 BARTALI
                        The night before my first Giro, I 
                        was so worried about getting 
                        dehydrated on the first stage that 
                        I drank water all night long.  Must 
                        have been few buckets worth.  And 
                        not two minutes after I fell 
                        asleep, I wet my bunk.  Alfredo was 
                        sleeping below me and do you know 
                        to this day he hasn’t forgiven me?

           A smile breaks over Coppi’s face.  Bartali reaches down.  
           Coppi takes his hand, helps himself up. 

                                 BARTALI
                        This year you carry my water, give 
                        it to me when I’m dry and you’ll 
                        have done your job.  Do it well and 
                        someday I’ll ride to help you over 
                        that line first.

                                 COPPI
                        I won’t let you down, Campanissimo.

           EXT. ITALIAN ALPS. DAY--1940

           The Alps roll endlessly through the horizon like a massive 
           wave.  The landscape is bucolic.  Wildflowers sway in a 
           gentle breeze.  Sheep graze on untamed fields.

           THEN, AROUND A DISTANT BEND-two specks climb the road...Two 
           CYCLISTS.  Heads lowered, racing.  They charge past and--

           Dozens of the world’s TOP CYCLISTS thunder by.

                        After twenty-one days in the 
                        saddle, this year's Giro has turned 
                        out to be the closest in the race's 
                        storied history.  Mere seconds 
                        separate the leaders from the 
                        peleton...

           Finally, bringing up the rear, an army of PRESS CARS.

                        kilometers and now...

           JAMES LIGGET, a British sports reporter, stands out the open

                        belongs to one of the riders who

                        ...or the great Bartali!  

           Bartali pulls ahead, when suddenly from THE MOUNTAINSIDE...

           A FRENCH FAN throws a glass bottle in Bartali path...Bartali 
           swerves, but not fast enough--

           HIS TIRE runs over the shattered glass.  Begins HISSING.  He 
           spits in frustration, pulls to...

           THE ROADSIDE

           Coppi veers out of the peleton to help. 

                                 COPPI
                        Campanissimo, let me.

           Coppi hands Bartali his waterbottle, slides out of the spare 
           tire slung over his shoulder.  Fixes it onto Bartali’s rim in 
           one motion...

           The peleton whips past.
                                 BARTALI
                        Faster Coppi!

           Coppi works double-time.  He inflates the tire.

                                 COPPI
                        Finished.

           The riders vault onto their bikes.  Chase.  

           EXT. STEEP GRADE/MOUNTAIN ROAD--MINUTES LATER

           Bartali tackles the climb.  Exhaustion plagues Coppi's face 
           as he struggles to keep up.

                                 BARTALI
                        How are your legs?  

                                 COPPI
                        Don’t wait for me.

           Bartali eyes Maes, a speck cresting the mountain ahead.

                                 BARTALI
                        Draft me.  When we crest, I'll 
                        draft you and get my legs back.  
                        I’ll take him along Porta Venezia.

                                 COPPI
                        Yes, Campanissimo.

           He swerves behind Bartali.  Bartali’s wake creates a vacuum, 
           helps drag Coppi through the peleton.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Faster.

           They pass through the peleton, close the gap.  As the 
           mountain crests, they overtake Maes.

                                 BARTALI
                        Switch!

           Bartali drafts behind Coppi.  MAES again cuts ahead, sprints 
           away.  Coppi stands over his saddle, begins to chase.

                                 BARTALI
                        My legs aren't back.  Keep my pace.  

           Maes rips around a downhill ridge.  Coppi and Bartali streak 
           after him into...

           THE CITY OF MILAN

           The final stage of the Giro is awe inspiring.  Thousands of 
           fans line both sides of the cobblestone Porta Vittoria...

           ...Spilling onto the tops of parked busses and cars...Waving 
           flags from open windows...
           But at once shock fills their faces.  Their Campanissimo 
           trails the rookie... 

           They explode in rapture!  Beating their fists, cheering on 
           the underdog.  Shouts of "Coppi" fill the air...

           Coppi's heart pumps adrenaline.  It’s the moment every rider 
           dreams of.  He stands out of his saddle and takes off.  
           Leaves Bartali in his wake...

                                 BARTALI
                        Coppi!   

           Bartali chases.  The road turns sharply into a dark tunnel 
           which empties out into...

           LE VELODROME

           A massive stadium built around the Corso Venezia.  THOUSANDS 
           OF FANS jump to their feet.  Coppi blows past Maes.  The 
           finish line five hundred meters ahead--

           Bartali passes Maes.  Zeroes on Coppi...

           But Coppi’s flying now.  Legs spinning in a blur.  Gaining 
           road.  He won’t be caught...  

           He shoots over the finish line--

           THE YELLOW RIBBON TEARS OVER HIS CHEST!  The city ignites.  
           The clamor is deafening. 

           BARTALI rolls in seconds later.  Collapses from exhaustion. 

           HEADS turn breathlessly to the great chalk leader board 
           hanging over the JUDGE'S STAGE...

           The TIME JUDGE confers with other JUDGES.  They slide COPPI'S 
           NAME PLATE into the winner's slot.  

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        ...With the twenty-second stage win 
                        bonus Fausto Coppi wins the Giro 
                        d'Italia!

           COPPI is hoisted on the shoulders of his countrymen.  We pull 
           past them, sitting alone on the curb...Bartali.

           We float towards his face as he watches Coppi being carried 
           by shoulders on which he should be sitting, basking in his 
           stolen glory...

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. TRAIN. NIGHT--MOVING

           A train streaks through the pitch-black Lombardy countryside.

           INSIDE TRAIN
           Bottles of Dom Perrignon POP!  Coppi’s celebration party 
           rages in the oak paneled dining car.  A table-full of Doll-
           faced SHOWGIRLS swoon, batting their eyelashes at...

           COPPI.  Singing “Soldato Enamorato” along with a drunken 
           quartet of CYCLISTS.  

           They finish to thunderous cheers and another shower of 
           champagne spray.  The Showgirls smother Coppi with kisses.  

           An ITALIAN CYCLIST raises his glass in toast.

                                 CYCLIST
                        To Coppi...Our new Campanissimo.

           Off the CLINKING of a hundred glasses--

           INT.  THE CABOOSE.  HOURS LATER

           Quiet.  Slapped with a champagne smile, Coppi staggers 
           towards the rear of the train.

           EXT. TRAIN. NIGHT

           He steps out onto the caboose platform, moves to the railing.

           Closing his eyes, he inhales the cool night air.  Feels as 
           close to being a God as any man ever has.

                                 COPPI
                           (disbelief)
                        La Magila Rosa...

           In the shadows behind him, Bartali's cigarette casts amber 
           light on his face.

                                 BARTALI
                        You were my gregario.

           Coppi doesn’t turn.  

                                 COPPI
                        If you were me, what would you have 
                        done?  

           Bartali spins him.  Face to face.  

                                 BARTALI
                        I should have left you riding the 
                        dirt tracks for spare change.  I 
                        stuck my neck out to get you on 
                        Legano and you cut my head off.  

                                 COPPI
                        So you say.  They say I’m the new 
                        Campanissimo. 

           Bartali swallows his fury.  Holds up a bottle of champagne--
                                 BARTALI
                        Then, a toast.
                           (Fills Coppi’s glass)
                        To the new Campanissimo...

           Coppi begrudgingly raises his glass in toast.

                                 BARTALI
                        ...And his stolen victory.

           Coppi's face sours.  He pours his glass on Bartali’s shoe.  
           Bartali wants to throttle him, his voice shaking...         

                                 BARTALI
                        Legano has no room for thieves. 

                                 COPPI
                        Another team will pick me up. 

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m sure they will, but in six 
                        weeks, I’ll be the one they carry 
                        out of Paris.  

                                 COPPI
                        Until then, I'm Campanissimo.  You 
                        carry my water.

           Coppi pushes Bartali off.  Steps inside...

           INT. FLORENCE TRAIN STATION. LATER

           Flashbulbs POP!  REPORTERS shout questions as Bartali steps 
           off the train.  Shining in a silk suit and tie, he's every 
           bit the superstar his public expects.

                                 REPORTER
                        Gino, will you begin training for 
                        Tour de France right away?

                                 BARTALI
                        Well, I heard Stagecoach is playing 
                        at the cinema, so the training will 
                        have to wait until after I see John 
                        Wayne fight off some Indians. 

           The Reporters laugh.  Bartali revels in the spotlight. 

                                 REPORTER TWO
                        Belgium has just surrendered to the 
                        Nazi’s.  Do you still support 
                        Mussolini’s allegiance to Hitler?     

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m a cyclist, I leave politics to 
                        men better informed than myself.  

                                 REPORTER THREE
                        How did Coppi get away from you in 
                        Milan?
           Flustered by the question, he considers outing Coppi as a 
           thief, but then focuses on all those microphones--

                                 BARTALI
                        He rode like he had wings.

                        By growing wings myself.

           INT. TRAIN STATION. CORRIDOR--MINUTES LATER

           Alfredo argues with a FEMALE OVRA OFFICER--a Fascist police 
           officer--outside the LADIES ROOM DOOR.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Is this one out of order?

           Two WOMEN brush past them and into the LADIES ROOM.

                                 SOFIA
                        Alfredo, it's fine really.  I can 
                        find another restroom.

           Alfredo’s wife, SOFIA (30’s) huddles close to her husband.  
           Stonefaced with embarrassment, her cheeks are almost as red 
           as her hair.  

                                 OVRA OFFICER
                        Sir, the lady has to use the 
                        restroom designated for Jews.

           Bartali glides towards them.  The OVRA Officer’s heart 
           flutters.   

                                 BARTALI
                        Where have you been? 

                                 ALFREDO
                        This woman says Sofia has to use 
                        some Jewish restroom down the hall.

                                 BARTALI
                           (to the Officer)
                        May I have a word with you?

           Bartali places his hand on her waist and leads her away.   

                                 BARTALI
                        Do you know who that man is?
                           (she shakes her head)
                        That's Alfredo Binda.  He was 
                        Italy's first great cyclist and now 
                        he's my friend and coach.     

                                 OVRA OFFICER
                        Well he’s been very rude.  I’m just 
                        following my orders.
                                 BARTALI
                        Please accept my apologies on his 
                        behalf, he’s a very proud man.  But 
                        perhaps you could overlook the fact 
                        you checked his wife’s papers and 
                        let her use this restroom? 

           She looks down, suddenly notices her hand in his...

                                 BARTALI
                        I’d consider it a personal favor. 

           INT. TRAIN STATION. CORRIDOR--MINUTES LATER

           Sofia exits the ladies room.  Alfredo takes her hand.  They 
           continue through the station.  

           Bartali nods his hat at the Officer as they pass.  She 
           blushes.

                                 ALFREDO
                        These racial laws are going to ruin 
                        this country.

                                 BARTALI
                        So what do we do?  Hang everyone 
                        who enforces them from gates of the 
                        Coliseum?  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Soon there won't be enough rope in 
                        the entire country for that.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION. CURB. DAY

           A CHAUFFEUR opens the door of a waiting car.  Bartali takes 
           Sofia’s hand.

                                 BARTALI
                        This isn’t Poland, Sofia.  It’s 
                        Italy and you’re safe here.

                                 SOFIA
                        Then why am I so afraid?  

           Sofia kisses his cheek and slips into the backseat.

                                 ALFREDO
                        My wife's becoming a pariah.

                                 BARTALI
                        Just because she was asked to use a 
                        special restroom doesn’t mean she’s 
                        going to be sent to a work camp.    

                                 ALFREDO
                        No, not today.  But tomorrow?
                                 BARTALI
                        But tomorrow nothing.  Even if 
                        anything were to happen, you’re not 
                        a Jew, your name will protect her.         

                                 ALFREDO
                        If finish lines are all you ever 
                        think about, you’ll never see 
                        what’s happening beyond them.  

           Alfredo moves to get into the car--

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m as sick as you are with what’s 
                        happening, but we have less than 
                        three weeks until the Tour de 
                        France.  I need you to promise me 
                        this war won’t interfere with our 
                        training.

           Alfredo meets Bartali's eyes.  Insulted his dedication should 
           ever be questioned.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Sunrise at the Ponte Ema bridge.  
                        If you’re a minute late, you’ve got 
                        ten-k of sprints. 

           Alfredo gets in the limo, swings the door closed.  Bartali 
           stares at himself in the reflection of the dark window until 
           the car drives off...

           EXT. BARTALI’S VILLA. FLORENCE COUNTRYSIDE. DAY

           Bartali's centuries old villa is perched atop a hill 
           overlooking Florence...

           INT. BARTALI'S BEDROOM. DAY

           A huge trunk is opened on Bartali’s wood floor.  He digs 
           inside...Unearths a long cardboard box.

           INT. BARTALI'S GARAGE. NIGHT

           Bartali flicks a light switch, illuminating an old garage 
           which is now the greatest trophy room ever.  Packed shelves 
           display hundreds of trophies from a storied career.  

           He opens the cardboard box.  A small, engraved GIRO D'ITALIA 
           trophy sits inside--

           1940 GIRO D'ITALIA.                                                                               
           SECOND PLACE--GINO BARTALI

           He crams it on a shelf crowded with countless other runner-up 
           trophies.  All of them covered in a fine layer of dust.

           Then, he turns to his wall of WINNER’S TROPHIES...

           Towering above him.  Goliaths carved of shimmering gold and 
           marble.  One from each of the greatest races.
           Tour de Suisse.  Tour of Lombardy.  Giro D’Italia...  

           Bartali polishes away a smudge from one, steps towards the 
           greatest prize of all...

           Framed next to the door.  Le Maillot Jeune (The Yellow 
           Jersey).  Awarded to the champion of the Tour de France.                                                  

           He runs his fingertips over the glass.  As if somehow trying 
           to summon the magic in his legs when he won it in ‘38...

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. TUSCAN COUNTRYSIDE. DAWN

           Bartali streaks down a road cut through cypresses and olive 
           trees.  Alfredo paces him on a Vespa.

                                 ALFREDO
                           (shouting)
                        Harder, Gino.  We have to put wings 
                        on your feet, remember?

           We fly into Bartali's face...Rock solid concentration.  The 
           only sound...The ROLL of his tires on the road--

           EXT. FLORENCE. DAY

           After a long day of training, Bartali and Alfredo coast over 
           the Ponte Vecchio bridge.  Three other bridges span the Arno 
           River behind them.

           EXT. GALLERIA DEGLI UFFIZI. DAY

           Flower vendors line the streets outside the medieval museum.   
           Bartali and Alfredo cycle past the palace, Palazzo Strozzi...

           Lines of faceless JEWS and GYPSIES wait just beyond.  Radios 
           of all shapes and sizes in their hands.  They relinquish 
           their radios to waiting BLACKSHIRT SOLDIERS...

                                 ALFREDO
                        It's the latest decree.  Jews can 
                        no longer own radios.

                                 BARTALI
                        Listening to the BBC will just 
                        cause them to worry unnecessarily.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Unnecessarily?

                                 BARTALI
                        I’ve told you already, Italy won’t 
                        become Poland.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Do you know the Blackshirts killed 
                        another band of Partisans today in 
                        Lecce?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALFREDO (cont'd)
                        At first, it was only Jews who had 
                        reason to worry, now it's the 
                        Catholics who are helping Jews.   

                                 BARTALI
                        The laws are meant for all of us to 
                        obey.  Even if doing so may 
                        sometimes seem like the crime.   

           SOUND UPCUT--The BOOM of a magnesium flash bulb--

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)
                        Just one more...Big smile!

           EXT. PIAZZA DANTE. DUSK

           A towering statue of Dante overlooks the bustling public 
           square.  Near the gates of the Church of St. Lorenzo, Bartali 
           poses for a BARTALI BLADES razor advertisement.

           A MAKE-UP WOMAN powders his face.  A SMALL CROWD watches from 
           across the square as the PHOTOGRAPHER snaps his next shot.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Chin up now, Gino. 

           A HANDLER waddles up to Bartali.  Leads him away...

                                 HANDLER
                        There's a young woman who’s been 
                        waiting for hours to meet you.

           The Handler guides him across the courtyard to a YOUNG WOMAN.  
           She can’t be over twenty.  Bartali takes her hand.

                                 BARTALI
                        Good evening, Signora.  I hear 
                        you've been waiting for some time.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        I'd wait all day to meet you.  
                        Every year, I cheer for you when 
                        you race past my house in the Giro.  
                           (pulls out a handkerchief)
                        I always wave this.  Last year you 
                        smiled at me when you passed.  Do 
                        you remember? 

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m sorry, but the road goes by so 
                        fast...
                           (sees the disappointment 
                           in her face)
                        Oh, wait, this handkerchief...Of 
                        course I remember you.  How could I 
                        ever forget a smile like yours?     

           The Young Woman swells, smiles just about as big as her mouth 
           will allow.  Something catches Bartali's attention over her 
           shoulder...
           Through the window of a nearby CHOCOLATE SHOP, a quietly 
           beautiful RAVEN HAIRED WOMAN (23) pays for some candy.  Soft 
           ringlets of raven dark hair fall over a porcelain face so 
           pale she looks as if she's never seen the sun...

           Bartali can’t take his eyes off her.   

           EXT. SIDE STREET. DUSK

           The Woman and her friend, a JEWISH WOMAN, 30’s, carry bags of 
           groceries down the cobblestone walk.  

           Bartali hurries after them, cuts down an alleyway, runs a 
           couple blocks.  He emerges back onto the street, puffs out 
           his chest, ready for the woman to recognize him--

                                 BARTALI
                        Good evening.

           He flashes his famous smile.  The women shuffle past.  
           Bartali’s dumbfounded.  Walks after them...  

                                 BARTALI
                        Ladies as pretty as yourselves 
                        shouldn't be walking alone after 
                        dark.  You never know who you may 
                        run into.   

                                 JEWISH WOMAN
                        My thoughts exactly.

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m Gino...Gino Bartali.  Let me 
                        carry your groceries for you.

           The Jewish Woman looks him over.

                                 JEWISH WOMAN
                        You’re the cyclist.  My father  
                        took me to watch you race last 
                        year.

                                 BARTALI
                        Then hopefully you saw me win.  

                                 JEWISH WOMAN
                        Of course.    

           Bartali winks at the Raven Haired Woman.  Steps in front of 
           her.  Leans against a building and narrows his eyes in his 
           most seductive of stares...

                                 BARTALI
                        And what about you?  

           Bartali notices several books peeking out of her bag.

                                 BARTALI
                        Let me guess, you find bicycle 
                        racing only fit for barbarians and 
                        illiterates?  
           She tries to hold back, but bursts out laughing.  Motions 
           down to Bartali’s shoe.  He’s standing ankle deep in a 
           puddle.  He steps out, shakes his shoe off...

                                 BARTALI
                        Now that I've made a fool of myself 
                        at least let me walk you home.  

                                 RAVEN HAIRED WOMAN
                        I’m sorry, but I’ve never been 
                        interested in athletes.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Why not?

                                 RAVEN HAIRED WOMAN
                        Because you put everything in your 
                        life second to your sport. 

           Bartali’s stung.  He finally steps back.  Tips his cap.   

                                 BARTALI
                        Good-night, ladies.    

           They walk off.  Bartali turns back towards the city...Just as 
           the Raven Haired Woman peeks over her shoulder, curious...

           ANGLE ON--HIS BACK AS HE WALKS AWAY--

           The ANGLE SHIFTS and we’re in a completely different scene, 
           following a completely DIFFERENT MAN as he walks past...

           THE BIBLIOTECA NAZIONALE (National Library)--A WEEK LATER

           The man is CAPTAIN GIUSEPPE STRAZELLA (38).  A bear in a 
           Blackshirt uniform.  His eyes are mysterious, colorless like 
           ice water.    

           Around him, dozens of confused JEWS are corralled by 
           BLACKSHIRT SOLDIERS into waiting trucks.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                           (shouting)
                        You are being detained until we can 
                        send you back to your own 
                        countries.  Have your Jewish 
                        identity papers out and ready to be 
                        handed over.

           SOLDIERS go down the lines, taking the immigrant Jews’ 
           identity papers and directing them to the trucks... 

           A YOUNG BLACKSHIRT SOLDIER strides towards Strazella.

                                 BLACKSHIRT
                        General Rofino wants to see you, 
                        Captain.  
           INT. STATE BUILDING. HALLWAY. DAY

           Strazella stops before an imposing door and KNOCKS.  
           Something catches his attention down the hall...

           A SECRETARY’S WORK ROOM

           Rows of SECRETARIES typing out forms.  Strazella focuses on 
           one woman near the back...

           On the soft curls of her hair...Her snow white fingers 
           dancing on her typewriter...The peek of her delicate wrists 
           from her blouse sleeves...

           It’s the Raven Haired Woman.  And something in Strazella’s 
           stare softens when he looks at her--

           The door opens and GENERAL ROFINO (50’s), a distinguished 
           Blackshirt with a clipped moustache, stands on the other 
           side.   

                                 GENERAL ROFINO
                        Please, come in.

           INT. GENERAL’S OFFICE. DAY

           An immaculate office high over Florence.  Strazella admires a 
           painting of a WAR HERO standing heroically on a battlefield.

           He subtly tries to imitate the hero’s pose.

                                 GENERAL ROFINO (O.S.)
                        Do you like it? 

           General Rofino stirs a cup of tea behind him. 

                                 GENERAL ROFINO
                        Himmler sent it for my birthday. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I’m afraid I don’t know much about 
                        art.

                                 GENERAL ROFINO
                        Neither do I, but the Germans are 
                        very refined.  Their influence will 
                        be good for this country.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Maybe so, but I’ve never found 
                        their politics to make much sense.  

                                 GENERAL ROFINO
                        It’s only a matter of time before 
                        they control Europe.    Those who 
                        fight Hitler are just rising up 
                        against their own future.  

           Strazella looks around the General’s office with obvious 
           envy.  He focuses on the General’s gold watch.  Looks down at 
           the cheap metal on his own wrist and pulls his sleeve down.
                                 STRAZELLA
                        But the Jews are harmless.   

                                 GENERAL ROFINO
                        That’s their game.  They smile to 
                        your face, but turn your back and 
                        they’ll pick your pocket.  What’s 
                        worse are these partisans.  It’s a 
                        a slap in Mussolini’s face they’ve 
                        begun hiding Jews in their attics. 

           Strazella turns to the window, takes in the breathtaking view 
           of Florence.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Then it would seem to me the 
                        problem isn’t in controlling the 
                        Jews.  The problem is finding these 
                        partisans who are helping them.  

                                 GENERAL ROFINO
                        If I had a man who could do that, 
                        everything you see might someday be 
                        under his charge.

           Strazella understands.  Turns to the General.   

                                 STRAZELLA
                        But I’m just a soldier.  I wouldn’t 
                        even know where to begin.

                                 GENERAL ROFINO
                        Begin by telling me you want the 
                        responsibility of a Colonel.  From 
                        there you’ll find your way.   

           Strazella stares out at the city.  The lights below reflect 
           in his hungry eyes.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I’ll need an office to work out 
                        of...And a secretary.  

           INT. FLAT. NIGHT

           A modest apartment somewhere in Florence.  A young, well-fed 
           couple, HUSBAND and WIFE, and a JEWISH MAN wearing a Yarmulke 
           eat a candlelit Shabbat dinner--

           Suddenly--BANG!  BANG!  HEAVY KNOCKS at the door... 

                                                  CUT TO:

           THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE

           TWO BLACKSHIRT SOLDIERS wait.  The Husband opens the door.  
           Strazella steps out from behind the Soldiers.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Leonardo Comte?
                                 HUSBAND
                        Yes.

           The Wife joins them at the door.  The dinner table behind 
           them empty.  The Jewish Man, vanished. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I’m with the OVRA and have reason 
                        to believe you’re housing a Jew.

                                 HUSBAND
                        You have the wrong apartment.  

           The Husband slams the door in Strazella’s face.  He blocks it 
           with his foot. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Then you won’t mind me having a 
                        look.

                                 HUSBAND
                        Come back later, we were sitting 
                        down to dinner.

           Strazella motions to his Soldiers who bully the Husband and 
           Wife out of their apartment and down the hall.  

           INT. FLAT. NIGHT

           Strazella creeps around the apartment as if behind any shadow 
           something may jump out at him...  

           He tears open several cabinet drawers...Spills a junk 
           drawer...A small cloth bag falls to the rug...

           Strazella taps it into his palm...A butterfly-shaped diamond 
           pendant drops out.  He pockets it, notices...

           Three place settings on the dinner table.  Something covered 
           by a napkin in the middle.  He pulls the napkin back...A 
           Kiddish cup engraved with Hebrew...

           He hones in on a nearby closet door.  Takes the safety off 
           his pistol and tears the door open...It’s empty.  

           He crosses to a large chest--Kicks the lid open.  The Jewish 
           Man cowers inside.  

                                 JEWISH MAN
                        Please...

           Strazella reaches for the man...And into his breast pocket.  
           He takes his pack of cigarettes.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Why are you hiding?  

           The Jewish Man shivers, afraid to speak.  His eyes fall to 
           Strazella’s pistol.  Strazella cocks the barrel.

           Notices the Jewish Man’s pants are stained wet.
                                 STRAZELLA
                        If you talk you have no reason to 
                        be afraid.  Why are you hiding?

                                 JEWISH MAN
                           (stutters)
                        I...I heard the deportations were 
                        beginning in Rome.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You Jews are something.  Every new 
                        conspiracy whispered you take as 
                        fact.  

                                 JEWISH MAN
                        You’re not going to send me to 
                        Ferramonti now?  Please, I’ll die 
                        in a work camp.  I’m a father, I 
                        have a family...

           Strazella stares at him.  Considering. 

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. FLORENCE--NIGHT

           SOLDIERS shove the Jewish Man into the backseat of a military 
           sedan.  He’s driven off.

           THE SIDEWALK

           Strazella steps out of the building and towards the Husband 
           and Wife.  Both of them kneeling on the sidewalk.  A 
           BLACKSHIRT SOLDIER holds a rifle to their backs...

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Get up!

           The couple climbs to their feet.  Strazella boots the Husband 
           in his ass--

           His head cracks the side of the building.  Strazella grabs 
           him by the throat, speaks a breath away from his face.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Tell your partisan friends that now 
                        when they’re caught hiding a Jew, 
                        they’re going to be sent to 
                        Ferramonti as well.  

           Strazella releases the Husband.  He crumbles to the pavement.

           Strazella lights his cigarette, motions to his Soldiers and 
           they cross the street through traffic. 

           SOUND UPCUT--The CRACK OF THUNDER--

           EXT. TUSCAN COUNTRYSIDE. DAY

           A black thunderhead tumbles in, casting a mist over the 
           countryside.  Bartali races along the rain-slicked road. 
           Chasing Alfredo on his Vespa.  
                                 ALFREDO
                           (through his megaphone)
                        Keep pace, Gino.  Only seven days 
                        to Paris--

           A fireball red ‘36 FERRARI ROADSTER roars past.

           Something fires inside Bartali.  He refuses to be beaten, 
           even by a machine. 

           He drops a gear.  Cranks hard, gains on the car...

           THE DRIVER and his GIRLFRIEND spot Bartali racing alongside.  
           The Driver glances at his speedometer in disbelief: 45 KMH.  

                                 ALFREDO
                           (screaming)
                        Gino!  Stop this!

           Bartali cuts ahead of the car.  The Driver drops a gear, 
           hammers the gas.  The Ferrari swerves to pass, rounds a sharp 
           bend--

           And hydroplanes in a puddle...Spins out of control...Finally 
           stops in a nearby field.

                                 GIRLFRIEND
                           (smacks the Driver)
                        Idiot!

           EXT. A ROLLING COUNTRY ROAD--CONTINUOUS

           Bartali looks over his shoulder.  Smiles when he sees the 
           stalled Ferrari--

           WHAM!  His front tire nails a pothole.  He flips off his bike-

           Skids across the rough dirt and into a ditch on the side of 
           the road.  Road rash bites all the way down his bloody leg...     

           Alfredo races up.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Are you okay?

                                 BARTALI
                        It’s just a scratch. 

           Bartali dusts himself off, picks up his bike.  The front fork 
           mangled. 

                                 BARTALI
                        I’ll need a ride back home.  I have 
                        a spare fork back in the garage.

           Alfredo revs his Vespa.  Rides circles around Bartali.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Want to ride like a maniac with the 
                        Tour a week away?  Then you walk.
                                 BARTALI
                        It's fifteen-k.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Twenty. 

           Afredo cranks the throttle.  Disappears down the road.  
           Bartali searches the endless countryside.  Nothing but olive 
           trees as far as the eye can see...  

           EXT. DIFFERENT COUNTRY ROAD--HOURS LATER

           Bartali piggybacks his bike down a deserted road when he 
           hears a ROAR approaching over the hill behind him...

           A COACH rides a motorcycle over the hill, screaming into his 
           bullhorn at the BIANCHI CYCLING TEAM RIDERS chasing behind...

           The Coach recognizes Bartali.  Stops.

                                 COACH
                        What happened, Gino?

                                 BARTALI
                        What’s it look like?  I wrecked.  
                        Maybe you could give me a ride to 
                        town?

                                 COACH
                        Of course.

           Coppi, wearing a BIANCHI TEAM JERSEY, slows as he rides 
           past...

                                 COPPI
                        We don’t have time for handouts.
                           (daggers at Bartali)
                        I have a Yellow Jersey to win.

           Coppi takes off down the road.  The rest of the Riders  
           chase.  

                                 COACH
                        There’s a town about three k down 
                        this road.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Wonderful.  

           He motors off.  Bartali boils with frustration.  Slams his 
           bike to the road...

           And then he sees smoke curling out of a distant chimney.

           EXT. NISSIM FARMHOUSE. LATER

           A ghost of a farm in the Farneta countryside.

           Time has left the vine covered farmhouse faded and 
           splintered.  Bone-thin horses WHINNY from the stables.
           Bartali climbs the CREAKY stoop when he hears a SHARP 
           GRINDING from an old shed across the property.

           INT. A BLACKSMITH'S SHED

           Sparks rain off a torch.  A BLACKSMITH forges a horseshoe.

                                 BARTALI (O.S.)
                        Pardon me.
                           (the Blacksmith turns)
                        I've had an accident.  If I could 
                        use your telephone...

           The Blacksmith lifts his welding mask, revealing a man with 
           the airs of a professional, but the soot covered face of a 
           laborer.  This is GIOCOMO NISSIM.

           Nissim slides on his coke bottle glasses.  

                                 NISSIM
                        I have no telephone.

                                 BARTALI
                        Then maybe you could give me a ride 
                        into Florence.

                                 NISSIM
                        Some Blackshirts came a few weeks 
                        ago and said they needed to borrow 
                        my truck.  I haven't seen it since.

           Bartali motions to his broken bicycle.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Can you fix this?

                                 NISSIM
                        I haven’t got the time--

                                 BARTALI
                        I’ll pay you.  I have money.

           He offers up a thick roll of money.  Nissim moves towards 
           him.  Looks closely to make sure it’s not counterfeit.   

                                 BARTALI
                        How much?

                                 NISSIM
                        All of it.  Half now.  The other 
                        when I finish.  

                                 BARTALI
                        But I’m Gino Bartali.  You’d have 
                        my gratitude.

                                 NISSIM
                        I’m afraid your thanks don't feed 
                        my family.
           EXT. NISSIM’S SHED. LATER

           Nissim forges the fork inside.  Bartali sits against the 
           shed, cigarette dangling from his lips, painfully picking the 
           rocks out of his road rash--

                                 JOSEPHINA (O.S.)
                        That’s going to get infected.  

           JOSEPHINA NISSIM, (mid '30's) a fine-boned housewife, stands 
           above him in her cooking apron, holding a pot of warm water.

                                 JOSEPHINA
                        Take off your sock.  

           Crusted to his bloody calf, he tugs at the sock.  Josephina 
           kneels next to him.  Sponges some warm water onto the sock.

                                 JOSEPHINA
                        Try now.

           The sock comes free.  She dips the towel in the soapy water 
           and with a mother’s tenderness she cleans out his wounds...

           INT. NISSIM FARMHOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT

           Around a dinner table, the Nissim’s three beanpole children: 
           VITTORIO (18), SUSANA (17) and PAULO (13) eat a dinner of 
           potatoes and war ration beef along with...

           Josephina, Nissim and Bartali.  Everyone chews in 
           uncomfortable silence, until Jospehina can’t take it anymore.  

                                 JOSEPHINA
                        Do you find yourself cycling 
                        through the countryside often?

                                 BARTALI
                        As often as I can. 

                                 JOSEPHINA
                        Then you must know these back roads 
                        well.

           Nissim stops chewing.  Starts listening...

                                 BARTALI
                        Actually I do most of my training 
                        up North.  Nothing builds the legs 
                        like climbing Mount Rosa.

                                 NISSIM
                        I hear the Blackshirt patrols are 
                        running all through the Alps now.  
                        Do you ever see them when you ride?

           Five sets of eyes now hang on Bartali’s answer and he quickly 
           understands what he's really being asked...
                                 BARTALI
                        I should be on my way.  Thank you 
                        for everything.  

           Josephina urges Nissim with her eyes.

                                 NISSIM
                        Let me walk you out.

           EXT. NISSIM FARMHOUSE. NIGHT

           Bartali mounts his bike, tests his fork.

                                 BARTALI
                        It feels better than new.    

                                 NISSIM
                        I’m expensive, but my work is good.

           Bartali hands him the rest of his money.  Nissim just stares 
           at it.  

                                 NISSIM
                        I don't want your money.

                                 BARTALI
                        You need to be paid for your work.

                                 NISSIM
                        Blacksmithing isn't my work.  I’m 
                        an accountant by trade.  But since 
                        these racial laws started, finding 
                        anyone who’ll trust a Jew with 
                        their money is near impossible. 

                                 BARTALI
                        Then I wish I had more to give you.

                                 NISSIM
                        Consider it a favor.  Do one for me 
                        in return.  

           Nissim's not sure how to put it.  The words just tumble out--

                                 NISSIM
                        I need a map of the backroads.  
                        From here to Borgoessia.

                                 BARTALI
                        A map?  I..I can’t.  I have a race 
                        coming up.

           Bartali tries to give him the money.  Nissim won’t take it.

                                 NISSIM
                        The Blackshirts are beginning to 
                        pillage the Jewish farms.  They're 
                        raping the woman.  If anything were 
                        to happen to my daughter...
                                 BARTALI
                        What can I do?  I just ride a 
                        bicycle.

                                 NISSIM
                        Then tell me if you’ve seen any 
                        patrols along the Verese pass? 

           Bartali holds on him.  Considers the question with sobriety.

                                 BARTALI
                        I’ve seen nothing...I’m sorry. 

           The disappointment sets in.  Nissim nods solemnly.  He's 
           asked too much and knows it.

           Bartali hands Nissim the money.  Closes his hand around it.  
           He climbs on his bike, pedals off into the night...

           EXT. HOTEL RELAIS. NIGHT

           A gala affair.  Spotlights crisscross the clouds.

           Limousines arrive outside the luxury hotel.  Formally dressed 
           GUESTS make their way up the red carpet...

           A BLACK MERCEDES pulls up.  Bartali steps out of the back 
           seat.  Smiles his way past the PHOTOGRAPHER’S FLASHBULBS.  A 
           BEAUTIFUL BLONDE on his arm.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Please, Gino.  Give us one with a 
                        wave.

           Bartali smiles and waves...A rush of commotion rises behind 
           him.  Coppi walks up the red carpet.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Coppi, pose with Gino.  

           Bartali locks eyes with Coppi.  Coppi knows he has no choice.  
           He shakes hands with Bartali.  They force smiles.

           FLASHBULBS EXPLODE like fireworks. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHERS
                        Gino over here please...Coppi this 
                        way...

           Bartali squeezes Coppi’s hand like he’s trying to break it, 
           pulls him in close and speaks quietly into his ear...

                                 BARTALI
                        Enjoy it while it lasts.  After I 
                        take the tour, nobody will even 
                        remember your name.

           Coppi locks eyes with him, pulls his hand away and continues 
           into the hotel...
           INT. HOTEL. GRAND HALL. NIGHT

           A spotlight shines down on BENITO MUSSOLINI.  He orates from 
           a podium on a stage. 

                                 MUSSOLINI
                        I stand here not as your leader, 
                        but as a humble fan of one of our 
                        country's greatest traditions...

           Beneath crystal chandeliers, countless tables dot the opulent 
           hall.  A rapt audience hangs on his every word.

           Bartali sits at a table near the stage.  Caressing the gloved 
           hand of his date.

                                 MUSSOLINI
                        And I have faith this year le 
                        Maillot Jeune will return to Italy 
                        on the back of one of our own!   

           The crowd breaks out in APPLAUSE.  Bartali places his napkin 
           on the table, ready to stand--

                                 MUSSOLINI
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you 
                        Gino Bartali...

           Bartali stands, the spotlight shines on him.  He takes a bow 
           to a raucous standing ovation.

                                 MUSSOLINI
                        ...And Fausto Coppi!

           ACROSS THE ROOM--In the warm glow of another spotlight, Coppi 
           stands, flashes a million dollar smile...

           The APPLAUSE seems to get louder and louder until it’s 
           RINGING in Bartali’s ears... 

           INT. BALLROOM. LATER

           The ORCHESTRA plays.  We FLOAT past MARIO LANZA, a famous 
           Italian crooner singing Perché (Because).  Keep floating...

           Past the dance floor, towards the empty tables.  Bartali sits 
           alone.  Smoking a cigarette.  Opening another bottle of wine.  

           Colonel Strazella approaches like some timid schoolboy...

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Don Bartali?

           He takes Bartali's hand, shakes furiously.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Colonel Giuseppe Strazella.  
                        Meeting you is...This is an honor.

                                 BARTALI
                        The honor’s mine.  
                                 STRAZELLA
                        I’ve followed your races since you 
                        won the Tour of the Basque Country 
                        in thirty-five.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Was it that long ago?  No wonder 
                        all these Coppi fans are popping up 
                        like flies.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Let them talk.  You’re in your 
                        prime.  Everybody knows the smart 
                        money’s on you in Paris. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Colonel?  I’ve been looking all 
                        over for you.

           Strazella turns.  The Raven Haired Woman from the market 
           waits behind him.  She’s elegant in a emerald green evening 
           gown. 

           Strazella takes her hand, leads her towards Bartali.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Adriana, come meet Don Bartali.   

           We'll now know the Raven Haired Woman as ADRIANA BANI.

                                 ADRIANA
                        Pleased to meet you.  

           Adriana’s eyes give the slightest hint she recognizes him, 
           but she pretends not to.  Bartali plays along.

                                 BARTALI
                        The pleasure’s mine.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Adriana’s my secretary.  She helps 
                        me remember who I need to speak to 
                        at these parties.

                                 ADRIANA
                        General Rofino is looking for you.

           Strazella smiles at her.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I don’t know what I’d do without 
                        her.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Do you think you could spare her 
                        for one dance?  I haven’t had one 
                        all night. 
                                 STRAZELLA
                        For the Campanissimo?  Anything, 
                        but you’ll have to ask her 
                        yourself.  

           The band starts up again.

                                 BARTALI
                        May I have this dance?  

                                 ADRIANA
                        I’m sorry, but I’m working. 

                                 BARTALI
                        It’s a party.  And a dance will 
                        bring me good luck in Paris. 

           Adriana turns at Strazella as if for permission.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I’m sure Don Bartali will be 
                        nothing but a gentleman.

           Strazella stares at Bartali.  His ice water blue eyes make 
           Bartali uneasy.  

                                 BARTALI
                        You have my word.  

                                 ADRIANA
                           (to Strazella)
                        Are you sure it’s alright?

                                 STRAZELLA
                           (forces a smile)
                        Yes.  Go and have fun.   

           She looks at Bartali, still not convinced.  

           INT. THE BALLROOM--A MINUTE LATER

           Bartali leads Adriana to the dance floor.  Heads turn.  
           Painted lips whisper about the girl with Bartali.   

                                 ADRIANA
                        Everyone’s looking at us.

                                 BARTALI
                        Then we should give them something 
                        to watch.  

           Bartali places his hand on Adriana’s back.  She stiffens at 
           his touch.  

                                 BARTALI
                        If we’re going to dance together 
                        I’m going to have to touch you.

           Adriana looks at him, she hadn’t thought of that.  
                                 ADRIANA
                        Yes...Of course. 

           Bartali gently takes her hand in his.  Places his other on 
           the small of her back.  And they dance.  

           She closes her eyes, lost in the grandeur of the music, the 
           moment, it’s almost magical.

                                 BARTALI
                        So is coming to these parties with 
                        the Colonel just a perk of the job?  

                                 ADRIANA
                        You shouldn’t be so presumptuous.  
                        I’m here for work.  But since we’re 
                        asking questions, where’s that 
                        woman I saw you sitting with?

           ACROSS THE BALL ROOM--Strazella talks to General Rufino.  His 
           eyes steal a peek over the General’s shoulder as...

           Bartali leads Adriana across the floor.  

                                 BARTALI
                        She had a little too much wine and 
                        saw herself home early.  Though I 
                        have to say I’m surprised someone 
                        who doesn’t even remember meeting 
                        me noticed my date. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        How could I not?  She was as tall 
                        as a giraffe.

           The music stops.  So do they.  But for a moment neither of 
           them let go.  Finally Adriana steps back.

                                 BARTALI
                        Thank you for the dance. 

           Bartali takes Adriana’s hand.  Kisses it.  Adriana blushes, 
           quickly withdraws her hand.

                                 ADRIANA
                        I hope it works...The dance, I 
                        mean.  I hope it brings you good 
                        luck in your race.  

           Bartali watches her disappear across the floor.  The next 
           song begins and off the graceful movements of the dancers:

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. FRENCH ALPS. TOUR DE FRANCE--TWO WEEKS LATER

           Wearing the Yellow Jersey, Coppi leads the PELETON down the 
           breakneck descent through the Alps...

           TITLE CARD:  
           Tour de France                                                      
           Stage 13/Cannes--Digne

           Bartali cuts to the head of the peleton, tucks and chases...

           COPPI checks over his shoulder.  Sees Bartali gaining, drops 
           a gear and takes off, pushing eighty kilometers an hour...

           But Bartali's relentless and suddenly they're neck and neck.  
           Both shooting for the narrow switchback ahead.  A thousand 
           meter drop on either side of them.

           Coppi jukes Bartali...Bartali jukes back...Their tires rub...

                                 BARTALI
                        Back off!

           A hairpin turn fast approaching.  A second from disaster--

           At the last second, Coppi hits his brakes.  Bartali shoots 
           the gap, takes the lead--

           Suddenly, a great WHINE echoes across the valley.  It grows 
           into a rolling thunder across the orange sky...

           Bartali looks up.  Doesn't quite know what he's seeing...

           Hundreds of black dots descend through the orange sky like 
           sinking stars...NAZI PARATROOPERS dropping into Paris.

           INT. PRESS TENT. NIGHT

           Bartali and Alfredo shuffle through the chaotic sea of 
           REPORTERS.  All speculating on the upcoming news conference.

           Finally, JACQUES GODDET, the Tour's Directeur, climbs the 
           make-shift stage, steps behind his podium.  The tent quiets.

                                 GODDET
                        It saddens me to report that at 
                        approximately half-past four this 
                        afternoon Paris fell to invading 
                        Nazi forces.

           Horror spills onto everyone's face.  

                                 GODDET
                        Le Tour de France is a symbol of 
                        peace and as such, too susceptible 
                        of apparition by the enemies of 
                        France to continue on this year.

           The room explodes.  Reporters spit questions at Goddet--

                                 REPORTER
                        What about next year?

                                 GODDET
                        The race will be suspended 
                        indefinitely until the commission 
                        sees fit to re-convene.
                                 REPORTER
                        When will that be?

                                 GODDET
                        Only once this fighting ends.

           INT. MINISTRY OF ITALIAN IMMIGRATION. FRANCE. DAY

           Bedlam at the customs office on the France/Italy border.  

           THOUSANDS OF ITALIANS flee France.  Shivering in disorganized 
           lines.  Scared and desperate to get back onto Italian soil.

           Bartali and Alfredo amongst them. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Now that they’ve taken Paris, it’s 
                        only a matter of time before London 
                        falls as well.  

           An IMMIGRATION OFFICER recognizes Bartali, waves to him.

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER
                        Gino!  Come.

           Bartali leads Alfredo to the front of the line.

                                 BARTALI
                        Thank you.

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER
                        Wait until I tell my wife I 
                        processed Gino Bartali's passport. 

           The Officer stamps Bartali's passport without question.  
           Alfredo hands his passport to another IMMIGRATION OFFICER.

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER TWO
                        What was your business in France? 

                                 ALFREDO
                        I’m his coach, Alfredo Binda.  

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER TWO
                        Open your bag please.

           Alfredo unzips his bag and shoves it at the Officer.  Bartali 
           notices...

           A FEW LINES DOWN--ANOTHER IMMIGRATION OFFICER processing the 
           passport of a TEENAGE BOY.  

           The Officer waves over three ITALIAN SOLDIERS.  They roughly 
           force the Boy towards the back of another line.  A line so 
           long we can’t even see the end.  A sign hangs above: LINEA 
           EBREA (JEWISH LINE).

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Don Bartali...
           Bartali's eyes dart back to the Officer who holds his 
           passport out with a smile so big it seems in bad taste.

                                 IMMIGRATION OFFICER
                        Welcome home.

           Alfredo meets Bartali, they walk off.  Bartali’s stunned. 
           This isn’t the home he left.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Still believe Italy won’t become 
                        Poland, Gino?  

           EXT. FLORENCE SQUARE. DAY

           The sun hammers on Bartali as he stands in his suit at the 
           end of a line of YOUNG MEN.  All filing into a MILITARY 
           MEDICAL TENT.  A huge red cross painted on the side.  Inside, 
           DOZENS OF DOCTORS give physical exams.

           A SOLDIER walks past, barking through a megaphone...

                                 SOLDIER OVER MEGAPHONE
                        In order to pass your physical you 
                        must meet military standards...

           Bartali dabs the sweat from his forehead with a silk 
           handkerchief.  Another BLACKSHIRT SOLDIER recognizes him.

                                 BLACKSHIRT SOLDIER 
                        Campanissimo?  Please, come to the 
                        front. 

                                 BARTALI
                        Thank you, but I’ll wait.

           INT. MILITARY TENT. DAY

           Bartali sits on a doctor’s table with his shirt off. 

           The Military Doctor holds a stethoscope over Bartali’s heart.  
           Confused, he moves the stethoscope and listens again.

                                 MILITARY DOCTOR
                        Excuse me.

           The Doctor turns, whispers to another DOCTOR.  The SECOND 
           DOCTOR puts on his stethoscope, holds it to Bartali’s chest--

           EXT. MILITARY TENT. DUSK

           Bartali walks out of the tent, dazed by disappointment.  
           Alfredo hurries towards him, pushing Bartali’s bike. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Where’s your uniform?

           Bartali hands Alfredo a sheet of paper.  He reads. 
                                 BARTALI
                           (disbelief)
                        I just wanted to do something.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You failed the physical?  

                                 BARTALI
                        They said my heart only beats 
                        thirty-two times a minute and 
                        that’s below military thresholds.

                                 ALFREDO
                        So you’re in too good of shape to 
                        fight?  With that kind of thinking 
                        it’s no wonder we’re going to lose 
                        our country in this war.   

           Bartali takes his bike from Alfredo.  Locks his toes into the 
           pedals.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Just a minute, my Vespa’s across 
                        the square.

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m not training today, Alfredo.  I 
                        just need to ride.    

           Alfredo understands.  Watches him ride off.

           EXT. SALITA DEL MOCCOLI. NIGHT

           Still dressed in his suit, Bartali whips down a winding hill.   

           He yanks off his tie.  Slides out of his jacket.  Removes his 
           hands from the handlebars and lifts them out to the side like 
           he’s ready to take flight...

           The rush of wind in his face feeds his spirit as he speeds 
           down the moonlit hill...

           EXT. FLORENCE. NIGHT

           The city of Florence is quiet at this time of night.  Bartali 
           floats through the dark side streets...

           DOWN THE BLOCK--A DRUNK MAN harasses Adriana outside THE 
           STATE BUILDING. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        I’ve already had a long day of 
                        work.  I’m not interested in having 
                        dinner with you.  So please--  

                                 DRUNK MAN
                        Then how about a bottle of wine?      

           The Drunk Man yanks Adriana's arm, forcing her close to him.  
           She drops an armful of books to the sidewalk--
                                 ADRIANA
                        Let go of my arm!

                                 BARTALI (O.S.)
                        You heard her. 

           The Drunk Man looks up.  Bartali stands above him.  Grabs him 
           by the lapels and tosses him, rolling across the street.  

                                 BARTALI
                        The lady asked you to go.  If you 
                        make me ask, I won’t be so polite.    

           The Drunk Man wipes his lip, recognizes Bartali.

                                 DRUNK MAN
                        Is that the best you’ve got?  No 
                        wonder everyone’s saying you were 
                        dogging it in the Alps.    

           Bartali lurches at the Drunk Man, but he runs off.  Bartali 
           takes Adriana’s trembling hands, helps her up.   

                                 ADRIANA
                        He grabbed me.  He wouldn't stop...

           Bartali looks at her tiny hands in his.

                                 BARTALI
                        You're trembling.  Don't be afraid.

                                 ADRIANA
                           (catches herself)
                        Yes...Well, he's gone now.  I 
                        should be getting home.  

           Adriana pulls her hands away, gathers her books from the 
           sidewalk.  Looks at him like she wants to say something, but 
           can’t bring herself to...

                                 ADRIANA
                        I have to go.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Let me walk you.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        No, that’s not necessary...Really.  
                        Thank you for your help.

           She brushes past, hurries down the street.

           EXT. PONTE SANTA TRINITA BRIDGE--MINUTES LATER

           Across one of the bridges slung over the Arno, Adriana looks 
           over her shoulder.  Bartali rides slowly, five meters behind.

                                 ADRIANA
                        I told you I’ll make it home fine 
                        on my own. 
                                  BARTALI
                        I’m sure you will. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        Then why are you following me? 

                                 BARTALI
                        Who said I was following you?  It's 
                        a beautiful night.  I’m just 
                        getting in a little extra training.

                                 ADRIANA
                        And how does peddling four 
                        kilometers an hour help you train?

                                 BARTALI
                        By teaching me patience.   

           Adriana stops.  Bartali squeezes his brakes.  They suddenly 
           stand face to face.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        If you have any illusions about me 
                        or you and me or...Well, forget it.  
                        I told you already, I don’t have 
                        any interest in athletes.    

                                 BARTALI
                        Now you’re the one being 
                        presumptuous.  I told you I’m just 
                        training.  

           A MILITARY TRUCK drives past.  THE DRIVER shouts over a PA 
           SYSTEM:

                                 DRIVER OVER PA
                        The city curfew goes into effect in 
                        fifteen minutes.  Anyone on the 
                        streets will be arrested.

           Adriana looks at Bartali and for a brief second he sees the 
           frightened little girl beneath the stone exterior. 

                                 BARTALI
                        Let me ride you the rest of the 
                        way.    

                                 ADRIANA
                        Thank you, but I’ll walk. 

           She walks off.  Bartali follows her.

                                 BARTALI
                        Don’t tell me you’re afraid of a 
                        bicycle ride.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        I’m not afraid.  It’s just...I’ve 
                        never actually ridden one before.
                                 BARTALI
                        So you don’t know how?  It’s okay, 
                        you don’t have to...I do.  

           Bartali holds his hand out for her to take, she looks at it, 
           seems to be fighting something within herself--

           EXT. CITY OF FLORENCE. NIGHT

           Adriana teeters on Bartali's handlebars.  Terrified, but 
           exhilarated.  Riding thorough the darkest part of the city.    

                                 ADRIANA
                        Faster!

           ALLEYWAY

           Bartali drops a gear, cranks harder.  They round a corner.  
           The road comes to a dead end--  

                                 ADRIANA
                        Watch out!

           Bartali shifts his weight, nimbly threads down a...

           SIDE STREET

           A VERY FAT MAN steps into the street.  Bartali hits the 
           brakes...Pulls Adriana onto his lap...They skid to a stop.

           The Very Fat Man just stares at them.   Finally, he waddles 
           away, murmuring to himself.  Adriana looks at Bartali.  
           Gently eases herself from his arms.

                                 ADRIANA
                        Maybe not so fast. 

           EXT. ADRIANA’S VILLA. NIGHT

           Bartali stops in front of a simple villa.  He lifts her off 
           his bars, gently floats her to the ground.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        That was an experience. 

                                 BARTALI
                        For me, too.  I’m used to people 
                        screaming in my face while I’m 
                        riding, but nobody’s ever been 
                        quite as loud as you.

           Bartali notices the windows in the villa are dark.

                                 BARTALI
                        You live alone?  Where are your 
                        parents?

                                 ADRIANA
                        When the war started they went to 
                        Switzerland.  I had to stay behind.  
                        My job is too important.  
                                 BARTALI
                        I’ve never seen a secretary with 
                        such dedication.  

           Adriana looks at him for a moment.   

                                 ADRIANA
                        Would you have won?  If the Nazi’s 
                        hadn’t invaded Paris, could you 
                        have beaten Coppi?

           Surprised by her question, he’s quiet...

                                 ADRIANA
                        The sports writers don’t seem to 
                        think so...Look at me, not only do 
                        I scream louder than I should, I 
                        also say things when I need to just 
                        keep quiet.

           Bartali looks at her, disarming her.  She fiddles with her 
           collar nervously. 

                                 BARTALI
                        If the writers know so much, they 
                        should ride against me rather than 
                        write about me...But the answer is 
                        yes, I would have beaten him.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        Then I’m sorry you didn’t get the 
                        chance.

           For a moment they just look at one another.  Bartali moves 
           towards her slowly, deliberately...   

           Caressing her face with his fingertips. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        I should go.

           His hands pull away the silk scarf wrapped around her hair.  
           Her dark wash of curls cascades over her shoulders...

           He kisses her.  And she doesn’t resist.  A slow, soft first 
           kiss.  She finally opens her eyes.     

                                 ADRIANA
                        I thought you were just training. 

                                 BARTALI
                        I lied.  

           She smiles.  For the first time she’s raw, unguarded.

                                 ADRIANA
                        Good-night, Gino.

           She disappears inside.  Bartali stares at the door for a 
           beat.  Rides off...
           INT. STRAZELLA’S OFFICE. DAY

           The CARRIAGE OF A TYPE WRITER stamps letters onto a form with 
           IDENTIFICAZIONE MILITARE (Military Identification) printed on 
           top... 

           Adriana pulls the form from the typewriter, fills out a 
           receipt in duplicate when--

           A door OPENS behind her.  Strazella steps out of his office 
           with GESTAPO OFFICER EICHMAN, a Nazi with a cold, grim face.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Let Heir Himmler know my office is 
                        at his disposal.  
                           (to Adriana)
                        Did you finish Officer Eichman’s 
                        identification papers?

           Adriana folds the document she was typing.  Hands it to 
           Strazella.  He double-checks it, passes it to the NAZI.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Now you’ll be able to move in and 
                        out of Italy without any problem.  

                                 EICHMAN
                        Excellent.  I have a feeling I’ll 
                        be back from Berlin soon enough.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I look forward to it.    

           Eichman walks out the door.  Strazella turns, watches Adriana 
           work for a beat...

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You’re not busy are you?

                                 ADRIANA
                        I need to get the records for the 
                        papers to the registrar.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        In a moment...Please, come into my 
                        office.

           Adriana stands, follows Strazella into...

           HIS OFFICE

           A small room on a low floor.  An oversized painting of 
           Mussolini looms above his skeletal desk.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I found out something very 
                        interesting about you today...

           A grin breaks over his face. 
                                 STRAZELLA
                        It’s your birthday, isn’t it? 

                                 ADRIANA
                           (can’t hide her surprise)
                        Oh...How did you know?

           Strazella reaches into his desk, pulls out a small gift box.   

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I have my ways.  Open it.  

           Adriana unties the ribbon, opens the box and pulls out a gold 
           butterfly broach rimmed with diamonds.  The same one he stole 
           from the partisan flat.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        I couldn’t possibly accept this.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Consider it a bonus for all your 
                        hard work.

                                 ADRIANA
                        I thought I was just doing my job.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You’re modest.  Now, let’s see how 
                        it looks on you.

           Strazella takes the broach from Adriana.  Pins it just under 
           her neck and angles her towards a small mirror.    

           For a second he’s motionless, his hands resting on her 
           shoulders...   

                                 ADRIANA
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        When this war’s over, Mussolini 
                        will remember those who helped him 
                        and so will I...You’re doing a 
                        wonderful job, Adriana.   

           Adriana looks down at his hands on her.  Near her neck.  
           Strazella catches himself, drops his hands and grins... 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Well, I hope you like it because I 
                        can’t take it back.

                                 ADRIANA
                        I love it.  Thank you, but...If 
                        you’ll excuse me I need to file 
                        those receipts before the office 
                        closes. 

           Strazella steps back.
                                 STRAZELLA
                        Of course. 

           Adriana smiles, moves out the door.  Strazella slumps into 
           his chair, he had hoped that would have gone better.

           EXT. GARDEN--DAY

           Bartali picks grapes behind his villa.  A transistor radio 
           plays the NEWS...

           TITLE CARD:  APRIL 1941

                                 RADIO NEWSMAN (O.S.)
                        ...Enter July’s Giro Dell’Emillia 
                        with the Bianchi team. 

           Bartali turns up the radio, when Sofia rushes around the 
           house towards him...

                                 BARTALI
                        Sofia?  What’s wrong?   

                                 SOFIA
                        It’s Alfredo.  He was arrested--

           EXT. FLORENCE. POLICE STATION. NIGHT

           Bartali paces on the stone steps outside the Florence police 
           station.  Finally, Alfredo bounds out the front doors.

                                 ALFREDO
                        They should be forced to spend an 
                        hour in one of their own cells.    

                                 BARTALI
                        How many fights do you have in you?            

           Alfredo stops.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Some waiter tells my wife they 
                        don’t serve Jews and you expect me 
                        to sit on my hands?

                                 BARTALI
                        If you fight, you go to jail, but 
                        I’m the one who suffers! 

                                 ALFREDO
                        You’re worried about your training?  
                        For what?  There won’t be any races 
                        until this war ends.
                                 BARTALI
                        Coppi is racing the Giro Dell’ 
                        Emillia in July.  If he’s racing, 
                        I’m racing.  We start training in 
                        the morning.   

                                 ALFREDO
                        I’m quitting, Gino.  We’re through 
                        training.

           Alfredo leads him away from the ears of a street corner NEWS 
           VENDOR.

                                 ALFREDO
                        First the Polish Jews were banned 
                        from walking on the sidewalks.  Now 
                        the Nazi's are forcing them onto 
                        trains for Auschwitz.

                                 BARTALI
                        There’s no proof these work camps 
                        even exist.

                                 ALFREDO
                        The proof they incinerate in the 
                        crematoriums. 

           Bartali stares at an anti-Semitic poster hanging on a brick 
           wall.  A cartoon drawing of a Jewish man with a pig's snout.  
           Beneath it: Maiale Ebreo (Jewish Pig)

                                 BARTALI
                        What does any of this have to do 
                        with my training? 

                                 ALFREDO
                        It’s Sofia.  We’re going to 
                        Switzerland.  She’s no longer safe 
                        here.  

                                 BARTALI
                        This is Italy.  We’re all safe 
                        here.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Then why have the Swiss closed 
                        their borders to the Jews?  They’ve 
                        begun turning whole families away.  

                                 BARTALI
                        So what then?  You’re just going to 
                        smuggle her in over the Alps on 
                        your back. 

           Bartali reads Alfredo’s long, deep silence.  

                                 BARTALI
                        I always knew you were crazy, I 
                        just never knew you were stupid on 
                        top of it.
                                 ALFREDO
                        There’s a pass over Mount Rosa that 
                        leads into Zermatt.  But if we go, 
                        I won’t be coming back.  

                                 BARTALI
                        My legs.  Your experience.  We're a 
                        team.  You can’t quit on me. 

           Alfredo holds on him.  Considering.

                                 ALFREDO
                        There is one way we could continue.    
                           (barely a whisper)
                        In Genoa there’s a Cardinal who’s 
                        offered Sofia Catholic identity 
                        papers.  With those I could safely 
                        get her to Zurich by train.  She 
                        has a cousin there she could stay 
                        with until things return to normal 
                        here.     

                                 BARTALI
                        You get caught carrying false 
                        papers and you’re a dead man.

                                 ALFREDO 
                        That’s why I can’t do it.  If I’m 
                        stopped that far from Florence I’ll 
                        be searched, but you, Gino...

                                 BARTALI
                        Ah, I suppose the patrols will just 
                        wave the Campanissimo right 
                        through.  You’ve got some 
                        imagination, old man.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Do this and I’ll stay behind for a 
                        year to help you train.  God 
                        willing, the Tour runs next year 
                        and you’ll be ready.    

                                 BARTALI
                        If I’m not in prison myself.

                                 ALFREDO
                        The soldiers are used to seeing you 
                        ride.  If you’re stopped, say 
                        you're training and took a bad 
                        turn.

                                 BARTALI
                        And if they search me regardless 
                        and find the papers?  Wouldn’t I 
                        swing for treason just like you? 

           Alfredo says nothing.  He would. 

                                 BARTALI
                        Ask me anything, Alfredo, but you 
                        can’t ask me to do this.
                                 ALFREDO
                        That’s exactly why I must.  We’re 
                        taking a train to Como tomorrow.  
                        From there we’ll make our way over 
                        the Alps.  
                           (holds out his hand)
                        Until this madness is through, 
                        Campanissimo.

           Bartali just stares at Alfredo’s extended palm...

           INT. BARTALI’S BEDROOM. NIGHT

           Four o’clock in the morning and Bartali lays awake, focused 
           on the claw of skeletal branches tapping against his window.

           EXT. PONTE VESPUCCI--DAWN 

           With the sun rising behind him, Bartali races towards the 
           rolling Tuscan countryside.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

           A SERIES OF SHOTS--BARTALI’S 100 KILOMETER RIDE. 

           He rides out of Tuscany.  From the rolling lush green, into 
           high mountain passes...

           The morning turns to afternoon, becomes evening...

           EXT. CHETUSA DE FERNATA. DUSK

           Tucked low over his bike, he whips down the other side of the 
           pass...And into the small village of Genoa..

           INT. SAN DAMIANO CHURCH. DUSK

           A cavernous chapel.  Sunlight streaks through glorious 
           stained glass windows.  MONKS light candles around the alter.

           Bartali's STEPS echo as he walks past rows of wooden pews.  
           He stops a passing MONK.  Murmurs something.

           The Monk points to a CONFESSIONAL BOOTH.  A YOUNG MAN steps 
           out of it and Bartali slips...

           INSIDE THE CONFESSIONAL 

           Through the mesh window, a thousand year old Cardinal on the 
           other side.  This is CARDINAL ELIA DALLA COSTA.

                                 BARTALI
                           (whispers)
                        Cardinal Dalla Costa?

           The Cardinal crosses himself, blesses Bartali.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        Yes, my son.  How long has it been 
                        since your last confession? 
                                 BARTALI
                        Alfredo sent me...For the papers--

           The Cardinal’s eyes snap at Bartali.  He bolts out of the 
           confessional, moving quickly, but with an arthritic limp.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Wait...I rode a long way.

           Bartali steps out after him...And into the chest of a BLACK 
           SHIRT SOLDIER--

                                 BARTALI
                        Excuse me.  

           The Soldier eyes Bartali, kneels in a nearby pew.

           EXT. CHURCH SQUARE--A MINUTE LATER

           Bartali crosses into the courtyard.  Sees the Cardinal's 
           cloak disappear down the nearby cellar stairs...

           INT. CHURCH CELLAR-NIGHT

           He races down the loose stone steps, loses his footing, 
           trips.

                                 BARTALI
                        Damn--

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA (O.S.)
                        Watch your language!

           Cardinal Dalla Costa stands before him.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        You're in God's house.

                                 BARTALI
                        My apologies.  But I still have a 
                        long ride home, so if I could just 
                        get those papers--

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        If you're going to take part in the 
                        underground, you'd better learn to 
                        hold your tongue.  
                           (whispers)
                        The walls have ears. 

                                 BARTALI
                        I'm not taking part in any 
                        underground.  I’m only doing a 
                        favor for a friend.  Now do you 
                        have them or not? 

           Cardinal Dalla Costa reaches into his cloak...

           Pulls out a brown envelope.  Bartali just stares at it.  
           Knows once he touches it there’s no stepping back.
           He takes the envelope, turns it over in his hands, unfolds an 
           authentic looking passport from inside...

           A sepia photo of Sofia pasted on the first page.  Beneath it, 
           her new identity:  FERMINIZZO, MARIA. 

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        Put it someplace safe.

           Bartali stuffs it into his bag--

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        No...If you're searched, that's the 
                        first place they'll look.

           EXT. CHURCH ALLEY. LATER

           The Cardinal works the rolled up envelope into Bartali’s dark 
           glass waterbottle, slips it into the bike’s bottle rack.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Are you trying to get me arrested?

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        We’re blind to that which is right 
                        before our eyes.  Trust me.      

           Bartali finally mounts his bike.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        Since you're here, stay for my 
                        sermon.

                                 BARTALI
                        I wish I had the time, but next 
                        month I'll be in Bologna trying to 
                        win the Giro Dell’Emilia.  I need 
                        to get my training started. 

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        Then a prayer before you go.

           The Cardinal bows his head, about to pray--

                                 BARTALI
                        You don’t have to...It’s very nice 
                        of you...Really.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        God made the bike, surely his help 
                        can’t hurt when riding it. 

                                 BARTALI
                        True, but show me a rider who 
                        believes a race is won by kneeling 
                        instead of peddling and I'll show 
                        you someone who’s never been 
                        Campanissamo. 
                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        When carrying something that could 
                        bring him this much trouble, a man 
                        without faith would do well to take 
                        all the help can get. 

                                 BARTALI
                        I have faith. 

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        Of course...And there’s a crucifix 
                        hanging over your bed to prove it. 
                           (Bartali says nothing)
                        If you truly had faith, the proof 
                        wouldn’t just be hanging on your 
                        wall.  Ride safely, Don Bartali. 

           EXT. GENOA COUNTRYSIDE. VARIOUS

           Bartali coasts past a countryside pocked with grape fields.

           EXT. TUSCAN COUNTRYSIDE. NIGHT

           He rides down a dark road with only the moon to guide him 
           through the gloomy night...  

           Suddenly before him--A BLACKSHIRT CHECKPOINT.  Bartali’s face 
           blanches.  His heart hammers.

           A weasel-faced BLACKSHIRT SOLDIER sits in his TRUCK on the 
           side of the road.  He steps out of the Truck.  Gun drawn...

                                 BLACKSHIRT
                        Your papers.

           Bartali steadies his nerves, hands over his passport.  He 
           glances down at the waterbottle.  The moonlight glints off 
           the papers inside.

                                 BLACKSHIRT
                        You're a long way from Florence 
                        Don...Bartali? 
                           (takes his hat off)
                        Excuse me, sir...These roads are 
                        closed to all traffic after dusk.

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m in training.  It got dark and I 
                        took a wrong turn.

           The Blackshirt returns his passport.

                                 BLACKSHIRT
                        I mean no offense, Don Bartali.
                        But I’m afraid I’ll need to search 
                        your bag.

           Bartali hands his bag over.  The Blackshirt digs through.  
                                 BARTALI
                        A man doing his duty for his 
                        country will never offend me. 

           Bartali clips into his pedals, ready to ride past.

                                 BLACKSHIRT
                        I’m sorry, but this road is closed.  
                        I have orders not to let anyone 
                        pass through here until morning.

                                 BARTALI
                        Then how am I supposed to get home?

           EXT. BLACKSHIRT TRUCK. NIGHT--MOVING

           The Blackshirt drives Bartali through Florence...He looks 
           down at his feet...The Soldier’s rifle on the floor.  The 
           razor-sharp bayonet gleaming in the Moonlight.

           He looks back at his bicycle hanging precariously out of the 
           back seat.  The water bottle shaking in it’s holder.

           EXT. BARTALI’S VILLA. NIGHT

           He signs an autograph for the Soldier.  

                                 BLACKSHIRT
                        Just make it out to Angelo.
                           (Bartali hands it to him)
                        Thank you.

           The Blackshirt drives off.  Bartali leans his bike against 
           the front stoop and his knees buckle--       

           EXT. FLORENCE TRAIN STATION. PLATFORM. NIGHT

           A sea of last-minute TRAVELERS rush aboard a train.  Alfredo 
           leads Sofia across the platform, hands her bags to a VALET.

                                 VALET
                        Ticket?

           Sofia hands him a ticket.  He staples a baggage claim stub on 
           top.  Holds it out for her.

                                 VALET
                        Your bag is cleared all the way to 
                        Geneva, Signora Ferminizzo.

           She stares down at the ticket.  Alfredo steps in, takes it.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Thank you.

           Alfredo turns to Sofia.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Everything is going to be alright.  
                        How often will you write?
                                 SOFIA
                        Everyday.

           She looks at the train, then back at her husband.  Knows she 
           has to go, but just can't bring herself to.

           A CONDUCTOR WALKS past, RINGING a bell--

           Bartali reaches into his coat, slips Sofia her new identity 
           papers.  The train's STEAM WHISTLE blows.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Should I be going with you?  

                                 SOFIA
                        No matter how many times you ask me 
                        my answer won’t change.    

                                 ALFREDO
                        But a year...  

                                 SOFIA
                        It’s not going to be any shorter 
                        for me, but you’re needed here.  

           She leans in, whispers to Alfredo.  

                                 SOFIA
                           (quiet)
                        I’m not the only one.  Remember 
                        that.   

           Alfredo holds on her.  Swallows his emotion.  Sofia turns to 
           Bartali.   

                                 SOFIA
                        Thank you, Gino.  Without you--

           Bartali clears his throat.

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m glad I could help.  

                                 SOFIA
                        Keep him out of trouble.

                                 BARTALI
                        Easier said. 

           Sofia watches PASSENGERS climb onto the train.  She turns 
           back to Alfredo--

                                 SOFIA
                           (stalling)
                        ...My sunflowers.  Remember to 
                        water them twice a week.  And 
                        Luigi’s food is in the shed, if he 
                        runs away put some milk out...

           Alfredo hugs her tight.  Buries his nose in her hair.
                                 ALFREDO
                        I won’t forget.   

           Sofia's eyes hold on Alfredo before she bolts for the train 
           and disappears inside.  The train GRINDS down the tracks...

           INT. TRAIN--MOVING

           Sofia sits in her seats.  She stares out as the train snakes 
           past Alfredo and Bartali.  

           EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM

           Alfredo watches the train chug away...

           When it stops short and with a SQUEAL.  A GROUP OF BLACKSHIRT 
           SOLDIERS run aboard.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Sofia...

           Alfredo takes a quick step to help.  Bartali grabs his arm.

           INSIDE THE TRAIN

           Soldiers storm down the aisle towards Sofia.

           OUT ON THE PLATFORM

           Seconds pass like an eternity...Finally, the Soldiers bully a 
           jittery MAN off the train...

           Another blast of steam and the train lurches, rolls into the 
           tunnel.  Alfredo starts breathing again.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. ALFREDO'S VILLA. BALCONY. NIGHT

           The lights of Florence in the distance, Alfredo holds a worn 
           letter he’s already read a dozen times and memorized...  

                                 ALFREDO
                        She says she slept for a week 
                        straight after she arrived.   

           Bartali empties a bottle of wine into his glass.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        She wants me to remember to feed 
                        Luigi.  You know sometimes I think 
                        she loves that damn cat more than 
                        she does me. 

           LUIGI, the old spotted cat, licks it’s paws, grooming himself 
           on a nearby bench.

                                 BARTALI
                        You can’t blame her, he keeps 
                        himself better groomed than you do.  
           Alfredo lifts the letter to his nose.  Closes his eyes and 
           inhales.  Savoring the faint scent of her perfume. 

                                 BARTALI
                        You could have gone with her. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        I gave you my word.  We have 
                        training.

           Bartali looks at him.  Something stirs behind his eyes and he 
           asks a question he already knows the answer to:      

                                 BARTALI
                        What did Sofia mean when she said 
                        she wasn’t the only one? 

           Alfredo pauses.

                                 ALFREDO
                        There are others we can help.  
                           (whispers)
                        You.  Me.  The bike.   

                                 BARTALI
                        I don’t have time for jokes.  The 
                        Giro Dalla’Emillia’s only a few 
                        months off.

                                 ALFREDO
                        That race is a waste of your time.  
                        You’re a champion, not some 
                        blacksock looking to make his mark.

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m a champion without a sport.  I 
                        need to ride.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        For what?  To win more trophies?  
                        You already have a garage full.

                                 BARTALI
                        I got her out of the country.  You 
                        train me.  That was our deal. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        It’s a far better thing to live one 
                        day as a lion than a hundred years 
                        as a sheep...Did I get that right?  

                                 BARTALI
                        It was a stupid press quote I stole 
                        from Mussolini.  Something for them 
                        to print beneath my picture.     

                                 ALFREDO
                        Maybe so, but tomorrow will bring 
                        another gun Battle in Sicily, 
                        another bombing of the consulate.
                           (quiet)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALFREDO (cont'd)
                        In the middle of this hell, we’ve 
                        got a chance to do some good.  

                                 BARTALI
                        I tried to enlist and they didn’t 
                        want me! 

                                 ALFREDO
                        It’s a blessing.  You can save so 
                        many more lives carrying papers, 
                        then you ever could with a rifle. 

                                 BARTALI
                        And all I have to do is risk my 
                        neck to do it.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        You’ll be risking your life, but 
                        you’ll be saving so many more.  

           Bartali pauses.  His sense of reason fighting what he knows 
           he must do.  Finally, he exhales, looks to Alfredo...

                                 BARTALI
                        You know I can’t.  I’m sorry.

           Bartali steps away, walks off.

           EXT. PONTE VECCHIO. DAY 

           Bartali and Adriana stoll across the bridge.  Bartali’s gaze 
           is distant.  His mind doing laps.

                                 ADRIANA
                        Are you trying to set a record for 
                        most time spent between two people 
                        without uttering a single word?  If 
                        so I think we beat it an hour ago.

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m sorry...I’ve just got some 
                        things on my mind.  

           Adriana stops.  Takes his hands. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        Who cares if the Milan-San Remo was 
                        just cancelled?  You don’t get a 
                        Yellow Jersey for winning that one.

           Bartali looks at her.  A cancelled race couldn’t be further 
           from his mind at the moment... 

                                 BARTALI
                        You’re right.  I don’t know why I 
                        let it get to me.  You’d think I’d 
                        be used to cancelled races by now.

           O.S.--The SCREAMS OF A WOMAN!  Bartali and Adriana turn 
           towards the sound...
           EXT. CITY STREET. DAY

           A JEWISH FAMILY kneels in the middle of the street.  The 
           Barrels of Blackshirt rifles pointed at their backs...

                                 JEWISH FATHER
                        Please, don’t hurt us--

           A SOLDIER brains him with the butt of his rifle. 

           Down the street ITALIAN SOLDIERS corral another group--MEN, 
           WOMEN and CHILDREN--into the back of a MILITARY TRUCK.

                                 BLACKSHIRT SOLDIER
                        All of you, into the truck now!

           All the while on a nearby sidewalk, a pack of ITALIAN MEN 
           stand in a small circle.  Watching.

           Bartali and Adriana arrive at the scene.  Bartali meets the 
           eyes of a GREY LOOKING LADY as she’s bullied into the 
           truck...

           He looks over at the Italian Men on the sidewalk, their hands  *
           in their pockets, and steps up to the BLACKSHIRT DRIVER.

                                 BARTALI
                        What are you doing with these 
                        people?

                                 BLACKSHIRT DRIVER
                        They didn’t pay their housing 
                        taxes.  They’re being arrested. 

                                 BARTALI
                        But there are women and children 
                        here.  How can children be 
                        responsible for housing taxes?    

           The Blackshirt Driver pushes past Bartali, climbs in the 
           truck cab, drives away...  

           Bartali watches the Grey Looking Lady recede into the 
           distance until she’s gone.  He turns back to the Italian Men 
           still standing there, all of them afraid to do a thing...

                                 BARTALI
                        I never thought I’d see the day 
                        Italian men were afraid to stand up 
                        for women and children.  

           A dazed ITALIAN MAN steps forward.

                                 ITALIAN MAN
                        There’s nothing we can do about it.  
                        There’s nothing any of us can do.  

           Bartalis says nothing and moves towards Adriana.  He takes 
           her hand and leads her away...    
                                 BARTALI
                        Let’s get you home.  I have 
                        training to do.  

           EXT. PONTE VECCHIO. DAWN

           Bartali powers over the bridge, begins his ride towards the 
           countryside.  Alfredo rides his vespa alongside him.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Switch to your mid-gear.

           EXT. SANTA CROCE CHURCH. DAY

           Bartali hides his bicycle in an alley next to the thirteenth 
           century church.  Alfredo leads him around back...

           INT. SANTA CROCE CHURCH. DAY

           A few FRIARS light candles near the pew.  Alfredo nods to a 
           passing Nun and moves to the...

           WOODEN CHARITY BOX

           He checks to make sure nobody’s looking, opens the lid and   
           reaches inside.

                                 ALFREDO
                        The Cardinal said it would be in 
                        here.

           Alfredo pulls out a brown envelope, slips it to Bartali. 

           INT. SAN DAMIANO CHURCH. NIGHT

           Carrying his bicycle down the narrow basement stairs, Bartali 
           knocks on a wooden door.  A lock CLANKS--

           Cardinal Dalla Costa opens up.  Ushers Bartali inside.

           INT. THE CELLAR. NIGHT

           A cramped, torch-lit space.  TWO MONKS stamp out false 
           identity papers on a make-shift printing press.  Bartali 
           removes his seat post, fishes into his frame...

           And pulls out the rolled brown envelope.  He hands it to the 
           Cardinal who removes several passport-type photographs of 
           JEWISH MEN and WOMEN...

           MUSIC UP:  A powerful, Barito version of “Libiamo, Libiamo.”

           INT. SAN DAMIANO CHURCH. NIGHT

           The PRINTING PRESSES echo like sledgehammers.  FRIARS and 
           NUNS stamp out passport after passport--
           ONE OF THEM READS: DESTEFANO, NINO

           --An SS OFFICER checks NINO DESTEFANO'S passport in the 
           Catholic section of Rome.  The Officer eyes him, then hands 
           back his credentials and lets him pass.

           GENEVIEVE SCUSSO--CATHOLICA....

           --We see GENEVIEVE SCUSSO, a nervous sixteen year old GIRL 
           boarding a train.

           TWO MORE PASSPORTS ARE STAMPED OUT--GIACOMO, PRIMO.  GIACOMO,  
           MARIA.

           --Bartali trains with Alfredo...Hands the passports to a 
           couple--The GIACOMOS--hiding in a dark attic.

           --The Giacomos hand the passport to an AGENT at the Swiss 
           border.  They're waved through.

           OTHERS--LEVI, CARLA.  LEVI, ENRICO.  LEVI, SUSANA.

           --The Levi family leans against the railing of a passenger 
           ship.  Watching Italy's coast recede into the fog.

           EXT. TUSCAN COUNTRYSIDE. DAY

           Alfredo guns his Vespa.  Bartali cycles next to him, looks 
           over his shoulder, veers sharply off the main road into...

           THE WOODS

           CARDINAL Dalla Costa steps out from behind a tree, rolling 
           out another of Bartali’s bikes.  They trade.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        God is with you, Gino.

                                 BARTALI
                        Then he knows I don't have time for 
                        small talk.  I'm training.  

           Bartali hops on the new bike and pedals off...    

           CARDINAL Dalla Costa rolls Bartali’s old bike behind a tree, 
           removes the saddle, uses a stick to dig into the down tube 
           and pulls out another brown envelope-- 

           THE MAIN ROAD--SECONDS LATER

           Bartali pumps hard, catches up to Alfredo.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Sophia sent me a box of chocolates 
                        yesterday.  I’d forgotten how good--

                                 BARTALI
                        ...How good Swiss chocolate was.  I 
                        know, you told me three times.
                                 ALFREDO
                        Really?  Well did I also tell you 
                        if you keep riding minute and a 
                        half k’s, I’ve got a better shot of 
                        winning the Yellow Jersey than you.
                           (blows his whistle)
                        Double time!  

           Bartali drops a gear, pulls away down the quiet road, 
           reliving some great race in his mind.  The CHEERING of the 
           crowd plays in his head, getting LOUDER and LOUDER and--

                                                  MATCH CUT TO:

           THE FINAL SPRINT OF THE GIRO DELL’EMILLIA.  COPPI RACES AHEAD 
           OF THE PELETON.  THE CROWD SCREAMING FOR HIM...

           He flies over the finish line first.  

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS. NIGHT

           A million stars wink above.  Bartali pumps up a razor sharp 
           catwalk.  He has to push so hard to climb it, he looks like 
           he’s going to fall over his handlebars with every crank of 
           his pedals...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS. NIGHT

           Bartali coasts through a winter’s fog.  He hears an eerie 
           KEENING overhead, looks up...

           A great shadow creeps against the night sky.  A LOW FLYING 
           NAZI PLANE.  Bartali slows, wills it to pass--  

           Its searchlight explodes on.  The chrome frame of Bartali’s 
           bike glows in the blinding, brutal light...

           Bartali weighs down on his pedals.  He drops a gear, drops 
           another, pulls down a hairpin turn...

           But the plane follows above him.  Bartali hits his brakes. 
           Disappears off the side of the road, down an embankment--

           EXT. THE WOODS. SAME

           He threads through the swath of thick trees, the darkness.  
           Careening over a rocky path, fighting to control the bike 
           which bucks like a bull beneath him...

           The plane’s spotlight cuts through the canopy of trees, 
           blinding him--

           His front tire hits a stump.  He catapults ass over head, 
           lands with a SPLASH into a mud puddle.  Rolling off the pain, 
           he looks up...

           The plane is gone, its light fading into the distance.  

           Bartali picks up his bicycle.  The chrome frame’s gleam 
           dampened by the dark mud.  He gets an idea, digs his hand 
           into the mud puddle, scoops up a handful--
           INT. SANTA CROCE CHURCH. NIGHT

           He opens the wooden charity box, puts a rolled brown envelope 
           inside and hurries out of the church--

           Two NUNS stare at him.  He recognizes their faces from some 
           of the passports he delivered to Cardinal Dalla Costa.

           EXT. SANTA CROCE CHURCH. NIGHT

           Bartali pedals through the night.  Alone.  His eyes heavy 
           from exhaustion, legs like rubber...

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

           ANOTHER RACE.  THE TRE VALLI VARESINE.  COPPI SURGES AHEAD OF 
           THE PELETON IN THE ALPS... 

           His legs pump, his torso bops from side to side...There’s 
           nobody even close to catching him...

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY--SUMMER

           Sunflower fields as far as the eye can see paint the world in 
           a warm yellow glow.

           Bartali pedals over the crest of the rolling road.  Adriana 
           sits sideways on his crossbar, again with a huge smile.

                                 ADRIANA
                        C’mon, is that all you got? 

                                 BARTALI
                        You want faster? 

           Adriana nods mischeviously.  Bartali drops a gear, pedals 
           harder and they accelerate like a bullet...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP. NIGHT--A MONTH LATER

           Dead quiet.  Bartali coasts down the far side of a 
           mountain...Above him, the LOW BUZZ of a PLANE--

           It’s searchlight combing the countryside.

           Bartali hits his brakes.  Stands as still as possible...The 
           searchlight beams down on him...

           He shivers, waiting for a bullet to be fired...

           But the plane passes him right by.  His bicycle now covered 
           by a heavy coat of dark, dry mud.  Making him invisible from 
           above...  

                                                  CUT TO:

           COPPI RACING IN THE GIRO DEL VENETO

           He snatches a feed bag from a RACE OFFICIAL while sprinting 
           down a straightaway...
           Fans chase him on all sides, screaming his name.

                                                  CUT TO:

           NEWSPAPER HEADLINE--(Translated) Coppi wins the Giro Del 
           Veneto!

           Winter.  Bartali reads the newspaper by Moonlight on some 
           lonely mountain road.  

           A sharp wind HOWLS over the peak.  Bartali shivers, unzips 
           his cycling jersey and stuffs the newspaper inside.  An old 
           cyclist trick to keep warm...  

           He pushes off, coasts down the mountain. 

           INT. FLORENCE OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT

           On Florence's finest stage, a lavish production of Don 
           Giovanni.  A rotund BARITO belts out Libiamo, Libiamo...

           Bartali watches from the balcony.  BLACKSHIRT OFFICIALS and 
           FASCISTS LEADERS fill the seats around him.

           He looks down to the floor seats.  Focuses in on...

           ADRIANA.  Sitting next to Strazella.  General Rufino and his 
           ARYAN WIFE next to them.   

           INT. OPERA HOUSE. LOBBY

           Bartali makes his way through the empty lobby.  The strains 
           of another aria bleeding though the quiet.  He steps through 
           the men’s room door...

           INT. RESTROOM. LATER

           Warm water runs over his hands in the sink.  In the mirror, 
           he watches a closed bathroom stall...

           The stall door swings open.  A SQUAT MAN steps out, glances 
           at Bartali and waddles into the lobby.  

           Bartali waits a beat and steps into the stall.  He locks the 
           door and fishes around the back of the toilet...

           He pulls out an envelope, stuffs it inside his playbill.

           INT. OPERA HOUSE BALCONY. LATER

           The Barito finishes singing.  A standing ovation THUNDERS 
           through the house.  

           Bartali returns to the balcony just in time to join the 
           applause.  He again casts his eyes down at Adriana standing 
           next to Strazella...  

           And almost as if she feels his eyes on her, she subtly turns 
           her head, eyes up...
           For an instant she meets his gaze...And for that instant, 
           they’re the only two in the whole house... 

           INT. OPERA HOUSE. LOBBY. LATER

           After the show, the Lobby buzzes with people.  Bartali spots 
           Adriana in the crowd.  He moves after her...  

                                 BARTALI
                        Adriana.

           But she doesn’t hear him, ducks inside the Ladies Room.  
           Bartali huffs, waits outside... 

                                 STRAZELLA (O.S.)
                        Gino?

           Bartali turns, pretends to be surprised as Strazella steps 
           out of the crowd towards him. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I thought I saw you.  How did you 
                        like the opera?  

                                 BARTALI
                        I can’t tell you really.  I think I 
                        fell asleep after the third aria.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I’m glad I’m not the only one.  If 
                        I could only get the business done 
                        at the cinema I do here I’d be a 
                        much happier man...So I hear you’ve 
                        been putting in a lot of riding.  
                        How’s the training been going?  

                                 BARTALI
                        Very well thank you for asking.  
                        I’m in the best shape of my life. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Then why aren’t you racing?  I miss 
                        watching you ride.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Let everyone else burn themselves 
                        out in Giros nobody will remember.  
                        When the Tour de France comes 
                        again, my legs will still be fresh.  
                           (Conspiratorially)
                        That’s my secret of how I’m going 
                        to take Paris.      

           Strazella pulls a cigarette from his pocket.  Pats his pants 
           for a lighter.

                                 BARTALI
                        Lighter?    
           Bartali pulls a sterling lighter from his pocket...And the 
           playbill slips out...It drops to the toes of Strazella’s 
           shiny black boots...

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Let me get that for you. 

           By the time Bartali realizes what’s happened, Strazella’s 
           already picked it up.  An envelope sticking out the side. 

           Strazella inspects the envelope in his fingertips.  Bartali’s 
           heart booms in his throat, but he’s cool...  

                                 BARTALI
                        Thank you, Colonel.  

           He takes the envelope and playbill back, slides them into his 
           coat and lights Strazella’s cigarette.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Well, maybe someday we can ride 
                        together and you’ll tell me some 
                        more of your secrets.  
                           (smiles)
                        I don’t think I’ll be much of a 
                        threat to you winning the yellow 
                        jersey again.  

           Strazella laughs loudly.  Then notices they’re standing 
           outside of the Ladies room. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Waiting for someone?  

                                 BARTALI
                        No, I was actually on my way home.

           Strazella looks at Bartali.  Reads him. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        It’s okay...I don’t blame you for 
                        taking a liking to her. 

                                 BARTALI
                           (confused)
                        I’m sorry, I--  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Adriana...I saw you looking at her 
                        during the performance.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Did I?  I don’t remember.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You know the first time I saw her I 
                        felt like I’d met someone I’d known 
                        for years.  But that’s just Adriana 
                        ...And then there are the other 
                        things about her.  More obvious 
                        things.   
                                 BARTALI
                        Well, she is a beautiful woman--

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Yes, she is.  And she’s mine.  If 
                        any man tried to get in-between she 
                        and I, well, I just couldn’t allow 
                        that to happen.      

           Strazella eyes Bartali.  Leans in close.  Deadly serious.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I make a far better friend than I 
                        do an enemy.  You can have any 
                        woman you want, stay away from 
                        Adriana.  Do you understand? 

           Bartali stares back.  Knows the Colonel can never know the 
           truth now.   

                                 BARTALI
                        As you wish, Colonel...Now if 
                        you’ll excuse me I have to be 
                        getting home.  I have training in 
                        the morning.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Then you’d better get your sleep.  
                        Good-night, Gino.

           Bartali nods, walks out of the lobby.  Strazella watches him 
           curiously... 

           EXT. FLORENCE ALLEYWAY. NIGHT

           A BLACKSHIRT SOLDIER leans against a building.  A rifle slung 
           over his shoulder.  He lowers his head to light his 
           cigarette, eyes beneath the brim of his cap...

           Still in his suit, Bartali SWOOSHES right past...His bicycle 
           silent as a whisper.  Dark as a phantom.

           A whip of wind on the Soldier’s face rouses him, but by the 
           time he looks up...Bartali’s gone.

           EXT. SAN DAMIANO CHURCH. NIGHT

           Bartali coasts to the rear of the church, hides his bike 
           beneath it.

           INT. SAN DAMIANO CHURCH. NIGHT

           He walks through the quiet church.  Steps into the...

           CONFESSIONAL BOOTH

           Cardinal Dalla Costa sits on the other side of the mesh 
           window. 

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        You’re late. 
                                 BARTALI
                        If you want someone faster, go find 
                        him.  It’s a miracle I made it over 
                        those catwalks in Arullo at all. 

           Cardinal Dalla Costa removes the screen.  Bartali slides a 
           rolled envelope through the hole.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        With the hour trials coming up I 
                        thought you’d have changed to the 
                        flat roads along the coast.

                                 BARTALI
                        Did you say hour trials?

           EXT. ALFREDO’S VILLA. NIGHT

           Bartali pedals into the yard of a simple villa.

           INT. ALFREDO’S LIVING ROOM

           An OLD ROMANTIC ITALIAN STANDARD spins on the phonograph.  A 
           dozen dusty CYCLING TROPHIES line the wall.

                                 BARTALI
                        Alfredo?

           OLD PHOTOS sit on the coffee table.  Bartali sifts through 
           them.  All photos of Sofia and Alfredo.  

           He then finds a stack of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS...

           (TRANSLATED FROM ITALIAN)

           BINDA FALLS IN CANNES...BINDA’S YELLOW JERSEY HOPES DASHED 
           AGAIN...  THE TOUR DE FRANCE CONTINUES TO EVADE BINDA...  
           BINDA RETIRES FROM COMPETITIVE CYCLING... 

           Alfredo swipes the articles away.  A bottle of Chianti in his 
           other hand.  He’s drunk and morose.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Won’t be long ‘till you catch 
                        yourself a sentimental old bat.  

           Alfredo staggers out the back door...

                                 ALFREDO
                        I was going to tell you.

                                 BARTALI
                        This isn’t the Giro Valli Varesine 
                        or some other one day stage race.  
                        This is the hour record.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        I’m aware of the legacy. 

           Alfredo stumbles outside...
           EXT. BACK YARD

           ...Towards a withered patch of sunflowers.  Bartali follows.

                                 ALFREDO
                        The Sunflower’s died.  I killed 
                        Sofia’s sunflowers.

           He motions to a full bowl of milk by the stoop.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        I put the milk out everyday, but 
                        Luigi hasn’t been home in weeks.  
                        He must have found someone else to 
                        feed him. 

                                 BARTALI
                        You’ve had enough.   

           Bartali reaches for the bottle.  It slips, shatters on the 
           walk.  Alfredo just stares at the broken glass. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        The Swiss closed their borders 
                        today.  The trains are now only 
                        running North as far as Milan. 

                                 BARTALI
                        But I have a family waiting to 
                        leave tonight for Zurich.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Then they’ve got some walk ahead of 
                        them.

           Alfredo bends.  Picking up the pieces of glass.

                                 ALFREDO
                        This time we’ve been apart, I’ve 
                        always known if something were to 
                        happen to her, I could get to her.  
                        But now...

           He stops talking.  Can’t.  One more word and he’ll crack.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        It was her idea that I stay behind 
                        to help...Tell me what kind of man 
                        agrees to such a thing.

                                 BARTALI
                        A man who has no other choice. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Do you know this morning I had to 
                        look at her picture because I 
                        couldn’t remember what her hands 
                        looked like?  She’s always had the 
                        most beautiful hands...All I want 
                        to do is hold my wife’s hand again.
           Bartali puts his hand on Alfredo’s shoulder.  Understands 
           something he never could had this war never happened.

                                 BARTALI
                        We’ll take a train to Milan.  I 
                        know a pass through the Dolomites 
                        that’ll have us to Switzerland in 
                        three days time.   

                                 ALFREDO
                        I’ll never make it over those 
                        peaks.  Not with my knees, not in 
                        this cold. 

                                 BARTALI
                        Then Hitler’s just turned you into 
                        a prisoner inside your own country.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You’re one, too.  Same as me.  

           The realization blind-sides Bartali.  It takes him a second 
           to gather himself--  

                                 BARTALI
                        There has to be something I can do.  

           Alfredo eyes him.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        There is.  Let’s see how those 
                        wings of yours are doing.

           EXT. VIGORELLI VELODROME. MILAN-DAY

           NINE-THOUSAND RACE FANS watch as FRENCH RIDERS whip around 
           the thousand meter track.  A huge oval of rich polished wood.   

           TITLE CARD:  1942 HOUR TRIALS

           James Ligget stands next to the track, broadcasting. 

                                 JAMES LIGGET
                        And Lacoque, Dupleix and Viren are 
                        closing in on Archambaud’s mark of 
                        45.798 k in an hour, but with only 
                        a minute remaining they won’t be 
                        able to break it...Ending up with 
                        just over forty-k for the hour...

           INT.  LOCKER ROOM

           A DOZEN RIDERS dress for their ride.  Coppi pees in the 
           urinal.  Bartali steps to the urinal next to him.

                                 BARTALI
                        Rumor has it you’ve joined the 
                        military?
                                 COPPI
                        The Infantry. 

                                 BARTALI
                        Infantry?  I heard you were 
                        patrolling the railway stations.  
                        Must see a lot of action when the 
                        four-fifteen returns all those 
                        school children from Empoli.     

                                 COPPI
                        At least I’m not hiding behind my 
                        name to keep me out of the war. 

           Coppi steps away.  Bartali moves after him, but Alfredo 
           intercepts--  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Save it for the race.    

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        And now the Italians take the 
                        track...

           EXT. THE VELODROME TRACK

           TORELLI, an Italian cyclist, takes his place at the starting 
           gate.  A minute later, Bartali rolls next to him.

           A TALL MAN calls to Bartali from the crowd:

                                 TALL MAN
                        You’ve got this, Gino!  This is 
                        your race.

           And a CHEERING GROUP OF FANS jump to their feet behind him.  
           Screaming for Bartali.  

           A HOOK NOSED MAN in the crowd stands.  Grabs his chest, fakes 
           a heart attack.

                                 HOOK NOSED MAN 
                        Wait!  Somebody call a medic.  
                        Bartali’s bad heart might give out 
                        during the race!  

           Coppi lines up in third position.  And it seems like everyone 
           in the place is on their feet.  The crowd couldn’t be louder.  

           A TIME JUDGE steps onto his podium. 

                                 TIME JUDGE
                        Racers take your ready.

           Bartali clips in.  Coppi clears his mind and waits...Finally, 
           the Judge FIRES the pistol--And they’re off!  

           Coppi jumps to the early lead.  Torelli drafts behind him.  
           Bartali rounds in third.
                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        Coppi pulls away early...Riding 
                        like a man possessed...

           MONTAGE:  THE HOUR TRIAL

           --Coppi races a half lap ahead of Bartali and Torelli.  Whips 
           past a bandstand of SCREAMING FANS--

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        And eleven minutes into this race, 
                        Coppi leads Bartali and Torelli by 
                        almost a full-k...I don’t know how 
                        Coppi’s going to keep this pace for 
                        an entire hour--

           --Bartali fixes on Torelli before him.  Drowns out the 
           screaming of the fans...

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        Bartali’s gunning!

           Bartali’s got Coppi in sight.  He cuts the distance, quickly 
           overtakes--

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        And Bartali’s caught Coppi!

                                                  CUT TO:

           COPPI--SURGES AHEAD.  BARTALI FALLS BACK.

           TITLE CARD:  30 minutes, 18 seconds.  Distance: 22.946k. 

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        At the half-way mark Coppi’s pulled 
                        within a hundred meters of 
                        Archambaud’s record pace.

           Suddenly, Coppi’s peddling slows.  Bartali overtakes him.  
           Coppi recedes in his wake--

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        And Coppi’s hit the wall!

           TITLE CARD: 47m 22s--35.42k.

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        While Bartali’s ahead of pace.

           Bartali rips past Alfredo as the coach clicks his stop watch.

                                 ALFREDO
                           (to himself)
                        Too fast, Gino.

           SEVERAL LAPS LATER--Bartali barnstorms the track...As Coppi 
           emerges behind him...

           Sailing on his second wind, gaining track.  He passes Bartali 
           who cuts in line behind him--  
                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        They’ve completed almost a hundred 
                        and fifteen laps, forty-five k in 
                        fifty-nine and one half minutes.  
                        It’s possible the hour record will 
                        be toppled by either of them.   

           But Coppi’s legs are younger.  He breaks away.  Bartali 
           struggles to catch him, digging deep for the speed, but--

           Coppi streaks down the final stretch... 

           Past a JUDGE WAVING A CHECKERED FLAG.  Bartali rolls across 
           the line a few seconds later...

           The TIME JUDGES confer...One of them nods in disbelief and 
           the CROWD jumps to its feet.    

                                 JAMES LIGGET
                        And Fausto Coppi has just become 
                        only the fifth man ever to set a 
                        new hour time record with 45.871 K.  
                        Besting Archambaud’s record by only 
                        thirty-one meters!

           Alfredo walks to Bartali and helps him off his bike.   

                                 ALFREDO
                        He’s still a fraud.

           Bartali looks around the velodrome, the screams--”Coppi 
           Coppi”--strip him of any possible doubt...  

                                 BARTALI
                        No...He’s their Campanissimo.

           We slowly move into Bartali’s eyes.  See Coppi’s reflection 
           as he’s swept up into the crowd.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

           ANOTHER PAIR OF EYES

           In these the reflection of a large fire.

           REVERSE--A VILLA ENGULFED IN FLAMES

           Is the only light on the otherwise dark hillside.  Strazella 
           stares at the burning villa, throws his torch through a 
           window with a CRASH!

           An out-of-breath SOLDIER runs up to him. 

                                 SOLDIER
                        There’s no sign of the woman or her 
                        father.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Keep searching.  They can’t have 
                        gotten far.
           Strazella begins searching the dark night with a lantern, 
           when he hears a throaty COUGH...

           He follows the sound, to the backside of a tree.  He finds an 
           ELDERLY MAN cowering behind.  Shivering from the cold. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Are you the Jew Guido Falche, 
                        father of Carianna?  

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        No, sir.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Then why are you hiding?  

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        I was walking home from supper with 
                        my nephew...I saw the flames and 
                        became disoriented--

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Identity papers.

           The Elderly Man searches his pockets.  Comes up empty.

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        I don’t have them.  I was just 
                        going over the hill.  

           Strazella shakes a crude NEWSPAPER in his fist.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You’re one of the Jews circulating 
                        this anti-Mussolini paper...

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        I’m an old man.  I can barely walk, 
                        let alone hand out a newspaper.

           Strazella pulls a photo out of his pocket.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Tell me who this woman is.

           The Elderly Man looks at the photo. 

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        I’ve never seen her. 

           Strazella holds on him, waiting for him to crack...

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Go home before you freeze to death.

           Strazella begins to walk away--

           CLICK!  CLICK!  Behind him...
           He spins.  The Elderly Man stands behind him, shaking the 
           jammed pistol in his hand.   

           Strazella draws.  Puts three shots in him.

           The Elderly Man drops his gun.  Crashes to the ground. 

           Strazella looks down at the smoking pistol in his hand.  Then 
           his empty eyes drop to the dead man laying before him...  

           He turns on his heel, walks towards a WAITING TRUCK and 
           reaches for the door--

           INT. ADRIANA’S VILLA. NIGHT

           Adriana opens the door of her dark kitchen.  She clicks on a 
           table lamp and sets down a bag of groceries--

           BANG!  The SIDE DOOR CLANKS in an unsteady breeze.  She walks 
           over, shuts it--

           And GASPS...A battered woman slumps in the chair across the 
           room.  Her face covered in soot, her clothes shredded.    

                                 ADRIANA
                        Carianna...

           We’ll recognize CARIANNA as the Jewish Woman Adriana was 
           walking with the first time she met Bartali.    

                                 CARIANNA
                        They burned everything. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        Where’s your papa?

           Carianna can’t even say it.  Adriana hugs her close.  

                                 CARIANNA
                        What’s this world come to when 
                        printing a newspaper can get you 
                        killed?
                           (silence)
                        It’s time, Adriana.  I’ve heard of 
                        a Cardinal who can help us.  I just 
                        need the papers.

           INT. RECORDS OFFICE. DAY  

           A heavyset woman, ROSA, sits behind her desk.  Adriana walks 
           through the door.   

                                 ADRIANA
                        Excuse me, Rosa.  

           Rosa looks up from her typewriter. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        Colonel Strazella needs a military 
                        ID for one of his soldiers. 
                                 ROSA
                        Give me his name and I’ll have it 
                        to you by the end of the week.

                                 ADRIANA
                        The Colonel said he needs it 
                        immediately.  If it’s easier I can 
                        fill it out myself.

           Rosa holds on her for a second, then rolls to her file 
           cabinet, removes a BLANK MILITARY ID.  She opens a HUGE 
           ACCOUNTING BOOK.  Notes the ID number. 

           She hands the blank document to Adriana. 

                                 ROSA
                        You need to fill out the receipts 
                        in triplicate and return all copies 
                        to this office. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        In triplicate?

                                 ROSA
                        It’s new policy from Berlin to 
                        reduce fraud.   

           Adriana looks at the paper in her hand.  Considers handing it 
           back and making up some excuse about a mistake...

                                 ADRIANA
                        I’ll have the receipts to you by 
                        the end of the day. 

                                                  CUT TO:

           THE BLANK MILITARY ID BEING FED INTO A TYPEWRITER

           Adriana shifts the carriage left.  Lines up the ribbon over 
           the BLANK BOX next to NOME (NAME)...

           She looks over her shoulder.  Through Strazella’s office 
           door...Strazella sits at his desk, talking on the phone.

           Adriana reaches into her purse.  Pulls out a folded page of 
           NEWSPAPER.  AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE:(TRANSLATED) OBITUARIES

           She runs her finger down the columns.  Stops on a dead 
           woman’s name:  Marianna Magnani.  She returns to the 
           typewriter, her fingers poised over the typewriter keys...

           She begins to type.  The carriage HAMMERING out the letters--

           INT. SANTA CROCE CHURCH. DAY

           Alfredo looks around the church, making sure he’s not being 
           watched.  He opens the wooden donation’s box, pulls an 
           envelope and tucks it beneath his coat--
           EXT. SANTA CROCE CHURCH. DAY

           Alfredo crosses himself and meets Bartali by...

           THE MARKET IN DANTE’S SQUARE

           Alfredo reaches into his coat--  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Here are the papers.

                                 BARTALI
                        I told you, not here.

           They pass a CROWD gathered around a NEWS VENDOR.  A daze of 
           shock on all of their faces.  Bartali buys a newspaper...

           A picture of Coppi on the front page.  Beneath it, a 
           headline: (TRANSLATED) Coppi--Prisoner of War in Tunisia!

           Bartali reads, his face piqued with emotion.

                                 BARTALI
                        I want to be Campanissimo again, 
                        but not like this.  

           Alfredo looks at him.  Knows there’s nothing he can say.

           EXT. SAN DAMIANO CHURCH. NIGHT

           Bartali and Alfredo ride to the side of the church.  Hides 
           his bicycle in a patch of bushes.  Alfredo parks his Vespa 
           next to it, lights up a cigarette...

           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT. NIGHT

           Cardinal Dalla Costa sits at his desk, carefully affixing an 
           official seal on a fake passport.  Bartali sits across.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        A family we provided papers for was 
                        just caught trying to board a train 
                        for Milan.  With the Nazi’s 
                        patrolling the rail stations, the 
                        trains are no longer safe for us to 
                        use.  

                                 BARTALI
                        So much for Mussolini’s promises.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        Which means we need to be ever more 
                        vigilant of our own.  

           Dalla Costa removes his glasses, stands. 

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        Come with me, Gino. 
           INT. BASEMENT PANTRY. NIGHT

           Bartali and the CARDINAL walk into a small pantry, open a 
           side door into an even smaller room where...

           Adriana huddles with Carianna, her Jewish friend.  A packed 
           suitcase by her leg.   

           For a second there’s a stunned, shocked silence.  Finally, 
           Bartali turns to the Cardinal, confused... 

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        These woman need your help.

           Adriana steps closer.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        You could have told me this was why 
                        your training was so important. 

                                 BARTALI
                        I didn’t know how.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        There’s a warrant for my friend’s 
                        arrest.  If she doesn’t get into 
                        Switzerland she’s as good as dead.    

           Bartali looks at Adriana.  Then, Carianna.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Do you have papers?  

           Carianna hands Bartali the MILITARY ID.  He opens it.  A 
           PHOTO OF CARIANNA next to the name:  MARIANNA MAGNANI.

                                 BARTALI
                        These are military papers.

                                 ADRIANA
                        Now you know why my job was so 
                        important to me.  

           Bartali digests.

                                 BARTALI
                           (to the Cardinal)
                        But you said we couldn’t use the 
                        trains.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        We can’t...How well do you know the 
                        roads from Lake Como to the Alps?  

                                 BARTALI
                        Well enough.  

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        Are you ready to move something 
                        much more dangerous than papers?  
           Bartali looks at Carianna.  At Adriana.  Nods without moving 
           his head. 

                                 BARTALI
                        I am. 

           The Cardinal removes the crucifix hanging around his neck, 
           blesses it with a kiss and loops it over Bartali's head.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        Then this will keep you safe while 
                        you do.

           EXT. NOCETA. NIGHT

           A MAN drives a truck off the main road.  Pulls into the 
           woods...

           He opens a secret compartment beneath the truck bed.  It’s 
           been converted into a small crawl space.  Carianna climbs 
           out.  Bartali follows.  

           EXT. FOREST OUTSIDE NOCETA. NIGHT

           Northern Italy.  Bartali leads Carianna through snow covered 
           shrub.  They come upon...

           A DARK, ICY ROAD

           In the distance, the GRINDING GEARS of a truck. 

                                 BARTALI
                        Down!

           They duck behind a fallen tree...A BLACKSHIRT TRUCK rolls 
           past...A DOG sits inside.  His ears prick up and he inside 
           begins BARKING...  

           The truck slows.  A SOLDIER sits in the front seat.  His eyes 
           sweep the forest--  

           BEHIND THE FALLEN TREE--Bartali hunkers down next to 
           Carianna.  His hand held firmly over her mouth.  Both of them 
           holding their breath...

           A SOLDIER creeps towards them, leading with his rifle...One 
           more step and they’ll be exposed--

           A FLOCK OF CROWS thunder from a nearby bush.  The Soldier 
           stops.  Returns to his truck.

                                 SOLDIER
                        It was just some birds.  

           EXT. FOREST WALK--NIGHT

           Moving quickly now, Bartali leads her through thick 
           shrubbery, knee deep snow...
                                 BARTALI
                        It’s not much further.

           EXT. LAKE COMO--NIGHT

           A canopy of stars reflect in the endless frozen lake.   The 
           Alps white peaks rise to the North...  

                                 BARTALI
                        This is as far as I go.  Follow the 
                        shoreline, it will lead you to a 
                        valley through the Alps... 

           Carianna shivers from the cold.  Bartali removes his scarf.  
           Wraps it around her neck.

                                 BARTALI
                        Move fast and if you run into a 
                        trouble just say you’re going to 
                        visit your sister in Zurich.  

           Bartali is struck by the look on her face.  

                                 CARIANNA
                        Thank you, Gino.

                                 BARTALI
                        Go!  

           She hurries towards the Alps.  Bartali walks in the other 
           direction...

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY

           Bartali emerges from the woods, onto the road...He sees the 
           truck that dropped him off idling in a nearby clearing...

           He runs towards the truck, opens the passenger door--

           And notices the windshield has been shattered by bullet 
           holes...The Driver lays dead and bloody in the cab.

           BEHIND HIM--MACHINE GUN FIRE ERUPTS...

           Bartali's feet turn to cement.  Nazi Soldiers charge towards 
           him...

           Bullets BURN past his head.  He darts off into the thick 
           woods.  The Soldiers release the snarling GERMAN SHEPHERDS 
           from their truck--

           EXT. DEEPER IN THE WOODS

           Through the thorny bushes, Bartali moves quickly.  The sharp 
           thorns slash his face and hands...The BARKING dogs on his 
           heels...He reaches the banks of...

           A WILD, WHITE-CAPPED RIVER.  He turns just as--
           A Dog leaps.  Snarling fangs snap at him...Tear at his 
           forearm.  He beats the dog off...Jumps into the river--

           BENEATH THE RUSHING WATER

           The air is pounded from his lungs.  He's tossed, spun. 
           Powerless against the rapids.  Finally, he surfaces--

           Gasping...The river continues to thrash him--

           BANG!  He crashes headlong into a rock.  Chokes down water...

           And grabs hold of a fallen tree.  He fights the water, drags 
           himself towards the river bank and collapses in the frozen 
           mud.  His right forearm shredded by deep bite marks...

           EXT. SNOWY COUNTRYSIDE. AFTERNOON

           A PILLAGED VILLA sits in the middle of the countryside.

           INT. PILLAGED VILLA

           Snow falls through a torn away section of roof.  Adriana 
           makes a fire in the hearth when--

           A loud THUMP at the door startles her.  Bartali stumbles 
           through, shivering and wet.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        Gino?  I’ve been waiting for hours.   
                        I’ve been so worried--

           He collapses in her arms.  Shivering uncontrollably.  She 
           sees his shredded forearm.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        We need to get you to a doctor. 

                                 BARTALI
                        No.  This is the only place we’re 
                        safe right now.

           Adriana wraps him in a blanket, rocking him back to warmth. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        Carianna?

                                 BARTALI
                        She’ll be in Switzerland by 
                        morning.

           Adriana swells in relief, whispers in his ear...

                                 ADRIANA
                        Thank you, Gino.

           INT. SAFE HOUSE. SITTING ROOM.  LATER
           A fire crackles in the sitting room hearth.  Adriana prepares 
           a bandage on her lap.  Bartali lays next to her, bundled up 
           on the couch beneath several blankets.  

                                 BARTALI
                        They raided this village on 
                        Christmas and sent the families to 
                        the work camp in Fermenzo.  It 
                        doesn’t look like much, but it’s 
                        our best safe house.

                                 ADRIANA
                        Do you think they recognized you?  

                                 BARTALI
                        I don’t think so.  But I’ll stay 
                        the night just to be sure.      

           Adriana pulls Bartali’s bloody sleeve up.  His forearm 
           shredded by bite wounds.  She cleans with alcohol. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        You don’t want this getting 
                        infected. 

           Bartali grimaces as Adriana wraps his forearm in a bandage.

                                 ADRIANA
                        What if one of those bullets had 
                        hit their mark, Gino?  

                                 BARTALI
                        But they didn’t.

                                 ADRIANA
                        No...Not this time. 

                                 BARTALI
                        Tell me what choice I have. 

           Adriana calms, speaks softly...   

                                 ADRIANA
                        Have you ever been afraid of 
                        anything in your life?  

                                 BARTALI
                        Being afraid and admitting it are 
                        quite different things.

                                 ADRIANA
                        Then tell me what scares you?    

           Bartali pauses, as if voicing this will somehow make it real.

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m afraid that by the time this 
                        war ends, they’ll all have 
                        forgotten my name. 
                                 ADRIANA
                        I’m not asking about the champion.  
                        Tell me what scares you?  

           He says nothing.  Then... 

                                 BARTALI
                        You do. 

           And at this moment, both of them are so vulnerable.  Adriana 
           takes his hand, places it on her neck. 

           His fingers caress her neck and shoulders.  Lost in the 
           softness of her skin, he kisses her...

           EXT. STATE BUILDING. MORNING

           Bartali helps Adriana off his handlebars.  She stands before 
           him for a quiet beat.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        There should be more men like you.    

                                 BARTALI
                        I just ride a bicycle.   

           She steps away just as--A SEDAN drives around the bend, parks 
           next to the building.  Adriana steps back from Bartali.

           Strazella climbs out of the car.  Surprised to see Adriana, 
           but even more surprised to see Bartali. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        To what do I owe the honor, 
                        Campanissimo?   

                                 BARTALI
                        I was out riding and ran into your 
                        secretary along Ponte Vecchio.

           Strazella looks down his nose at Adriana, doing the math in 
           his head...

                                 BARTALI
                        Mussolini is doing his best, but 
                        these streets are no longer safe 
                        for a lady to walk alone. 

           Strazella hides any suspicions behind an easy smile.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You’re a gentleman as well as a 
                        champion.  Since you’re here could 
                        I get your opinion on something?  

                                 BARTALI
                        Of course.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Excuse us, Adriana.
           Strazella ushers Bartali to walk before him, down...

           A DARK ALLEYWAY

           They move towards a garage door at the end. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        It’s just down here.

           Bartali rolls his bike alongside.  The way he walks, watching 
           Strazella’s shadow following him down the alley, it’s as if 
           he’s just waiting to be shot in the back--

           Strazella motions to a dark door.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Through that door.  

           Bartali takes a breath, steps into--

           A CAVERNOUS GARAGE  

           A dark and dank box.  A few old military trucks in the 
           middle.  

           Bartali closes his eyes.  Sure there’s only one reason the 
           Colonel would take him in here...

                                 BARTALI
                        If you’re looking for someone to 
                        fix these trucks, I have to tell 
                        you I’m an ace with pedals and 
                        gears, but when it comes to motors 
                        I’m lost.  

           Strazella smiles, goes into the corner, removes a white 
           sheet, revealing an old BARTALI three-speed bicycle.    

                                 BARTALI
                        I didn’t know they still made 
                        these.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        They don’t.  I picked it up at a 
                        pawn broker.  Just like yours, no? 

                                 BARTALI
                        Very much so.  May I have a look?

           Bartali leans his bike against the truck.  Bends over 
           Strazella’s bike, inspecting it.  He reaches down, spins the 
           pedals with his hand...  

           Strazella stands above him.  Staring down at Bartali’s back 
           with dead eyes.

                                 BARTALI
                        Looks like all the mechanics are in 
                        order, everything looks clean.
                                 STRAZELLA
                        Which is more than I can say for 
                        your’s.  Did you ride it through 
                        the swamp?

           Bartali looks at his own bike.  It’s caked in dried mud.  

                                 BARTALI
                        I just came back from training 
                        above Ponte Ema.  A little rain and 
                        those backroads turn to soup.  

           Strazella shoots a lightning quick glance at Bartali’s socks.  
           His shoes.  Both of them clean, not a speck of mud.    

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Maybe now that I have a bike we can 
                        finally do some riding together. 

                                 BARTALI
                        I look forward to it.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I actually have some free time 
                        tomorrow, what do you say?   

           EXT. FLORENCE COUNTRYSIDE. DAY

           Strazella rides his bicycle through the countryside.  Bartali 
           pedals alongside him.

                                 BARTALI
                        We can rest if you like.

           Strazella huffs like he’s about to keel over in the cruel 
           heat.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I’m barely breaking a sweat.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Shift to your high gear.

           Strazella clicks the gear.  His pedals spin easily now.  

           EXT. SIDE OF MOUNTAIN ROAD--LATER

           Under a canopy of trees just below the peak, Bartali 
           stretches.  Strazella struggles to catch his breath.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I thought I’d be stronger.  

                                 BARTALI
                        You’re doing fine.    

                                 STRAZELLA
                        My legs are even older than yours, 
                        don’t forget.  

           Strazella eyes the heavy bandage on Bartali’s forearm.  
                                 STRAZELLA
                        Looks like a good one.

                                 BARTALI
                        Ride as fast as I do and sometimes 
                        you fall off...
                           (grabs his bicycle)
                        Now, let’s get going before our 
                        muscles tighten up.    

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP. DAY

           The hot sun beats.  Bartali and Strazella crest a long climb.  
           Strazella douses his face with a water-bottle.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Steep as these hills are it doesn’t 
                        surprise me you’re the only one my 
                        men ever report seeing here.     

                                 BARTALI
                        I suppose I’m the only one fool 
                        enough to climb hills like this for 
                        fun.      

                                 STRAZELLA
                        For fun?  I think it’s time you 
                        level with me.

                                 BARTALI
                        What about?  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You don’t just ride here for fun.  
                        Something tells me this climb is 
                        one of your secrets...   

           Strazella tests him with his stare.  Bartali shifts 
           uncomfortably in his saddle.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        ...Your training secrets, 
                        Campanissimo.  These hills will 
                        have you in some shape when the 
                        next tour comes around.   

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m afraid you’ve got me...Truth be 
                        told I don’t ride for fun, I ride 
                        to win. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I’ve gotten reports that the Jews 
                        have been using this road to get 
                        over the Dolomites.  I don’t 
                        suppose you’ve seen anything on any 
                        of your rides.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Nothing I can think of, but I’ll be 
                        sure to keep an eye out.  
           Strazella hands back his waterbottle. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You’d be doing a great service for 
                        your country.

                                 BARTALI
                        There would be no greater honor.  
                           (stands out of his saddle)
                        Now, let’s see how well you keep up 
                        on the sprints.  If you want to 
                        ride for Legano I need to know you 
                        can burn down the stretch.

           Bartali races off.  Strazella spins his legs furiously, but 
           just falls further and further back in Bartali’s wake--

           AROUND THE BEND--SECONDS LATER--A BLACKSHIRT CHECK POINT

           Two BLACKSHIRT SOLDIERS stand astride the road with guns 
           drawn.  Strazella watches Bartali approach the Soldiers...

           Who recognize him and wave their hats like overheated fans.  
           Bartali passes without even breaking his pace...

           And Strazella’s eyes shrink into suspicious slits.

           EXT. BARTALI’S BALCONY. DAWN

           Bartali steps out onto his balcony, sipping a cup of coffee.  
           He breathes in the morning air, notices--

           A MILITARY TRUCK parked just off the road, hidden in the 
           woods... 

           EXT. BARTALI’S VILLA. LATER

           Bartali pedals out of his driveway, coasts down... 

           THE HILLSIDE

           He whips around a sharp bend.  The same MILITARY TRUCK pulls 
           from out of nowhere.  Bartali turns down a narrow road...

           The truck follows.  Barreling down the road at his exact 
           speed.

           Bartali takes another left...He looks over his shoulder, the 
           truck’s fifty meters back--

           He squeezes his brakes, veers to the road side and pulls out 
           his water bottle...

           The truck RUMBLES past, kicking up a dust storm...

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
           TWO SPARROWS SWOOP PAST A HUGE CROWD GATHERED OUTSIDE THE 
           STATE HOUSE IN FLORENCE.  IT’S EARLY SPRING.

           Bartali and Alfredo stand in the crowd, looking on as...

           An OVRA GENERAL speaks on a microphone from the STATE HOUSE 
           STAIRS.

                                 OVRA GENERAL
                        ...And for serving our country in 
                        her hour of need, I am proud to 
                        present the Medal of Valor to 
                        Fausto Coppi. 

           Coppi climbs on stage next to the General.  The General pins 
           the medal on Coppi’s military coat and salutes him.  The 
           crowd CHEERS, APPLAUDS WILDLY.

           Bartali seems to melt.  

                                 BARTALI
                        I’ve seen enough. 

           He’s pushes his way out of the crowd.  Alfredo chases him.  

                                 BARTALI
                        He sat in a Tunisian jail cell for 
                        three months and they’re acting as 
                        if he won the war himself.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Let him play the war hero and get a 
                        medal on his chest.  With the 
                        charity you do, the reward is in 
                        your heart.

           Bartali looks across the square, a BLACKSHIRT SOLDIER smokes 
           a cigarette.  Bartali notices him glance towards them.  He 
           takes Alfredo by the arm, leads him down a quiet avenue.  

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m proud of what we’ve done, but 
                        my charitable heart is leaving me 
                        with an empty stomach.  The Milan-
                        San Remo’s been announced for April 
                        and I’m entering it.    

                                 ALFREDO
                        It’s propaganda.  Mussolini wants 
                        us occupied with something besides 
                        the war during the election year.

                                 BARTALI
                        Propaganda or not it’s the first 
                        real race in a year.  And there’s 
                        fifty thousand lire to the winner.   

           Bartali notices another Blackshirt Soldier lingering across 
           the square.  He drags Alfredo around a corner and into a dark 
           alley...
                                 ALFREDO
                        What’s wrong with you today?

                                 BARTALI
                        For the last week there seems to be 
                        Blackshirts everywhere I go.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Quit being paranoid, Gino.  It 
                        doesn’t suit you.  

           Bartali hushes Alfredo.  The Blackshirt Soldier rushes past 
           the alley.

                                 BARTALI
                        Still think I’m seeing ghosts.

                                 ALFREDO
                        But who?

                                 BARTALI
                        The Colonel most likely. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Then it would seem you have bigger 
                        things to worry about than a race.

                                 BARTALI
                        I haven’t raced in over a year.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        There hasn’t been a race worth your 
                        time.  

                                 BARTALI
                        But I need money.  If we win you 
                        could send Sofia something--

                                 ALFREDO
                        My wife is well taken care of.  And 
                        you and I...We’re surviving.     

                                 BARTALI
                        You call this surviving?  I’m the 
                        Campanissimo.  Or have you 
                        forgotten that, too?

                                 ALFREDO
                        Of course I haven’t.

                                 BARTALI
                        When this war started they’d write 
                        I was getting too old to win.  Now 
                        they don’t write about me at all.  
                        While Coppi’s name has been printed 
                        more times than Mussolini’s.  

           Alfredo’s silenced.      
                                 BARTALI
                        I just need to know I can still 
                        beat him.                 

           EXT. PESCIA. DAY

           Halfway through the race.  Crowds CHEER from a wartorn city 
           street.  The peleton streams past like an endless snake...

           TITLE CARD:  MILAN-SAN REMO.   1943

           Coppi rides in the middle...Bartali fights for position near 
           the rear...

           EXT. GENOA COUNTRYSIDE. LATER

           They speed through the countryside.  Coppi cuts through the 
           peleton like they're standing still.

           WE FALL BACK SEVERAL RIDERS--Bartali sees Coppi disappear 
           over the hill and strikes...Darting past a dozen riders...

           EXT. STEEP CLIMB. DAY

           Bartali closes the distance fast.  Matches revolutions with 
           Coppi for a stretch, then drops a gear and pulls past--

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD. DAY

           Bartali leads the climb to the rocky peak of Mount Osaro...

           But Coppi's legs carry him faster.  He overtakes and leaves 
           Bartali in the dust...

           Bartali weighs down on his pedals, cuts back ahead of Coppi.

           EXT. PEAK OF MOUNT OSARO

           Bartali fights to control his breathing.  The mountain peak 
           in his sights, when--

           A MOTORCADE OF MILITARY TRUCKS full of BLACKSHIRT SOLDIERS 
           roars past and back down towards Genoa...

           Bartali’s eyes follow into the valley below...To the 
           cobblestone San Damiano Church in the village...

           And something overcomes him...He grabs his thigh, feigns a 
           cramp and pulls off the road. Coppi stares him down as he 
           whips past...

           The peleton WHOOSHES by, A MEDICAL truck stops. 

                                 BARTALI
                        It's just a cramp. 

                                 RACE DOCTOR
                        You need water.

           Bartali holds up his water bottle.  
                                 BARTALI
                        I’m fine.  Go!

           The Doctor jumps back in the truck.  Bartali watches the last 
           of the RACE VEHICLES disappear over the crest...

           The dust settles around him and he pops to his feet--

           EXT. ROAD TOWARDS GENOA

           The Blackshirt convoy rolls on.  

           A FEW HUNDRED METERS BACK--Bartali screams down the 
           hill...The motorcade in his sights.  He cuts off the road, 
           onto a hellish dirt road short-cut... 

           EXT. VILLAGE OF GENOA

           Bartali barrels out of the mountains.  Blazes through the 
           town's medieval gateway.  Cuts down an alley--

           A second later, the motorcade speeds through town--

           EXT. SAN DAMIANO CHURCH--A MINUTE LATER

           Bartali hides his bicycle behind the church.

           INT. SAN DAMIANO CHURCH CELLAR

           A group of JEWS huddle as Cardinal Dalla Costa ladles soup 
           into their empty bowls-- 

           Bartali bursts into the room.

                                 BARTALI
                        They’re coming. 

           EXT. CHURCH--A MINUTE LATER

           The Soldiers pull up.  Storm inside...

           INT. CHURCH

           ...Interrupting a solemn mass.  PARTISANS fill the pews.  
           Cardinal Dalla Costa stops in the middle of his sermon--

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        May I help you? 

           The CAPTAIN leads his men through the church and down the 
           stairs.  He kicks the wooden door open, rushes into...

           THE CELLAR

           Just spiderwebs and a few old desks.  Any sign of the hidden 
           Jews is gone.  
           EXT. FRONT YARD--MINUTES LATER

           The Blackshirt trucks drive off...

           We drift back to the woods beyond the church...Bartali hides 
           in the thick brush.  The refugee Jews hiding next to him.

           He’s begins to concentrate on his breath.  He’s just made a 
           sacrifice he never thought he was capable of...

           EXT. SAN REMO--FINISH LINE. NIGHT

           Everyone left hours ago.  It’s graveyard quiet. 

           Bartali finally rolls past the finish line.  CITY WORKERS 
           clean the confetti that litters the street.  

           Bartali looks to the LEADER’S BOARD.  COPPI’S nameplate sits 
           in the winner’s box.  It’s like a punch in Bartali’s gut.  

                                 ALFREDO (O.S.)
                        I don’t think this will be your 
                        best finish.  

           Alfredo leans against the winner’s podium.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Did you hear the news?  

                                 BARTALI
                        Not now, old man.

                                 ALFREDO
                        A convoy was headed towards a 
                        church suspected of housing refugee 
                        Jews.  But when they got there, 
                        they found nothing.  That’s some 
                        story, wouldn’t you say?    

                                 BARTALI
                        I just gave him the race.   

                                 ALFREDO
                        But you rode like a lion.  Winning 
                        would have just made you a sheep. 

           INT. STRAZELLA’S OFFICE. DAY

           Strazella works at his desk.  A KNOCK at the door. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Yes? 

           Adriana enters.    

                                 ADRIANA
                        The census report, Colonel.

           Strazella pours through the thick document:  (TRANSLATED) 
           CENSUS OF ABSENT OR MISSING JEWS.  
           He thumbs through THE NAMES OF HUNDREDS OF UNACCOUNTED FOR 
           ITALIAN JEWS.  Page after page, row after row--

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Has Berlin called yet?

                                 ADRIANA
                        Three times in the last hour.  

           INT. STRAZELLA’S OFFICE. LATER

           Strazella, General Rofino and Gestapo Officer Eichman sit 
           around a war table, in the midst of a serious discussion.

                                 GENERAL ROFINO
                        Berlin has suggested we adopt 
                        Hitler’s Schroeder Plan.  

                                 EICHMAN
                        It calls for zero tolerance policy 
                        in regards to those aiding the 
                        escaping Jews.  It’s been very 
                        effective controlling partisans in 
                        Warsaw.  We’d like to begin by 
                        sending in some of our men--

                                 STRAZELLA
                        The General entrusted me with this 
                        post for a reason.  I have the 
                        situation well in hand. 

                                 GENERAL ROFINO
                        Then why are there seven hundred 
                        Tuscan Jews suddenly missing?  

           The General stares at Strazella with a look that dares him to 
           challenge.   

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Whatever Hitler thinks is best, 
                        consider it done. 

           EXT. CITY OF FLORENCE. DAY 

           Bartali and Alfredo cycle along the Arno, they pass a block 
           long line of BLACKSHIRT and NAZI SOLDIERS standing shoulder 
           to shoulder...

           TITLE CARD:  MAY 1943

           A NAZI CAPTAIN blows his WHISTLE.  The Soldiers fan out, 
           entering every building on the block...

           Bartali and Alfredo cycle past a NAZI SOLDIER.  He stares 
           Bartali down as he passes...  

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE--VARIOUS--HOURS LATER

           Alfredo and Bartali ride through the blooming Fernata 
           countryside.     
                                 BARTALI
                        What’s my time?

           But Alfredo doesn’t hear him.  A hangdog frown on his face.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Alfredo!  

           Alfredo snaps out of his daze.  Checks the stopwatch hanging 
           from his neck. 

                                 BARTALI
                        What is it with you today?  You 
                        haven’t even been keeping track of 
                        my splits, have you? 

           Alfredo slows his Vespa.  Bartali keeps his pace. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        The Germans took over the post 
                        office.  I haven’t received a 
                        letter from Sofia in almost three 
                        months now. 

                                 BARTALI
                        I don’t get my mail anymore either.  
                        The Germans would rather use our 
                        letters to stoke the ovens in 
                        Auschwitz then give them to us.

           They cycle past a...

           FARMHOUSE

           Bartali recognizes it as the farm belonging to Giocomo 
           Nissim, the blacksmith who fixed his bicycle.  TWO MILITARY 
           TRUCKS are parked in the driveway.

                                 BARTALI
                        Alfredo, wait.    

           EXT. A HILLTOP

           Overlooking Nissim’s farmhouse.  Bartali parts some bare 
           branches, sees--

           NISSIM KNEELING IN A FIELD OF BARE APPLETREES.  A SOLDIER 
           steps behind him.  Brains him with the butt of his rifle...

           ACROSS THE YARD, another group of BLACKSHIRTS hold SUSANA--
           Nissim’s daughter--back as she fights to break free. 

           PAULO rushes to his sister.  A SOLDIER grabs him, locks him 
           in a choke-hold...

           VITTORIO AND JOSEPHINA kneel in the dirt, rifles aimed at 
           their backs.

                                 SUSANA
                        No, Mama!  Vittorio--
           STRAZELLA appears behind Vittorio, a cocked pistol in his 
           hand.  He kicks Vittorio.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Run!
                           (he boots Josephina)
                        You too.

           They run for their lives.  Strazella raises his pistol--

           POP!  POP!  Vittorio falls.

           Strazella aims at Josephina--

           POP!  He stitches her back with bullets.  She drops and the 
           screams quiet.  In their place a dead, suffering silence.

           HILLTOP

           Bartali’s horror struck.  Alfredo stammers, trips back...

           One of the branches SNAPS!  STRAZELLA wheels.  Stares at the 
           patch of trees.  Finally, he waves his men off...  

           EXT. THE ROAD--A MINUTE LATER

           Bartali and Alfredo stumble from the woods in time to see the 
           Military vehicles disappear down the road...

           EXT. BACK OF FARMHOUSE--MINUTES LATER

           Bartali toes around a corner.  Moves past the bodies slumped 
           in the snow--

           CLICK!  CLICK!  A shotgun is cocked behind him.  

           Paulo stands in a doorway.  Shotgun beaded.  Finger shaking 
           on the trigger.

                                 PAULO
                        Get away from my Mama.

                                 BARTALI
                        I'm a friend.  Your Papa fixed my 
                        bicycle.  We had supper--

           Alfredo steps around the corner.  Paulo wheels the gun on 
           him. 

                                 BARTALI
                        Wait!  It’s me...Bartali.   

           Bartali removes his cap.  It takes Paulo a second to 
           recognize him, but he finally lowers the shotgun.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT

           Bartali and Alfredo sit at the table.  Nissim across from 
           them.  His head in his hands, still trembling.
                                 NISSIM
                        I was feeding the horses...The 
                        trucks pulled up...They forced us 
                        into the field and...

           Bartali’s bloodshot eyes drift out the frosted window...In 
           the soft, falling snow, Susana cradles her mother's body.

           EXT. BARTALI’S VILLA. LATER

           Bartali coasts towards his garage, opens the door--

                                 ADRIANA (O.S.)
                        Didn’t anyone ever tell you it’s 
                        rude to make a lady wait all night?

           Adriana steps out from behind a tree.  Bartali’s eyes snap to 
           attention, searching the dark woods, the road.  

                                 BARTALI
                        What are you doing here? 

           Approaching HEADLIGHTS cut up the hillside.  Bartali grabs 
           her arm, leads her...

           INSIDE THE GARAGE

           Bartali peeks out a window.  The headlights stop at the end 
           of his driveway...And continue into the night.  

                                 BARTALI
                        It’s not safe for you to come here.  
                        I told you a dozen times already. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        I have something for you.  

           Adriana pulls an envelope out of her pocket.  Bartali opens 
           it...Three MILITARY IDENTIFICATION CERTIFICATES inside.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        You can get three men over the 
                        border with these.  They even have 
                        the state seal.  All you have to do 
                        is add photos--  

                                 BARTALI
                        Do you know who you work for?  This 
                        is not a game, Adriana.  If he 
                        catches you doing this, you’re 
                        dead.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        It’s too late.  I filed the 
                        receipts with the registrar this 
                        afternoon.  

           Bartali shoots her a cross look.  Stuff the papers in his 
           coat.  
                                 BARTALI
                        No more, Adriana, do you hear me? 

                                 ADRIANA
                        If I told you to stop doing what 
                        little you could to help, would you 
                        listen?  
                           (he looks away)
                        Then don’t expect me to.  

           Bartali’s face fills with sadness, preoccupied by the gravity 
           of what he has to say.  

                                 BARTALI
                        We have to stop this.

                                 ADRIANA
                        We’ve gone too far to stop now--

                                 BARTALI
                        No.  You and I...We can’t see each 
                        other anymore.  

           Adriana looks at him, pure disbelief.  

                                 BARTALI
                        If we’re caught together, we could 
                        expose the entire underground. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        But I need you, Gino.

                                 BARTALI
                        And I need you, but if we’re caught 
                        and I’m not there to help them, 
                        then who?   

                                 ADRIANA
                        Someone else.

                                 BARTALI
                        There is no one else.  

           Adriana leans in and kisses him.  A soft, lingering kiss that 
           seems all too brief and yet lasts forever at the same time. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        Good-bye, Gino.

           She looks at Bartali one last time and steps out of the 
           garage.  Bartali’s eyes drift closed.  The last thing this 
           war could have stolen from him, it has...

           INT. SAN DAMIANO CHURCH. NIGHT

           Bartali knocks on the cellar door.  No one answers.  He 
           pushes inside.

           The cellar’s empty.  The printing presses gone.  Cardinal 
           Dalla Costa steps behind him.  
                                 BARTALI
                        Where are the presses?

           INT. SAN DAMIANO CHURCH. OFFICE. NIGHT

           Cardinal Dalla Costa sits across his desk from Bartali.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        We can’t produce anymore passports.

                                 BARTALI
                        I only need three.  

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        Running the presses right now would 
                        be suicide.  They’re too close.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Maybe so, but not helping this man 
                        and his family would be murder.   

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        The passes have been shut down by 
                        the Nazis.  There’s no way into 
                        Switzerland.

                                 BARTALI
                        Exactly why we’re not going North.  
                        We’re going South over the Gothic 
                        Line.  The Allies will have control 
                        of Assisi by the end of the month.    

           The Cardinal look at Bartali.  There’ll be no changing his 
           mind.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        How are you going to get there?  
                        You don’t know the roads.  The 
                        patrol schedules are 
                        different...You need a plan, Gino.

                                 BARTALI
                        Who says I don’t have one? 

           INT. JAZZ CLUB. NIGHT

           A smoky nightclub full of NAZIS and BLACKSHIRT OFFICERS.  

           Bartali sits alone at a table by the band.  A WAITER brings 
           him a foamy draft beer, points out the men who have taken the 
           liberty of ordering it for him--

           TWO BLACKSHIRT CAPTAINS nod from the bar...

                                                  CUT TO:

           LATER--The Blackshirts have joined Bartali's table.  They're 
           laughing, having a hell of a time.  All good and lit.
           INT. BLACKSHIRT TRUCK--MOVING

           Bartali sits in back, sipping from a flask.    

           The FAT CAPTAIN, who we saw at the table earlier, drives.  
           Stinking drunk, he has a hard time keeping on the winding 
           road.  A SKINNY CAPTAIN next to him.

                                 BARTALI
                        I appreciate the ride home.  My 
                        villa’s right over the next hill.

           Headlights cut across a BLACKSHIRT TRUCK parked on the 
           roadside.  The Skinny Captain pulls a small leather-bound 
           notebook from beneath the seat.  Makes a notation--

           Bartali peeks over his shoulder as the Skinny Captain writes 
           in the notebook--02:34.  (IN ITALIAN)  FLORENCE CHECKPOINT # 
           4--ON DUTY.

           He notices a SOLDIER sleeping in the truck.

                                 SKINNY CAPTAIN
                        This job never ends.

           The Skinny Captain shoves the notebook back under his seat.  
           The Fat Captain stops the Truck.

                                 FAT CAPTAIN
                        One minute, Gino

           They get out.  Bartali eyes the notebook.  Looks out the 
           window...The Blackshirts shake the Soldier awake--

           Like a snake, Bartali snatches the notebook.  Its full of 
           notations; all different checkpoint locations and times--

           The doors open.  The Blackshirts just outside--
           Bartali fumbles the book.  It falls to the floor--
           He grabs it.  Sits on it--                                                         

           The Blackshirts climb back in--  

                                 SKINNY CAPTAIN
                        It’s not their fault.  All our men 
                        are overworked. 

           Bartali nods.  The Captain turns to him...

                                 SKINNY CAPTAIN
                        You going to give that back?

           Bartali swallows, looks down...He’s talking about the flask.  
           He hands it back and slips the notebook in his pocket in one 
           motion...

           INT. NISSIM FARMHOUSE--DAY

           Bartali stands over a map of Italy.  Nissim reads out of the 
           stolen notebook.  
                                 NISSIM
                           (reading)
                        ...Twenty-two hundred hours the 
                        patrols go through Fernata.  Twenty-
                        two-thirty they pull the patrols 
                        out of Chianti and into Freize...

           EXT. NISSIM’S FARM. DAY

           Bartali, Alfredo and Nissim trudge towards a weathered barn.

           INSIDE BARN

           The door RUMBLES open.  Light slices through the darkness of 
           a dusty, hay filled stable.  Nissim tosses several rotting 
           bags of potatoes off an old APPLE WAGON.

           It looks like a small hay cart.  Four wheels, a rusty bed and 
           a swing-arm to attach to a horse...

           Bartali stares at the cart.  Then back at Nissim.  The man's 
           obviously lost his mind.

           INT. NISSIM'S WORKSHED. VARIOUS

           SERIES OF SHOTS:  BUILDING THE CART

           --The sparks fly from Nissim's torch as he carves the bed out 
           of the applecart.

           --Bartali helps Nissim weld a new bed into place.  This one 
           dropped a half-meter lower than the original.

           --Alfredo drills a few holes into a mattress-sized board.

           --Paulo curls up in the cart bed.  Alfredo and Bartali lay 
           the board over him, hiding him inside--

           EXT. NISSIM’S FARM HOUSE. DAY

           Nissim, Susana and Paulo sit on the apple cart as Bartali 
           tows them in figure eights around the yard.

                                 PAULO
                           (laughing)
                        Faster!

           INT. NISSIM'S FARMHOUSE. NIGHT

           Bartali and Alfredo pour over the Map which is spread out 
           across the table.  There are dozens of notations along the 
           routes; each detailing Blackshirt patrol schedules... 

           Nissim stands next to them.   

                                 BARTALI
                        These times are to the minute.  
                        They patrol the same routes, the 
                        same time everyday.  
           Alfredo traces the route with his pencil.

                                 ALFREDO
                        If you leave by midnight you can go 
                        through the Gran Strasso Mountains.

                                 NISSIM
                        Those climbs are too steep to pull 
                        that much weight.  

                                 BARTALI
                        You don’t think I can do it?   

           Nissim nervously looks at the applecart out the window. 

                                 NISSIM
                        Maybe we should just wait until the 
                        Allies get here.  They could be 
                        here anytime.

                                 BARTALI
                        Maybe so, but what I know for sure 
                        is it’s only a matter of time 
                        before those Blackshirts are back 
                        to finish what they started.  

           Nissim’s eyes fall on Paulo and Susana peeling potatoes in 
           the kitchen...

                                 NISSIM
                        When do we leave? 

           EXT. VILLAGE OF SORENTO. NIGHT

           The wine-dark Ligurian Sea spreading behind him, Bartali tows 
           the apple cart along a narrow stretch of winding road.  

           EXT. UMBRIA COUNTRYSIDE. EARLY MORNING

           A fog blankets the countryside.  Bartali continues peddling. 

           EXT. GRAN STRASSO MOUNTAINS. EARLY MORNING

           Bartali rides a rough and dusty road...

           OVER THE CREST OF A KNOLL--A NAZI ROAD BLOCK appears.  

           Four NAZI SOLDIERS stand across the road.  A SHORT NAZI with 
           a bulldoggish, hirsute face steps forward.  One hand cradling 
           his machine gun.

                                 BARTALI
                           (whisper)
                        Quiet. 

           Bartali stops.  Soldiers circle, inspecting the apple cart 
           suspiciously.

                                 SHORT NAZI
                        Off the bicycle.
           He stands face to face with the Nazi.

                                 SHORT NAZI
                        Your identity card.

                                 BARTALI
                        Yes.  I’m Gino Bartali.  The 
                        cyclist.

           The Nazi looks at him.  Doesn’t know him. 

                                 SHORT NAZI
                        Where are you coming from?  

                                 BARTALI
                        Florence.

           Bartali hands them over.  Masking his shaking hand with a 
           scratch of his temple.  

           THROUGH THE SLAT IN THE CART'S SIDE--Nissim and the 
           children’s eyes wide in abject fear as the Soldiers swarm.

                                 SHORT NAZI 
                        You're a long way from home.  What 
                        brings you this far South--

                                 BABY FACED NAZI (O.S.)
                        Bartali?

           A BABY-FACED NAZI flicks away his cigarette and bounds from 
           the hood of a nearby Military truck. 

                                 SHORT NAZI
                        You know this man?

           The other Soldiers continue poking around the wagon.

                                 BABY FACED NAZI
                        This is Gino Bartali.  He used to 
                        be the Campanissimo.  

                                 SHORT NAZI
                        So then why are you towing a cart 
                        of potatoes through the mountains?  

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m training.  If you wanna climb 
                        the Alp d’Huez like it was flat, 
                        first do it pulling an extra 
                        hundred kilos. 

           The Short Nazi holds on him for a beat.  His intuition tells 
           him to investigate further.    

                                 SHORT NAZI
                        Then you won’t mind if we have a 
                        look at your cart?
                                 BARTALI
                        I’m on a training schedule, my 
                        heart-rate--

                           (in German)
                        Unload it.  

           The Nazi’s unload the potato sacks, toss them aside...  

           INSIDE THE CART--Nissim huddles with his children.  

           A Soldier lifts away the last sack, exposing the breathing 
           holes.  Through them, shafts of light shine down onto 
           unblinking eyes--

           An EMERGENCY AIRHORN BLARES--Echoes through the valley...

           The Soldier drops the bag.  They race towards their vehicles.

                                 BABY FACED SOLDIER
                        The Partisans are uprising again.

           He leaps into the back of a truck.  The motorcade disappears.  
           And just like that everything is still...

           Bartali looks to his chest, sees the crucifix hanging out of 
           his jacket and a faith he’s never known washes over him. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK. MIDNIGHT

           Bartali stops in some heavy forest.  He tosses the potato 
           sacks off the cart, slides away the false bottom.  

                                 BARTALI
                        We’ve arrived. 

           Nissim and his children sit up.  They marvel at the lights of 
           Assisi off in the valley below...

           Bartali and Alfredo sit in the stunned audience, watching 
           with utter disbelief.
           EXT. CINEMA. DAY

           Bartali and Alfredo walk out into the grey day.  The streets 
           are empty.  Unusually quiet.

           Bartali looks up to a nearby apartment building.  All the 
           shutters are closed.  Doors double-locked.

           A BOY (13) runs past them, screaming--

                                 BOY
                        Death to Mussolini!  Let him hang!

           EXT. CITY OF FLORENCE--ONE MONTH LATER

           The NAZI ARMOR TANK DIVISION rolls through Dante’s Square.  
           Mechanical brigades of NAZIS march behind.

           Frightened ITALIANS gape from the sidewalks.  Bartali and 
           Alfredo in the crowd.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I heard the Germans have stopped 
                        holding trials for partisans.  
                        They’re now shooting all Jewish 
                        sympathizers on sight as policy.  

           Bartali seems to grow even paler.

                                 BARTALI
                        The German’s have always been a 
                        model of efficiency.   

           INT. ITALIAN CONSULATE. DAY 

           TWO HUNDRED ITALIAN MILITARY BRASS stand in perfect rows, 
           right arms straight out in a NAZI salute.  A high ranking SS 
           OFFICER stands on a stage before them, swearing them into the 
           Third Reich...

           We move through the lines...Find Strazella, arm raised, 
           proudly proclaiming his allegiance to Hitler...

           INT. STRAZELLA’S OFFICE. DAY

           YOUNG NAZI SOLDIERS carry boxes into a spacious office 
           overlooking Florence.  

           Strazella walks in, breathes in his new office.  It’s even 
           bigger than he had hoped.  He moves to the window.  Stares 
           out at Florence so far below him... 

           For the first time he’s wearing a Nazi uniform. 

           EXT. GENOA COUNTRYSIDE. NIGHT

           Bartali WHISTLES down a swooping bend.  The dark road 
           unspools before him, when--
                                 NAZI VOICE (O.S.)
                           (in German)
                        Stop!

           Bartali hits his brakes.  Skids to a hard stop.  A slit-eyed 
           NAZI SOLDIER steps out onto the road before him.  

                                 NAZI SOLDIER
                           (in German)
                        Your papers.

                                 BARTALI
                        I don’t understand.

                                 NAZI SOLDIER
                           (broken)
                        Papers now!

                                 BARTALI
                        Yes, papers.  One moment...

           Bartali feels around his pockets, but they’re empty.  He 
           opens his bag, begins searching...

                                 NAZI SOLDIER
                           (broken)
                        Where are they?  

                                 BARTALI
                        I have them here somewhere.

           The Soldier shoves him.

                                 BARTALI
                        There’s no need for that...

           Bartali reaches into his pocket...And like a whip, the barrel 
           of the soldier’s rifle is against Bartali’s temple--

           INT. JAIL CELL. NIGHT

           Bartali sits on a bench in the dank cell.  He shivers, his 
           head hung in his hands.  

           A NAZI SOLDIER walks up to the cell door.

                                 NAZI
                        Bartali?  

           INT. PRISON BOOKING ROOM. NIGHT

           A CLERK hands Bartali his bag.  Bartali turns to walk out, 
           Strazella stands in the doorway.  

                                 BARTALI
                        This is a surprise.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        When Gino Bartali is arrested for 
                        breaking curfew, you’d be amazed 
                        how quickly rumors spread. 
                                 BARTALI
                        I hope the gossip is more 
                        interesting than the truth...I was 
                        training and forgot my papers at 
                        home.  I suppose I have you to 
                        thank for getting me out?      

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I just had to make a couple of 
                        phone calls.  Could I interest you 
                        in coming back to my office for a 
                        brandy?  

                                 BARTALI
                        I appreciate it, Colonel, but right 
                        now I’d just like to go home.

           Strazella smiles with intensity.  He’s not asking.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Don’t forget if it wasn’t for me 
                        you’d be sleeping in that cell.  
                        Just a drink, what do you say?  

           INT. STRAZELLA'S OFFICE. FLORENCE. NIGHT

           A bottle of brandy GLUGS into a snifter.  Standing at his 
           liquor cabinet, Strazella pours a second glass.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Do you know there’s now eight-
                        hundred missing Jews in Florence? 

           Bartali sits behind him, petting Strazella's Rottweiler, 
           fighting to keep his mask of indifference.

                                 BARTALI
                        The Nazi’s need to stop worrying 
                        about the Jews and figure out a way 
                        to stop the Allies. 

           Strazella hands Bartali a drink.  Sits in a rocking chair 
           across from him.  The chair CROAKS everytime he rocks... 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        There’s a legend in the ghettos of 
                        some superhero who smuggles Jews 
                        out of Italy right under the noses 
                        of our patrols.

                                 BARTALI
                        You can’t blame them for telling 
                        stories to keep their spirits up.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I suppose...Tell me, why do you 
                        train at night?      

           Strazella's matter-of-fact tone unsettles Bartali.
                                 BARTALI
                        Training in the cold helps get my 
                        lungs in racing shape.  Radio Free 
                        Europe is reporting the war could 
                        end as soon as March.   

                                 STRAZELLA
                        It’s important to keep one’s 
                        spirits up in times like these, but 
                        then again there’s reality.
                           (silence)
                        Has any rider ever won the Tour de 
                        France after thirty, Gino? 

           Bartali looks down at his drink, swirls the ice in it 
           thoughtfully.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Not yet.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Then why are you still training?  
                           (leans forward)
                        If you had noticed anything 
                        suspicious on any of your rides I’m 
                        sure you’d have told me.

                                 BARTALI
                        I said I’d be keeping an eye out 
                        and I have been.  Is there 
                        something you’d like to ask me? 

           A palpable tension fills the room, Strazella looks steadily 
           at the half glass of bourbon in his hand.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I’m sorry. This war is making it so 
                        I don’t know who to trust anymore.  

           A soft KNOCK at the door and Adriana steps in carrying a 
           stack of papers.  She sees Bartali, turns ashen.

                                 ADRIANA
                        I didn’t know you were in a 
                        meeting.

           Strazella greets her at the door, takes the papers and sits 
           at his desk.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Come in, come in...You remember Don 
                        Bartali.

           Adriana can’t bring herself to look at him.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        Nice to see you.

           Bartali soaks her in like it’s the first time he’s ever seen 
           her.  Strazella mulls over the papers.
                                 STRAZELLA
                        These papers should have been 
                        signed and filed weeks ago.

                                 ADRIANA
                        I didn’t want to bother you with 
                        paperwork.  You’ve been so busy.

           Strazella begins signing.  Bartali slides into his overcoat.

                                 BARTALI
                        I should be going, but thank you 
                        again for your help.  Since the 
                        Nazi’s arrived my name doesn’t buy 
                        me the freedom it once did. 

           They shake hands.  Strazella looks him dead in the eye and 
           doesn't let go...

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I’m sure you’d have done the same 
                        for me. 

                                 BARTALI
                        You know I would have.  

           Strazella releases his hand.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Get home safely. 

           EXT. STATE OFFICE. AN HOUR LATER

           Adriana walks out of the state building, hugging her overcoat 
           against the cold.  Bartali steps out of a nearby doorway.

           He grabs her arm, spins her towards him.

                                 ADRIANA
                        But you said--

           He leans in and they kiss like it’s the first time...

           INT. BARTALI’S BEDROOM. NIGHT

           They lay in bed, sinking into each other.  Naked limbs 
           entangled beneath an old quilt.  

           Adriana’s head on his chest, Bartali smokes.  She brushes her 
           fingertips over his naked thigh.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        So this is it.  The leg that pushes 
                        all those kilometers...Flex it for 
                        me.

                                 BARTALI
                        You’re not serious.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        Don’t be shy.  I want to see.
           Bartali concedes, flexes his thigh.  A deliciously satisfied 
           grin grows across her face.   

                                 ADRIANA
                        Not bad.  

           Bartali watches Ada’s fingertips move over his thigh.  
           Notices a gold watch dangling around her wrist.   

                                 ADRIANA
                        It was a gift from the Colonel.  I 
                        wasn’t going to accept it, but then 
                        I saw this...

           Adriana slides the watch off.  Shows Bartali the inscription 
           on the back:  Julia il mio amore.  (Julia my love) 

                                 ADRIANA
                        I tried to find the woman it 
                        belongs to, but there are so few 
                        Jews left...When I look at it, I 
                        wonder if she ever thinks about it.   

                                 BARTALI
                        I’m sure she does.  Now it’s your 
                        job to keep it safe until you can 
                        give it back to her.  

           Then, from somewhere in the city--A CONCUSSIVE BOOM!

           Bartali leaps out of bed, cracks his window.  The night sky 
           is orange, dozens of fires burn throughout Florence...

           The fires reflect in Bartali’s eyes as he watches his beloved 
           city being pillaged.  EXPLOSIONS RUMBLE through the streets 
           like a distant thunder storm.

           Adriana meets him at the window.  A NAZI BOMBER flies over 
           them, drops a bomb on the Ponte alle Grazie bridge--

           It explodes in a plume of fire and smoke, painting the Arno 
           like a bloody sunrise.  Adriana holds Bartali tight.   

                                 BARTALI
                        Tomorrow night there’s a train 
                        leaving for Assisi.  I want you to 
                        let me put you on it.  You’re not 
                        safe here anymore.  

                                 ADRIANA
                        Neither are you.  Come with me. 

                                 BARTALI
                        I can’t just hand the Germans my 
                        home.   

                                 ADRIANA
                        It’s already theirs.  There’s no 
                        reason to give them your life, too.    
           EXT. FERNATA RAIL STATION. NIGHT

           Steam bellows from the stacks of a TRAIN sitting in it’s 
           berth.  NAZI soldiers check the papers of PASSENGERS 
           streaming onto the train...  

           An NAZI checks papers by the entrance to the last car.  A 
           MUSICIAN holding a mandolin case hands over his passport--

           A military watermark next to his photo. IDENTIFICAZIONE 
           MILITARE stamped across the top.  

           The Nazi notices the instrument in his hand. 

                                 NAZI
                        I see you’re in the military.  What 
                        division?  

                                 MUSICIAN
                           (rehearsed)
                        The one-hundred and thirty-second 
                        Ariete Armoured Division. 

           The Nazi raises an eyebrow, eyes the Musician up and down.

                                 NAZI
                        Must be difficult playing a 
                        mandolin inside the hull of a tank.    
                           (checks his ticket)
                        I didn’t know there were any 
                        divisions still operating in 
                        Assisi.  

           A bead of sweat runs down the Musician’s temple.  He drops 
           his mandolin case, starts running.  The Nazi blows a WHISTLE--

           A gang of NAZI SOLDIERS tackle the Musician.  The Nazi picks 
           the forged MILITARY PAPERS off the ground.

           INT. STRAZELLA’S OFFICE. NIGHT

           A PHONE RINGS in the dim office.  Strazella sleeps at his 
           desk, snoring like a bear.  

           The phone wakes him.  He jolts up-right, answers:

                                 STRAZELLA
                        This is Colonel Strazella.

                                                  CUT TO:

           GENERAL ROFINO’S OFFICE--SAME/INTERCUTTING

           The General sits at his desk.  

                                 GENERAL ROFINO
                        You sound like you’re sleeping.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        No...I was just catching up on some 
                        paperwork.  
                                 GENERAL ROFINO
                        I see...A Jew was just picked up at 
                        a rail station in Greve.  He was 
                        trying to get on a train using 
                        false military papers.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You’d think with the lengths we go 
                        this sort of thing would stop.

                                 GENERAL ROFINO
                        The papers he was using were traced 
                        back to your office.

           Strazella’s throat turns to sandpaper. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You can’t think that I...

                                 GENERAL ROFINO
                        Of course not.  My question is how 
                        loyal are those working for you? 

           EXT. TUSCANY COUNTRYSIDE. DAWN

           Adriana rides on Bartali’s handlebars.  The rising sun 
           tracing a soft halo over her, she looks like an angel...

           He stops just down the road from her villa.  Helps her down.

                                 BARTALI
                        I’ll be back at six.  Pack lightly.

                                 ADRIANA
                        Can you promise me that after today 
                        you’ll never ride without me again?

                                 BARTALI
                        All you ever had to do was ask.   

           Bartali kisses her goodbye, rides off.  

           INT. ADRIANA'S VILLA

           Closing the front door behind her, Adriana floats past...

           THE DEN  

           A desk lamp is on.  She steps in, reaches to turn it off--

           Notices the floor behind the desk is littered with papers and 
           books.  The drawers of the desk overturned and emptied.

           The floor behind her CREEKS!

           Strazella leans sullenly against the doorway.   His eyes 
           morose, thick with a mix of despair and rage.  
                                 STRAZELLA
                        The least he could have done was 
                        walk you in.

                                 ADRIANA
                           (stunned)
                        What are you doing here?

           Strazella creeps behind her, parts the curtains with his 
           fingertips and looks out the window...

           STRAZELLA’S POV--Bartali disappears down the road.  

           Strazella nods to a GERMAN TRUCK hidden in the woods across 
           the road.  The truck pulls out, motors after Bartali...

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Four military passports filed in 
                        the names of dead Italians have 
                        been traced back to my office. 

           Strazella carefully closes the drapes.  The intensity of his 
           calm makes Adriana’s throat run dry. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You signed for each of them. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        I signed for dozens of papers, but 
                        they were all at the request of the 
                        General’s office.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You shouldn’t lie to me, I’m the 
                        only friend you have.  

           Adriana holds on him.  Knows if she talks, she’s dead. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        I was just following directions.  
                        Maybe someone in his office--

           Strazella throws her up against the wall.  Face to face.  Her 
           lips trembling.  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Is he part of the underground, too?  

                                 ADRIANA
                        I know nothing about the 
                        underground.  I would never betray 
                        my country.  I swear it.  

           Strazella looks at her.  Through her.  Wants so badly to 
           believe her.  He lifts his hand, gently strokes her hair.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Do you know even if you were part 
                        of the underground, I’d have burned 
                        all of Rome to protect you?
                                 ADRIANA
                        I do. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Then why would you betray me?  With 
                        him of all people...Did you like 
                        the way his hands felt on you?

           Strazella lightly brushes his hand over her breast.  Down her 
           stomach.  She struggles for breath...

                                 STRAZELLA
                        The famous champion’s hands must 
                        have made a simple girl from the 
                        countryside feel so special...

                                 ADRIANA
                        It’s not like that.  He loves 
                        me...And I love him. 

           Strazella’s heart shatters in his chest.  He pauses.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I know you never felt about me the 
                        way I did you, but was there ever a 
                        time when you’d thought of me as 
                        anything more than just the man you 
                        worked for?  

           Adriana looks at him.  Afraid to speak.

                                 ADRIANA
                        Of course--

           Without warning--He backhands her!  She crumbles to the floor 
           and curls into a ball.  Crippled with fear.      

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I told you not to lie to me.  The 
                        man you’re in love with is nothing 
                        but a coward who thinks his 
                        trophies protect him from the law.

           Strazella slides on his coat, his leather gloves and looks at 
           her for what he knows is the last time. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I would have given you the world if 
                        you would have let me, instead you 
                        made me do this.     
                           (checks his watch)
                        The Germans will be here to 
                        question you soon, if I were you I 
                        wouldn’t be here when they arrive. 

           And he walks out of the room.  Adriana holds her breath, 
           listening to his BOOTSTEPS as he walks out of the villa.  The 
           door CLOSES...And she explodes into a fit of tears.
           INT. SAN DAMANO CHURCH BASEMENT. DAY

           Bartali hovers over Cardinal Dalla Costa as he prints a set 
           of papers, places them in an envelope...

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        These will get you both on the 
                        train...You did a lot of good, 
                        Gino.   

                                 BARTALI
                        It was an honor.
                           (tips his cap)
                        See you after the war, Cardinal. 

           EXT. SAN DAMANO CHURCH. DAY

           Bartali sneaks out the side of the church.  He pulls his 
           bicycle from the nearby bushes.  Removes his seat and hides 
           the papers inside...

           He rides off, revealing...

           A NAZI MILITARY TRUCK parked behind a wall, waiting.

           EXT. FLORENCE COUNTRYSIDE. DAY

           Bartali rides past a one-room schoolhouse, Florence smolders 
           in the distance...

           EXT. DESERTED HILL--DAY

           He whips down the steep road.  It unspools beneath him in a 
           blur...

           THE HILL BEHIND HIM--A NAZI TRUCK appears...Bartali sees it 
           coming...

           INSIDE THE TRUCK--The DRIVER aims for Bartali.  Hits the 
           gas...

           Bartali looks over his shoulder...The truck right behind him 
           now...About to ram his tire...

           Bartali swerves, cuts across the road, disappears down...

           A SIDE ROAD

           Bartali takes the rolling bend like he's on rails.  But soon 
           enough the truck is back.  Pulls beside him...

           A NAZI leans out the window.  His rifle poised on Bartali.  
           He pulls the trigger--

           BAM!  Bartali's front tire explodes!

           He flips out over his bars like a rag doll.  Lands in the 
           middle of the road with a bone-crushing THUD!
           EXT. VILLA TRISTE. NIGHT

           Eerie quiet.  Whips of snow tumble across the sidewalk, past 
           an abandoned factory just outside Florence.  

           INT. VILLA TRISTE. BASEMENT. NIGHT

           A match is scraped, thrown into a furnace.  The fire ignites 
           with a WHOOSH, revealing...

           A windowless, grey place; more of a cell than a room.  The 
           metal door is booted open...SOLDIERS drop Bartali on a 
           concrete slate.  Chain his arms and legs in manacles. 

                                 BARTALI
                        What do you want?  I’ve done 
                        nothing!

           A Soldier carries in Bartali's twisted bike.  Another pulls 
           out a handsaw.  Cuts through the frame...Wrenches it 
           apart...Papers fall from inside the tube...

           Strazella walks in.  Something hanging from his hand...  

           He opens the furnace door.  Lays the blade of a serrated 
           Saboteur knife in the hot coals.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        I had my suspicions, but I never 
                        believed you’d betray your own 
                        country.  

           Strazella unfolds the false papers.  Sees one of the 
           passports is for a woman.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You had plans to leave the country 
                        with a woman?   

           Bartali's still.  His face so pale he looks as if he's been 
           shut off.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        When I was a boy, my first job was 
                        working at a slaughter house in 
                        Frieze.  I hated putting the cows 
                        down most of all.

           Strazella reaches into the furnace.  Pulls out the red-hot 
           blade. 

                                 STRAZELLA
                        But I learned the best way to kill 
                        them was to heat my blade in a 
                        fire...

           He holds the knife up to Bartali's eyeball.  Bartali snaps 
           his head side to the side--

           Strazella grabs him by the hair, forces his eye wide 
           open...The glowing blade, about to pierce his eyeball.
                                 STRAZELLA
                        That way when I slid the knife 
                        through the cow's eyeball, it would 
                        pierce right through the brain.  
                        Killing it without a struggle.  
                        That pop when the eyeball 
                        punctures...It still makes me sick.  

           He smiles a devil's smile and lifts the knife away.

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Stop shaking.  If I killed you I’d 
                        have an insurgence on my hands.

           He rips off Bartali's shoe.  Bartali beats his leg...

                                 STRAZELLA
                        That’s why your obituary will read 
                        you were killed in a cycling 
                        accident.  

           ...Five NAZIS descend on Bartali...Overpower him, hold his 
           legs down...

           Strazella slowly, every so slowly rolls Bartali's sock down 
           to the arch of his foot.  Bartali’s face begs for mercy, his 
           mouth forming inaudible words...  

                                 STRAZELLA
                        You could have had any woman you 
                        wanted.  Why her?    

           The steel blade flashes down...Slices though Bartali’s 
           Achilles tendon!

           Bartali convulses.  Eyes roll back white.  He screams out in 
           hideous, unconceivable pain.

           Strazella scratches his chin, leaving a whip of blood across 
           his jaw.  He leans down to Bartali’s ear, whispers...

                                 STRAZELLA
                        Never again will a traitor be my 
                        Campanissimo.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT

           An icy road.  The Nazi truck races through the murky dawn.  
           It speeds up and the Soldiers dump Bartali out the side...

           He hits the road hard.  Smacks his head, tumbles off the road 
           and down a steep embankment...

           Finally, coming to a rest in the ravine below...We float into 
           his grey face.  His disorientated eyes drift closed.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. THE NEXT DAY

           TWO NUNS step into the frame.  They shoo away a flock of 
           crows and find...
           Bartali.  Blanketed beneath a layer of snow.

           One of the Nuns rolls him over.  Lips blue.  Eyes swollen.  
           Face crusted with dried-blood...He’s dead for sure...  

           EXT. FERNATA MONASTERY. NIGHT

           The night is still.  A thousand year old fortress that looks 
           like it was abandoned a long time ago.  The fountain outfront 
           is chipped from bullets.  The courtyard crumbling around it.      

           A PARTISAN keeps watch from the Monastery’s bell tower.  A 
           rifle slung over his shoulder.

           INT. MONASTERY ATTIC

           The cramped attic has been converted into a makeshift 
           hospital ward.  The Monastery is now a partisan safehouse.

           A few NUNS scrub away the dried blood on Bartali’s face.  A 
           cast around his ankle.  

           Bartali's eyes drift open...And reality crashes into him like 
           a locomotive.  He seizes violently.  Kicks his legs...

           Slams his cast against the wooden footboard of the bed.  The 
           pain blinds him--

                                 NUNS
                        Help!  Don Binda!  Cardinal!

           Cardinal Dalla Costa and Alfredo hurry into the room...

                                 ALFREDO
                        It's Alfredo.  You're safe--

                                 BARTALI
                           (frantic)
                        Where is she?  I have to get to her 
                        before he does...

                                 ALFREDO
                        Gino...Calm down...  

           But he fights Alfredo off, desperate to stand. 

                                 ADRIANA (O.S.)
                        Gino!

           Her voice freezes him.  He looks up...

           Adriana steps into the room.  Her eye bruised.  A firestorm 
           of emotion runs through Bartali as she moves towards him.

                                 BARTALI
                        What did he do to you?

           Adriana puts her hands up, hides her bruises.
                                 ADRIANA
                        Don't look at me...I tried to find 
                        you...When I couldn’t I went to the 
                        Cardinal...
                           (can barely say it)
                        I said if I could see you just one 
                        more time...

           Bartali pulls her close.  Her sobs muffled in his chest.

                                 ALFREDO
                        This is the only safe house they 
                        haven’t found yet, but none of us 
                        know what tomorrow might bring.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        Which is why we’re leaving 
                        tonight...The underground’s 
                        finished, Gino.  There’s only a few 
                        of us left.  

           Bartali’s stunned.  Takes a moment to digest. 

                                 BARTALI
                        The back route to Assisi is still 
                        open--

           Adriana pulls back.  Can’t believe what she’s hearing.

                                 ADRIANA
                        You won’t get far in the snow with 
                        the shape your ankle is in.   
                           (to the Cardinal)
                        He won’t make it.

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        In this cold none of us would. 
                        There’s a train leaving for Assisi 
                        at midnight.  

           The Cardinal reaches into his coat.  Produces three sets of 
           false papers.  Hands one to each of them.

                                 BARTALI
                        But the trains aren’t safe.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Neither is sitting here waiting for 
                        the Nazis to find us.

           Bartali tries to sit, grits away the pain.

                                 ADRIANA
                        What are you doing?

                                 BARTALI
                        If I’m being forced to run from my 
                        home, there are some things I need 
                        to take with me. 
           Bartali forces himself to stand.  A bolt of pain steals his 
           breath.  He steadies himself against Alfredo’s shoulder...

           INT. BARTALI’S VILLA. 

           Alfredo pushes the door.  It creeks open.  Bartali walks in, 
           limping on a cane... 

           Adriana steps in over a mess of shattered glass.  Every 
           window in the house is broken out.  Every piece of furniture 
           overturned...

           And a sudden dread fills Bartali.  

           INT. BARTALI’S BEDROOM. NIGHT

           Bartali sits in a chair, watching Adriana’s shaking hands 
           fold a grey sweater into a small bag.  

                                 BARTALI
                        We’re going to make it.

           Adriana says nothing.  Just concentrates on packing.  Bartali 
           motions to a small, wooden box atop his dresser.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Will you hand me that box?

           Adriana hands him the box.  He opens it, removes the crucifix 
           Cardinal Dalla Costa gave him... 

           He loops the crucifix around her neck.

                                 BARTALI
                        If anything should happen and I 
                        can’t protect you this will.

           Adriana looks down at his leg wrapped in gauze.  Bartali 
           smiles through his nerves...

                                 BARTALI
                        I know it might not look like it 
                        now, but it’s done well by me. 

           She fingers the cross.  Her eyes well with tears, but she 
           smiles, too.   

                                 BARTALI
                        There’s one more thing I need.

           INT. BARTALI’S GARAGE. LATER

           Dark.  Bartali pulls a string.  A single overhead bulb casts 
           an orange light on his trophies.  

           Adriana helps him crutch his way down the line of prizes.  He 
           runs his hands over them, remembering each victory, moving 
           towards...
           The framed Yellow Jersey hanging on the far wall.  He stops 
           before it.  

                                 BARTALI
                        They can’t have this.  

           Bartali looks at her.  At the cast around his ankle.  A sad 
           understanding passes between them...  

           Adriana lifts the frame off the wall.  Removes the back. 
           Bartali delicately pulls the Yellow Jersey from the frame, 
           stuffs it in his coat pocket.

           EXT. WOODS. AN HOUR LATER

           A HOOTING owl breaks the stillness of the freezing night.  

           Then, the crunch of FOOTSTEPS in the snow.  Something moves 
           through the darkness, coming closer...

           Adriana and Alfredo help Bartali limp through a clearing in 
           the woods.

                                 ALFREDO
                        It’s just beyond here.

           Suddenly, a pack of frightened horses WHINNY past and an 
           orange blaze sears their faces.   For a second, Bartali takes 
           in the sight.  Torrents of flames consume the monastery. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        What happened?

           Bartali sees a troop of NAZI TRUCKS speeding away...

           EXT.  MONASTERY MINUTE LATER

           They walk towards the burning Monastery.

           The dead bodies of their friends laying in the snow.  Shot in 
           the backs of the heads, execution style.  Some of them 
           smoldering now.  Some still burning...

           Bartali hears quiet MOANING behind a bush.  He canes towards 
           it...Cardinal Dalla Costa lays on his side in the snow.  

           Bartali rolls him over...And suddenly his hands are wet.

           The Cardinal bleeds out from a gunshot wound in his chest, 
           leaving a dark wash of blood soaked snow beneath him. 

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                           (gasping)
                        They’re all dead. 

                                 BARTALI
                        Don’t talk.  You’re going to be 
                        okay.   
           The Cardinal gently takes Bartali’s hand in his.  Musters his 
           final words:

                                 CARDINAL DALLA COSTA
                        Your faith doesn’t just hang on 
                        your wall anymore, does it?

                                 BARTALI
                        It hasn’t for a long time. 

           The Cardinal’s body slumps.  Bartali sinks into the snow and 
           lets out a primal, anguished cry.  Adriana kneels next to 
           him, wraps her arms around his shoulders. 

                                 ALFREDO
                           (softly)
                        We have to go.  Before they come 
                        back.         

                                 BARTALI
                        I don’t have it in me to run 
                        anymore.   

                                 ALFREDO
                        Dead in the snow is not how you 
                        want your name remembered.  

           Emotions roll back and forth between them, but even in his 
           darkest hour, Bartali’s got the heart of a champion.  He 
           fights his way to his feet...

           EXT. FLORENCE COUNTRYSIDE. NIGHT

           They move along a black country road.  Adriana leads with a 
           lantern.  Bartali leans on Alfredo, caning his way...

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. NIGHT

           A NAZI TRUCK rounds a curve and passes.  They step out of the 
           woods, continue their long walk...  

           ALONG THE ARNO RIVER. NIGHT

           The wind whips off the icy river.  

           Bartali soldiers on, but with every staggered step, a 
           fireball shoots up his leg.  His cast is soaked with blood.

           Then, like an evil mirage through the darkness...

           THE CITY OF FLORENCE

           A smoldering stew of NAZIS and SMOKE.  The FEAR in the city 
           is deafening--The BARKING of dogs, mixed with GUNFIRE.  

           Two NAZI PLANES BUZZ overhead... 

                                 ALFREDO
                        This must be what the end of the 
                        world looks like.
           EXT. PONTE VECCHIO. MINUTES LATER

           They move over the crowded bridge, the only crossing left 
           that hasn’t been bombed by the Germans.  

           A PEASANT MAN’s eyebrows furrow in recognition of Bartali as 
           he passes.  Bartali pulls his cap low, hides his face, limps 
           through the people...

           EXT. FLORENCE RAILWAY STATION. NIGHT

           The platform is packed with ITALIANS racing to board trains.  

           Adriana, Bartali and Alfredo make their way towards their 
           train.  A baby-faced NAZI SOLDIER stands at the entrance, 
           checking passports and tickets.  

                                 BABY FACED SOLDIER
                        Papers?

           Alfredo gives the Nazi his papers.  He checks the papers, 
           waves him onto the train...

           Bartali looks at Adriana, silently assures her.  She hands 
           over their papers.

                                 BABY FACED NAZI
                        The two of you are travelling 
                        together...Miss Prizzo?

                                 ADRIANA
                        Yes.  

           The Nazi checks Adriana’s ticket and Bartali recognizes 
           him...

           The baby face has grown a mustache, but it's the same skinny 
           Nazi who inspected Bartali’s apple cart when Nissim and his 
           children were inside.  

           The Nazi hands Adriana back her papers, opens Bartali’s and 
           reads the name: RUGGERI, ANTONIO.  He looks at the photo--

           Recognizes Bartali.  For a moment he says nothing, double-
           checks the papers...And returns them. 

                                 BABY FACED NAZI
                        Have a safe trip, Don Ruggeri.

           A silent understanding passes between the two men.  Bartali 
           tips his cap, steps aboard the train.

           INT. TRAIN. AN HOUR LATER--MOVING

           Quiet.  Just the constant RUSH of iron as the train rolls 
           through the Chianti countryside...

           We TRACK down the dark aisle of the last car...Every seat is 
           taken.  And though nobody is asleep, nobody says a word.  
           Near the rear of the car, Alfredo looks out the window.  In 
           the seats across from him, Adriana sits next to Bartali.  He 
           looks down at her hands, restless in her lap.

                                 BARTALI
                        Close your eyes, you need rest. 

           She closes her eyes, nuzzles close.  Is almost sleeping, 
           when...

           BOOM!  An fireball explosion lights up the distant 
           countryside.  And another...This one much closer--

           Suddenly--The HISSING of the train’s heavy, steam-powered 
           brakes...The earsplitting GRIND of steel on steel...

           The jolt sends overhead bags across the car...Passengers fall 
           out of their seats...Adriana holds onto Bartali...  

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. SAME

           The train finally SQUEALS to a hard stop...For a second, 
           everything is still, unearthly silent...  

           INT. TRAIN 

           Bartali peers out the window.  Down the tracks...The train 
           bridge ahead is ablaze.  The steel supports crumbling and 
           twisted by mortar shells...

           Then, the RAT-TAT-TAT OF GUNFIRE echoes through the valley.  
           A storm of BRITISH AND AMERICAN TROOPS race over a snowy 
           hillside, fighting back--

           A retreating PLATOON OF NAZI SOLDIERS.  Grenades BOOM, 
           exploding puffs of earth.  The Allieds advance on the NAZIS 
           just past the stranded train... 

                                 ALFREDO
                        What is this?

                                 BARTALI
                        We rode into the middle of a fire-
                        fight.

           BANG! BANG!  The train’s windows SHATTER!  

           Stray bullets ricochet through the car.  Bartali pulls 
           Adriana down to the floor as glass cascades around them...  

                                 BARTALI
                        We have to get off the train. 

           Bartali, Adriana and Alfredo move down the aisle.  

           Then--A BLINDING EXPLOSION.  It rattles the train like an 
           earthquake--  

           A collective hysteria breaks out amongst the PASSENGERS.  
           They race over each other, desperately clawing their way out 
           of the car, creating a current of bodies in the aisle...
           Adriana is swept up in the mob...Her grip breaks from 
           Bartali’s and she disappears into the chaos...

                                 BARTALI
                           (calls out)
                        Adriana?

           He hears nothing over the DIN OF SCREAMS.  Looks behind him.  
           Only finds a mess of dark faces.      

           His hands in front of him now, he fights his way out the 
           train.

                                 BARTALI
                           (louder)
                        Alfredo?...Adriana!

           Every step shreds his ankle, but an intense single-mindedness 
           burns on his face--

           He limps towards the door, stumbles out into...

           THE SNOW OUTSIDE   

           GUNFIRE seems to be coming from every direction as the 
           ALLIEDS fight the NAZIS... 

           Bartali falls to the snow.  The pain returns to his leg at 
           once, but he forces himself to crawl.  PASSENGERS run in 
           every direction.  Bartali’s knocked down.  Trampled. 

                                 BARTALI
                           (desperate to himself)
                        Adriana!  Where are you?

           Bartali crawls out of the melee.  Ducks for cover beneath the 
           train...The PINGS of stray bullets spark the steel above...

           SEVERAL PASSENGERS drop around him, hit by stray bullets.  
           Then--ANOTHER BOOM--A heavy cloud of earth explodes before 
           him--

           Bartali drops to his belly...Hides beneath the train as a 
           BRIDGE OF NAZI TRUCKS AND SOLDIERS retreat right past him--

           The Nazis race off into the night and just as quickly as it 
           started, everything is quiet.  Only the CRIES of injured 
           SOLDIERS and PASSENGERS to fill the void... 

           Bartali looks up, sees something half-buried in the snow.  He 
           scoops it up in his palm...The crucifix he gave Adriana.   

                                 ADRIANA (O.S.)
                           (weak)
                        Gino...

           Adriana lies slumped a few meters away.  Her breathing is 
           erratic, her eyes unable to focus.  Bartali crawls to her.  
           Slowly, weakly, he tries to sit her up, but she winces.  
                                 ADRIANA
                        My stomach...It’s burning...

           He looks down at her shirt, wet from blood.  Finds a piece of 
           jagged shrapnel jutting out of a wound in her stomach. 

           Bartali puts pressure on the gash with his hands, blood flows 
           out over his fingers...

                                 BARTALI
                        It’s just a scratch.  You’ll be 
                        fine.  

           A star field of HEADLIGHTS speed towards them.  Bartali pulls 
           Adriana close, braces for the worst--   

           A fleet of trucks with BRITISH FLAGS painted on the sides 
           RUMBLE past.  BRITISH SOLDIERS jump from the trucks, begin 
           extinguishing fires, helping the INJURED...

                                 ADRIANA
                        The Allieds...We made it.    

                                 BARTALI
                        We made it and we’re safe now.  

           Bartali places Adriana’s hand in his.  Their breath clouding 
           around them in the cold.  

                                 BARTALI
                        I want you to squeeze my hand and 
                        keep squeezing.

           Adriana feels the soft, peaceful snow falling on her face. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        It’s snowing.  Just like in my 
                        dreams...I’m cold...I’m so cold.

           Bartali brushes away the snow from her cheeks. 

                                 BARTALI
                        No, it’s not snowing.  The sun is 
                        shining on your face and we have 
                        warm jam on toast waiting for us.  
                        And after that chocolate truffles, 
                        so fresh they melt on your 
                        fingertips before you get them in 
                        your mouth.

           Adriana begins shivering uncontrollably.  Her grip on 
           Bartali’s hand weakens...  

                                 BARTALI
                        Doesn’t that sound good?  

           Alfredo stumbles towards him, sees Adriana limp in Bartali’s 
           arms.  The metal sticking out of her stomach.    

                                 ALFREDO
                        Help!  Somebody help us!
           FOUR BRITISH SOLDIERS race over to them.  Alfredo shows them 
           the shrapnel sicking out of her stomach...  

           The Soldiers slide Adriana onto a stretcher, race her away 
           towards a MILITARY AMBULANCE...

                                 BARTALI
                           (to Alfredo)
                        I can’t let her be alone.  

           Alfredo helps Bartali to his feet and towards the back of...

           THE MILITARY AMBULANCE

           Alfredo helps Bartali sit on a bench across from Adriana.  A 
           pair of BRITISH MILITARY DOCTORS examine her abdomen...  

           Bartali places the crucifix in her palm, closes her hand 
           around it.  She opens her eyes half-mast, so weak...

                                 ADRIANA
                        You promised never to ride without 
                        me again.

           And with that her drift eyes close.  

           Bartali can barely speak.  Welling with more emotion then 
           he’s ever known possible.

                                 BARTALI
                        And I never will.  

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. PARIS. DAY--FOUR YEARS LATER

           The air pops with expectation.  Thousands of FANS blanket 
           Paris in color and sound.  Waving flags and homemade signs.  
           This is the largest crowd in the tour's history--

           TITLE CARD:  1948 TOUR De FRANCE
                        21 Stages/4,922KM

           Up and down the Place des Palace Royale, hundreds of CYCLISTS 
           warm-up.  Getting ready for the race...

           IN A TRAINER’S TENT

           A TRAINER massages Coppi while he speaks to REPORTERS.

                                 REPORTER
                        It's been eight years since your 
                        last Tour.  Will you have trouble 
                        handling the mountains?

                                 COPPI
                        My legs are in twice the shape they 
                        were back then.
                                 REPORTER
                        What about Bartali?  Are you 
                        worried about him? 

                                 COPPI
                        I hope he doesn’t hurt his hands.

                                 REPORTER TWO
                        Hurt his hands?  

                                 COPPI
                        If that old man thinks pushing his 
                        wheelchair all the way up Alp 
                        d'Huez will be easy, he’s got 
                        another thing coming. 

           EXT. AVENUE PARC-DES-PRINCES. DAY

           WE PUSH THROUGH THE CHAOTIC scene...A man sits alone on the 
           curb...Invisible amongst the commotion--

           A few years older, a few more wrinkles, Bartali looks like a 
           man humbled. 

           He studies all the young faces.  All the fresh legs moving 
           past him.  Intimidated by the finely tuned youth of his 
           competition.  

           Alfredo laces a leather riding brace over his calf.

                                 BARTALI
                        They're so young.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Young and dumb.

                                 BARTALI
                        I try this and I'll be remembered 
                        as the old fool who still believed 
                        he could take Paris.

                                 ALFREDO
                        History's made by the fools who are 
                        too dumb to know when to quit.  
                           (pause)
                        Time may do hell to our muscles, 
                        but the thing in our guts that 
                        makes us ride...That thing knows 
                        nothing about time.  

           EXT. STARTING LINE

           The Riders assemble, we move past their faces:  Hard.  
           Unflinching.  Ready for battle faces.  Most young and 
           cocksure.  We recognize only a few from the '40 Tour...

           A slight BUZZ ignites through them.  It catches onto the 
           crowd, growing louder...
           Bartali rolls to the line.  

                                                  CUT TO:

           IN HIS JEEP AT FRONT OF THE TOUR MOTORCADE--JAMES LIGGET, the 
           British sports reporter, yells into his microphone.

                                 JAMES LIGGET
                        I must be seeing a ghost...Well, I 
                        think the rumors are true.  Gino 
                        Bartali is alive and he’s in Paris!

           Bartali clips into his pedal.  Kisses the crucifix around his 
           neck.  It’s the one we last saw in Adriana’s hand...

           A sudden crush of noise from the stands--

           Coppi takes his place on the starting line. 

                                 COPPI
                        The Old Man who found God and stole 
                        a last shot at Paris.  How Poetic.

           Bartali stares back impassive.     

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Racers take your ready...

           The racers test their brakes...Lock into their pedals...Reel 
           their cranks back...The moment seems to hang forever until--

           The STARTING GUN fires  The riders shoot off the line

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        And the thirty-fifth running of Le 
                        Tour de France is underway.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. LATER

           The mass of Riders thins into a snake.

           We SWOOP PAST the riders--Coppi and his BIANCHI teammates 
           lead the pack.  Bartali labors, mopping up the rear.  

           EXT. PARIS COUNTRYSIDE. LATER

           Coppi opens a three hundred meter lead over the peleton... 
           Bartali holds near the middle...

           EXT. COL DE VARS MOUNTAINS. DAY

           Climbing the mountains North of Paris.  The weaker riders 
           fall back as Bartali weaves through the traffic.

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        Bartali is making his move up the 
                        Col de Vars.

           Bartali cuts through the peleton...Passing a Polish Rider...A 
           couple of Brits...An American...
                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        The years don't seem to have slowed 
                        Bartali.  In fact, I don't think 
                        I've ever seen him stronger.

           He kicks in his afterburners.  Overtakes Coppi... 

           EXT. TROUVILLE. NIGHT

           Bartali screams down the mountains towards the village of 
           Trouville.  Thousands of RACE FANS flood the streets.

           He crosses the finish line unchallenged. 

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        And the impossible has just 
                        happened before my eyes!

           Bartali slips into the yellow jersey.  

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        At thirty-four, the man whose been 
                        nicknamed Il Vecchio, the old man, 
                        has just won his first Maillot 
                        Jeune of this race!

           EXT. DINARD. DAY

           Wearing the Yellow Jersey, Bartali leads the climb through 
           the mountains...

           TITLE CARD: STAGE TWO
                       TROUVILLE--DINARD

           LOUISON BOBET, a French rider, charges and passes...

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        And the Frenchman, Bobet, has 
                        overtaken Bartali.  Coppi trails a 
                        kilometer back.

           EXT. LA ROCHELLE.  DAY

           Now in the yellow jersey, Bobet screams through a small 
           coastal village.  Bartali follows, seconds behind...

           EXT. BIARRITZ. SOUTHERN FRANCE. DUSK

           With the sun setting over the Mediterranean behind him, Bobet 
           struggles up the climb...

           From a kilometer back Bartali strikes.  Devours the hill...

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        Bartali is striking on Bobet.

           Bartali whips past him...But then, an attacking rider over 
           his shoulder--
           COPPI.  Ten meters behind.  He drops to his biggest gear and 
           swerves right towards him.  For a moment they ride side by 
           side...

                                                  CUT TO:

           Still in the yellow, Coppi fights off a French rider...He 
           clicks his shifter and accelerates...

           TITLES:  STAGE 11
                    MARSEILLE--SAN REMO

           RACK BACK a kilometer to--THE PELETON.  Bartali has fallen 
           back further.  Laboring to keep pace.   

                                                  CUT TO:

                        ...And Fausto Coppi has just taken 
                        his eigth stage win...

           EXT. MOUNTAINS. NIGHT

           Freezing rain muddies the treacherous road.  

           Mud splattering his face, BARTALI fights, but the peleton 
           creeps away.  Alfredo races up next to him in a JEEP...

                                 ALFREDO
                        Faster!  You're losing ground.

           EXT. BRIANCON. DAY

           A winding road through open country.  Coppi sweeps past 
           hundreds of rabid fans...

           TITLES: STAGE 13
                   CANNES--BRIACON

           They cheer his name--COPPI!  COPPI!  COPPI!--And he breaks 
           his lead wide open--

           FIVE KILOMETERS BACK--BARTALI 

           SUDDENLY--IN THE CRUSH OF RIDERS BEFORE HIM--

           Two cyclists throw elbows.  Beating the hell out of each 
           other for position.  Bartali finds a hole to pass--
           When a DANISH CYCLIST slips out of his pedals, crashes in the 
           middle of the road right before him--

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        And Piot is down!

           SEVERAL CYCLISTS wreck into him.  Bartali skids, crashes into 
           the pile-up.

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        Bartali is down!

           Another RIDER slams down on top of Bartali.  Pins his ankle 
           and twists it...

           He wails out.  Frees himself from the snarl, jumps back on 
           his bike and fights to continue down the road.  But every 
           push of the pedals shreds through his bad ankle...

           He falls to the rear of the peleton.

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        It seems the era of Bartali has 
                        officially ended while the reign of 
                        Fausto Coppi continues.

           EXT. THE STARTING LINE--THE NEXT DAY

           Bartali takes his place on the starting line. 

           Coppi stares at him from down the line.  Just shakes his 
           head...Crazy old fool. 

           A FRENCH RIDER rolls up next to Bartali.  Pats him on the 
           shoulder, inspired.

                                 FRENCH RIDER
                        Give ‘em hell, Gino.

           And then a couple more RIDERS nod at Gino...

                                 RIDERS
                        ...Good luck...Way to hang in 
                        there, Bartali...

           Bartali’s stunned.   He clips into his pedals.  Prepares for 
           what could be his final ride...

                                 STARTER
                        Racers, take your ready...

           The Riders take their marks.  Ready to explode off the 
           line...The STARTER raises his pistol.  Fires--

           They leap off the line.  Fighting for position...

           Coppi pulls to an early lead.  Bartali fights to keep pace 
           with the pack, fending off the wicked pain in his leg...
           EXT. AIX-LES-BAINS. DAY

           The French Alps.  Overheated trucks stall on this, the first 
           of the Tour's historic climbs...

           Bartali drafts in the middle of the peleton.

           WE MOVE INTO HIS HEAD--All sound drains away.  Only the ROLL 
           OF HIS WHEELS...

           He drops to his biggest gear.  The chain snaps in place 
           around the sprocket.  He strikes--

           Carving his way through the peleton.  Each time he turns his 
           cranks, passing another rider...

           He's relentless.  Only one rider still ahead of him--

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        Bartali’s striking.

           COPPI.  Fifty meters ahead.  Bartali guns it, suddenly right 
           behind him--

           Coppi jukes.  Bartali fights him off and overtakes...

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        He's just overtaken Coppi!

           EXT. ALP D’HUEZ . DAY

           The widowmaker.  Like a giant corkscrew carved into the face 
           of the mountain, twelve kilometers of switchbacks cut up 
           France's tallest peak...

           Not an inch separates Bartali and Coppi as they dig up its 
           steep banks...

           Bartali, racked in unimaginable pain, thinks about quitting 
           with every push on his pedals.  But then his eyes drop to his 
           chest...

           To the crucifix.  He’s reminded of the sacrifices made so he 
           could be here, he focuses on the pain and it powers him...  

           He spins his cranks harder.  Coppi and he match revolutions, 
           neck and neck...

           EXT. ALP D'HUEZ. NEAR THE PEAK

           They crown the snowy peak.  HUNDREDS OF FANS explode--
           ...Lionman...Lionman...Lionman!

           Bartali and Coppi plunge down the other side.  Begin the 
           breakneck descent.  Bartali shifts to his biggest gear.  
           Whips down the hill with deadly speed...
           EXT. AIX-LES-BAINS. DAY

           Bartali races through the city...Fans running alongside 
           him...Motorcycles flanking behind...

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        What I'm seeing right now is 
                        reminiscent of the Bartali of old.

           He blazes across the finish line.

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        And Bartali takes Aix-Les-Bains!

           Bartali bolts off the starting line in SLO-MO.

           EXT. MULHOUSE. DAY

           High in the Alps.  He rolls over a rickety bridge slung over 
           a yawning chasm...

                       MULHOUSE--STRASBOURG

           EXT. STRASBOURG. DAY

           Mobs of fans run alongside Bartali.  He storms over the 
           finish line in Strasbourg...

           Coppi rides in several minutes later. 

           LEADER'S BOARD--Bartali's in fifth place.  Down only 10m 03s.

           EXT. THE FINISH LINE IN LIEGE

           Face racked in pain, Bartali wins another stage.

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        And he's taken Liege.  That makes 
                        five stage wins in a row...

           THE LEADER BOARD--Bartali's name is now second.  4m 12s 
           behind Coppi.

           Coppi eyes the leader board.   Smashes his water-bottle to 
           the ground in frustration.  He pulls his coach aside...
                                 COPPI
                        Find where he’s filling his water 
                        bottle and fill mine from the same 
                        fountain.

           EXT. ROUBAIX. DAY

           A twisting dirt pass high in the Alps.  The peleton has 
           broken up on the steepest of the climbs so far.  

           TITLE CARD:  STAGE 20
                        LIEGE--ROUBAIX

           Coppi leads the peleton by a kilometer.  His coach stands out 
           the open roof of the Bianchi team Jeep--

                                 COACH
                        Faster Fausto. 

           But we fly past Coppi to the summit of Mount Roubaix...

           Bartali's already crested the peak.  He speeds down the other 
           side.  Minutes ahead of Coppi.

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        Bartali's courage, his resolute 
                        determination has inspired even the 
                        most hardened of fans.  The former 
                        Il Vecchio has been bestowed with a 
                        new nickname here in France...
                           (beat)
                        The Lionman of Tuscany.

           EXT. ROUBAIX FINISH LINE

           Frenzied fans crowd both sides of the street.  Like a great 
           wave, they part to allow Bartali through--

           He storms over the line.  His sixth stage win in a row.  
           Alfredo rips him from his bike, shakes him excitedly.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Only one more stage, Gino.

                        ROBAIX--PARIS

           We drift past their faces:  Exhausted and beaten.  These are 
           no longer the cocksure young men we saw when the race began.  
           These miles have aged them.  

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        The riders will race through 
                        Roubaix and then climb the 
                        widowmaker, the dreaded Alp d'Huez, 
                        before making their way through 
                        Paris.
           Bartali takes his place on the starting line...

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        Though fifty-seven riders stand on 
                        that line, this race is really only 
                        between two...

           Still wearing the yellow jersey, Coppi lines up next to him.  
           Looks him square in the eyes.  

                                 COPPI
                        See you in Paris.  

           Bartali eyes him for a moment.  

                                 BARTALI
                        Meet me under the Arc de Triumphe 
                        and I’ll pour you a glass of my 
                        champagne.  

                                 COPPI
                        Or I’ll pour you a glass of mine.  
                        Good luck to you, Campanissimo.  

           Though the words mean so much, Bartali just nods.  Cranks his 
           pedals back.  Waits for that gun...

           JAMES LIGGETT reports from his jeep amongst the motorcade.

                                 JAMES LIGGET
                        After 4,664 kilometers, Fausto 
                        Coppi leads Gino Bartali by an 
                        overall margin of nine seconds.

           The Starting Judge raises his pistol.

                        Racers take your ready!

           The Riders take their marks, wait for the gun...

           He FIRES!  The Riders fire off the line.  Coppi pulls out to 
           an early lead.  Bartali sprints with the pack...

           EXT. AERIAL. THE ROAD TO PARIS

           From high above, the peleton looks like a line of ants 
           scrambling down the countryside...

           Bartali drafts off one of his Legano TEAMMATES near the rear 
           of the peleton.  Up ahead he sees Coppi round a distant bend--

           Bartali stalks him...Gains road...Finally passes Coppi...

           MONTAGE--BARTALI AND COPPI PIGGYBACK THE LEAD TOWARDS PARIS--

           --FANS chase as they race past farmland...Coppi cranks hard,

           --Coppi speeds through the flats of a valley, holding Bartali 
           behind him.

           --Driving up a knoll, Bartali breaks and catches Coppi.  
           Their pumping legs match revolutions...

           In the distance, a vast sea of dots.  A million FANS clog the 
           streets of Paris.

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        And they're neck and neck going 
                        into Paris!

           EXT. PARIS. DAY

           They thunder out of the mountains and shoot into the city.  
           The Eiffel Tower rising in the distance.  A MILLION PEOPLE 
           line the Champs Elysee...

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        We've seen races before, but never 
                        like this.  Never have athletes 
                        ridden with such passion.  Never 
                        have two men wanted anything more.

           LES PARC-DES-PRINCES

           The final sprint.  An awesome display of will as Coppi fights 
           to catch Bartali...

           A deafening CLAMOR erupts from the stands...Bartali blocks it 
           all out...Blocks out the pain in his leg.  Only focused on--

           The finish line approaching down the straightaway.  It all 
           seems to be happening in slow motion...

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        Only eight hundred meters to the 
                        finish!

           Coppi and Bartali race shoulder to shoulder...Legs pumping, 
           matching revolutions.  The finish five hundred meters ahead--

           Bartali kicks in the afterburners.  Drops a gear and explodes  
           Coppi falls back into his wake--

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        Bartali is gunning!

           The finish line four hundred meters away...Bartali pumps 
           faster...Pulls away and won’t be caught--

           The yellow ribbon tears over his chest!  Paris erupts!    

                                 JAMES LIGGET (O.S.)
                        This is nothing short of a Miracle! 
                        The Lionman has roared in Paris   
                        Gino Bartali wins the thirty-fifth 
                        running of the Tour de France!
           Thousands surge the Park des Princes...Rushing the street and 
           overflowing into it...ALFREDO runs up to Bartali, hands him 
           the Champione du Tour's Yellow Jersey.  

                                 ALFREDO
                        Le Maillot Jeune, Campanissimo. 
                        You’ve finally grown your wings.

           When--Sofia leaps into Alfredo’s arms.  Kisses his face a 
           thousand times...  

           Bartali slides into the Jersey.  Nothing's ever felt so good. 
           He sees someone pushing her way through the crowd--  

           It’s Adriana.  On her hip, their three year old son, ANDREA, 
           hides in his mother’s shoulder.  So much in Bartali’s look as 
           he reaches for them...

           For a second Bartali and Adriana just stare at one another. 

                                 ADRIANA
                        They haven’t forgotten your name.   

           He pulls her towards him and they kiss.  A kiss for all 
           eternity.  Then Bartali steps back, holds his hand out...

                                 BARTALI
                           (to his son)
                        Ready to take a ride, Andrea?

           Andrea nods excitedly.  Bartali helps Adriana onto the cross 
           bar of his bike.  Andrea sits in her lap.  

           Bartali takes a deep breath and pedals into his victory lap 
           around the Parc-des-Princes...Thousands of red roses shower 
           down on them...A MILLION HANDS reaching out...CONSTABLES hold 
           back the surging crowd--

           Through the chaos, Bartali recognizes a SKINNY MAN cheering 
           for him amongst the crowd...Then, a FAMILY...Then, an OLD 
           JEWISH WOMAN...GIOCOMO NISSIM and his children, SIMONA and 
           PAULO...   

           And this victory lap suddenly becomes about something much 
           more important than a yellow jersey.  It’s about the miracle 
           of all these lives.  All of them here because of him...   

           Bartali’s overwhelmed with emotion as he continues the 
           victory lap towards the Arc de Triumphe.  Finally fading into 
           its great shadow...   

           END TITLE CARDS:  

           At 34 Gino Bartali became the oldest rider to ever win the 
           Tour de France.  To this day he’s the only man to win his 
           second Yellow Jersey an entire decade after his first.  

           He passed away in May of 2000 having never spoken publicly of 
           his involvement with the Assisi underground.  
           It wasn't until the 2002 Tour de France that his wife, 
           Adriana, revealed that during the years of 1941-1944 he 
           helped save the lives of over 800 Italian Jews.  

           In 2006, Adriana was awarded the Gold Medal of Civil Action 
           by the President of Italy in Gino Bartali’s name.  

           Today he is remembered in Italy as both Campanissimo and 
           savior.
