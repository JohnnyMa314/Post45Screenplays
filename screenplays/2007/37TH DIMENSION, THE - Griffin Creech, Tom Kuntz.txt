           INT. MIDTOWN APARTMENT - DAYTIME

           Open on a large, traditionally styled Japanese apartment. 
           Simple but high end. Rice screen walls, tatami floors, art. A 
           large bodyguard-type sits by the door to a lavish tea room. 
           He reads a magazine.

           INT. APARTMENT - TEA ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A handsome 50 year old Japanese businessman sits across a 
           table from a miniature, yet strikingly beautiful Asian girl, 
           TOP 40. (she has all the same proportions of a normal person 
           but she is about 10% as big as a normal person). Her body is 
           exceptionally curvy and sexy. She’s dressed in a sexy, 
           stylized version of a schoolgirl’s outfit. There is also a 
           younger Japanese man sitting off to the side. 

           The younger Japanese man lifts a little mini-DV cam. The 
           record light goes on. He nods. 

                                 YOUNGER MAN
                        Do you mind if I film?

                                 TOP 40
                        (japanese cutesy-girl voice and 
                        accent) No. Not at all. Go ahead. 
                        That’s fine.

           The younger man smiles and does a small head bow in thanks. 

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.

           The older man looks at the younger man.

                                 YOUNGER MAN
                        Mr. Nagaki says it is wonderful to 
                        meet you, TOP 40, that your music 
                        is his favorite. He has enjoyed 
                        your concerts in Tokyo several 
                        times over past year, and is now so 
                        very pleased to spend time with you 
                        here in America. He asks, as first 
                        of three questions per arrangement 
                        brokered with your agents, please, 
                        number one question, if it is 
                        acceptable, how you do you deal 
                        with stress of your career as 
                        international pop star?

           She nods.
                                 TOP 40
                        Yes. It is stressful. However, I 
                        try to keep my life as simple as 
                        possible.

           The younger man translates for his boss.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Ah. Boyfurendo ga arimasuka?

                                 YOUNGER MAN
                        Hai.

           Top 40 looks, waiting.

                                 YOUNGER MAN
                        Mr. Nagaki would like to know.... 
                        Do you have a boyfriend?

           She smiles slightly.

                                 TOP 40
                        No. Not at the moment.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Ah so. Sumimasen, ja antawa ichiban 
                        sugoidesu. Anatawa kireina tsubo.

                                 YOUNGER MA N
                        Mr. Nagaki realizes it is 
                        unforgivable boldness to say, but 
                        he cannot stop from telling you 
                        that you are like a piece of 
                        pottery from his home prefecture, 
                        perfect in your imperfections. The 
                        beauty of nature in a woman. He is 
                        most pleased by this audience.

                                 TOP 40
                        Domo arrigato go zi mas.

           The older man nods and smiles.

           SFX: A slight rustling sound coming from the older man’s lap.

           The younger man hears it and quickly tries to keep her 
           attention.

                                 YOUNGER MAN
                        Ah, Mr. Nagaki wonders if you would 
                        sing for him.
                                 GIRL
                        But he didn’t say anything.

                                 YOUNGER MAN
                        He requested earlier that I ask 
                        you.

           TOP 40 looks suspicious.

           SFX: More rustling.

           Top 40 glances down past the edge of the table, at the lap of 
           the older Japanese man, he has his hand in his pants and is 
           furiously masturbating.

                                 TOP 40
                        Oh my...

           She jumps out of her chair and takes a few steps back from 
           the two men. The Japanese man doesn’t flinch. In fact, he 
           begins masturbating even more furiously.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Gomenasai, neh, watashi wa 
                        fushinsetsunakute.

           The assistant keeps the video camera trained on TOP 40. 

                                 YOUNGER MAN
                        (raises voice) Mr. Nagaki 
                        apologizes if this makes you 
                        uncomfortable.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Ohhh. Ahhh. Areki hai taki.

                                 YOUNGER MAN
                        Mr. Nagaki now requests please you 
                        accept his hulking load in your 
                        delicate white palms.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Ooh, Ahhh, Ohhhhh.

           Top 40 is panicked and appalled. She goes to walk out but the 
           younger man moves in front of her, still filming, blocking 
           her access to the door.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Ooh, Ahhh, Ohhhhh.
                                 TOP 40
                        (to bodyguard) Gerald! Gerald!

           INT. OUTSIDE THE TEAROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The bodyguard reading his magazine. We can hear the sounds of 
           TOP 40 screaming and of the climaxing Japanese man in the 
           room beyond. He stands up and goes to open the door but it’s 
           locked. He begins shaking it. Then throws himself against it, 
           but it holds.

           INT. OUTSIDE THE TEAROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Suddenly the lights begin to flicker, as if being tampered 
           with. 

           INT. TEAROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The lights continue to flicker for a moment and then the room 
           goes completely black with darkness. 

           The camera stays on the dark room. The sounds of the 
           climaxing old man are quickly replaced with sounds of a 
           struggle.... the sounds of Top 40’s muffled scream... duct 
           tape being pulled off the roll... the exclamations of the men 
           being turned into muffled grunts.

           TITLE FADES UP OVER DARKNESS: The 37th Dimension
           INT. SIDE STREET - MORNING

           SMITH DANGEROUS SMITH, mid to late 30s, indy musician looking 
           guy, slightly worse for wear but cool, is asleep in his car 
           on a completely deserted side street near a construction 
           site. His head against the steering wheel. In the passenger 
           seat is an empty bottle of cheap booze.

           Smith suddenly wakes up, not sure where he is. He rubs his 
           eyes, stretches.

           He starts up his car and pulls away.

           EXT. SMITH’S OFFICES - AN HOUR LATER

           Smith, looking just as disheveled as when he woke up, is 
           walking into some anonymous building in the diamond district. 

           Just out front of the building, a middle-aged Russian-looking 
           guy is talking on his cellphone, covering his mouth so no one 
           sees what he’s saying. He stops talking.

                                 RUSSIAN GUY
                        Hey, Smith.

                                 SMITH
                        Hey, Ronnie. Good, you?

                                 RUSSIAN GUY
                        Great, great, how’d the piece work 
                        out for your girl?

           Through the hangover, we see a little glimmer of pain on 
           Smith’s face.

                                 SMITH
                        Unfortunately we’re not seeing each 
                        other anymore.

                                 RUSSIAN GUY
                        See, you shoulda let me make you a 
                        bracelet to match...

           Smith shrugs and heads into the building.

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

           Smith walks into his offices, which feel like a contemporary 
           version of a classic film noir detective’s offices. 
           (Think “Chinatown”). His fresh faced assistant Johnny sits at 
           reception.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Hey Smith.

                                 SMITH
                        Johnny.

                                 JOHNNY
                        How ya doin?

                                 SMITH
                        Alright.

           Smith walks through the office toward the coffee maker.

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

           Camera pans to scan the walls of his office, taking in 
           various framed pictures of Smith with celebrities and 
           magazine articles about Smith, headlines about successful 
           investigations for kidnappings, thefts, murders, etc.

           Specifically we see a framed magazine cover.

           INSERT: “Who the stars call when the ransom note arrives-
           Smith Dangerous Smith”

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The camera comes off the wall to find Smith pouring himself 
           some coffee.

                                 JOHNNY

                        Mr. Mullins is here to see you.

                                 SMITH
                        OK.

           INT. SMITH’S PRIVATE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith walks into his private office. A middle-aged man, RAY 
           MULLINS, sits a bit anxiously in a chair.

                                 SMITH
                        Mr. Mullins, how are you?
                                 MULLINS
                        Good, Mr. Smith, thank you, and 
                        yourself?

                                 SMITH
                        Pretty good. 

           Smith strings it out a little.

                                 SMITH
                        Coffee?

                                 MULLINS
                        No, thank you.

                                 SMITH
                        So...

                                 MULLINS
                        Yes.

           Mullins moves to the edge of his chair.

                                 SMITH
                        Water?

                                 MULLINS
                        No. Mr. Smith, I really just...

           Mullins motions with his hands, wants to get on with it.

                                 SMITH
                        OK. (beat, takes a sip) Mr. 
                        Mullins, I’m going to cut right to 
                        it. (beat) Your wife’s not cheating 
                        on you. I can see why you thought 
                        she might be. I mean, she’s a 
                        looker. But she’s as close to a 
                        saint as you’re going to find. 
                        (beat) I wish I could tell my 
                        clients this every time.

           Smith reaches into his desk and pulls out a pack of photos. 
           He slides them over to Mullins who eagerly opens them. It 
           shows a lovely woman in her mid-thirties conversing with her 
           colleagues at some cheesy after-work bar.

                                 SMITH
                        See, she’s just hanging out, 
                        nothing major.

           Smith pulls out another photo.
                                 SMITH
                        Here, she’s, uh, actually showing 
                        some pictures of you to some of her 
                        coworkers. And I think it’s worth 
                        noting that I watched her switch to 
                        water after her second drink. It’s 
                        just not the way an out of control 
                        whore operates. If you’ll pardon my 
                        language.

           A few tears come to Mullins’ eyes. He pushes the photos away.

           The two men just sit there for a second.

                                 MULLINS
                        God, I feel terrible for doubting 
                        her. I’m such a miserable piece of 
                        fucking shi...(trails off. 

           Mullins pulls himself together as Smith nods and generally 
           tries to look sympathetic.

                                 MULLINS
                        At any rate, it’s good to know, Mr. 
                        Smith, thank you. I’m going to go 
                        now.

           Mullins starts to get up to leave. 

                                 MULLINS
                        ...Try to patch up what’s left of 
                        my marriage, if that’s even 
                        possible, now that it’s been 
                        ravaged by my pathetic 
                        insecurities.

           Mullins begin crying.

                                 SMITH
                        Hey, no judgements here. 

           Smith pushes some tissues across the desk. Mullins nods and 
           takes one. He wipes his eyes and gets up to go.

           Smith also rises, and walks around the desk to shake hands.

           Mullins hesitates for a second, then gives Smith a big bear 
           hug.

                                 MULLINS
                         (a little teary)Thank you.
                                 SMITH
                        (trying to act embarrassed)
                        Just doing my job, you know.

           Smith holds him out at arm’s length.

                                 SMITH
                        Look, sorry to make you come all 
                        the way down here, I just don’t 
                        like to give news over the phone.

                                 MULLINS
                        Of course. Again, thank you.

           Smith walks the man out. He closes the door. 

                                 JOHNNY
                           (leading)
                        Nice to give somebody some good 
                        news once in a while, huh?

           Smith stops and looks at Johnny for a second. A bit blank. 

                                 SMITH
                        Yeah. Definitely.

           Smith walks back into his office. He opens a drawer and pulls 
           out some photos.

           fraternity brothers at Mardi Gras. Everyone is wearing beads.

           Smith picks up his phone, dials a number.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Hello?

                                 SMITH
                        You’re still married.

           He hangs up without listening further. He takes the picture 
           and feeds it through a paper shredder. He then kneels down on 
           the floor, flips aside a piece of loose carpet, and reveals a 
           floor safe.
           He puts in the combination, opens it, and puts a wad of cash 
           into the safe.

           Smith walks out.

                                 SMITH
                        Be back in an hour.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Cool.

           Smith is almost at the door.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Hey, Smith.

                                 SMITH
                        Yeah.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Check this out.

           Johnny grabs a remote off his desk and turns up the TV. It’s 
           a special news report.

           Smith walks back in.

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Tight shot of the television.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        TOP 40, teen pop star sensation, 
                        has been reported kidnapped. 
                        Apparently abducted yesterday while 
                        making a private personal 
                        appearance, this comes as she 
                        prepares to launch her upcoming 
                        world tour to promote her new 
                        album.

           The TV shows footage of top 40 in concert, and a clip from a 
           video.

           Smith and Johnny shake their heads.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Wow, pretty crazy, huh?
           Smith nods.

                                 SMITH
                        Yeah. Be nice to get a call for 
                        that.

                                 JOHNNY
                        It could happen...

           Smith just looks at Johnny.

                                 JOHNNY
                        What, the actress? Hey man, it’s 
                        not your fault, you had a disease. 
                        Drug addiction is a disease. It’s 
                        in the past.

           Smith shrugs, and goes to walk out.

           The phone rings.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Smith Dangerous Smith and 
                        Associates. (beat) Just a moment 
                        please.

           Johnny puts the caller on hold.

                                 JOHNNY
                        It’s for you.

           Johnny’s look tells him it’s The Call.

                                 SMITH
                        Get the fuck outta here.

           Johnny raises his eyebrows.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Line 1.

           Smith casually makes his way over to the phone, motions for 
           Johnny to transfer the call.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I’ll put you through to Mr. Smith 
                        now.

           Johnny transfers the call.

           Smith looks at the phone and counts to twenty. Agonizingly 
           long, Johnny is freaking out. Motioning for him to take the 
           call.
                                 SMITH
                        This is Smith. Yes. Hello Mr. 
                        Greenberg. I’m sorry about the 
                        wait, I was just concluding some 
                        business with a client. It’s quite 
                        a busy time for us.

           He listens.

                                 SMITH
                        Yes, of course. We’ve been watching 
                        the coverage. Of course I’ll meet 
                        with you. (beat) The retainer, yes, 
                        in advance. At 2 o’clock, today. 
                        Yes.

           A slight smile comes across his face.

                                 SMITH
                        Johnny, let’s go to lunch.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - SAME DAY

           Roger The Turtle Man, a sixty-something man’s head attached 
           to a small turtle’s body, is at a table, having lunch with 
           his agent, TODD MILNER, 30s, cocky, well-groomed. They are 
           placing their order with the waiter. 

                                 AGENT
                        I’ll have the club steak.

           The waiter turns to Turtle Man. 

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        Just soup, please.

           The waiter leaves.

                                 AGENT
                        So, Roger, how’s it going?

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        Well, Todd, pretty damn slow, and 
                        it doesn’t get any faster when you 
                        send me on parts like that Southern 
                        aristocrat thing yesterday.

           The agent talks as he butters and eats a roll. Mouth full of 
           food.
                                 AGENT
                        Oh, you were great for that, you 
                        should have read for it.

           Turtle Man just looks at him.

                                 AGENT
                        Look, the thing is, there’s kind of 
                        a glut in the market for turtle men 
                        right now. It’s the same for anyone 
                        unique... Your career will go 
                        through phases like this. At first, 
                        people are gonna be  like “holy 
                        shit, a turtle man.”. But now.. 
                        People have seen you and that 
                        initial novelty has worn off... 
                        it’s a little played out. People 
                        don’t give a shit that you won an 
                        Oscar thirty years ago. But that’s 
                        just right now... it’s like 
                        Travolta. Remember Travolta before 
                        Pulp Fiction? Remember what a 
                        fucking shit storm his career was 
                        in? You just have to be patient. 
                        Wait for your Pulp Fiction. That’s 
                        all. And in the meantime, keep your 
                        mouth shut, no more radical 
                        political statements, no more 
                        standing in solidarity with your 
                        socialist brothers in East Timor 
                        bullshit. BE an entertainer. That’s 
                        what we’re focusing on here. 
                        Entertainment.

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        So in the meantime you send me on 
                        an open call to be a plantation 
                        owning shipping magnate named 
                        Xavier Thibodeaux? 
                           (beat)
                        Christ, why do I need an agent for 
                        that, I can read it on the back 
                        page of the Stage Door.

           Agent holds his hand up, with a roll in it, gesturing for 
           emphasis.

                                 AGENT
                        Look. I think right now you’re 
                        probably best served regenerating 
                        yourself in theater. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AGENT (cont'd)
                        Look around, it’s a goddamn on-deck 
                        circle back into film. And it’s The 
                        actor’s medium, right? All that 
                        horseshit. 

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        I guess, it’s just that after Helen 
                        passed, I-

                                 AGENT
                        Helen?

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        My wife.

                                 AGENT
                        Your wife. Jesus. 

           The two men look at each other. Conversation stopped.

                                 AGENT
                        Sorry to hear that.

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        You did hear it. I invited you to 
                        the funeral.

                                 AGENT
                        Really?

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        Yes.

                                 AGENT
                        My assistant must not have given me 
                        the message, but I’ve got a new one 
                        now.

           Turtle Man just stares at the agent. The agent finally 
           breaks.

                                 AGENT
                        (beat) Shit. Roger, I’m sorry. 
                        Well, let’s have a drink to her at 
                        least.

           The agent motions to the waiter.

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        No, look, it’s fine. It’s done. 
                        It’s been a year. I don’t want to 
                        mourn my wife. I just want to work.
           Turtle Man tries to put a smile on his face. But it’s faint 
           and strained. There is a silence. The waiter is standing 
           there, just waiting.

                                 AGENT
                        Two champagnes. No, shit, that’s 
                        too celebratory. Two, oh hell..

           The agent looks up at the waiter.

                                 AGENT
                        What’s a good serious drink, like a 
                        somber type of drink?

                                 WAITER
                        What, like a Scotch or something?

                                 AGENT
                        Yeah, like a Scotch, but uh, more, 
                        you know, serious.

                                 WAITER
                        Like a single malt Scotch?

                                 AGENT
                        Yeah, like a single malt. Bring us 
                        something like that.

           The agent’s blackberry beeps. He stands up, puts some cash on 
           the table. Turtle Man looks at him.

                                 AGENT
                        Shit. I’ve gotta run. Drink mine 
                        for me, will you? We’ll talk next 
                        week.

           The agent pats him on the shell, and walks off.

           EXT. OUTSIDE RESTAURANT -  A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Turtle Man exits the restaurant. He gets into his car and 
           begins to try to negotiate out of the tight parallel parking 
           situation he’s in.

           Directly behind Turtle Man’s car, only half in frame, we see 
           a white VW van.

           INT. VW VAN - CONTINUOUS

           We see the interior of the van.

           It’s a neat and clean white VW van(circa 1970’s). Six young 
           Haitian men are inside. Neat haircuts. Quite dark-skinned, 
           wearing ties and short-sleeved shirts, name tags, etc.

           The two men up front are LIONEL and GEORGE. 

           In the very back of the van is a variety of sales material 
           for business schemes with a Caribbean flair. (A cleanse 
           involving palm syrup. Or a charity on Mont Serrat that helps 
           poor people get jobs making bags out of old cane sugar sacks. 
           Beach houses on the rattiest, shittiest Caribbean island.)

           INT. VW VAN - CONTINUOUS

           The men are on their lunch break, eating stew out of 
           tupperware containers. George looks up at Turtle Man trying 
           to back out of this spot.

                                 GEORGE
                        Brother, I believe that man is not 
                        as in possession of his spatial 
                        faculties as he might be.

                                 LIONEL
                        Indeed, brother, perhaps a gentle 
                        toot of the horn would be in order. 
                        But softly, for a hostile attitude 
                        is not a positive business 
                        practice.

           Just then, Turtle Man ever so slightly taps their front 
           bumper with his car.

           INT. VW VAN - CONTINUOUS

           The four Haitians in the back all stir expectantly, though 
           George and Lionel up front don’t betray any emotion 
           whatsoever.
           INT. TURTLE MAN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Turtle Man is craning his turtle neck, clearly having a hard 
           time seeing what’s happened. Looking into rearview. Angrily 
           shifts the car into Park.

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        Shit.

           INT. VW VAN - CONTINUOUS

           The Haitians get out of the van. At first just Lionel and 
           George, then the four others pile out. One of them is 
           physically much larger than the other five.

           INT. TURTLE MAN’S CAR

           Turtle Man sees them coming in the rearview, with great 
           effort he shifts in his seat so he can face the window.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

           The Haitians walk over to Turtle Man, and lean down to talk 
           to him through the driver side window.

                                 GEORGE
                        Did you not realize you were quite 
                        close to our vehicle, uncle?

                                 TURTLE MAN   
                        What?

                                 LIONEL
                        Do you require assistance, uncle? 
                        Do you not understand where you 
                        are? 

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        (irritated) I know where I am. 
                        Look, you guys were parked pretty 
                        goddamn close to my car. 

                                 LIONEL
                        Hey!

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        What?
                                 LIONEL
                        I’ll thank you to keep the 
                        profanity out of it, uncle. What if 
                        a child were to walk by?

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        WHAT? What the fuck are you talking 
                        about?

           Just then a child walks by. A couple of the lesser Haitians 
           take the child by the shoulders, escort him about ten feet 
           down the sidewalk and give him a dollar bill and a candy. 
           Then walk back over.

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        Look, I don’t remember you being 
                        parked here before I went to lunch. 
                        You guys pulled up right on my ass. 
                        You need to pay more attention. 
                        Look, there’s no damage. I have an 
                        appointment. So can we just forget 
                        about it?  

           Lionel and George and the others just stare at Turtle Man. 
           Turtle Man waits for them to say something. Lionel weighs 
           Turtle Man’s words for a moment, and then finally steps back 
           and extends his hand out, granting Turtle Man permission to 
           leave.

                                 GEORGE
                        Have a pleasant day, Uncle.

           INT. TURTLE MAN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Turtle Man drives away.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

                                 LIONEL
                        I was upset by that man, brother.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes, I too. But remember, until 
                        they are a customer, they are a 
                        potential customer. 

                                 LIONEL
                        Amen, brother.

           The other Haitians all nod in agreement.
           INT. STRIP CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Johnny and Smith are eating a big platter of fried food at a 
           really second rate strip club. Smith is doing shots and 
           drinking beers. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        You sure you should be drinking?

                                 SMITH
                        I’ll be fine.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Seriously, Smith-

           Smith silences Johnny with a look. They sit there for a 
           second.

                                 SMITH
                           (faux sincere)
                        Alright, look, I appreciate what 
                        you’re saying, it’s just that, I’ve 
                        got some butterflies, you know? I 
                        can...WE, can really use this 
                        money. I mean, it’s been a couple 
                        of months since I paid you.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I’m getting by.

                                 SMITH
                        Yeah, well.. That’s not good 
                        enough.

           The two men look at one another. It’s very sincere.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Oh shit, Smith, it’s 
                        understandable, you know, but maybe 
                        you just shouldn’t...

           The seriousness of the moment is broken as Smith signals to 
           the waitress for two more.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Well, I guess a couple is ok, as 
                        long as you can handle it.

           Smith motions a couple of the girls over. He looks at them 
           both, then grabs the prettier one, and plops her down in his 
           lap.
           EXT. RESIDENTIAL SIDE STREET - THAT DAY

           We see an exterior of a decent townhouse. 

           INT. TURTLE MAN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Turtle man enters his apartment and fixes himself a Scotch at 
           the wet bar in his living room. His home is nice, but 
           decidedly from the 70s.

           He puts on a record album on his antiquated record player.

           MUSIC IN: Leonard Cohen’s Suzanne

           He walks over to an easy chair and eases himself into it. 
           Exhales, letting the day’s stress fall away a bit.

           He looks up at a picture on the wall.

           INSERT: A younger Turtle man holding his wife in one arm, an 
           Oscar in the other, circa 1973.

           INSERT ANOTHER PHOTO: A younger turtle man helping to open a 
           restaurant with some celebrity pals.

           INSERT ANOTHER PHOTO: Him more recently standing arm in arm 
           with native tribesmen in Irian Jaya, blocking a dirt road in 
           the forest to loggers.

           He looks back at the picture of his wife. She was very 
           beautiful. Like Anne Bancroft.

           INT. TURTLE MAN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Turtle Man takes a sip of his Scotch.

           Just then, a black hand reaches into frame and gently takes 
           the Scotch from Turtle Man and lightly tosses it away.

           It bounces on the thick carpet but doesn’t break. Scotch 
           spills into the carpet.

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        Jesus Christ.

           Cut to reveal all six Haitians standing there in Turtle Man’s 
           apartment. Lionel and George stand front and center.

                                 LIONEL
                        Factory fucking mint.
                                 GEORGE
                        Fucking shitbag.

                                 LIONEL
                        Swearin’ in front of the 
                        motherfuckin’ children.

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        What the hell are you doing? How 
                        the hell did you get in here?

                                 GEORGE
                        What do you think we’re doing?

                                 LIONEL
                        Really, it’s a silly question.

                                 GEORGE
                        Clearly we have gained unauthorized 
                        access to your dwelling, and it 
                        seems unlikely-

                                 LIONEL
                        Highly unlikely.

                                 GEORGE
                        That we are here on a mission of 
                        mercy. 

                                 LIONEL
                        Unless it were to rid the world of 
                        an old cranky cumwad who smells 
                        like pond water. 

                                 GEORGE
                        And should not have a driver’s 
                        license.

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        Oh, jesus, look, I’m sorry about 
                        your car, I didn’t-

                                 GEORGE
                        As are we, Uncle. And there was a 
                        moment where an apology might have 
                        resolved things.

                                 LIONEL
                        This moment has passed. 
                                 TURTLEMAN
                        You need to leave. I just hit the 
                        panic button on my alarm system. 
                        The police are coming right now.

           Lionel shakes his head. It’s the most ridiculous lie he’s 
           ever heard.

           George turns from examining Turtle Man’s wall of photos.

                                 GEORGE
                        Lionel, this piece of shit is 
                        famous.

                                 LIONEL
                        No.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes. 

           George picks up the picture of Turtle Man’s beautiful wife 
           off the wall.

                                 GEORGE
                        Is this your wife?

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        Yes.

           George grows excited and rubs his crotch.

                                 GEORGE
                        Where is she. I wish to rape her. 
                        Immediately. I am very excited at 
                        the prospect. 

                                 TURTLE MAN
                        She’s dead.

           Lionel backhands Turtle Man’s face, knocking him to the 
           floor.

                                 LIONEL
                        You sick fuck, my brother does not 
                        wish to rape a dead woman. God help 
                        you for suggesting it.

           At this point, Turtle Man retreats his head, arms and legs 
           into his shell.

                                 GEORGE
                        Into the bathroom.
           INT. TURTLE MAN’S BATHROOM - 10 MINUTES LATER

           A couple of the other Haitians have filled up the tub, they 
           are holding Turtle Man underwater. They bring him up.

                                 GEORGE
                        Had enough?

           The old turtle man looks frazzled and scared but not quite as 
           bad as he should.

                                 LIONEL
                        Brother, it occurs to me that we 
                        cannot drown a turtle.

                                 GEORGE
                        Aha. Correct you are. A silly 
                        oversight on my part. To the 
                        kitchen.

           INT. TURTLE MAN’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Hard cut to a close up of a gas stove burner igniting. The 
           flames ignite with a whoosh.

           Cut wider to see that all four burners are on high flame.  
           The sound is roaring loud.

           Lionel and George are struggling to hoist Turtle Man onto the 
           stove. 

           Turtle man shrieks in horror.

           Lionel and George grin at one another.

           Lionel opens up a pack of Wheat Thins and checks his watch. 

           Lionel thumps the top of Turtle Man’s shell with a kitchen 
           spoon. 

                                 LIONEL
                        (mouth full of food)
                        Old man, you still in there?
           Turtle Man whimpers in pain.

                                 LIONEL
                        Just checking.

           INT. KITCHEN - A FEW MINUTES LATER 

           Turtle Man’s shell is smoking. Smoke fills the kitchen.

           Lionel and George still hold him firmly in place.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A couple of the other Haitians are watching a soccer match on 
           TV.

           Boiling liquid begins seeping out of Turtle Man’s shell and 
           hitting the burners, sending up steam.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Lionel is holding Turtle Man in place using oven mitts.

           Turtle Man’s head finally pops out. His head is steaming, 
           scalded, blistered. He screams in agony.

                                 LIONEL
                        An opportunity has made itself 
                        known, my brother.

                                 GEORGE
                        Indeed it has, brother.
           With that, George instantly sinks a kitchen knife down into 
           turtle man’s neck. Killing him instantly. His head now stuck 
           outside the shell. It’s sudden and gruesome.

           INT. VW VAN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Driving. The two Haitian men up front smile at one another. 
           The scenario is utterly peaceful and in complete contrast to 
           the last scene. 

           INT. VW VAN - CONTINUOUS

                                 GEORGE
                        Beautiful day, eh, brother.

                                 LIONEL
                        A beautiful day for conducting 
                        business, brother. 

                                 GEORGE
                        In a world ever more free of the 
                        ridiculous constraints of 20th 
                        century trade barriers.

                                 LIONEL
                        Amen.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           We see the van change lanes, perfectly executing the turn 
           signal, and smoothly sliding over. Lionel even sticks his arm 
           out the window to make a right turn signal.

           EXT. AIRPORT - SAME DAY

           A large private jet comes in for a landing.

           EXT. AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

           A rolling staircase is pulled up to the side of the airplane.

           EXT. PRIVATE AIRPLANE HATCH - CONTINUOUS

           The hatch is opened. A beautiful stewardess opens the door. 
           J.T. MONAHAN, a powerful Texas billionaire playboy steps into 
           the doorway. Around 35, roughly handsome, cowboy hat, hand-
           tooled boots, boot cut slacks, and a suede western cut sports 
           coat gets out. He holds what looks like a very fancy leather 
           bowling bag. He walks down the steps.

                                 J.T.
                        Suzanne, next time we see each 
                        other, I plan to be even RICHER.

           He chuckles at his own bad joke, grabs her ass, walks out of 
           frame and down the stairs.

           EXT. TARMAC - CONTINUOUS

           The chauffeur tries to carry the bag for J.T. but he hands 
           the guy his hat instead. J.T. sits down in the car, unzips 
           the top of the bowling bag, then pours himself a drink from 
           the mini-bar in the car.

           INT. CAR - 10 MINUTES LATER

           J.T. looks out the window as the car passes a huge 100 foot 
           high billboard on the side of an industrial building.

           The billboard is of two tiny men (10% the size of a normal 
           person) sparring. One of them is in a karate outfit. The 
           other little man is a greased up, very muscular black man 
           with chunky African villager jewelry on.

           INSERT: The Little Titan World Championships. DEATH!

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           J.T. puts his hand on his bowling bag.

           EXT. PIERRE HOTEL - DAY

           J.T. Monahan gets out of the limo and goes inside the hotel.

           INT. SUITE OF PIERRE HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           J.T. enters his suite. He puts the bag down on the bed. He 
           picks up the phone and calls room service.

                                 MONAHAN (THICK TEXAN ACCENT)
                        I’d like an ounce of beluga, blinis 
                        and all that shit too. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MONAHAN (THICK TEXAN ACCENT) (cont'd)
                        I’m also gonna need a pound of 
                        fresh ground sirloin, tri-tip if 
                        you got it. Raw.

           J.T. Is interrupted.

                                 MONAHAN (CONT’D)
                        I want some fuckin’ steak tartare, 
                        I’ll ask you for some fuckin’ steak 
                        tartare. Just the pound of beef. 
                        Don’t put no goddamn garnishes on 
                        it. And bring up a magnum of the 
                        1990 Pommery while you’re at it. 
                        Thank you.

           Monahan hangs up and goes over to the bed and pulls the 
           pillows off of it and throws them on the floor. He then 
           unzips his bowling bag, and goes to take a leak, leaving the 
           bathroom door open.

           INT. SUITE OF PIERRE HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           The bag sits there on the bed as J.T. pisses.

           Then the bag RUSTLES.

           It rustles again. There’s a beat as we wonder what the hell’s 
           in it.

           A 12 inch tall man climbs out, CHAMP, formally known as VERN 
           CARTER. He is also dressed as a cowboy. He stretches.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 J.T. 
                           (calls out over shoulder)
                        How you feelin’ today, champ?

           Champ cracks his neck side to side.

                                 CHAMP
                        Pretty good, J.T, How ‘bout you?

                                 J.T.
                        Oh, alright. 

                                 CHAMP
                        Fell asleep there when we was goin’ 
                        over the Ozarks. Damn, that’s 
                        pretty country. 
                                 J.T.
                        Sure as hell is. You need anything, 
                        champ?

                                 CHAMP
                        Just some grub, J.T.

           J.T. zips up and walks over to the bed.

                                 J.T.
                        On the way, just called down for 
                        it.

                                 CHAMP
                        (nods) What’s the line today on the 
                        fight?

                                 J.T.
                        You’re a three to one favorite, old 
                        son. Some woman by the name of Inez 
                        DeCooper is apparently bringin’ 
                        some little Filipino hill fighter 
                        who’s just kicked’ the shit outta 
                        some people in them overseas 
                        matches. Anyway, he’s gettin’ a lot 
                        a press. (beat) Sonofabitch wears a 
                        loincloth.

                                 CHAMP
                        I’ll be damned. A Fillypino. Aint 
                        never fought one a them. And what’d 
                        the hell you say he wears?

                                 J.T
                        A loincloth. Like a little towel, 
                        with a belt to cover his balls and 
                        what not. It’s, uh, traditional.

                                 CHAMP
                        Sounds like some kind of fuckin’ 
                        indian. Well, I reckon I’ll do 
                        alright. I jus hope he don’t get to 
                        try to workin’ no black magic or 
                        hexes on me. I don’t kin to that 
                        horseshit, gets on my nerves.

                                 J.T.
                        You’ll be fine. 

           J.T. takes a sip from a highball glass of whiskey.
                                 J.T.
                        Now let’s see the goddamned 
                        reignin’ world champ knock out a 
                        couple hunnert pushups before 
                        dinner.

                                 CHAMP
                        That’d be my pleasure, J.T.

           The little man drops down on the bed and starts knocking out 
           one-armed pushups as J.T. watches, nodding in approval and 
           takes a gulp of his drink.

           EXT. HEADQUARTERS OF TKG MUSIC- LATER THAT DAY

           Smith and Johnny are in Smith’s car, pulling up outside the 
           building. Johnny puts the car in park. Johnny looks at Smith. 
           Smith looks out the window, up at the building. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        Good luck, man.

           Smith looks at Johnny briefly, then opens the door.

                                 SMITH
                        Thanks Johnny, ‘ppreciate the ride.

           EXT/INT. HEADQUARTERS OF TKG MUSIC - CONTINUOUS

           Smith walks into the lobby of the soaring skyscraper. He goes 
           through security and heads into the express elevator.

           He looks like shit. Weaving a little as he walks. 

           In the elevator he produces a little baggy of speed and does 
           a quick bump, wipes his nose, and runs in place for a second, 
           then cracks his neck from side to side. Punches the air a 
           couple of times.

                                 SMITH
                        Alright. Fuckin’ on deck.

           INT. HEADQUARTERS OF TKG MUSIC - CONTINUOUS

           He gets out and is met by a secretary, Avi Greenberg.

                                 AVI (SLIGHT ISRAELI ACCENT)
                        Mr. Smith, please come this way.
           As the two men walk, Avi puts out his hand. Smith takes it, 
           and shakes.

                                 AVI
                        I’m Avi Greenberg, Mr. Kiberton’s 
                        personal assistant. We spoke on the 
                        phone. Thank you for meeting with 
                        us on such short notice. You have a 
                        card?

           Smith nods. He hands it to him.

           INSERT: Smith’s card. It’s white and simply designed. It says 
           “Smith, Dangerous Smith: Private investigator”.

                                 SMITH
                        You’ve got my retainer?

                                 AVI
                        We’ll address that in the meeting.

                                 SMITH
                        Also, I like to keep my involvement 
                        in cases out of the press. 

                                 AVI
                        Of course.

           INT. BOARDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They walk into a lavish boardroom. Framed gold and platinum 
           records line the walls. There are four or five people in 
           suits as well as a couple of rumpled detectives. The suits 
           stand. The detectives stay seated. One man walks toward 
           Smith.

                                 MR. KIBERTON 
                        Hello, Mr. Smith, I’m Francis 
                        Kiberton, CEO of TKG Music. You 
                        come highly recommended. As we 
                        understand, these high profile 
                        cases are your forte. Or used to 
                        be.

                                 SMITH
                        Yeah, I’ve diversified a bit.

           The cops laugh a little.

                                 MR. KIBERTON
                        Well, Mr. Smith, let’s sit and we 
                        can discuss our situation.
                                 SMITH
                        Fine.

                                 MR. KIBERTON
                        Coffee, juice?

                                 SMITH
                        No thanks. 

           They direct Smith to a chair near the head of the long table. 
           Smith sits.

           INT. BOARD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kiberton looks around the room.

                                 MR. KIBERTON
                        Hello, everyone, thank you for 
                        coming in. I realize the events of 
                        yesterday have come as quite a 
                        shock, but I hope that by acting 
                        quickly we can minimize our losses.

           Everyone sits down.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Mr. Smith is a private detective we 
                        have retained to aid in the rescue 
                        of Top 40. He has been involved in 
                        a number of high profile cases in 
                        the past including the abduction of 
                        the Goldberg twins, and their 
                        eventual rescue.

           The board nods. The detectives look annoyed.

                                 MR. KIBERTON
                        As you know, our highest-grossing 
                        artist, Top 40, was kidnapped 
                        yesterday as she made a personal 
                        appearance.

           There is general murmuring from the board.

                                 MR. KIBERTON
                        As you may also know, we have 
                        invested a great deal of money in 
                        Ms. 40. And for the last four 
                        years, she has returned the favor, 
                        in spades.
           Kiberton stops and touches the table for emphasis during the 
           next few words.

                                 MR. KIBERTON
                        And now we find our precious angel 
                        missing. It’s very problematic. All 
                        our thoughts are towards a quick 
                        rescue.

           All the executives around the table nod. 

           Smith nods. Kiberton looks over and slightly raises his voice 
           to get their attention.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Mr. Smith, I don’t want to waste 
                        any time. We’ll have a short 
                        briefing now, and then the police 
                        as well as Avi on our side will 
                        further elaborate. We’re eager for 
                        you to get to work. (beat) However. 
                        I do want to discuss one thing with 
                        you. We understand that in the past 
                        there have been a few 
                        discrepancies, shall we say, in 
                        your methodology. That being noted, 
                        I wish to make something clear. It 
                        is only a fortunate confluence of 
                        events that brings you to this 
                        room. That being the unavailability 
                        of several of your contemporaries 
                        combined with the similarity of 
                        this case to some you’ve solved in 
                        the past. And, if I may be frank, 
                        our desperation to light a fire 
                        under the torpid bottoms of the 
                        police department in this matter.

           The cops look a little annoyed at this comment.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Do I have your assurance that 
                        reliability won’t be a concern, Mr. 
                        Smith?

           Smith sits there for a minute.

                                 SMITH
                        Yes.
                                 KIBERTON
                        Mmmhmmm. And we can trust that this 
                        case won’t end in you wandering 
                        around in the woods with an 
                        undelivered bag of ransom, talking 
                        to trees, while a girl gets chopped 
                        to bits?

           Two board members are whispering to one another, they stop 
           cold and look at Smith when Kiberton says this. One of the 
           detectives whistles under his breath.

                                 SMITH
                        Definitely.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Good.

           Kiberton nods at Avi, who passes an envelope to Smith across 
           the table.

                                 AVI
                        Retainer, contact numbers, ND 
                        agreement, waiver form of 
                        publication rights.

           Smith nods. Signs a few forms. Hands them back.

                                 SMITH
                        Look, I just want to say that, 
                        well, there’s not a day that goes 
                        by that I don’t think about that 
                        poor girl.(beat) And if there can 
                        be any sort of bright side to a 
                        situation like that, I’ve been 
                        clean and sober for 436 days. And 
                        I’ve devoted my life and 5% of my 
                        earnings to the service of Jesus 
                        Christ. 

           Smith makes eye contact with some of the board members as he 
           speaks.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Particularly in the inner city.

           The board members nod.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Well, excellent. We also give a 
                        small percentage of our corporate 
                        earnings to charity.
           The brief pause suggests this is not true. 

           INT. BOARD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kiberton nods at Avi. Avi dims the lights and hits a 
           projection machine. 

           A slide show begins on the far wall.

           A ransom note comes up.

                                 AVI
                        We received this ransom note late 
                        last night instructing us as to how 
                        we would receive messages from the 
                        kidnappers. They are asking for $20 
                        million. And if we don’t comply, as 
                        you can see they’ve issued all the 
                        standard threats about death and 
                        dismemberment. 

           INSERT: a piece of a sentence from the note reading “cut out 
           the bitch’s vocal cords and use them to make a kazoo”

                                 SMITH
                        Jesus.

           The room murmurs.

                                 SMITH
                        They sound serious.

                                 KIBERTON
                        So it seems. (beat) Detective 
                        Murray from the police department 
                        is here, and has agreed to brief 
                        you on some of their findings. 
                        Thank you, Mr. Smith. Anything 
                        else?

                                 SMITH
                        Yes. I told your man there, I don’t 
                        like any mention in the press, it 
                        gets in-

           Kiberton holds up a hand.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Mr. Smith, I can tell you, in all 
                        seriousness, we have no desire for 
                        your name to be publicized anywhere 
                        remotely CLOSE to that of our own.
           Smith is humbled. 

                                 KIBERTON
                        Just speaking frankly.

                                 SMITH
                        Sure.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Thank you, Mr. Smith.

           Kiberton turns and begins conversing with the other board 
           members.

           INT. SIDE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The detective is talking to Smith. He passes some photos over 
           to Smith of the kidnapping scene. It looks like a Juergen 
           Teller photo series. Flash photography of bound and gagged 
           Japanese men.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Private appearance with a Japanese 
                        businessman. The Japs say the 
                        lights went out, somebody whacks 
                        them on the head with something, 
                        probably a pistol. They get duct 
                        taped and gagged. All the while the 
                        bodyguard’s stuck outside because 
                        the room’s locked from the inside. 
                        Lights come up, the girl’s gone. 
                        Building security’s got nothing. No 
                        witnesses on the street. 

                                 SMITH
                        How’d they get in if they didn’t go 
                        past the bodyguard?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        The tearoom also opened onto a 
                        service hallway. Which was 
                        unguarded.

                                 SMITH
                        Was the building searched?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Thoroughly. Roof to basement, sewer 
                        and utility tunnels underneath. 

           Smith takes all this in. The Detective pushes play on a VCR. 
                                 DETECTIVE
                        This is the videotape the assistant 
                        recorded during the appearance. 

           The detective fast-forwards through much of it, including the 
           now comically hyper-fast scene of the old man beating off. 

           Smith watches intently. His head bobs a little as he watches.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Are you drunk?

                                 SMITH
                        What? No.

           The detective turns off the VCR. Grabs a few folders, hands 
           them over to Smith. Smith looks at them, waiting for 
           explanation.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        The best leads we have so far.

           Smith takes the folders, the detective gets up.

                                 SMITH
                        Any elaboration on why these guys?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        It’s all in there, I don’t have to 
                        hold your hand. I just have to give 
                        you the information. Not that 
                        you’re going to do anything with 
                        it.

                                 SMITH
                        (under breath, sort of) Asshole.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        What?

                                 SMITH
                        Cocksucker. 

           Smith puts his shades on and stands up, walks out.

           INT. MAGNIFICENT UPTOWN APARTMENT - THAT EVENING

           The home of a wealthy socialite, INEZ DECOOPER. Beautiful, 
           older, perfectly dressed. She stands at the window, fingering 
           the drapes, smoking, speaking to her antique dealer, BURTON 
           TIMMS.
                                 SOCIALITE
                        So you say, Mr. Timms, but I’m not 
                        sure I need another priceless 
                        ancient Sumerian relic.

           Mr. Timms wears a somewhat threadbare yet well-tailored suit, 
           and mops his brow. There is an array of small carved stone 
           items laid out on a velvet jeweler’s cloth in front of him.

                                 MR. TIMMS
                        But madame, it’s one of a kind, I 
                        purchased it at a considerable 
                        cost, to myself, on the assumption 
                        that you would be interested, I of 
                        course reference our previous 
                        arrangement by which you placed-

                                 INEZ
                        Previous arrangement, Mr. Timms, 
                        previous. I find that I have just 
                        about all the limestone scarabs and 
                        giant pearl scepters that any one 
                        woman needs. 
                           (beat)
                        No, I’m not accepting delivery. I 
                        find the sport is gone from 
                        collecting the artifacts of dead 
                        civilizations, Mr. Timms. I’m 
                        putting my money into more...lively 
                        entertainment these days. Now get 
                        out of here, and take your trinkets 
                        with you.

           Mr. Timms pauses for a moment, and then begins to gather up 
           his priceless relics and put them in his case. He grabs his 
           hat and turns to walk out without a word.

           INT. MAGNIFICENT UPTOWN APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Cut to an ankle-height POV shot running straight towards Mr. 
           Timms.

           Right as it gets to Mr Timms’ ankle...

           INT. MAGNIFICENT UPTOWN APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Cut to shot of a little Filipino tribesman(10% human size) 
           wielding a sword nearly as long as his body. He swings it 
           above his head, and into the ankle of Mr. Timms. 
                                 TIMMS
                        Ahhhhh, dear God.

           Instantly, Timms’ pant leg begins turning red with blood. 

           INT. MAGNIFICENT UPTOWN APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Inez attempts to control the little man.

                                 INEZ
                        Sumpar! Sumpar! No! No!

                                 TIMMS
                        My god, what is it? What is it?

           Inez ignores Timms and begins banging an ashtray on a table 
           to make him stop. 

                                 INEZ
                        Sumpar, get back into the kitchen! 
                        DO NOT make me get Maria!!

           Begrudgingly, Sumpar does as he is told. But right before 
           going into the kitchen, he turns and runs back over and takes 
           another hack at Timms’ leg.

                                 SUMPAR
                        Arrrhhhhh!

           INT. OFF TRACK BETTING - A FEW HOURS LATER

           Smith is at the OTB, a racing form in his hand. He’s wasted. 
           He watches a buggy race on the closed circuit television.

           His horse loses.

                                 SMITH
                        Bullshit. Conspiracy.

           He throws the racing form down. A couple of heads turn.

           INT. OTB - CONTINUOUS

           Johnny comes in, looking for Smith.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Smith, don’t you think we should 
                        get to work?
                                 SMITH
                        (drunk) Jesus. Relax, John. I, 
                        called, all the usual guys. If 
                        anybody’s heard anything, they’ll 
                        give us a buzz. 

           Smith puts his arm around Johnny. Just as Smith’s nose starts 
           bleeding.

                                 SMITH
                        Work’s good, buddy, but don’t 
                        forget to live. Now. (beat) How 
                        much money you got on you? They 
                        think this check’s a fake. And I 
                        got a sure thing in the 7th.

           Johnny looks at Smith’s bleeding nose as Smith shows Johnny 
           his retainer for $100,000.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Jesus, Smith.

           Johnny puts it in his own pocket for safekeeping.

                                 JOHNNY
                        C’mon, Smith, let’s go.

                                 SMITH
                        No.. You go ahead. I’ll see you 
                        later, buddy.

           Johnny shoots Smith a disapproving look. Smith weighs his 
           priorities for a moment, then speaks, looking at the tv.

                                 SMITH
                        We pay the cable bill at the 
                        office?

                                 JOHNY
                        Uhm.. Yeah I think so. Why?

                                 SMITH
                        Ok. Let’s go.

           Smith begrudgingly get’s up and heads out with Johnny.

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - HALF HOUR LATER

           Johnny and Smith are back at Smith’s office. Going over 
           papers, basic investigation stuff. Smith still seems pretty 
           liquored.
           Occasionally he looks over at a small TV in the corner where 
           he’s got the horse races on.

                                 SMITH
                        These police leads are weak. 
                        Fucking garbage. She had a couple 
                        of restraining orders against 
                        various nut job stalker types, but 
                        none of them did this, waste of 
                        fucking time. The ex-boyfriend, 
                        Roland, is a possible, he’s a crazy 
                        sonofabitch, but I can’t see him 
                        pulling something like this off.

                                 JOHNNY
                        What about the Japanese guy who 
                        paid to meet with her? I mean, the 
                        guy’s on film whacking off in front 
                        of her.

           Smith shrugs.

                                 SMITH
                        What’d the cops say?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Interviewed by the police and 
                        released. Now back in Japan. Along 
                        with his personal assistant. Had 
                        some pull with the Japanese 
                        government so they intervened on 
                        his behalf. 

                                 SMITH
                        If he did it, he wouldn’t be asking 
                        for ransom.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Maybe just covering himself?

           Smith thinks about it for a second.

                                 SMITH
                        Maybe. But I doubt it. Who whacks 
                        off before they kidnap someone? It 
                        just doesn’t make sense. Not even 
                        in this day and age.

           Smith looks over at the TV. One horse and buggy is running at 
           least 20 paces back from the rest, losing ridiculously badly.
                                 SMITH
                        Goddamnit! Does that horse have 
                        herpes or something?!!

           He punches the desk. Then turns off the TV. He refocuses on 
           the leads.

                                 SMITH
                        You have the tape from the 
                        appearance?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Yeah. Here.

           He hands Smith the tape. Smith pops it in the VCR. The tape 
           begins to play. Smith speaks while it plays.

                                 SMITH
                        So they get into a locked room, 
                        probably through the service 
                        entrance, they turn the lights out, 
                        probably from the building’s 
                        control room, maybe even broke in 
                        and did it a couple of days ago, 
                        and put the thing on a fucking 
                        timer. Hard to say. Then, they’re 
                        so fucking confident or so hell 
                        bent on not actually HURTING anyone 
                        that they don’t just kill the guys 
                        and take the girl, they take the 
                        time to disable each one of them, 
                        in the dark, bind them, grab the 
                        girl and get out. And whoever it 
                        is, whoever THEY are, they do such 
                        a good job that no camera, no 
                        person, in the entire building, or 
                        on the street, before, during or 
                        after the job sees you. (beat) Not 
                        even the one filming in the ROOM. 
                        That’s not a fucking job, that’s 
                        fucking witchcraft.

           Smith throws his pencil down on the table. 

           There’s a call. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        Smith Dangerous Smith and 
                        Associates. (beat) Mr. Greenberg. 
                        Yes. OK. Hang on.

           Johnny puts the call on hold.
                                 JOHNY
                        It’s Mr. Greenberg, the kidnappers 
                        have made contact.

                                 SMITH
                        (routine) Yup, it’s about time for 
                        that.

           INT. TKG MUSIC - AN HOUR LATER

           Smith and the board guys and the cops are all gathered in the 
           board room. They’re looking at the next piece of 
           communication. It’s a simple typed note.

                                 SMITH
                        So they’ve scheduled a conference 
                        call?

                                 KIBERTON
                        So it would appear.

                                 SMITH
                        Huh. Fuckin’ weird.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Is this not something you’ve 
                        encountered before, Mr. Smith?

           He looks around at Smith and the detectives. Everybody 
           shrugs.

                                 SMITH
                        Uh, well, usually, you know it’d be 
                        something like ‘be at a payphone at 
                        a certain time,’ or ‘use this cell 
                        phone only or the bitch gets it,’ 
                        or something along those lines. But 
                        a conference call. (nods head in 
                        appreciation) Fucking innovative.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

           Cut to them all huddled in the conference room around the 
           phone. Avi is dialing the number.

                                 CONFERENCE CALL:
                        Welcome to the ATX Teleconferencing 
                        Messageboard. The other 
                        participants of your call have not 
                        yet joined. Please stand by.
           SFX:  Hold music.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They sit in the room looking at one another. Smith eases a 
           baggy out of his pocket and then feigns dropping a pen under 
           the table.

           INT. UNDER CONFERENCE ROOM TABLE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith dabs a little speed on his hand below the table, then 
           comes back up. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Smith acts like he’s itching his nose, and takes a big snort 
           that makes Kiberton look up from his notepad.

                                 SMITH
                        Allergies.

           INT. CONFERENCE CALL - CONTINUOUS

           SFX: The electronic ding sound of another person joining the 
           call.

                                 AVI
                        Hello? 

           Silence.

                                 AVI
                        Is anyone there? 

           More silence.

                                 KIDNAPPERS
                        (A pleasant English woman’s voice)   
                        We’re here.

           The room all shoots looks to each other regarding the female 
           and British nature of the voice. The detective sitting next 
           to Smith scribbles a note in his notebook.

           INSERT HANDWRITING IN NOTEBOOK: Female...British.

           Cut to Smith who watches him write this. He shoots the guy a 
           sarcastic look as if to say, “Impressive work”.
                                 AVI
                        Good. Let me begin by saying who we 
                        have on this end. Our CEO-

                                 KIDNAPPERS
                        (Interrupting) We’re going to keep 
                        this short, we just bloody hate 
                        calls that drag on. We require 20 
                        million American dollars in cash. 
                        And you’ll forgive us for being 
                        partial to English luggage, but 
                        we’d like the money in a 
                        Globetrotter 30 inch suitcase, 
                        extra deep, in black, original 
                        collection. The exchange will be in 
                        72 hours. At a location to be given 
                        to you before the deadline. It is 
                        now 4 pm on Tuesday. The money must 
                        be in our courier’s hand by 4 pm 
                        Friday. When he is safely returned, 
                        and it has been established he was 
                        not followed, Top 40 will be 
                        released. This will not be a 
                        simultaneous exchange, I’m afraid. 
                        For obvious reasons of security 
                        which I’m sure you all appreciate. 
                        You will have one person bring the 
                        money. It will not be a member of 
                        the police. You will tell us who 
                        this person is before the drop. We 
                        will contact you six hours before 
                        the deadline. Oh, and obviously, 
                        all the usual rigamarole applies, 
                        about her death being a most 
                        painful and embarrassingly gory one 
                        if any of your people fuck this up. 
                        Look at the time, must dash, we’ll 
                        be in touch. Ta.

           Phone hangs up.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They all look at one another. The detective looks over at his 
           colleague who looks at his watch and shakes his head.

                                 DETECTIVE MOORE
                        It just traces back to the 
                        conference call company’s main 
                        line. I can see if they have a 
                        source number but I doubt it. If we 
                        had been given more lead time we-
                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        Try anyway.

           The other detective makes a call to get it traced.

           A bit of annoyance around the room.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 KIBERTON
                        Interesting, wouldn’t you say, 
                        detective, that there’s a woman 
                        involved. Your profile had been 
                        several men, was it not?

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        Yeah, this could really help us, 
                        but it’s also possible-

           Smith turns in his chair and says something under his breath.

                                 KIBERTON
                        What’s that, Mr. Smith.

           Smith turns and puts his keychain on the table, there’s a 
           little device attached to it.

                                 SMITH
                        I was just saying.

           He hits a button on the keychain device and holds it up to 
           his mouth.

                                 SMITH
                        (the same voice as the kidnapper on 
                        the call) That the voice you heard 
                        is a standard option on several 
                        over the counter voice altering 
                        devices available just about 
                        anywhere to almost any idiot with 
                        twenty dollars.

                                 KIBERTON
                        You didn’t think of that, 
                        detective?

           The detectives look at Smith in anger.
                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        Mr. Kiberton, I was in the middle 
                        of saying that it’s possible that 
                        the voice was altered, but-

                                 KIBERTON
                        Well goddamnit, you didn’t spit it 
                        out. This isn’t a time for 
                        subtleties and fucking gentleman’s 
                        agreements about who gets to speak 
                        first! Find me the goddamn girl!

           He bangs his fist on the table.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Find me the fucking girl!

           Everyone sits there, stunned.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Well, what are we all waiting for?

           Everyone walks out of the room.

           Smith hits his device again.

                                 KIDNAPPER’S VOICE
                        Sorry about interrupting you, 
                        detective. 

           EXT. BUILDING ROOF OPPOSITE A SWANKY HOTEL - NIGHT

           Smith is lying at the edge of a roof of a building. He has 
           headphones on, and a directional mike. He’s taking photos 
           with a telefoto lens.

           We see what he’s looking at. A super long lens shot of some 
           naked hookers doing drugs on a couch next to a conventional 
           old-school looking DRUM MACHINE, ROLAND, with a big dick and 
           balls growing out of the front of it.

                                 SMITH
                        (begrudgingly impressed)
                        You fancy motherfucker with your 
                        fancy fuckin’ drugs.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - EVENING

           ROLAND is being sucked off by two white strippers with big 
           tits. 
           They are both wearing headbands, high heels and g-strings, 
           but nothing else. They are on their knees in front of the 
           couch. 

           The coffee table is covered with cocaine and sex toys.

           One stripper sucks on one of his balls while the other deep 
           throats him. Roland speaks, when he does, the lights on his 
           front console light up.

                                 ROLAND
                        (a suave, yet slightly computerized 
                        voice...Think Ton Loc) Aw yeah, 
                        baby. You like them purple 
                        chestnuts, don’t you?

                                 WHORE
                        (mouth full) Mhmmmmm Hmmm.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           The door to the hotel suite opens. No one pays any attention.

           Smith walks in. No one sees him.

           Smith shakes his head.

                                 SMITH
                        Hello Roland.

           The girls pull away.

                                 ROLAND
                        Well well well... Smith Dangerous 
                        Smith. How’d you get in here?

                                 SMITH
                        It’s kind of what I do for a 
                        living.

                                 ROLAND
                        Riiight. Give me a minute to wrap 
                        things up here. Cool?

                                 SMITH
                        Sure.

           Roland’s bodyguard comes into the room from the bathroom and 
           notices Smith. He makes a move for him.
                                 ROLAND
                        No, Percy, it’s ok, baby. Mr. Smith 
                        is an old friend. Just stoppin’ by 
                        for a minute.

           Smith makes his way to the minibar and pours himself a Jack 
           and coke and sits down. Offscreen we can hear the whores and 
           Roland all climaxing.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           After a moment, Percy enters frame and places Roland on the 
           couch next to Smith. He then places a towel over Roland’s 
           giant dick. Throughout the following interaction, the cock 
           moves from time to time under the towel.

                                 ROLAND
                        So what’s up?

                                 SMITH
                        Wanted to see if you know who 
                        kidnapped your ex-girlfriend?

                                 ROLAND
                        That’s the big question of the 
                        moment. You ask, the police ask, my 
                        mother asks.... and my answer 
                        remains the same. I don’t know. 

                                 SMITH
                        You sure?

                                 ROLAND
                        Oh I’m sure. 

                                 SMITH
                        And you wouldn’t have any reason to 
                        do it yourself, would you? Maybe 
                        annoyed she left your label. You’ve 
                        got debts, you pick up some fast 
                        ransom money. Maybe you just get 
                        rid of her?

                                 ROLAND
                        Oh, my.

           Smith turns around in his chair. One of the girls is doing a 
           handstand while the girl in the chair eats her out. Smith 
           turns back around.
                                 ROLAND
                        That’d make things nice and easy on 
                        you, but unfortunately Mr. Smith, 
                        I’ve been in this hotel suite for 
                        the better part of a week, working 
                        my way through this rather large 
                        pile of drugs with my friends here. 
                        Of course, when the police visited, 
                        they had the courtesy to knock, so 
                        there were no drugs. Officially 
                        speaking. And I’ll thank you to 
                        uphold that version of things.

                                 SMITH
                        Glass houses, man.

                                 ROLAND
                        Exactly. Very amusing, Mr. Smith. 
                        So, as I was saying, before that, I 
                        was in the studio fairly 
                        continuously for the last three 
                        months, surrounded by people. One 
                        of whom, Percy, I require for 
                        purposes of mobility. And in 
                        regards to my business, it’s never 
                        been better, so I don’t see why I 
                        would have done such a thing. Any 
                        future questions can be referred to 
                        my attorney. Now, do you care to 
                        dabble?

           Smith looks at the pile of coke. 

                                 SMITH
                        I’m a simple man, but thanks. 

           At this point, the bodyguard comes over and picks up Roland 
           and begins to carry him back to the girls.

                                 ROLAND
                        A pleasure, Mr. Smith. Good luck.

           Smith walks toward the door.

                                 ROLAND
                        Also.. Smith... You should get a 
                        biteguard. That trucker speed is 
                        going to ruin your teeth.

           Smith regards Roland’s joke with the tiniest of chuckles and 
           walks out.
           INT. SMITH'S OFFICE - THE NEXT MORNING 

           Smith and Johnny are back at the office going through leads. 
           Smith is recapping his visit to Roland. He has the developed 
           pictures of Roland and girls getting it on in the hotel room. 
           Johnny flips through them as Smith speaks.

                                 SMITH
                        Roland didn’t do it, but let’s keep 
                        an eye on him anyway. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        (awestruck) These are some pretty 
                        crazy pictures.

                                 SMITH
                        Yup. So what’d you turn up?

           Johnny refocuses, pulls out a big stack of research. Reports 
           and pictures of all the police detectives and the TKG MUSIC 
           people etc. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        Everyone’s clean. The assistant, 
                        Greenberg, the board members, 
                        Schultz, Meyer, Morgan, Simmons. 
                        One interesting little tidbit.

           Johnny flips a few pages to a picture.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Kiberton’s a closet faggot who 
                        blows commuters at the train 
                        station, but other than that, these 
                        guys are clean. I tapped all their 
                        phones, had our guy check their 
                        email, the works, no large sums of 
                        money moved, nothing.

           Smith looks at the photo. There’s one from a hidden camera of 
           Kiberton kissing a businessman in a train station bathroom.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Oh... And I did find this.

           Smith looks at another folder. A photo of a handsome, 
           impeccably dressed older fellow, like Lawrence Olivier in 
           Marathon Man, before he shaves his head, but more handsome.
                                 JOHNNY
                        Didn’t find it on the first pass 
                        because the lawsuit is in one of 
                        the music company’s subsidiary 
                        names rather than her’s. 

                                 SMITH
                        (impressed) Interesting.

           EXT. ROOFTOP OF EMPTY PARKING STRUCTURE - THAT DAY

           The handsome older fellow is perched in the backseat of a 
           convertible Bentley. He’s intently working at something in 
           his back seat. He has a beautifully ornate parasol over his 
           shoulder which keeps him in shade. It flutters gently in the 
           breeze. He wears latex gloves and a surgical mask.

           Camera moves to reveal that the man is performing surgery on 
           a woman who lies unconscious in his back seat. She is hooked 
           up to an IV and heart monitoring system and despite the 
           obvious peculiarities, the operation seems quite clean and on 
           the level. We watch as the surgeon produces some large fake 
           breasts and begins to insert them under the chest flesh of 
           the patient.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Smith pulls into the parking lot, parks about twenty spaces 
           away, and just watches for a minute. He snaps some pictures 
           off.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Smith walks up. A well-dressed chauffeur polishes the hood of 
           the car. The doctor goes around to the trunk, he rummages 
           around for some bandages, and return to the patient, 
           bandaging her up.

                                 DOCTOR
                        (aristocratic English accent) My 
                        dear, you’ll forgive me for saying 
                        so, but these are a pair of the 
                        most glorious round mounds I’ve 
                        ever built.

           Patient mumbles through anesthesia.
                                 DOCTOR
                        Really first rate titties. I could 
                        kiss them, stitches and all. I 
                        really could.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

                                 SMITH
                        Doctor Blainsley , Hubert 
                        Blainsley?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Yes.

                                 SMITH
                        Could I speak to you for a moment, 
                        sir?

                                 DOCTOR
                        You’re not my three o’clock.

                                 SMITH
                        No.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well I don’t do walk-ins. I’m 
                        afraid you’ll have to make an 
                        appointment.

                                 SMITH
                        I’m not here to get any work done.

                                 DOCTOR
                        And you are?

                                 SMITH
                        My name’s Smith Dangerous Smith, 
                        I’m looking into the kidnapping of 
                        Top 40, one of your former 
                        patients.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Ah yes, her. Well, I’m just 
                        finishing up. I’ll need ten 
                        minutes.

                                 SMITH
                        Certainly. 

           Smith stands there. The doctor starts to turn away, then 
           turns back.
                                 DOCTOR
                        (extremely angry) Bloody 
                        irresponsible of you, Smith. 
                        Standing here like you’re a damn 
                        Punjabi. You don’t have the skin 
                        for this sort of bravado. That’s 
                        the noonday sun above you, man. 
                        It’s not to be trifled with. Now, 
                        away with you. Go on then, back to 
                        your car, take shelter. What is 
                        that, a Cooper Seven?

                                 SMITH
                        Buick.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well, alright. Ten minutes, I 
                        assume you’ve got a device for 
                        telling time.

                                 SMITH
                        Sure.

           Smith has nodded off in his car. He is awoken to the sound of 
           knocking on the glass. It’s Blainsley’s chauffeur.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - TEN MINUTES LATER

           Smith climbs into the back of the doctor’s Bentley. While he 
           speaks with the doctor, he admires the intricacy of the 
           backseat’s medical set up.

           The doctor arranges the parasol so they’re both in shade.

                                 DOCTOR
                        That’s better. The sun is a killing 
                        machine. Now, how can I be of 
                        service, Mr. Smith.

                                 SMITH
                        You’re currently being sued by Top 
                        40’s record company, and they’ve 
                        filed a complaint with the state 
                        plastic surgery board. They’re 
                        claiming you molested her while you 
                        did her ti-... Breasts.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Yes, for her tour of the far east.

                                 SMITH
                        Well, did you?
                                 DOCTOR
                        Which one?

                                 SMITH
                        One, both?

                                 DOCTOR
                        No, yes. I did her BREASTS, and no 
                        I didn’t touch anywhere near the 
                        old Mountbatten’s tomb. 

                                 SMITH
                        So you don’t know anything abut her 
                        kidnapping.

                                 DOCTOR
                        That’s right.

                                 SMITH
                        Any thoughts on who might have done 
                        this? You come into contact with a 
                        lot of powerful people. The kind of 
                        people with resources. Any 
                        theories?

           The doctor shrugs.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well I know it won’t be who anyone 
                        expects it to be.

                                 SMITH
                        Oh really, How so?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mr. Smith, my business is technical 
                        skill and discretion. I work on 
                        some of the richest people in the 
                        world. Occasionally people like 
                        that are kidnapped or assassinated. 
                        Or sometimes they’re blown up in 
                        their private jets in what might 
                        have been an accident or an 
                        assassination, or even a kidnapping 
                        made to look like an accident. Do 
                        you follow me, Mr. Smith? You seem 
                        the sort to get confused. No? Good. 
                        In any event, it’s just never who 
                        you think in these sorts of things. 
                        And I very much doubt that it’s who 
                        you think it is, Mr. Smith. No 
                        offense, I hope.
                                 SMITH
                        No, none taken. 

           Smith appraises the doctor carefully with his eyes.

                                 SMITH
                        Thank you, doctor. Do you have a 
                        card?

           The doctor hands him a card. Smith looks at it.

           INSERT: Hubert Blainsley, MD, discretion, quality, expensive.

           Smith starts to get out of the car.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mr. Smith?

           Smith turns around

                                 SMITH
                        Yes?

           The doctor is holding out a gimme cap, it’s not a ball cap, 
           it’s a round-brimmed hat like old Japanese men wear.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well put it on, you bloody fool. 
                        And if I may be of further service, 
                        please call. But do make an 
                        appointment.

                                 SMITH
                        I will. 

           Smith gets out. As Smith walks to his car, he walks past a 
           older blonde woman who has had a TON of plastic surgery.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Come, Sylvana, we’re ready for you, 
                        dear!

           INT. CONCRETE ROOM WITH NO WINDOWS - THAT DAY

           TOP 40 is in an empty concrete-walled room. She is lying on a 
           little pad that she’s using as a mattress. There are a bunch 
           of bottles of water nearby. A TV with a stack of DVDs sits in 
           the corner. It’s all porn except The Sound of Music and Rocky 
           IV. 
           There is a noise from the door. Top 40 gets up and runs to 
           the door. A fruit rollup is being shoved under the door. It 
           barely fits.

                                 TOP 40
                        You motherfuckers! What is this 
                        shit. Give me some real food! I’m 
                        on a very specific diet!

           She waits for a response. Nothing.

           EXT. CITY - THAT NIGHT

           Smith is walking on the sidewalk in front of his office 
           building. 

                                 VOICE, O.C.
                        Excuse me, sir, I’d like to talk to 
                        you today about an exciting 
                        opportunity to invest in the people 
                        and the future of the Caribbean, on 
                        the picturesque island of Mont 
                        Serrat, do you have a moment?

           Smith looks at over,  Lionel is walking next to him.

                                 SMITH
                        Well, actually, if-

                                 LIONEL
                        Get in the fucking car, Smith.

           Smith looks down at Lionel’s right hand. Lionel is holding a 
           really gnarly looking shank made out of a wire from a chain-
           link fence stapled to a broom handle. 

                                 LIONEL
                        Get in the fucking car.

           George has pulled up the white VW van alongside them. Smith 
           reluctantly agrees.

           INT. VW VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Smith climbs in.

                                 LIONEL
                        Watch the sales material.

           Smith steps around a pile of brochures.
                                 LIONEL
                        Sit between Little Jim and Creve-
                        Coeur.

           Smith sits down in the first row of the backseat between two 
           other Haitians. One normal-sized, one huge.

                                 LIONEL
                        You know Little Jim, but I don’t 
                        think you’ve met Creve-coeur 
                        before, have you, Smith?

                                 SMITH
                        No.

                                 LIONEL
                        Our cousin, here visiting from the 
                        islands. 

           Smith nods to the larger of the two men he sits between. The 
           large Haitian nods back. Smith passes an envelope up front.

                                 LIONEL
                        Look what the man has for us, 
                        brother.

                                 GEORGE
                        A great big wad of cash. 

           George plugs a wire into the cigarette lighter, he pulls a 
           portable money counter out of the dashboard. It rattles 
           through the money. 

                                 LIONEL
                        Indeed. But not as great or as big 
                        a wad as it should be.

           Lionel turns around to face Smith. He pulls out another 
           equally crude shank. This one a shard of glass mounted into a 
           BMX bike handle. The other two Haitians grip Smith by each 
           arm.

                                 GEORGE
                        So why didn’t we have this money 
                        yesterday, Smith?

                                 SMITH
                        I just got it.

           Lionel jabs Smith with the knife in the arm.

                                 SMITH
                        Owww! Jesus!
                                 LIONEL
                        Lazy fucker.

                                 GEORGE
                        Don’t bleed in my fucking car, 
                        Smith.

           Lionel slashes him across the arm again.

                                 LIONEL
                        You heard my brother. Cover your 
                        arm, motherfucker.

           Smith covers his bleeding arm.

                                 LIONEL
                        The three of us have entered into a 
                        business arrangement, Smith, and 
                        you are not complying.

                                 GEORGE
                        Fucking junkie gambler deadbeat 
                        motherfucker.

                                 LIONEL
                        Fucking Mr. I’ve got celebrity 
                        friends.

                                 SMITH
                        I know what you’re about to s-

           Lionel slashes him again on the arm.

                                 SMITH
                        OW! FUUUUUUCK.

                                 LIONEL
                        No you don’t, boy.

                                 GEORGE
                        You owe us seven hundred thousand 
                        dollars, Smith.

                                 LIONEL
                        Seven hundred thousand fucking 
                        dollars.

                                 GEORGE
                        We want the rest.

           By now Smith is bleeding from his face and both arms. He’s 
           trying to hold some of the cuts, but he’s bleeding too bad. 
                                 SMITH
                        I’m gonna pay.

                                 LIONEL
                        Oh really? How are you going to do 
                        that?

                                 SMITH
                        I’ve got a job.

                                 LIONEL
                        Ha. Another husband desperate to 
                        find out if his wife is getting 
                        fucked by his best friend? 

           Lionel gets ready to cut Smith again.

                                 SMITH
                        No.... the TOP 40 case.

           INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

           The whole van stirs at this news.

                                 LIONEL
                        Bullshit.

                                 SMITH
                        It’s true, I just got hired.

                                 LIONEL
                        You? Why would they hire YOU?

           Smith shrugs, it doesn’t seem so crazy to him.

           George rubs his head, in disbelief.

                                 GEORGE
                        A degenerate fuckhead who is 
                        hopelessly addicted to drugs, and 
                        in massive debt... Who lets 
                        kidnapped girls get chopped to 
                        bits? I tell you, brother, the 
                        music industry is even more insane 
                        than I had previously been led to 
                        believe.

           One of the Haitians in the backseat speaks up. It’s the big 
           one. He seems simple.
                                 CREVECOEUR
                        (Andre the Giant deep voice) If he 
                        solves the case, then he can pay 
                        us.

           George and Lionel both regard the big man, surprised he said 
           something.  They find it amusing that he put together such a 
           simple piece of logic.

                                 LIONEL
                        (patronizing, yet civil) You’re 
                        quite right, Creve-coeur.

           Lionel turns his attention back to Smith.

                                 LIONEL
                        But really I should kill you right 
                        now, because the odds of you 
                        figuring out something like this 
                        are close to zero. 

                                 SMITH
                        I’ve got leads.

                                 GEORGE
                        Whoopee.

                                 LIONEL
                        We’ll be in touch.

                                 GEORGE
                        Get out of the fucking car.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The door of the moving van opens and Smith is pushed out. He 
           hits the pavement and rolls for a good 15 feet before coming 
           to a stop. He is covered in cuts and bleeding pretty bad.

           People walking by look at him in horror and then look away. 
           Smith gets to his feet and stumbles away down the street.

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - THE NEXT MORNING

           Smith and Johnny are going over leads. Johnny stares at 
           Smith’s cuts on face and arms. Smith is covered in bandaids 
           and bandages.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Jesus man. You need to go to the 
                        hospital.
                                 SMITH
                        Fuck that. What do you got?

                                 JOHNNY
                        What the hell happened to you?

                                 SMITH
                        Nothing. What do you have?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Not much. Some amusing phone sex 
                        sessions on Kiberton’s cell phone 
                        but other than that, nothing.

           Long pause. 

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        Smith?

                                 SMITH
                        Yeah?

           Johnny looks troubled.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I’m a little worried we’re not 
                        getting anywhere. Do you, you 
                        know...want me to bring some other 
                        guys in, or...

                                 SMITH
                        Johnny, it’s under control.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Because if you want...

                                 SMITH
                        It’s under control, Johnny. Just 
                        keep digging and call me when you 
                        find something.

           Smith gets up and leaves.

           EXT. MIDTOWN SKYSCRAPER- THAT DAY

           Smith takes photos of various groups of foreign people in 
           front a U.N-esque building that seems to function as a sort 
           of foreign mission. He takes picture of a young college girl 
           walking her dog. He takes pictures of a hot dog vender.  If 
           there is a method to his madness, we can’t tell what it is. 
           He seems to be just taking pictures of anything and 
           everything.
           INT. A BAR - THAT EVENING

           Smith walks in, saddles up to the bar and orders a drink. He 
           downs it and orders another. He downs it and orders another. 
           He looks around. He even snaps a couple pictures in here. 
           There’s a slightly ragged but sexy barfly at the end of the 
           bar. He gets up and walks over to the jukebox and inserts a 
           bill and puts on a song.

           INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

           The ragged barfly walks over to Smith. We can’t tell if she’s 
           a hooker or just wants a drink.

                                 WOMAN
                        Hi there. 

           Smith doesn’t notice her at first.

                                 SMITH
                        Hi.

                                 WOMAN
                        (motioning to cuts) So what 
                        happened to you?

                                 SMITH
                        (wasted) Listen, you seem like a 
                        very nice person, but I’m going 
                        through something right now, and I 
                        just don’t think this can happen. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Well why don’t you buy me a drink 
                        and we can find out?

           Smith says nothing, takes out his baggy of drugs and does a 
           bump right in front of her. She gets up, annoyed, and walks 
           away. Smith has second thoughts and begins to yell out to 
           her.

                                 SMITH
                        Wait, come back. 

           The woman keeps walking, doesn’t even look back at him.
           INT. SMITH’S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

           Early the next morning, Smith’s in bed. There are bottles 
           everywhere. The phone rings. Smith, eyes barely open, 
           answers.

                                 SMITH
                        Hello.

                                 AVI
                        Hello, Mr. Smith, it’s Avi 
                        Greenberg calling.

                                 SMITH
                        (gravelly) Hey Avi.

                                 AVI
                        Mr. Kiberton and the board are all 
                        quite eager to see what progress 
                        you’ve made.

                                 SMITH
                        Right... Well, I...

                                 AVI
                        We’ll see you at one o’clock.

           INT. TKG MUSIC - ONE PM

           Smith walks into the boardroom where the detectives and 
           Kiberton are sitting around.

           Smith is completely cut up and fucked up looking.

           Everyone stops cold when they see him all cut up.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Jesus.

                                 KIBERTON
                        It looks like you’ve seen some 
                        action, Mr. Smith. Was it in 
                        regards to the case?

                                 SMITH
                        (dead serious) Yes it was. 

           The room stirs. Kiberton nods in vague approval.
                                 KIBERTON
                        Sometimes you’ve got to break a few 
                        eggs, is it? That sort of thing?

                                 SMITH
                        Exactly.

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        The kidnappers sent us a photo.

           He slides it across the table to Smith.

           INSERT: It’s Top 40 standing in a nondescript room, she has a 
           blindfold on, and is holding a sign that says “Fuck today’s 
           date”

                                 KIBERTON
                        Apparently they’re not concerned 
                        with assuring us that she’s 
                        alright.

                                 SMITH
                        What do you mean?

                                 KIBERTON
                        You know, generally, the kidnapped 
                        hold a newspaper in this sort of 
                        photo, don’t they?

           Smith shrugs, examines the photo more closely. 

                                 SMITH
                        Can I keep this?

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        Yeah, it’s a copy.

           Smith takes the photo and examines it at length.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Well Mr. Smith, I think we’re ready 
                        when you are. 

                                 SMITH
                        Yeah, ok. 

           Smith opens his brief case and produces a mound of pictures 
           of various suspects and splays them out on the table. From 
           the get go things feel very disorganized. He rummages through 
           the pile aimlessly, finally settling on one of his 
           surveillance shots of Roland.
                                 SMITH
                        So, let’s start here. Roland is the 
                        ex boyfriend and former producer, 
                        as you probably know. His story 
                        checks out. 

           He puts down that photo, rummages around some more. Produces 
           a photo of Hubert Blainsley.

                                 SMITH
                        This... is Hubert Blainsley, the 
                        plastic surgeon, who is currently 
                        being sued by one of your 
                        subsidiaries for alleged 
                        malpractice against Top 40. 
                        Frankly, we were surprised he 
                        hadn’t been mentioned by the 
                        police, but it doesn’t really 
                        matter because it just isn’t him. 
                        He was accepting an award and 
                        giving a talk the night of the 
                        kidnapping and has about 1,000 
                        people who can vouch for it. Of 
                        course he could have hired some 
                        thugs to do the work but it all 
                        seems like a long shot since the 
                        malpractice charges will probably 
                        never stick anyway. 

           He flips to a photo of a spanish looking guy.

                                 SMITH
                        Another lead we’re following up on, 
                        a top figure in a Mexican organized 
                        crime ring.

           The room stirs with anticipation. Smith flips right past him.

                                 SMITH
                        And here are some other guys who I 
                        think are possibilities.

           He flips some of the random foreign people photos onto the 
           table, the girl walking her dog, the hot dog vendor etc. The 
           room hangs on his words, waiting to hear why. But he says 
           nothing.

                                 SMITH
                        (unconvincing)
                        But I can’t say why just yet.
           The room stirs some more. This is starting to feel like a 
           bunch of filler. the detective picks up one of Smith’s photos 
           of the a russian looking guy.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        To that end, I should tell you all 
                        something about THIS man.

           He picks up the photo.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        As a former police diplomatic 
                        attache, I can tell you that HE not 
                        only works for the Ukranian 
                        consulate, he is a father of four, 
                        who spends every minute not at work 
                        at the bedside of his cancer-
                        stricken wife, and still finds the 
                        strength to actively campaign 
                        against the use of land mines.

           The detective reaches his breaking point. He slams his hand 
           down on the table.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        And if I were to go to my boss, and 
                        say I was investigating this man, I 
                        would HAVE MY BALLS HANDED TO ME!
                        (beat) Mr. Kiberton, this is just a 
                        few vague possibilities smeared 
                        with a bunch of bullshit. 

           The detective stands up, and grabs the dossiers that smith 
           has been going through, he holds them up.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        (mocking voice) He ‘sort of’ 
                        investigated this one, he ‘maybe’ 
                        thinks it could be these guys, this 
                        other one, oh, he’s ‘interesting.’ 
                        ‘We’ll keep on it.’...

           The detective throws the papers down.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        There’s no thoroughness here, no 
                        analysis, it’s crap. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DETECTIVE (cont'd)
                        He’s just going through his files, 
                        and pulling out the biggest oddball 
                        weirdos that look suspicious in a 
                        meeting, cobbling together some 
                        kind of half-wit statement about 
                        them, so he can spend more time in 
                        some shitty bar full of half-dead 
                        freaks. This isn’t a goddamned 
                        brainstorming session to come up 
                        with characters for a board game, 
                        Mr. Kiberton, it’s a KIDNAPPING 
                        investigation. He’s grasping at 
                        straws here, And we’re sick of 
                        wasting resources following it up 
                        for him.

           Smith looks down at the table.

           INT. BOARD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The detective throws some photos on the table.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Speaking of, this is something 
                        we’re following up on.

           The photos are of Smith drinking at the bar full of half-dead 
           freaks.

                        I thought you were sober.

                                 SMITH
                        It’s a soda.

           The next photo is of the bartender leaving the entire bottle 
           of liquor next to Smith. 

                                 SMITH
                        So, detective. I guess now that 
                        you’ve discredited me, you’re going 
                        to tell us who did it. Before I go 
                        home and stop fucking up your 
                        investigation, who is it? 

           The detective doesn’t say anything.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        We’ve got some promising leads 
                        we’re following, Smi-
                                 SMITH
                        Like what, because I’m sure Mr. 
                        Kiberton would love to hear about 
                        some of them.

           Kiberton actually nods at that. The detective shrugs, 
           actually taken aback a bit at the direct counterattack.

                                 SMITH
                        You guys are sitting on jackshit. 
                        And you fucking know it. So be 
                        thankful that I’m bringing in any 
                        leads at all.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Mr. Kiberton, we’ve got dozens of 
                        leads like this that we don’t bring 
                        to you PRECISELY because they turn 
                        out to be huge piles of shit like 
                        these. They’re a waste of your 
                        time. 

                                 KIBERTON
                        I don’t know, Detective, quite 
                        frankly, I agree with Mr. Smith 
                        here. At least he’s out there 
                        beating the bushes and getting all 
                        cut up and what have you. You men 
                        seem to have your thumbs up your 
                        asses, eating chili dogs or what 
                        not, and convincing yourselves that 
                        you’re doing a good job.

           He turns to Smith.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Mr. Smith, no more diplomats and 
                        what have you. But please continue 
                        with your work.

           EXT. TKG MUSIC - CONTINUOUS

           Smith exits TKG MUSIC after the meeting. His cell phone 
           rings. It’s johnny.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Smith, I found something.
           INT. COFFEE SHOP - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

           Johnny and Smith are sitting at a small table in a coffee 
           shop. Johnny produces a clipping from the newspaper, J.T. 
           Monohan in town for Little Titan Championships. (also smaller 
           on the page is an obituary for ROGER THE TURTLE MAN).

                                 SMITH
                        J.T. Monohan. Jesus. I can’t 
                        believe the cops missed this.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Maybe they didn’t. I mean, you said 
                        they gave you obvious leads. 
                        They’re probably sitting on a few 
                        things they didn’t tell us about.

                                 SMITH
                        True. Where’s he staying?

                                 JOHNNY
                        The Pierre.

           EXT. ST. PIERRE HOTEL - A FEW HOURS LATER

           Smith is waiting in his car outside the St. Pierre Hotel. 
           J.T. Monohan comes out. Drives away in a chauffeured car.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Smith follows J.T.’s limo down a few sidestreets.

           EXT. BRIDGE - 15 MINUTES LATER

           Smith tails J.T.’s limo across the bridge into a rougher part 
           of the city.

           EXT. ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

           J.T. gets out at a 24 hour Brazilian restaurant.

           EXT. ACROSS STREET FROM RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Smith watches Monohan from across the street as Monohan dines 
           at a Brazilian restaurant, eating the traditional dish of 
           steak, beans, rice and plantains with a fried egg on top. 
           Monohan puts little bites into his bag from time to time. 
           Locals come over and talk to him like he’s the don. A woman 
           brings her son in a wheelchair over for Monohan to inspect. 
           Monohan shakes the boy’s hand. Gives him a $50 bill.

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSE NEIGHBORHOOD - AN HOUR LATER

           Monahan gets back into his limo. Smith follows JT into a 
           desolate warehouse district. Monohan gets out at a windowless 
           warehouse. Goes inside. Smith waits. Takes pictures of the 
           place. 

           He calls Johnny on his phone.

                                 SMITH
                        Johnny, how we doin’ on those 
                        tickets?

           INT. LITTLE MAN FIGHTS - THAT NIGHT

           A packed arena, the crowd is going wild. It’s like a hyped up 
           vegas boxing match. Cameras are flashing etc.

           INT. RING OF LITTLE MAN FIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

           A pair of little men (10% human size) fight viciously, 
           tearing each other apart. It is the well-muscled African from 
           the billboard, against a Bruce Lee looking little Asian guy 
           wearing silk pants.

           The Bruce Lee guy is all over the African, kicking him, 
           somersaulting over him, and then kicking him. 

           The African is dazed. 

           Finally the Bruce Lee guy tries to get too tricky.

           The African guy grabs him, and literally rips his head off. 
           He holds it in one hand. The headless body of the Bruce Lee 
           guy falls lifelessly to the ground with a thump. The crowd 
           goes crazy.

           The bell rings.

           A referee comes into the ring. He holds up the arm of the 
           African in victory.
           INT. RING OF LITTLE MAN FIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

           The African is swarmed by his handlers. Some EMTs come in and 
           lift the body of the Asian onto a stretcher. They try to get 
           the head back, but the African throws it into the crowd, 
           which goes crazy.

           The ring is splattered with blood. A couple of guys in white 
           coveralls run around with squeegees. They just smear the 
           blood around.

           INT. RING OF LITTLE MAN FIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

           J.T. Monohan’s fighter is making his way to the ring, as is 
           the Filipino of the rich socialite, INEZ DECOOPER. 

           INT. RING OF LITTLE MAN FIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

           They both enter the ring, and go to opposite corners.

           The Filipino wears a loincloth. The cowboy takes his hat off. 
           Then takes his shirt off. Revealing criss-crossed scars 
           across his torso. He puts his hat back on. He turns to face 
           the Filipino.

           His handler crouches down to the cowboy.

                                 HANDLER
                        What’d ya think, champ?

                                 COWBOY
                        I think I’m gonna break this boy 
                        over my knee.

           Handler gently pats the cowboy on the back.

           INT. RING OF LITTLE MAN FIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

           The announcer steps into the ring. He is also a little man. 
           But he looks like a retired fighter. Old and scarred.

                                 MC
                        Ladies and gentlemen, it is my 
                        great pleasure to announce the 
                        final bout of tonight’s undercard. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MC (cont'd)
                        In the red corner, weighing two 
                        pounds, seven ounces, a corn fed, 
                        wolf bred, red meat killing 
                        machine, world champine Vern 
                        Caaarrrrteeeeeeerr!!!!!

           The crowd cheers. J.T. Stands up in the front row.

                                 J.T.
                        You kill that sonofabitch, boy. 
                        Kill ‘im!

           J.T. makes eye contact with Inez DeCooper, and raises his 
           hat, chuckling. Inez DeCooper fans herself.

                                 MC
                        And in the blue corner-

           Inez perks up.

                                 MC
                        Weighing two pounds, one ounce, the 
                        killa from Manilla, Sumpareen 
                        Muhpareesian!!!!!!!!

           The crowd cheers again. 

           The arena lights dim and a Jumbotron above the ring turns on. 
           The screen goes red, as if filling up with blood.

           The word DEATH! starts flashing on the red screen.

           The crowd goes fucking crazy.

                                 CROWD
                        Death! Death! Death! Death!

           INT. LITTLE MAN FIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

           The bell rings. The two men go at each other. They instantly 
           begin to viciously kick the shit out of each other.

           INT. LITTLE MAN FIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

           Johnny and Smith are at the fights, betting in the concourse, 
           placing bets. Smith takes a gigundo bump of speed when 
           Johnny’s looking the other way.

                                 SMITH
                        This is some gory shit.
                                 JOHNNY
                        It’s fucking awesome.

                                 SMITH
                        Yup, let’s get to our seats.

           INT. LITTLE MAN FIGHTS - FIVE MINUTES LATER

           Smith and Johnny settle into their seats. Smith takes out 
           some pocket binoculars and scans the stadium... we see his 
           POV through the binoculars... it settles on Monohan in the 
           front row, cheering his man on.

           INT. LITTLE MAN FIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

           The first round ends. Champ returns to his corner, he’s 
           bleeding badly.

                                 CHAMP
                        I’m cut pretty bad, coach.

                                 MANAGER
                        Don’t worry champ, we’ll take care 
                        of it. (turns to assistant) Piss on 
                        him.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        What?

                                 MANAGER
                        You heard me, piss on him. It’ll 
                        close the wound. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        The hell I will.

           The manager has no time to argue.

                                 MANAGER
                        Oh fuck it.

            He reaches down and unzips his own fly.

                                 CHAMP
                        Jimmy, you come one inch closer to 
                        me with that shrivelled up green 
                        bean and I swear to christ i’ll 
                        tear it off.
                                 MANAGER
                        Goddamn it, Champ, you’re gonna die 
                        if we don’t close this wound up!
                        Now close your eyes...

           Against his better judgement, Champ closes his eyes. The 
           manager leans in closer and begins to piss all over champ’s 
           wound. The stream cascades all over him.

           Angle on J.T. MONAHAN seeing this from his seat. It’s a 
           curiosity, but he shrugs it off and continues to schmooze 
           with other rich folk.

           The place is going wild. The manager continues to piss on 
           Champ. Champ’s eyes still closed.

                                 MANAGER
                        I read about this in Roots. Chicken 
                        George would do it to his fighting 
                        roosters.

           He stops pissing and zips up. The cuts really do seem to have 
           stopped bleeding.

                                 MANAGER
                        How you feel, Champ?

           Champ opens his eyes. The manager hands him a towel.

                                 CHAMP
                        I could fight.

                                 MANAGER
                        Good. You mad at me?

                                 CHAMP
                        Hell yes.

                                 MANAGER
                        Good, use it on that sonofabitch.

           They let the little man up, and he goes back into the ring. 

           INT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           The two tiny men fight viciously.

           Champ breaks the Filipino’s right arm, and uses it to 
           strangle the Filipino, as he repeatedly kicks in the man’s 
           ribcage.

           The crowd cheers as the beating gets more savage.
           INT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           Champ takes one of the Filipino’s legs and bites it off at 
           the hip, then begins clubbing the Filipino with it. The 
           Filipino is DEAD.

           The bell rings. The match is over.

           The handlers swarm the ring and raise Champ’s arm in the air 
           for victory. The announcer carefully steps into the ring and 
           grabs the mic.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Ladies and gentlemen, That 
                        concludes this evening’s events, 
                        but get ready for tomorrow’s 
                        championship, between tonight’s 
                        victorious Vern Carter and the 
                        European champion, Mukembe Motutu.

           The crowd roars, and chants “DEATH, DEATH”

           The Jumbotron shows pictures of Champ and the African we saw 
           earlier.

           INT. ARENA - TWENTY MINUTES LATER 

           The arena is largely emptied. We notice two men far up in the 
           nosebleeds are still in their seats. It’s Smith and Johnny.

           Smith is watching Monohan with his binoculars. He watches as 
           J.T. approaches INEZ DECOOPER.

           INT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           Inez is picking up her things to leave. 

                                 J.T.
                        Hello there.

                                 INEZ
                        Hello.

                                 J.T.
                        Sorry ‘bout your Filipino. He was a 
                        vicious little sonofabitch, I’ll 
                        give you that.

           Inez regards J.T. coldly.
                                 INEZ
                        Well, I’ll just have to get a 
                        better one. Excuse me.

                                 J.T.
                        Hang on a second, darlin’.

           He blocks her path.

                                 INEZ
                        What is it?

                                 J.T.
                        I was wonderin’ if you might like 
                        to have dinner with me this 
                        evening.

                                 INEZ
                        So you can gloat about your victory 
                        today? No thank you.

           J.T. steps closer and grabs her arm a bit tough.

                                 J.T.
                        I insist.

                                 INEZ
                        Fine.

           INT. JT’S LIMOUSINE -  A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           The car pulls up at the St. Pierre Hotel. We cut inside the 
           limo.

                                 INEZ
                        I thought we were going for south 
                        american barbecue.

                                 J.T.
                        You weren’t hungry.

                                 INEZ
                        Actually, I rather was.

                                 J.T.
                        No, you wasn’t.

           Inez looks annoyed.
                                 J.T.
                        Listen. You wanna get liquored up 
                        and have unprotected sex in more 
                        than one hole, you come on up. If 
                        you wanna go home and count your 
                        antiquities, and comb your hair 
                        with your granny’s silver brush, 
                        well then go on.

           Inez sits there, frozen by his bluntness.

           INT. JT’S HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           J.T. and Inez are walking into J.T.’s suite at the Pierre. He 
           pours some champagne. J.T. pulls Inez close and kisses her 
           roughly. She tries to pull away a little. He pulls her in 
           again. They begin pulling each other’s clothes off. 

           INT. JT’S HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Champ stirs in his cage. He’s got some bandages on him from 
           his fight. He sees J.T. and INEZ kissing.

                                 CHAMP
                        I’ll be damned. 

           INT. JT’S HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           J.T. begins handling Inez a bit roughly, but she seems a 
           little distracted.

                                 INEZ
                        J.T., J.T..

                                 J.T.
                        What?

                                 INEZ
                        He’s looking at us.

           J.T. looks over where he notices Champ staring at them and 
           growling.

                                 J.T.
                        Aw, Christ. So?

                                 INEZ
                        Can’t you put a sheet over him or 
                        something?
                                 J.T.
                        He’s not a fuckin’ parrot, Inez.

           Inez pulls away.

                                 J.T..
                        Alright. Fine.

           J.T. takes off his shirt and drapes it over the little man’s 
           cage. The little man is growling with desire. We see he has 
           an erection through his pants. J.T. winks at the little man 
           and throws the shirt over him. Then he turns back to Inez. 
           They re-start their rough foreplay.

           INT. LITTLE MAN’S CAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Champ pulls a switchblade out of his boot, and cuts a slit in 
           the shirt. He peers out at the two. 

           J.T. is now fucking Inez from behind on the bed. He’s still 
           wearing his boots. Waving his cowboy hat in the air.

           INT. SMITH’S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

           Smith is at home, passed out on the couch.

           The TV is on. A Roland video plays on the TV.

           His cell phone starts ringing. His home phone starts ringing. 
           He wakes up with a start.

                                 SMITH
                        Hello?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Smith, where the hell are you? 
                        These music company guys are all 
                        over me. They want to meet again 
                        today. 

                                 SMITH
                        (in a daze at first) What? Right. 
                        Ok. I’ll be there soon. 

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER  

           Smith is in his office. He’s looking at yesterday’s pictures 
           up on a wall. He’s drinking black coffee. He refills his mug. 
           He scans a bunch of photos, looking frustrated. Nothing 
           catches his eye.

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           He picks the photo of Top 40 holding the “Fuck today’s date” 
           sign. He looks the photo over, studying it intensely. Camera 
           goes tight on the photo. Specifically on the TV next to TOP 
           40 in the image. In it, there seems to be a reflection of 
           something.

           Smith circles the TV with black pen. Next to the circled TV 
           he writes “Something here?” Johnny looks over as Smith pins 
           the picture up on the wall.

                                 SMITH
                        Hey Johnny, come look at this 
                        picture of the girl. There’s this 
                        weird fucking reflection or 
                        something.

           Johnny’s across the room, shuffling through some papers.

                                 JOHNNY
                        (over shoulder)
                        What do you think it is?

                                 SMITH
                        I don’t know. Looks like maybe a 
                        hand or something. Maybe. Hard to 
                        tell. See if you can get the 
                        original or a high res scan from 
                        our buddies in the police force, 
                        ok?

           Johnny nods.

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith moves onto pictures of the warehouse he tailed Monohan 
           too. He’s about to look at something else, and then he stops 
           cold. 

           He takes out a photo loop, and looks more closely at the 
           photo. 

                                 SMITH 
                        Johnny, come take a look at this.
           Johnny comes over, looks at a picture of a the warehouse 
           Smith followed Monohan to. On the door of the building are 
           signs for several companies. Quite small.

                                 SMITH
                        Daiichi cleaning services. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        What’s going on?

           Smith picks up his phone, and dials a number. He uses his 
           little keychain device to do a Japanese accent. 

                                 SMITH
                        Yes, this is Daiichi cleaning 
                        services, we are doing our monthly 
                        service analysis for your building, 
                        has everything been satisfactory? 

           Smith listens.

                                 SMITH
                        It has? Oh good. No, I’m the new 
                        manager, Takashi-san has left us.

           Smith hangs up.

                                 SMITH
                        The building TOP 40 was kidnapped 
                        from uses Daiichi company maids to 
                        clean the apartments. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        No fucking way.

                                 SMITH
                        Yup, let’s go.

           INT. TKG MUSIC - 20 MINUTES LATER

           Smith walks in. 

           INT. BOARDROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Smith has pictures of Monohan splayed out on the table.

                                 SMITH
                        J.T. Monohan arrived in town three 
                        days ago. Officially here for the 
                        Little Man fights. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SMITH (cont'd)
                        His fighter is one of the best. 
                        Amazing to watch actually, if you 
                        ever get a chance. 

           Stony faces from everyone in the room.

                                 SMITH
                        Anyway, over the last 10 years, 
                        he’s been implicated but never 
                        convicted of activities ranging 
                        from the white slave trade to arms 
                        smuggling. He’s a dirty 
                        sonofabitch.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Why haven’t you been following up 
                        on this man, Detective?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Mr. Kiberton, Monohan is a scumbag, 
                        no doubt about it, but we ruled him 
                        out days ago. What the fuck does he 
                        want with this girl? She’s not some 
                        anonymous 10 year old from Kansas 
                        that no one’s going to notice. 
                        Everybody in the fucking world 
                        knows who she is. No one would get 
                        away with having her for a sex 
                        slave. Not even some third world 
                        dictator.

                                 SMITH
                        (as if talking to an idiot) The 
                        very rich men who buy human beings 
                        to serve them are always looking 
                        for something better, more one of a 
                        kind, it’s like art collectors who 
                        buy stolen paintings. Very few 
                        people, maybe no one besides the 
                        collector, will ever see the 
                        painting. It’s part of the allure. 
                        A famous beautiful pop star? Now 
                        that’s worth paying for.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Well why bother with the ransom? 
                        Why not just take her out of the 
                        country?
                                 SMITH
                        Throws you guys off the trail, 
                        keeps you focused on finding her in 
                        the city rather than looking for 
                        someone to take her out of the 
                        country. She’ll probably be in the 
                        cargo hold of a private jet right 
                        about the time you show up 
                        somewhere with a briefcase full of 
                        money, and no one ever comes to 
                        meet you. Or maybe he’s setting up 
                        a buyer, and if that doesn’t go 
                        through, he’ll try to get the 
                        ransom. Either way, he’s waiting 
                        for the right moment to get her out 
                        of the country. He could have done 
                        it right after he grabbed her, but 
                        it would have been traced back to 
                        him. Every day, there are 1200 
                        flights out of the city from three 
                        airports, hundreds of cargo ships 
                        coming and going, trains come 
                        through, tens of thousands of cars, 
                        you can’t check them all. And every 
                        day, the trail gets colder, the 
                        possibilities just increase. All of 
                        which he knows. No, he’s got her in 
                        a safe place, he doesn’t have to 
                        move right away.

           We see everyone around the room, Smith is making an amazing 
           amount of sense for a deadbeat.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Where then?

           Smith throws some photos down of the Daiichi warehouse.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Alright, Mr. Smith, what is the 
                        building’s significance?

                                 SMITH
                        We all know that the kidnappers 
                        accessed the room through the 
                        service hallway. The development 
                        company that manages the apartment 
                        building where TOP 40 was kidnapped 
                        uses a maid service based out of 
                        this warehouse.(a very long beat) 
                        Monohan spent six hours here on 
                        Tuesday.
           Shocked looks around the room. 

                                 SMITH
                        I hope this makes up for last time, 
                        detective, I really want us to be 
                        friends. (softer) cocksucker.

           The detective thinks about responding, but composes himself. 
           He turns to his underlings.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        We’ll take it from here. I want to 
                        be in that warehouse and in 
                        Monohan’s hotel suite in twenty 
                        minutes.

           The room becomes a flurry of activity as a couple of senior 
           detectives get on their cell phones and begin making plans 
           for a raid.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Nice work, Mr. Smith. I’d been 
                        warned that your technique was a 
                        bit irregular, and it definitely 
                        gave us a scare, but hopefully this 
                        will be it.

                                 SMITH
                        Well, let’s manage our expectations 
                        for now. We don’t have her yet. But 
                        I’m pretty confident. Unless...

                                 KIBERTON
                        Unless...

                                 SMITH
                        He’s already sold her.

           Smith nods knowingly.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Shit.

           Smith nods.

                                 KIBERTON
                        What would they do to her?

           Smith shrugs.
                                 SMITH
                        Concubine, organ harvesting, human 
                        sacrifice, pickle her and put her 
                        in a big fuckin’ jar and drink her 
                        essence at New Year’s. (shrugs) 
                        It’s hard to say. (beat) These 
                        aren’t normal people like you and 
                        me, Mr. Kiberton.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

           The cops raid the warehouse. Dozens of swat officers, etc. A 
           helicopter.

           They break in, throw tear gas into the front office. A couple 
           of little Guatamalan workers come out of the office, hands 
           up.

           INT. WAREHOUSE MAIN SPACE - CONTINUOUS

           They get into the main warehouse space. SWAT pours in.

           They scour every inch of the place. It’s empty except for two 
           runty mutt dogs having sex. There’s an awkward moment while 
           the two dogs are surrounded by a squad of armed men. The men 
           slowly lower their weapons.

           INT. ST. PIERRE HOTEL - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           SWAT OFFICERS storming the lobby past old rich people.

           INT. ST. PIERRE HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           SWAT OFFICERS going up the stairs. Busting into J.T. 
           Monohan’s suite. SWAT officers coming in through the fire 
           escape etc.

           INT. MONOHAN’S SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Monohan rises up out of bed. Inez is in bed next to him, a 
           bit slower to rise.

                                 SWAT
                        Get down! Down! Down!

                                 J.T.
                        What the FUCK is goin’ on?
           SWAT rushes him, they knock him to the ground and cuff him. 
           Inez is cuffed as well.

                                 INEZ
                        This is absolutely outrageous, J.T.

                                 J.T.
                        Well, I didn’t fuckin’ plan it, 
                        Inez. It’s a police raid, not a 
                        dress-up party.

           We see Champ in his cage, struggling to get at the SWAT 
           officers. He takes out his little knife from his boot.

                                 CHAMP
                        I’ll cut you!

                                 J.T.
                        Calm down, Champ! You got a fight 
                        tonight. Relax goddamnit!

           Champ ignores J.T. And begins swinging his knife at the hands 
           of the guys handling his cage.

                                 J.T.
                        This some kind of motherfuckin’ 
                        joke? It’s Mukembe’s people, ain’t 
                        it?

           INT. MUSIC CONFERENCE ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

           Smith is sitting there with the police and the executives. 
           The room is dead quiet. The mood is utterly serious.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Mr. Kiberton, Monohan is clean. 
                        There was nothing of significance 
                        in his hotel room, and he has an 
                        alibi for every second of his time 
                        in New York. This warehouse was 
                        used to make plastic molds, and now 
                        they just use the front office. 
                        Monohan’s buying the property and 
                        converting it into a state of the 
                        art training facility for little 
                        men, thus his trip there a few days 
                        ago. It is not, nor has it ever 
                        been connected to Daiichi cleaning 
                        services. Someone stuck a fucking 
                        sign up on the building a couple of 
                        days ago. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DETECTIVE (cont'd)
                        The manager for the plastics 
                        company told me he’d been meaning 
                        to take it off. 

           Detective turns to Smith.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        It’s a complete fucking setup. (to 
                        Smith) How could you be so fucking 
                        stupid? Didn’t you check it out? 

           Smith is stunned. He sits there in silence. 

                                 DETECTIVE
                        You washed up piece of shit. There 
                        was nothing in there but two shitty 
                        little dogs fucking. 

           Smith looks away.

                                 SMITH
                        I though-

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Somebody’s been feeding you bad 
                        information, and you’ve been 
                        bringing it back here like a little 
                        puppy. They’ve been watching you, 
                        working you. And now they know that 
                        we’re back to square fucking one. 
                        With less than 24 hours.

           Long pause. The gravity of the current situation overcomes 
           the room. Kiberton turns to look at Smith.

                                 KIBERTON
                        This is very disappointing, Mr. 
                        Smith. Very disappointing. 

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Johnny is alone in the office studying the photo of TOP 40 
           with the circled TV. He is inspecting the image with a photo 
           loop.

           There’s a buzz at the door. Johnny get’s up and answers it. 
           It’s the Haitians. They walk in.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hello.

           We can tell Johnny doesn’t know who the Haitians are by his 
           welcoming demeanor.
                                 JOHNNY
                        Hey, can I help you?

                                 GEORGE
                        I was wondering if my associate and 
                        I might speak to you for a moment 
                        about an opportunity to purchase 
                        land in a tropical paradise, kissed 
                        by the sun.

                                 LIONEL
                        Blessed by fair winds,

                                 GEORGE
                        And with fabulous investment 
                        potential.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Oh.. uh, sorry, this is a place of 
                        business, we don’t allow 
                        soliciting.

           EXT. THE STREET - 10 MINUTES LATER

           Smith is walking down the street. Shellshocked from the day’s 
           events. He dials Johnny at the office. 

           INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Lionel picks up the phone.

                                 LIONEL
                        Hello, please hold.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Smith is on a busy loud street, he couldn’t quite hear the 
           voice. He stops... curious... continues to hold the phone to 
           his ear.

                                 SMITH
                        Hello? Who’s there? Johnny?

           SPLITSCREEN - CONTINUOUS

           Smith is now on one half. On the other half of the 
           splitscreen is Smith’s office,  where JOHNNY, Smith’s 
           assistant, is now nude and duct-taped to the top of Smith’s 
           desk. 
           Lionel and George are standing over Johnny, whacking Johnny 
           with a Swingline stapler, actually stapling him and jabbing 
           at him with a lucite pyramid shaped Detective award. His body 
           has been stuck all over with brightly colored plastic 
           pushpins. A ballpoint pen is stuckin his leg. The other 
           Haitians are trying to get into Smith’s safe.

                                 LIONEL
                        Brother, this man almost looks too 
                        young to be left heading the office 
                        while his employer is out.

                                 GEORGE
                        A mustache, if kept neatly trimmed, 
                        can give the appearance of being 
                        older, and is thus a potential 
                        asset in such a situation.

                                 LIONEL
                        Very true, brother.

           Lionel takes a marker off the desk and begins giving the 
           whimpering Johnny a magic marker mustache.

           He steps back to admire his work. He adds something.

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 GEORGE
                        No practical business application, 
                        but humorous.

           Lionel has given johnny a Hitler mustache and a swastika 
           right in the middle of Johnny’s forehead.  He takes his hand 
           off the receiver and resumes speaking with Smith.

                                 SMITH
                        Johnny, you there?

                                 LIONEL
                        Sorry for the long wait time, may I 
                        help you.

           Smith recognizes the voice instantly and stops cold. 

                                 SMITH
                        Shit.

                                 LIONEL
                        Hello, Smith.
                                 SMITH
                        What the fuck are you doing? Leave 
                        him alone. He doesn’t have anything 
                        to do with this.

           Johnny gags slightly, disrupting Lionel just as he’s going to 
           speak. 

                                 GEORGE
                        (to Johnny) Learn some fucking 
                        manners. Your employer is on the 
                        phone, motherfucker.

           George savagely whacks him with the stapler three or four 
           times. We see the glinting silver staples stuck in him.

                                 SMITH
                        I have until tomorrow.

                                 LIONEL
                        Indeed you do, Smith. We were just 
                        in the neighborhood so we thought 
                        we’d swing by and drop off some 
                        self-help materials with your 
                        assistant. Motivational literature. 
                        That sort of thing.

           Crevecoeur (the big, simple one) pulls a small revolver out 
           of Smith’s drawer. He cocks it and points it at Johnny. Sort 
           of like he’s playing with a toy.

           The gun fires and hits Johnny. Neither Lionel or George 
           expected this.

                                 SMITH
                        Hello? What the fuck was that?

           George quickly hangs up the phone.

           END OF SPLITSCREEN

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Lionel and George turn to Crevecoeur.

                                 LIONEL
                        My goodness Creve-coeur.
                                 GEORGE
                        Crevecoeur, Lionel is simply using 
                        the threat of death as a business 
                        negotiation tactic. He did not wish 
                        for this man to be shot.

           Crevecoeur says nothing. He just stands there looking dumb. 
           He puts Smith’s gun down on the desk. Lionel looks over and 
           regards the now lifeless body of Johnny on the desk. He seems 
           to see the bright side.

                                 LIONEL
                        Well. I suppose this does leave a 
                        succinct message. Let’s go.

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith runs into his office with gun drawn, but the HAITIANS 
           are gone. He sees Johnny’s body.

           He walks over to Johnny. Johnny’s arms have been folded, 
           tucked in between his arms is a book.

           INSERT: “THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE”

                                 SMITH
                        Fucking devils.

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith quickly goes to his safe, flips up the carpet, opens 
           it, and grabs everything out of it and stuffs it in a 
           briefcase.

           He then goes to grab his revolver on the desk.

           Smith cracks the revolver open, dumps the shells in his hand. 
           Hurriedly he sorts through them, one has been fired.

           He dumps them all in his pockets.

                                 SMITH
                        (to self)
                        Gun, shell casing-

           He turns and looks at the desk where Johnny is lying. It’s 
           covered in blood.
           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith hurriedly tears through a cabinet in the office. He 
           pulls out some cleaning supplies. He pulls on a pair of 
           rubber gloves. He lays a couple of garbage bags out onto the 
           floor. He lifts Johnny off the desk as gently as possible and 
           drags him onto the floor.

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith begins shoveling all the blood-soaked papers and desk 
           objects into a big garbage bag. 

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith is Windexing down the desk. He’s just about got it 
           cleaned. 

           He starts looking around the room for more blood or other 
           incriminating objects. The place looks surprisingly good.

           He nods at his own achievement. And then is interrupted by a 
           gasping sound. 

           Smith turns his head and looks at Johnny.

           He stands there, looking at him. 

           Johnny gasps again.

                                 SMITH
                        Oh fuck.

           Smith is instantly panicked. 

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           The door to Smith’s office opens, Smith pokes his head out, 
           we see him look both ways, he reaches back and begins 
           dragging Johnny’s body out.

           Johnny is on an office chair with rollers. We hear him wheeze 
           periodically.

           Smith has his briefcase under one arm, in the other he’s 
           holding the garbage bag full of bloody trash.

           Smith tries to push Johnny as fast as he can, despite being 
           so loaded down. He does a weird half-run walk. 
           INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Smith reaches the service elevator. He bangs the down button. 
           The elevator reaches the floor. The two of them get in.

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith gets Johnny to his car. He looks a bit frantic. He pops 
           the trunk, inside is some weird surveillance gear, a lot of 
           wires and things and a pair of boltcutters. He pushes it all 
           aside. He spreads some blankets out in his trunk and puts 
           Johnny in the trunk. He closes the trunk.

           He looks at the chair, he throws it in the backseat.

           Then he stops, thinking.

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - A MINUTE LATER

           Smith is holding a pair of needlenose pliers. The trunk is 
           open.

           He looks Johnny over, trying to figure out where he got shot. 
           He rips open his shirt, and sure enough there’s a bullet 
           hole. 

                                 SMITH
                        Johnny, I’m sorry man, but I’ve got 
                        to do this, then I’ll take you to 
                        the hospital. 

           Smith douses the pliers with an old bottle of booze. 

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Smith raises the pliers, seemingly about to go digging for 
           the bullet in Johnny’s chest. Then he pauses, something 
           occurs to him.

           He pushes Johnny over.

                                 SMITH
                        Oh thank god.

           We see the bullet went through Johnny, and it’s literally 
           sticking out of his skin on his back.

           Smith grabs the bullet and puts it in his pocket.
           Johnny coughs.

           Smith slams the trunk and jumps into the car.

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Smith drives, obviously a little rattled but starting to 
           regain his odd stoned composure. He sees a speed limit sign, 
           and actually takes the trouble to make sure he’s not 
           speeding. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL - TEN MINUTES LATER

           Smith pulls up around the corner from the emergency room. He 
           gets out, pops open the trunk and then reaches into johnny’s 
           pocket and pulls out his wallet and driver’s license and puts 
           it in his pocket.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           From inside the emergency room, looking past a bunch of 
           various emergency room weirdos, we see Smith carrying Johnny. 
           Smith has a hat on to disguise himself a bit.

                                 SMITH
                        Help! I found this guy in the road. 
                        He’s hurt real bad.

           Doctors and nurses come running over.

                                 SMITH
                        (softly) Hang in there, Johnny.

                                 DOCTOR
                        What happened to this man?

           Smith is gone.

           EXT. SIDE OF HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           Smith gets in his car and pulls away.

           EXT. STREET - 20 MINUTES LATER

           Smith pulls off the road next to a dirty canal. He looks 
           around, and throws the gun in the water. He reaches into his 
           pocket and tosses the bullet in too. 
           Next he pulls out the garbage bag full of bloody papers and 
           douses them with a bottle of booze in his car. He lights the 
           bag on fire and it instantly goes up in a whoosh of flames.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Smith drives, a bit numb, he’s out by the airport. 

           INT. SEEDY AIRPORT MOTEL - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

           Smith checks in. Behind the clerk are variety packs of little 
           airplane-sized bottles of booze. They look to be 24-packs.

                                 SMITH
                        And give me one of those too.

           INT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Smith goes into his hotel room and proceeds to get wasted on 
           the tiny little bottles of booze. 

           INT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           The arena is packed and full of energy. We see J.T. Monohan  
           sitting with INEZ by his side. He says something to her and 
           then gets up and starts making his way through the crowd 
           towards a Spanish don looking guy, ANDREAS MORALEZ, played by 
           John Waters.

                                 J.T.
                        Mr. Moralez.. J.T. Monahan...  How 
                        are you? In from the Azores?

                                 MORALEZ
                        Ah, Yes, Senor Monahan, I am very
                        a-happy to be here. We’re very 
                        pleased with our prospects.

                                 J.T.
                        Your man Mukembe is a hell of a 
                        fighter.

                                 MORALEZ
                        Gracias. And how are you?

                                 J.T.
                        Well, I had a little run in with 
                        the police last night which kept us 
                        up.
                                 MORALEZ
                        Oh my. Whatever it was, did you do 
                        it?

           The two men share a laugh.

                                 J.T.
                        Normally the answer would be yes, 
                        but fortunately this was a mixup. 
                        (turns serious) And if I find out 
                        you had anything to do with it, I 
                        will fucking kill you. 

           Moralez’ grin is wiped off his face.

                                 J.T.
                        Good luck tonight, you fucking sack 
                        of shit.

           Monohan turns and walks away.

           INT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           Monohan settles into his seat for Champs’s big fight against 
           Mukembe.

           INT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           The grizzled old little man fighter announcer shuffles out to 
           the center of the ring.

           The crowd is chanting “Death! Death!”

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        In the blue corner, weighing 3 
                        pounds, one ounce, a severer of 
                        heads, a bringer of death, Mukembe 
                        Motutu!

           The crowd roars.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        In the red corner, weighing 2 
                        pounds, 11 ounces, corn fed, kills 
                        ‘em dead, Vern Carter!

           The crowd goes crazy. 
           INT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           Champ raises a fist from his corner. He takes his shirt off. 
           His stitched up cuts from the night before don’t look good. 
           He looks tired.

                                 MANAGER
                        Now you got to keep him away from 
                        these cuts, Champ. 

           Champ just nods.

                                 REFEREE
                        Fighters ready.

           INT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           The bell rings.

           Immediately Mukembe leaps at Champ and savagely kicks Champ 
           in the chest, right where his stitches are. He is hurled 
           across the ring, and starts bleeding badly.

           The crowd goes apeshit.

           Angle on Monohan not liking the fight getting off to this 
           start.

           Back in the ring, Champ struggles to get up on his feet as 
           the ref holds Mukembe back.

           INT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           Champ gets up. The ref steps aside. Mukembe rushes Champ 
           again. Champ waits for him, and punches him in the throat. 

           Mukembe stumbles, gasping for air. Champ kicks him in the 
           mouth. 

           Mukembe goes down, it looks like Champ has stemmed the tide. 

                                 J.T.
                        Finish him off, Champ!

           Champ nods, and starts walking over to kill Mukembe. He 
           stumbles and stops, he looks like he’s in pain. He grasps at 
           the stitches on his chest.

           The referee goes over to see if Champ is ok. 
           INT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           Champ goes down on one knee, he doesn’t look good. He coughs 
           up a bunch of blood. 

           Just then, Mukembe lurches up, throws the referee out of the 
           ring, grabs Champ by the hair, and punches him so hard in the 
           chest that his fist comes out the other side.

           He begins prancing around the ring with Champ’s impaled dead 
           body on his arm. 

           The crowd goes crazy. 

           INT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           J.T. is upset. Heartbroken. Moralez is clapping excitedly. He 
           looks over and raises his gin and tonic at Monohan. Monohan 
           fumes.

           The bell begins ringing, it’s over.

           The Jumbotron fills with red. The word “death” comes up.

                                 CROWD
                        DEATH! DEATH! DEATH!

           INT. CEMENT ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           TOP 40 is sitting on the mattress in utter boredom. Around 
           her is a scattering of empty fruit roll up wrappers. Rocky IV 
           is playing on the TV behind her but she’s barely watching. 
           She hears a noise. Something’s being shoved under the door.

           She goes over, it’s a flat piece of jerky like you get at a 
           convenient store. 

           She goes to the door and bangs on it. 

                                 TOP 40
                        Buy me some decent food, you 
                        bastards!

           There’s no answer, just the sound of Sylvester Stallone 
           talking on the TV in the background.
           INT. TKG MUSIC - THE NEXT MORNING

           The executives and the police are gathered around a table. 

                                 POLICE
                        Nothing.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Nothing?

                                 POLICE
                        We’re sorry to say it, but we feel 
                        that you should proceed with paying 
                        the ransom at this point and we’ll 
                        try and set up something that way, 
                        that’s our best bet now of getting 
                        her back alive.

                                 KIBERTON
                        (holding back annoyance) OK, well 
                        who’s going to handle the exchange?

                                 POLICE
                        We’ve got several undercover 
                        officers in mind-

           Kiberton shakes his head.

                                 KIBERTON
                        I don’t think that’s going to cut 
                        the mustard, do you detective? 
                        These people were fairly definitive 
                        that it should not be a police 
                        officer. We have to tell them who 
                        we’re going to use pretty damn 
                        quick and I think we have no choice 
                        but to have our man Mr. Smith 
                        handle this. 

                                 POLICE
                        I think, with all respect sir, 
                        that’s an idiotic choice. 

                                 KIBERTON
                        I don’t see who else it could be. 
                        He’s been in this situation before, 
                        he’s not a police officer, and 
                        we’ve got to give the kidnappers a 
                        name.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Well what about Mr. Greenberg?
                                 KIBERTON
                        Avi doesn’t have the stones for 
                        something like this, detective. 

           Avi looks mildly offended.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Sorry, Avi but it’s true.

           Avi nods. 

                                 AVI
                        But what if Smith won’t do it, sir?

                                 KIBERTON
                        (surprised) We’re not giving him 
                        any fucking choice, Avi. If he 
                        doesn’t do it, we’ll plant some 
                        drugs on him, and accuse of him of 
                        trying to steal something.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        We don’t plant drugs on people, 
                        sir. And besides, I don’t think 
                        you’d need to go to that length. 

                                 KIBERTON
                        Fair point. But we’re using Smith. 
                        (beat) I don’t know if I’m the only 
                        one thinking this, but it’s no 
                        great loss to the world or our 
                        shareholders if a junkie detective 
                        gets killed. (beat) Avi, find 
                        Smith.

           INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Smith Dangerous Smith is now drinking in the bar next to the 
           seedy motel.  Morning sun shines through a small window in 
           the front of the bar. He’s never looked so ragged. He’s 
           talking nonsense to himself.

           He gets up and goes over to a postcard dispenser, but it’s 
           empty. He comes back to the bar. He starts drumming on the 
           bartop with his hands. He’s beyond fucked up.

                                 SMITH
                        Uh-huh.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What?
                                 SMITH
                        Nothing.

           Smith produces his bag of speed and empties the remainder of 
           it into a healthy pile right on the bar. He grabs the straw 
           out of his drink and blows in it to get the excess liquid out 
           of it.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Hey man. You can’t do that shit 
                        right there.

                                 SMITH
                        What? Oh...

           He accidentally spills his drink into the pile of drugs, 
           they’re instantly useless.

                                 SMITH
                        Shit.

           INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Smith gets a call on his cell. He sees it’s TKG Music. He 
           debates about answering it. He doesn’t answer. It immediately 
           rings again. He picks up.

                                 SMITH
                        Hello?

                                 KIBERTON
                        Smith?

                                 SMITH
                        Yes?

                                 KIBERTON
                        We need you to make the drop. How 
                        soon can you be here?

                                 SMITH
                        Uhm,...I can’t really make it down 
                        there right now.

                                 KIBERTON
                        And why is that?

                                 SMITH
                        Uh, (improvising.. Looks at the 
                        pile of wet drugs on bar) I just 
                        had a bit of an accident.
           INT. KIBERTON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Kiberton leans forward in his chair.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Did you know your assistant’s in 
                        the hospital, Mr. Smith? Close to 
                        death? The police are very curious 
                        what you might know about it. And I 
                        guarantee you, that if you don’t 
                        get your ass into this office, not 
                        only will we sue you for every 
                        penny of the retainer, plus 
                        damages, we’ll get your license 
                        taken away, and we’ll make goddamn 
                        sure you get nailed for whatever 
                        happened to your assistant, even if 
                        I have to make up a reason and pay 
                        off every goddamn judge in the 
                        state to do it. So what’s it going 
                        to be?

           Smith weighs the options. 

                                 SMITH
                        Jail sounds ok. I want to be in 
                        solitary though. That many judges 
                        should be able to take care of 
                        that, right?

                                 KIBERTON
                        Look goddamnit, you’ve got to do 
                        it. We’ve already told the 
                        kidnappers you’re going to do it. 
                        There’s no changing it now. What do 
                        you want?

           Smith thinks about it.

                                 SMITH
                        Seven hundred- (he stops himself) A 
                        million bucks.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Oh fuck you, you fucking lunatic.

           Smith waits. He knows Kiberton has no other choice. A long 
           moment passes. He calms down.

                                 KIBERTON
                        OK. Agreed.
                                 SMITH
                        Cash.

                                 KIBERTON
                        That’s not possible.

                                 SMITH
                        Then you and Avi better put your 
                        heads together and figure out how 
                        you’re going to frame me for.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Goddamn you Smith! Ok. CASH. Now, 
                        where the hell are you? 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - TWO HOURS LATER

           Smith is in the back of a police car. As the police car 
           drives into the city, it passes the arena where the Little 
           Man championship bout was being held.

           Smith sees a big Jumbotron screen on the side of the arena 
           with an image of the tiny African fighter holding up a gold 
           champion belt over his head, Champ’s blood still cascading 
           down his arms.

           The cops trigger the sirens and lights to get through the 
           traffic.

           INT. TKG MUSIC -  A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Smith is ushered into the office. Avi meets him. He is 
           decidedly colder with Smith.

           INT. TKG MUSIC - CONTINUOUS

           Smith is led into yet another conference room.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Smith.

           Smith just nods. He doesn’t wait for the detectives to step 
           forward, he turns to them.

                                 SMITH
                        I’m not wearing a wire, that’ll 
                        just get me and the girl killed. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SMITH (cont'd)
                        If you want to get the girl back 
                        alive, you’re going to have to pay 
                        these guys their money and play by 
                        their rules.

           The rooms stirs.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Pishposh, I don’t see why we can’t 
                        recover the girl and our funds.

           Smith shakes his head. 

                                 SMITH
                        Everyone should remember that 
                        they’ve already said that once 
                        their courier has safely returned 
                        with the money, THEN they’ll 
                        release the girl. Mr. Kiberton, 
                        you’re not getting your money back. 
                        Not even with the help of the 
                        city’s greatest crime-fighting mind 
                        of all time on your side. (looks at 
                        Murray)

           Murray looks up from writing a note, he looks tired and 
           pudgy, not such a great mind.

                                 SMITH
                        No helicopters, no fancy bullshit, 
                        unless you just want me to take 
                        your 20 million dollars for a ride 
                        around town. Because that’s what 
                        it’ll be. These guys will pull 
                        back, not make contact, and you’ll 
                        find the girl decomposing in a 
                        rented apartment once the smell 
                        gets so bad the neighbors keep 
                        wondering who’s cooking old fish 
                        all the time.

           Kiberton winces.

                                 KIBERTON
                        OK. What do we do?

                                 SMITH
                        One car, way, way behind me. Two 
                        guys, very discreet. They need to 
                        stay a couple of hundred yards 
                        back.
                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        And we’re just going to trust you 
                        to take care of this?

                                 KIBERTON
                        Unfortunately, I think we are. 

           The detective starts to argue.

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        It’s your call, sir, but the odds 
                        that you’ll ever see your money or 
                        the girl again are pretty damn 
                        slim.

                                 KIBERTON
                        So are the odds of you finding the 
                        kidnappers before they make contact 
                        again. Which is in... (turns to 
                        Avi)

                                 AVI
                        Any second now.

                                 KIBERTON
                        (quietly) Pretty slim, you must 
                        admit. So this is how we’re going 
                        to goddamn well do it.

           The detectives shrug.

                                 SMITH
                        Where’s the drop?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        We’re about to find out.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Avi hits a button on the speaker phone and slides it closer 
           to the group.

           There is a long pause and some strange shuffling and clicking 
           sounds. The group exchanges looks.

           More silence. Then the kidnapper’s voice.

                                 KIDNAPPER’S VOICE
                        Mr. Smith is there?

                                 KIBERTON
                        Yes. We are prepared to-
                                 KIDNAPPER’S VOICE
                        (interrupting) He should go 
                        downstairs to his car, and begin 
                        driving. And wait for instructions 
                        on the cell phone under Mr. 
                        Kiberton’s chair.

                                 KIBERTON
                        What?

           There are some shuffling sounds on the other end, then the 
           sound of the call being disconnected and then a dial tone.

           INT. BOARD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kiberton goes to look under his chair. There is indeed a 
           cellphone taped there. The room stirs.

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        Better let us have a look first, 
                        Mr. Kiberton.

           The detectives cluster around the chair.

           The detective cuts the duct tape with a pocket knife. He 
           examines the phone.

                                 KIBERTON
                        My god. How could they have...

           Smith laughs, then pretends to be coughing.

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Smith rides down with the detectives. 

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        I don’t know how such a first rate 
                        fuckup keeps blundering into gifts 
                        from God. You screw up case after 
                        case, you get this one, you fuck it 
                        up, you get put back on it. Fucking 
                        incredible.

           Smith just looks forward, not listening. He looks at his 
           watch.

           EXT. BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Smith walks out of the building. And stops cold.
           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           A couple of detectives are going over Smith’s car, finishing 
           searching the inside it. 

                                 SEARCHING DETECTIVE
                        It’s clean.

                                 SMITH
                        If there’s any damage to that car, 
                        detective, it’s going to be your 
                        ass.

           EXT. BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Smith and the detective continue walking down to his car, 
           flanked by cops. Avi is there as well. Two security guards 
           are carting the Globetrotter suitcase that the kidnappers 
           requested. They are literally stumbling to carry the bag, 
           it’s THAT heavy.

                                 AVI
                        The money.

                                 SMITH
                        Jesus. Looks heavy.

           It takes both men to put the suitcase in Smith’s backseat.

                        Plug this into the cellphone. That 
                        way we can listen in.

           He gives Smith a typical cellphone earpiece-type device that 
           has an extra wire leading to a little antenna box.

                                 SMITH
                        Don’t fuck this up for me.

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        Ok, let’s go everybody. Smith, wait 
                        right there.

           Murray grabs Amith and spins him around against his car and 
           pats him down. He takes a gun out of the back of Smith’s 
           pants.

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        Kidnappers said no guns, Smith. Now 
                        get in the fucking car and go get 
                        us a girl.
           Avi looks at Smith as he walks away. Smith gets into his car 
           and starts the engine and looks at his watch. There’s a crowd 
           of people on the steps in front of the building watching on.

           The phone rings almost immediately.

                                 SMITH
                        Hello.

           Silence. Then the voice speaks.

                                 KIDNAPPER’S VOICE
                        Begin by proceeding straight ahead. 
                        You’re coming up on a right turn. 
                        Take it.

           Smith does. He’s now on a two lane street. Traffic in both 
           directions.

                                 KIDNAPPER’S VOICE
                        Now go straight. Midway down the 
                        block, turn your car into oncoming 
                        traffic so you block BOTH lanes. 

           Smith hesitates.

                                 KIDNAPPER’S VOICE
                        Do it!

           Smith closes his eyes and turns his car into traffic on the 
           two lane street. He’s now blocking both lanes. It instantly 
           stops traffic in both directions. 

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Cars honk at Smith as he is stopped in the middle of the 
           street. He sits there for a moment, waiting for further 
           instructions.

                                 SMITH
                        Now what?

           Silence.

           We see Smith physically struggling to get the suitcase out of 
           the first car.
           He drags it between the two cars, unable to pick it up, and 
           somehow manages to shove it into the backseat of the other 
           car.

           Smith is in a rough neighborhood, as he slows down to go over

           The house beyond the curb has a VERY SPECIFIC lawn ornament, 
           two concrete cherubs holding up a concrete dove. They are 
           gazing out, almost regarding Smith. He looks at them for a 
           long moment.

           Smith has gotten out of the car. He’s got the hood up. He’s

           We see a sign advertising calling cards to Trinidad and 
           Tobago.

           Smith looks around.
                                 SMITH
                        (under his breath) No fucking way.

                        blocks.

           Smith drives. He reaches a desolate area of abandoned old 
           commercial buildings. There is a small cluster of buildings 
           surrounded by empty lots, full of broken bricks and trash.

           The detectives recount the tale for Kiberton et al.

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        At 4:24 pm, Smith went into a 
                        building with the money, after a 
                        short time, there was gunfire heard 
                        and then the building exploded. We 
                        assume he was killed along with the 
                        kidnappers. We don’t know the cause 
                        of the explosion, could be that a 
                        bullet clipped a gas line, but 
                        based on its intensity, we think it 
                        was explosives. We’re not sure if 
                        the explosion was triggered by the 
                        shooting, or the kidnappers 
                        themselves. Our best guess is the 
                        kidnappers planned to blow the 
                        building as a diversion after they 
                        got the money. But that’s just a 
                        guess. We found a white VW van 
                        parked behind the building, which 
                        we assume was the intended getaway 
                        vehicle. Obviously this is all 
                        speculation at this point. The fire 
                        department is still on the scene, 
                        the rubble’s too hot to sort 
                        through. They’ve informed us that 
                        any clues to what happened in there 
                        have probably, err, melted, at this 
                        point.

           Kiberton doesn’t give a shit about this.

                                 KIBERTON
                        What about Top 40?

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        Nothing yet.

                                 KIBERTON
                        (disbelief)
                        And the money?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        We recovered several thousand 
                        dollars, sir-
                                 KIBERTON
                        (mock friendly)
                        Oh, well, you should just keep it, 
                        really, I mean it. (angry) for your 
                        legal defense, you incompetent 
                        pieces of shit!

           They recoil.

                                 KIBERTON
                        The money’s gone, Smith’s dead, the 
                        kidnappers are dead, no sign of the 
                        girl, or any reason to think that a 
                        bunch of dead kidnappers will tell 
                        us where she is!

                                 SUPERINTENDANT
                        Mr. Kiberton, we have no reason to 
                        believe that others in the ring 
                        won’t still make contact to try to 
                        re-ransom the girl.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Others? Do you really think that’s 
                        going to happen, sir? If there even 
                        are “others?” After their 
                        contemporaries have all been blown 
                        into tiny little pieces?

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        It’s a possibility.

                                 KIBERTON
                        Is it? Well you’ll forgive me if I 
                        don’t share your sense of optimism. 

                                 SUPERINTENDANT
                        We’ll see what we can do, sir. 

           Kiberton just mumbles and waves his hand.

                                 AVI
                        That will be all, gentlemen.

           EXT. TKG MUSIC - CONTINUOUS

           Murray and his partner walk out with their boss, THE 
           SUPERINTENDANT. 
                                 SUPERINTENDANT
                        She’ll turn up in a field or in a 
                        river or a post office box 
                        somewhere, but in the meantime, 
                        we’ve got to work this one through. 
                        Kiberton wants us to go through 
                        Smith’s papers, see if there’s 
                        something he might have had and 
                        missed. 

           Detective Murray gets ready to protest. The superintendant 
           holds his hands up.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT
                        I know what you’re gonna say, but 
                        the cocksucker actually came up 
                        with a few things on this one. Just 
                        go check it out.

           Detective Murray nods.

           INT. SMITH’S OFFICE - HOUR LATER

           Detectives Murray and Moore are going through Smith’s papers. 
           He’s got a file of possible suspects.

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        So he had us both down as suspects.

           He holds up a dossier.

                                 DETECTIVE MOORE
                        Really?

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        Yeah. The guy was fucking ballsy. 
                        Gotta give him that.

           He throws the dossier down. He’s flipping through a notebook 
           of Smith’s.

           On the wall Smith has a note taped up. It reads “reflection 
           in TV. Ring?”

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        Did you see this?

           The other detective pops his head in from the other room.

                                 DETECTIVE MOORE
                        What?
                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        Bring in the picture of Top 40 from 
                        the kidnappers, will you?

           The other detective walks in with it.

           It’s the photo of Top 40 holding the piece of paper that says 
           “Fuck today’s date” on it.

           They look at it. Murray examines it with a photo loop then 
           points out something in the photo.

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        Look.

                                 DETECTIVE MOORE
                        What?

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        Right here next to Top 40.

           Murray uses the loop to examine the photo. In the TV, we see 
           a reflection. It’s pretty clear that it’s of a dark-skinned 
           hand holding the camera that took the photo. The hand has a 
           very distinctive ring with a very distinctive “L” on it. 

           Both detectives seem a bit stunned.

                                 DETECTIVE MOORE
                        Jesus. How did we miss THIS?

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        During the drop, he kept saying “No 
                        fucking way”.

           He puts the photo down and picks up one of Smith’s pictures 
           which is sitting on top of a pile of photos. It’s of the 
           Haitians, all getting out of a their white VW van in the same 
           neighborhood the explosion happened.

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        That van behind the building at the 
                        drop, it was a 60’s VW van, right?

                                 DETECTIVE MOORE
                        Yup.

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        And the ID on the guy who came to 
                        the door was a young black guy with 
                        a white short sleeved shirt and 
                        tie?
                                 DETECTIVE MOORE
                        Yup.

           Detective Moore picks up the next photo in the pile and holds 
           it up for detective moore to see. It’s a long lens close up 
           of Lionel. He fits the description exactly and most 
           importantly he has the distinctive gold “L” ring on his right 
           hand.

                                 DETECTIVE MOORE
                        Jeeeeesus Christ. These are the 
                        kidnappers. He was sitting on the 
                        goddamned kidnappers. Why the hell 
                        didn’t he tell us about this? 

           Detective Moore shakes his head. 

                                 DETECTIVE MURRAY
                        You got me. Maybe because he was a 
                        fucking idiot who was hopelessly 
                        addicted drugs and awful at his 
                        job?

           Detective Moore shrugs. It’s a perfectly acceptable 
           explanation.

           EXT. FIFTH AVENUE SIDEWALK - NOON, THE NEXT DAY

           Crowded city sidewalk, typical lunchtime NYC cityscape.

           The foot traffic parts. 

           We see a small (10% regular human size) person drunkenly 
           weaving along the sidewalks. It has a sack over its head. And 
           a long tshirt that says “New York Fucking City”

           It pulls at the sack on its head. Finally pulling it off.

           A crowd has gathered around.

           It’s Top 40.  The crowd gasps. She looks disheveled like 
           she’s been living in fairly rough conditions.

           Camera cuts wide to reveal that she’s standing right in front 
           of TKG Music headquarters.
           INT. EVENING NEWS BROADCAST - EARLY EVENING

                                 ANCHOR
                        Breaking news, TOP 40 is released 
                        five days after her reported 
                        disappearance.

                        Her release comes on the heels of a 
                        botched attempt to pay her 
                        kidnappers a reported ransom of 20 
                        million dollars, earlier today.

           INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS

           We cut wider to reveal that the newscast is playing on the TV 
           in JT’s limo. J.T. drives slong, staring out the window, 
           ignoring the newscast. He looks somber. Reflective. On the 
           seat next to J.T. is a small mahogany coffin.

           EXT. AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

           JT’s limo rides up right along side his private jet. The 
           stairs are already down for him. His cargo hold is open and 
           some men are loading his things into the plane.

           INT. JT’S JET - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           J.T. gets on the plane, all the hot stewardesses fawn over 
           the little coffin.

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Oh no, J.T., what happened?

           J.T. shakes his head.

                                 J.T..
                        Well Suzanne, I guess he just 
                        didn’t have it for the final. 
                        Mentally, he was just off his game. 
                        Here, let’s put our friend 
                        somewhere quiet for the ride home, 
                        ok, sweetheart? We’ll bury him 
                        under that big mango tree when we 
                        get home.

           He passes the coffin to the stewardess.
           INT. JT’S JET - CONTINUOUS

           A stewardess helps J.T. select and light a cigar. J.T. stares 
           out his window at the men loading large packing crates into 
           his cargo hold. The stewardess then hands him a phone. He 
           dials a number and puts it to his ear.

                                 J.T.
                        Inez DeCooper, what the hell are 
                        you doin’?

           INT. INEZ’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Inez is having a handler show her several new little men. She 
           speaks on the phone as the handler has the little men do some 
           shadowboxing. 

                                 INEZ
                        Oh, Why bother, J.T., Really.

           INT. JT’S JET - CONTINUOUS

           J.T. looks out the window.

                                 J.T.
                        Well, I know you’re sensitive, 
                        Inez, so I didn’t want you to think 
                        I’d just leave town without saying 
                        goodbye.

           INT. INEZ’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Inez is dithering between an Aborigine or a long-haired biker 
           gang looking little man. 

                                 INEZ
                        That’s very sweet of you, J.T., but 
                        I said goodbye to you when I 
                        flushed your semen down the toilet.

           INT. JT’S JET - CONTINUOUS

           J.T. chuckles. Then leans forward.
                                 J.T.
                        The next time I come to New York 
                        I’m gonna break into your apartment 
                        and tie you up and fuck you like a 
                        Korean gymnast in a prison camp.

           INT. INEZ’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Inez pauses. A tiny smile passes across her face. 

                                 INEZ
                        Well, if you promise.

           Pause.

                                 INEZ
                        Goodbye J.T..

           She hangs up and turns to the trainer. She points to the 
           biker gang little man.

                                 INEZ
                        I’ll take that one.

           INT. JT’S JET - CONTINUOUS

           J.T. chuckles and hangs up. He continues to look out the 
           window and puff on his cigar.

           EXT. SOUTH AMERICA - 8 HOURS LATER

           JTs plane touches down and taxis toward a hangar. The baggage 
           is unloaded and taken into a hangar. J.T. gets out of the 
           plane and walks into the hangar. J.T. ushers everyone out. He 
           opens a large wooden packing crate with a crowbar. There are 
           some paintings and things inside. He pulls them aside and 
           then goes at the back of the crate with his crowbar again. 

           He pulls off some planks of wood, revealing Smith inside, 
           seated in a small hidden compartment. He’s drenched in sweat 
           and eating a sandwich. He gets out and stretches. 

                                 J.T.
                        Well I guess you can add aided and 
                        abetted a known felon to all that 
                        other bullshit you said about me. 

           Smith nods. 
                                 J.T.
                        Not that a lot of it isn’t true.

                                 SMITH
                        Well, thanks for the assistance.

           J.T. nods.

                                 J.T.
                        For the right price, I’m a very 
                        helpful person. There’s your gear 
                        over there, as requested. Need a 
                        hand with that?

                                 SMITH
                        Sure.

           Smith goes over to his stuff and produces the large 
           Globetrotter suitcase of money from the drop. The two of the 
           men struggle with the heavy case and put into the trunk of a 
           small car. 

                                 J.T.
                        Good doin’ business with you, Mr. 
                        Smith.

                                 SMITH
                        Likewise. 

           J.T. pauses.

                                 J.T.
                        Actually, there’s one thing I gotta 
                        ask. Well, I got a whole damn bunch 
                        of questions, but our time here is 
                        short. How in the hell did you make 
                        sure they’d put you on the case in 
                        the first place?

           Long pause. Then Smith speaks.

                                 SMITH
                        I didn’t. 

           J.T. nods. Thinks about it for a minute. 

                                 J.T.
                        Ready either way, huh?

           Smith just stands there and says nothing. 

                                 J.T.
                        I’ll be damned. 
           A tiny smile comes over Smith’s face.

                                 J.T.
                        This could get lonely, Mr. Smith. 
                        You arrange to have a ladyfriend 
                        meet you down here?

                                 SMITH
                        I haven’t had a ladyfriend in a 
                        very long time.

                                 J.T.
                        Well, I’m sure you’ll have time to 
                        remedy that.

           The two men stand there.

                                 J.T.
                        Enjoy your stay here in-

           SFX: J.T.’s jet fires up, it’s too loud for us to hear him 
           say where Smith is. 

           The men shake hands.

           EXT. ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER THAT WEEK

           MONTAGE BEGINS:

           MUSIC IN: Jose Feliciano “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right”

           Shot of a grey sedan, JUST LIKE the one that Smith drove to 
           the drop location, but it’s not all scorched and destroyed. 
           The tires have been taken, trim ripped off, about 10 
           florescent orange abandoned vehicle warning stickers 
           plastered to the windows.

           Behind the car, we see the VERY SPECIFIC lawn ornament of the 
           the two concrete cherubs holding a concrete dove from when 
           Smith’s car broke down during the drop.

           INT. HALLWAY OF A RUN DOWN APARTMENT BUILDING - THAT DAY

           Camera tracks down the hallway, we stop at a door that has 
           several eviction notices plastered to it. 
           INT. APARTMENT IN THE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Shot of the inside of the front door. The apartment interior 
           is dark. The door has boards nailed across it. Someone 
           clearly never wanted it to open. 

           INT. WINDOW OF THE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The window is spray-painted white. We hear noise and then two 
           guys in coveralls out on the fire escape break the window and 
           come in.

           One guy walks to the front door. He examines the nailed-up 
           door.

                                 WORKER #1
                        Fuckin’ weirdo.

           He flips the light switch on and off, they don’t come on. 

           INT. APARTMENT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           One of the guys walks into the bedroom, there is a 
           sophisticated looking tape machine hooked up to a telephone.

           Several of the buttons on the machine have crude labels made 
           of masking tape, with writing on them.

           INSERT: we see labels that say #1, #2, #3, #4 etc.

           INT. APARTMENT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Worker #2 goes to the kitchen. There are a bunch of bottles 
           of generic Irish whiskey, and two cans of spaghetti-Os. 

           He shrugs and takes a couple of bottles of whiskey, then 
           walks into the bedroom where worker #1 is looking over the 
           phone machine.

                                 WORKER #2
                        What is that thing?

                                 WORKER
                        I dunno.. an answering machine? I 
                        bet Roberto will give us cash for 
                        it. 

           He pulls the plug out of the wall and throws all the wires 
           and phone gear into his work bag. 
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - THAT DAY

           Johnny is in the hospital recovering, a nurse comes in and 
           hands him a thick envelope which is addressed to him with no 
           return address. He open’s it up and reaches in. First he 
           pulls out a small brick of cash. It’s modest sized but 
           clearly a LOT of money. He’s curious, looks around, doesn’t 
           know who sent this. Then he realizes there’s more in the 
           envelope. He reaches in and pulls out a distinctive gold ring 
           with the initial “L” on it. Johnny instantly recognizes it 
           from the photo. He looks closer, rubs the ring between his 
           fingers, a dark brown makeup comes off on his fingers. 
           Curious, Johnny reaches into the envelope and pulls out a 
           small tin of brown shoe polish.

           Johnny thinks for a minute. He puts the pieces together. He 
           starts to chuckle to himself. He reaches over and opens up 
           the biohazard waste bin and throws the ring and the tin of 
           polish into it. He then sticks the money back in the package 
           and shoves it under his pillow as lays his head back on the 
           pillow.

           Past his open door, we see Roland the drum machine get 
           wheeled past on a gurney, his cock oozing pus and groaning in 
           pain.
