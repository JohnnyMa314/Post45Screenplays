                                    Richard Price
           EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE — TWILIGHT

           The bad old days; dope, guns, affordable housing.

           Five young anti-crime cops cruising in an unmarked van.  
           These five are FRANK BRUNO, the brothers EDDIE AND TITO 
           RIVERA, DENNIS KLINE, ERIC KOWALSKI.  Street soldiers, tight 
           friends.

           FRANK’S POV — YOUNG LATINA HOOKER (NORMA)

           making eye contact.

                                 FRANK
                             (to Kline)
                        Denny, go around...

           Van turns the corner; Norma follows.  She leans in the 
           window.

                                 NORMA
                             (distinctly scarred)
                        See those two Jhericurl dudes 
                        standing by the corner store?  They 
                        both heeled, got the pieces in the 
                        back over they ass.

                                 FRANK
                        Thank you, Mami.  You doing OK out 
                        here?

                                 NORMA
                        Doing what I got to be doing.

                                 FRANK
                        Be careful alright?  Still got my 
                        card?

                                 NORMA
                        I got everybody’s card.
                             (flirting)
                        You still got mine?

           EXT. 7TH PRECINCT STATION - 30 MINUTES LATER

           The five of them escorting two Jhericurled gun collars into 
           the house.

                                 KLINE
                        Anybody for the Plug?

                                 EDDIE
                        You gonna behave this time?
                                 KLINE
                        If you’re buyin’.

           INT. PLUG UGLIES BAR — BRONX - 2 HOURS LATER

           The five drinking, everybody horsing around except for Dennis 
           Kline; a mean drunk; stony, glaring at A GROUP OF ALBANIAN 
           BANGERS.  One of them picks up on the look.

                                 ALBANIAN
                        Fuck’s you problem?

           That’s all it takes; Dennis launching himself across the bar 
           at the guy, Frank, the Rivera brothers and Kowalski 
           immediately defusing; used to this with him.

           EXT. — PLUG UGLIES — LATER

           The five cops exit.  The Albanians are on the sidewalk; a 
           momentary staredown.  Frank and Co. hustle Kline away before 
           he can start again.

                                 KLINE
                        I’m good, I’m good.

           His friends relax, walk a few steps then Kline wheels and 
           charges the Albanians before anyone can stop him.

           But they’re ready, and they all start kicking his ass.  And 
           his friends have no choice now but to wade in and it becomes 
           a free for all.

           Everybody is loaded and things get out of hand; vicious; the 
           cops mainly pounding the crap out of the others; Kowalski and 
           Tito Rivera especially going bughouse; kicks, rabbit punches, 
           Kowalski pulling a lead sap.

           In a short moment all the Albanians are down, Tito stomping 
           someone unconscious until his brother Eddie pulls him off. 
           The only cop down is Dennis Kline, the drunkest.

                                 FRANK
                             (hauls Kline to his feet)
                        Give me your goddamn keys, you 
                        idiot.

           They all pile into Kline’s car, Frank driving off.

           ALBANIANS’ POV - SIDEWALK LEVEL

           The retreating car; license plate seen through dimming eyes.
                                       PRESENT TIME

           EXT. DARKENED OFFICE BUILDING - BRONX — 10:00 PM

           In silhouette, two men, DANNY and BIG BOY, enter from the 
           street.

           INT. DESERTED HALLWAY INSIDE

           Elevator groans open. And here they come: Danny (wiry, antsy, 
           30) and Big Boy (a bear, 35), both in jeans and leather 
           jackets, walk towards a glass door decaled with the NYPD 
           CRIME SCENE UNIT logo, underneath which someone has 
           handwritten: WE SEE DEAD PEOPLE.

           INT. CSU OFFICE

           A sea of mainly empty desks — a few detectives on phones as 
           Danny and Big Boy cross to

           A SIDE ROOM

           where a near-elderly detective, LUMPKE, stands hunched over a 
           draftsman’s table.  The walls are hung with schematic 
           diagrams of murder scene apartments and crime scene photos.  
           Lumpke nods to them; nervous.

                                 DANNY
                        You got it?

           Lumpke reaches for a package hidden beneath a pile of in situ 
           murder snaps on a table.  Big Boy slips the package under his 
           jacket and they start to leave.

                                 LUMPKE
                        Hey...

           They stop, turn, Danny slips Lumpke a roll of cash

           EXT. MUSIC CLUB/LOUNGE, “CHINAMAN’S CHANCE” ON HOUSTON STREET 
           (L.E.S.) — 11:00 PM

           A line stretching 2 blocks.  Everyone in their 20’s.

           At the door are two mammoths; AFRICAN FREDDIE, (fatigue 
           jacket, dreads), and WHITE BERNARD, (shaved head, leather 
           jacket). They’re taking 20 bucks a head, stamping hands, a 
           few ghetto hugs for familiar faces.

           Behind them in the window is a sign:

                    THE MOPES
                    2NIGHT ONLY
           EXT. A SMALL BAR - “DOS PALMAS” ON DELANCEY STREET — SAME

           Only 3 blocks away. Its funkier, clientele mostly locals, 
           Danny and Big Boy carrying the package.

           INT. DOS PALMAS

           Danny and Big Boy walking through the dark front bar, a few 
           kisses for the girly-girls, for Norma, (now 42), and CINTA, 
           40, both working behind the stick.

           They head to “PRIVATE PARTY” sign, enter a back room with 
           twenty half-hammered cops; liquor and cold cuts.

           Frank Bruno, (early 40’s now, an Lt.) intercepts them.

                                 FRANK
                        You get it?

           Big Boy hands the package to Frank who unwraps just enough of 
           it; grins..

                                 FRANK
                        Oh slap my ass and call me Mary.

           Frank turns, keys in on Eddie Benitez (40’s now).

                                 FRANK
                        He’s gonna freak...

           EXT. CITY OF INDUSTRY, BKLYN — SAME

           Dead mini-city of mostly abandoned factories between NY Bay 
           and the Gowanus Parkway.  No sign of life.

           CLOSE ON GARAGE DOOR

           INT. GARAGE - CLOSE ON A WORK TABLE

           laid out like a still life of promised mayhem; handguns, a 
           shotgun, latex gloves, gaffers tape, packs of hosiery.

           We see tattooed hands slipping on gloves, ripping up the 
           hosiery, ditching cigarettes, wrapping the stock of the sawed 
           off with gaffers tape.

           All movements are brisk and practiced.

           INT. DOS PALMAS - 12:00 AM

           80’s music piped in. Cops are loud, a little sloppy.

                                 DANNY
                             (a little bombed)
                        Ey, yo!  Turn the music.  C’mon.  
                        Let me... Eddie!
           He raises his glass to Eddie, sitting on a couch with Frank, 
           the two elder statesmen in here.

                                 DANNY
                        Eddie, Eddie.. You're.. How can you 
                        hang it up man... How,
                             (teary)
                        what about me.  You ever think 
                        about me? Who’s gonna break my 
                        balls now whenever I fuck up..

                                 ALL
                        I will!  Me!  Danny right here!

                                 DANNY
                        I’m trying to, to say something 
                        here..

           ON Eddie and Frank, laughing.

                                 DANNY
                        Eddie, ever since I was a white 
                        shield and you took me under your 
                        wing..

           A chorus of bird chirps.

                                 DANNY
                        Eddie, I never had a father...

                                 MILANO
                             (30, mohawked 
                              weightlifter)
                        Danny, you want one of mine?  I had 
                        three.

           This time the laughter is too much and Danny sulks off.  But 
           Eddie intercepts him, gives him a hug, everybody cheering.

           Frank gets his hands on the package again.

                                 FRANK
                        Here you go, Pops..From us to you

           Eddie unwraps it and we finally see that it’s a framed 
           montage of headlines from over the last twenty four years; 
           every big arrest Eddie has ever been part of, bordered by his 
           academy photo from 1984, and a shot of him being promoted to 
           Detective First Grade in 2006.

                                 EDDIE
                             (choked up)
                        C’mon, crank the freakin’ music, 
                        it’s like a funeral in here.

           Some homegirls wander in from the front bar.  They jam on.
           EXT. GARAGE, CITY OF INDUSTRY — 1:00 AM

           Riot gate rolls up and THE MEN, wearing identical hoodies, 
           faces in shadow, exit, two carrying duffle bags. They pile 
           into a BLUE VAN.

           INT. CHINAMAN’S CHANCE — 1:30 AM

           A zoo — jam-packed.  Money and booze flying back and forth in 
           a rainbow arc across the six deep bar.

           Bartenders periodically clean out the four tills, stash cash 
           in bank bags beneath the bar

           The line from outside runs right through this madhouse and up 
           the stairs to the performance space.

           INT. DOS PALMAS — 2:00 AM

           Eddie and Frank taking a break at the front room bar.  Norma 
           and Cinta still working the stick.

                                 FRANK
                        Campus cop.

                                 EDDIE
                        You always say that, ya prick.  
                        It’s assistant to the head of 
                        investigations for New York 
                        University.  65 g’s on top of my 
                        tax-free 60 a year from this, and 
                        free tuition for my kids of which I 
                        got three.  At 50 g’s a year that’s 
                        a 150 thousand dollar free ride.  
                        Per year.  Are you kidding me?

                                 FRANK
                             (winking at Norma)
                        Campus cop.

           EXT. GOWANUS PARKWAY - 2:00 AM

           That BLUE VAN heading west into the city.  We see the night 
           lights of Manhattan

           INT. UPSTAIRS PERFORMANCE LOFT — CHINAMAN’S CHANCE - SAME

           Mobbed.  THE MOPES playing something anarcho-sensitive with a 
           side of rueful irony.

           EXT. DOS PALMAS — 3:00 AM

           The party has staggered out onto Delancey where Danny and Big 
           Boy are having a race up the fire escape ladders that extend 
           from the street to the roof.
           Danny still on the sidewalk, is watching Big Boy ponderously 
           lumber half way up the four story building.

                                 DANNY
                        Ready?

                                 BIG BOY
                        I’m ready, I’m ready.

                                 WOMAN
                             (sticking her head out 
                              third floor window)
                        Hey asshole get off my goddamn 
                        building!

           Danny leaps to the lowest rung and starts to effortlessly 
           clamber up the rungs just using his hands as the cops on the 
           3:00 AM sidewalk cheer and Big Boy struggles upwards.

                                 WOMAN
                        I’m serious!  I’ll call the goddamn 
                        cops, yah morons!

                                 BIG BOY
                             (winded, on eye level)
                        Lady, you gotta be shittin’ me.

           Everybody on the street is howling, now.

                                 FRANK
                             (laughing, but the boss)
                        Alright, fellas.

           EXT/INT. BLUE VAN — SAME

           Rolling down Delancey, slows to a crawl in order to take in 
           all the bombed cops on the street and on the fire escapes.

           The hooded men look at each other for a beat.

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE CHINAMAN’S CHANCE - 4:00 AM

           House Manager and White Bernard transferring a mountain of 
           cash from the show into a duffle bag.

           INT. MAIN ROOM OF CHINAMAN’S - SAME

           Only fifteen or so people left; half passed out drinkers and 
           some staff.  African Freddie sees someone out, locks the 
           front door.

           INT. DOS PALMAS - 4:15 AM

           Everyone back inside as CURTIS, a young black detective, 
           serenades Eddie with an old Irish ballad of farewell.
                                 CURTIS
                        I wish I had you in Carrickfergus, 
                        only for nights in Ballygrand, I 
                        would swim over the deepest ocean, 
                        the deepest ocean to be by your 
                        side .... But I'll sing no more 
                        now, till I get a drink ..... I'm 
                        drunk today and I'm seldom sober, a 
                        handsome rover from town to town...

           CLOSE ON — EDDIE

                                 CURTIS (OS)
                        but I am sick now and my days are 
                        numbered, come all ye young men and 
                        lay me down ...

           Rapt with Curtis’s high sweet voice, the room remains utterly 
           silent, broken by...

           INT. CHINAMAN’S - 4:15 AM

           BOOM.  African Freddie blown backwards by the sawed off right 
           through the glass door, the sound of the shot partly muffled 
           by loud piped-in music.

           The men in hoodies and hosiery-smeared faces charge in and 
           BOOM there goes the surveillance camera; remaining drinkers 
           and staff screaming, scrambling.

                                 HOODIE 1
                        GET FLAT!  STARFISH DOWN!

           Most people understand and drop face down, spreading their 
           arms and legs wide — except for one panicked girl who goes 
           down and sobbing, starts waggling her extremities as if she’s 
           making a snow angel.  Hoodie 1 steps on her back.  She 
           screams.

                                 HOODIE1
                        Starfish, you dumb bitch!

           Hoodie 2 vaults the bar starts rifling the cash registers, 
           then turns to the remaining bartender

                                 HOODIE 2
                        Where’s the overflow

                                 BARTENDER
                        The what?

           He gets pistol whipped for the hesitation; once, twice, 
           thrice; savage; then staggers to get the overflow bags.
                                 HOODIE 3
                             (pulling up a waitress by 
                              her hair)
                        Where’s the gate.

                                 WAITRESS
                        The what?

           At which point White Bernard comes upstairs from the office 
           with the duffle bag of cash from the show.

           The music had drowned out the gunshots so he’s momentarily 
           stunned by the tableau but quickly gets it and does the right 
           thing, lowering the duffle to the floor then backing away.

           Hoodie 3 steps up, hoists the duffle and starts to turn to 
           the door, when...

                                 BERNARD
                        Just don’t hurt anybody.

           This freezes Hoodie 3, turns him around.

                                 HOODIE 3
                        What?

           He puts down the cash-stuffed duffle and walks back to 
           Bernard.

           Pull back to see Hoodie 3 is very short compared to Bernard; 
           literally has to look up at him; a little man’s rage building 
           here.

                                 BERNARD
                        You got it all bro’.  Just go.
                             (then he notices dead 
                              African Freddie)
                        Aw, Freddie...

           These are Bernard’s last words as Hoodie 3, under the hard 
           rock beat, attacks him with his bare hands, chewing him up in 
           a viciously expert manner, dropping him to the floor then 
           stomping him into oblivion, the others in the crew tensely 
           watching.

           And then —like that — they’re gone, leaving the survivors 
           face down and whimpering under the driving music.

           EXT. DOS PALMAS — SAME

           The cops, wasted, half-dead, finally exiting into the first 
           hint of dawn.  After a last embrace with Eddie, most stagger 
           off to their cars, leaving the hard-core squad: Frank, Eddie, 
           Big Boy, Danny, Curtis, MILANO, IRMA and BANNERMAN.
                                 EDDIE
                        I’m telling you, put in your papers 
                        and come in with me.  We’re talking 
                        a four year free ride for that kid 
                        of yours.  And no offence but 
                        you’re gettin’ a little too long in 
                        the tooth to keep rolling in the 
                        dirt with the bad guys.  In fact 
                        it’s embarrassing.

                                 FRANK
                        C’mon, I’ll take you home.

                                 EDDIE
                        I’ll take you home.

           The not-too distant sound of sirens, Frank’s cell goes off, 
           then Eddie’s, then some of the others

                                 FRANK
                             (into phone)
                        Yeah...
                             (sobering)
                        Yeah.

           FRANK’S POV - HALF HIS SQUAD ON THEIR CELLS,

           getting the oh-shit news from the dispatcher.

           FRANK’S POV - HE CAN SEE THE REVOLVING MISERY LIGHTS

           of patrol cars bouncing off the upper floors of the tenements 
           nearest Chinaman’s Chance only a few blocks away.

                                 FRANK
                        Be right there.  Get Night Watch to 
                        send over some bodies.

           Hanging up, he quick-scans the faces of his squad, in various 
           states of inebriation, everybody struggling to strap their 
           game heads on.  Keys in on Bobby Bannerman, so hammered he 
           can’t even stand up straight.

                                 FRANK
                        Bobby, why don’t you go back to the 
                        house and start the victimology. 
                        Well call in the info as we get it

           Bannerman nods and steps into the street, nearly getting 
           mowed down by a cab, the squad wincing.

                                 FRANK
                        Anybody need to work with Bobby?
                                 CURTIS
                             (a little shaky)
                        We’re good, Lieu.

           ON Frank — hopes so.

           EXT. CHINAMAN’S CHANCE — 4:45 AM

           Ambulance just leaving - siren screaming.  A few patrol cars, 
           a few uniforms, crime scene tape roping off shattered front 
           door, more tape rigged to corral a dozen drunk and freaked 
           witnesses, penning them in on the sidewalk next to the club, 
           a uniform wading through notepad in hand, taking down info.

           Frank steps to JIMMY LEVINE, the harried looking Patrol 
           Sergeant.

                                 FRANK
                             (shaking hands)
                        Jimmy, what you got.

                                 LEVINE
                        Looks like a robbery went south, 
                        one bouncer dead, the other took to 
                        Cabrini, three four perps maybe 
                        five, stocking masks, gloves, 
                        hoodies, came in blasting, got 
                        everybody on the floor had a big 
                        concert here or whatever, got the 
                        take from that, cleaned out the 
                        registers...

           Nodding to Frank, Eddie quietly heads inside the bar.

                                 FRANK
                        What kind of artillery?

                                 LEVINE
                        Shotgun by the hole in the guy

                                 FRANK
                             (re: roped off witnesses)
                        What’s with the corral?

                                 LEVINE
                        Shits off the rails tonight. I got 
                        2 cars 4 guys, ninety traumatized 
                        drunks, I’m trying to preserve the 
                        scene, keep the wits from wandering 
                        off..

                                 FRANK
                        I hear you.  The vic went to 
                        Cabrini, what’s his name?
                                 LEVINE
                        Bernard something, I’m not sure we 
                        even got it, I’m telling you, 
                        Frank...

                                 FRANK
                        No problem, no problem.

           He turns to Danny and Curtis, assessing their sobriety.

                                 FRANK
                        Head over to Cabrini, stay with 
                        this Bernard guy, try not to 
                        breathe on him.

           The young uniform that was with the roped off witnesses comes 
           over

                                 UNIFORM
                             (to Levine)
                        Sarge, somebody should go inside 
                        pull the blinds, guys laying right 
                        in the window, the girls are 
                        getting hysterical.

           ANGLE — THE WINDOW

           Eddie inside, pulling down the blinds.

                                 FRANK
                        So what are they saying?

                                 UNIFORM
                        I don’t know, everybody’s fucked up 
                        drunk crying puking talking rifles 
                        bazookas shotguns, spears, I’m not 
                        even asking, just taking down 
                        vitals before they Houdini.

                                 MALE PATRON
                             (behind the rope)
                        Other than the shotgun, which was a 
                        sawed off, I saw a Ruger and a 
                        Glock, didn’t catch the others.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh yeah?  Know your guns?

                                 PATRON
                        Yes, sir.  Two tours’ worth and a 
                        boyhood.

                                 UNIFORM
                        I was gonna say, this guy here’s 
                        pretty sharp.
           At which point the gun expert just passes out drunk.  More 
           patrol cars pull up.

                                 FRANK
                             (to Levine)
                        Get some of these incoming to ferry 
                        the wits to the house,
                             (to Irma and Big Boy)
                        You and you go back and start 
                        banging them out.
                             (to Levine, re: parked 
                              cars)
                        I need all these plates taken down.

           Eddie comes to the shattered door, beckons to Frank.

                                 FRANK
                             (shaking Levine’s hand)
                        Sarge, you did great.

           As Frank walks past the penned in witnesses just now starting 
           to be escorted to the patrol cars he overhears:

                                 GIRL
                             (sobbing)
                        Make like a starfish, how do you 
                        make like a starfish?  I didn’t 
                        understand!  I didn’t understand!

           INT. CHINAMAN’S CHANCE

           African Freddie in his own blood, EMT detritus.

                                 EDDIE
                        Shell casing in the doorway.

                                 FRANK
                             (re: shot up camera)
                        We should get TARU down here, maybe 
                        some film made it into the digital 
                        bank

                        Knock knock.

           Frank and Eddie look up to see Dennis Kline, (early 40’s) Now 
           a Lt. in the Manhattan Robbery Squad.  Subdued, wary and 
           cautiously ironic- for the moment.

                                 EDDIE
                             (loudly)
                        The fuck’s he doing here?

                                 FRANK
                             (to Eddie)
                        Wait for me outside.
           As Eddie leaves he doesn’t look at Kline directly but he 
           comes within a hair of shoulder-knocking him back.  Kline is 
           aware of this animosity but bears it.

                                 KLINE
                             (mock-cordial)

                        What are you doing here, Dennis?

                                 KLINE
                        I saw all the lights.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll ask again.

                                 KLINE
                        I’m working a pattern. I got two 
                        robberies in pocket this could make 
                        three.

                                 FRANK
                        No kidding.

                                 KLINE
                        No kidding.

                        So Eddie’s putting in his papers, I 
                        hear.

                        Maybe she’s old enough to be in the 
                        house on her own.

                        So.  What do you think?

                        I’m sure she’d go for it but no.  
                        I’ll call my sister.

                        would you feel about going to NYU, 
                        if I can get you all four years on

           We see African Freddie walk to the door, wave someone off 
           i.e., we’re closed, then watch the door explode inwards and 
           Freddie literally fly backwards, landing in a pool of blood.

           The HOODIES burst in, one takes aim at the camera then SCREEN 
           GOES BLANK.

           African Freddie coming into view.  The blast of the shotgun, 
           reverse angle, the hoodies charging in.

           Then speeded up nothing.

           Then they’re leaving with the cash bags from the bar and the 
           duffle bags.  Walking quickly but not running until they’re

                        We got only viejo stumblebums come 
                        in here.

                                 MAQUETUMBA
                        Is perfect.

                                 NORMA
                        Well then like I told you and these 
                        other cabrons three times already. 
                        No.

                                 MAQUETUMBA
                        Mami, this time I’m not asking.

                                 NORMA
                        You was a piece of shit when you 
                        was little and you’re a piece of 
                        shit now.

                        You and your maricon drogeros.  Get 
                        the fuck out my place.

           Maquetumba sits up looking a little taken aback by the 
           hostility, then simply grabs her by the hair and bangs her 
           face into the bar, once twice three times.

                                 MAQUETUMBA
                        I’m trying to be a gentleman you 
                        old whore!

                                 NORMA
                             (slumped up on the 
                              duckboards)
                        Yeah, you would know. It was me and 
                        your mother out there 24/7 back 
                        then.

           Maquetumba smashes his beer glass then vaults the bar to work 
           on what remains of her face as Nestor and Popeye casually 
           start to break the place up.

           INT. FRANK’S BEDROOM - 7:00 AM

           Frank sleeping, his daughter Lola poking him with the phone.  
           Frank rousing, sees his daughter staring at him stares back a 
           staring contest until she grins.

                                 LOLA
                        Uncle Eddie...

                                 FRANK
                             (on phone)
                        What’s up.

                                 EDDIE
                        Mancini wants a meet at 9.  7th 
                        Squad and Robbery.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s not good.

                                 EDDIE
                        Nope.  And Bernard White?  The 
                        other bouncer?  Just got a call.  
                        He went out of the picture an hour 
                        ago.

           INT. POLICE PLAZA CONFERENCE ROOM — DAY

           Chief Mancini at the head of the table.  He drops a copy of 
           THE DAILY NEWS on the table.

                                 MANCINI
                        “POSSIBLE UPTOWN CONNECTION TO 
                        LOWER EAST SIDE SLAUGHTER.”
           He drops a NY POST on the table.

                                 MANCINI
                        “MYSTERY CREW KILLS TWO IN DOWNTOWN 
                        ROB/SLAY.”

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL a big oval table  Frank and the 7th Squad 
           to the left.  Kline and Manhattan Robbery to the right.

                                 MANCINI
                        One.  The media game ends now.  
                        Next time I read or see something 
                        about this case that didn't come 
                        out of my office, I'm gonna source 
                        it down and I'm gonna take scalps.

           Frank and Kline avoid Mancini’s eyes.

                                 MANCINI
                        Two.  7th Squad and Robbery are 
                        gonna marry up.  This is now a task 
                        force.  There's more than enough 
                        evidence to suggest a pattern here.  
                        Venues, time of night, guns, masks, 
                        violence.
                             (beat)
                        We can't wait around to be wrong on 
                        this.

           Kline meets Frank's eyes; i.e.: one for me.

                                 MANCINI
                        Three.  The 7th has the homicides 
                        and the manpower.  You're gonna 
                        base out there, Robbery will bring 
                        everything they've got and 7th 
                        Squad will welcome them with open 
                        arms.
                             (beat)
                        Any questions?
                             (nothing)
                        Get to work.

           Twenty people on the move.  Frank glaring at Kline as they 
           stand.

                                 MANCINI
                        Frank.  You got a minute?

           Kline lingering.  Clocking Frank and Mancini as they head 
           back toward the office.  Not liking this at all.

           INT. MANCINI’S OFFICE

           Frank takes a seat.  Mancini closes the door.
                                 MANCINI
                        You going to give me any shit about 
                        working with Kline get it out of 
                        your system now.

                                 FRANK
                        Feeling the heat?

                                 MANCINI
                        This whole building’s a sauna

                                 FRANK
                        We’ll do what we have to do

                                 MANCINI
                        No.
                             (beat)
                        I want something more.
                             (Frank waits)
                        The kid who died this morning?  
                        Bernard White?  He was the son of 
                        my first partner in patrol back in 
                        ’81, Teddy White, died himself a 
                        few years back.  When Teddy was in 
                        the hospital I told him I’d always 
                        look out for his family and now his 
                        kid’s dead.  On my watch.  So.  I  
                        want these animals caught, but I 
                        don’t want them coming to trial.
                             (Frank simply absorbs 
                              this)
                        You’re the only one I can say this 
                        to.  And here’s the deal.  You take 
                        care of this for me.  You take care 
                        of this... I know you have no 
                        interest in going up the ladder but 
                        the next open Captain’s slot is 
                        right in your backyard, Zone 
                        Commander for the First Division.  
                        I’m not talking about slapping on 
                        the chevrons and getting stuck 
                        behind a desk in Queens, you’ll 
                        still be working with all your 
                        people but have some real power for 
                        a change.  A nice kick in your 
                        pension too.

                                 FRANK
                        John, you ask me for something like 
                        this well see how it plays out.

                                 MANCINI
                        You saw what they did.  You know 
                        damn well how its gonna play out.

                        Plus I’m thinking you’re gonna want 
                        this because the guy they have 
                        lined up for the job right now is 
                        Dennis Kline.  He’s got more juice 
                        in this building than Con Ed but 
                        you do me right on this I’ll have 
                        just enough muscle to swing it your 
                        way.
                             (beat)
                        Somehow I can’t see you reporting 
                        directly to Kline the rest of your 
                        days.

                                 FRANK
                        My age, those days are numbered.

                                 MANCINI
                        How would you feel about hanging it 
                        up and leaving all your people in 
                        Kline’s hands?  You worked to make 
                        a good squad there in the 7th, he 
                        takes the reins no way is he going 
                        to let guys loyal to you stay put.  
                        He’ll scatter them to the winds.

           ON Frank - this hits him.

                                 MANCINI
                        You do this for me and Division 
                        Captain is yours.  You don’t, it’ll 
                        go to Kline and I won’t lift a 
                        finger to stop it.

           Frank rises, heads to the door

                                 MANCINI
                             (pained)
                        Frank.  I’m the one that got 
                        Teddy’s kid that job.

           INT. FRANK LEAVING MANCINI’S OFFICE

           Eddie standing there, grim-faced, holding out his cell.

                                 FRANK
                        Who is it?

           Eddie won't say.  Handing him the phone, as we

           INT. WARD WAITING AREA - DAY

           Frank, with Eddie in tow, coming down the hall, sees:

                        Paco...

           INT. WARD ROOM - DAY

           A dozen curtained-off beds.  Frank and Eddie getting the 
           debrief from:

                                 DETECTIVE ROENIG
                        We'll go back tonight, ask around, 
                        but if she's not gonna talk...
                             (resigned)
                        It never happened.

                                 FRANK
                        Let me see what I can do.

           INT. NORMA'S BEDSIDE - DAY

           Norma.  Slashed.  Swollen. Drugged up.  But not so high she 
           can't see Frank standing beside her, and not so damaged she 
           won't try to wave him away.

                                 FRANK
                        Who did this?
                             (takes her hand)
                        You think I'm gonna let this go?

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Frank huddled up with Cinta.

                                 FRANK
                        It's not gonna take care of itself.

                                 CINTA
                        She made me promise.
                             (trapped)
                        She said if I tell you it's gonna 
                        go on and on.  You know how she 
                        is...

                                 FRANK
                        I'll make it stop.  Whatever it is, 
                        Cinta, I promise it stops.

                                 CINTA
                        Paco, she’s got Christo’s gun.  
                        This cabron comes back...

                                 FRANK
                        Just give me his name and I promise 
                        it ends.
           FRANK’S POV — CHRISTO,

           Norma’s middle-aged ex-gangbanger boyfriend is marching down 
           the corridor towards them, wild-eyed with rage and distress.

                                 FRANK
                        Give me his name and you won’t have 
                        to worry about giving it to him

           INT. 7th SQUAD — HOUR LATER

           Task force coming together fast.  It's a shotgun marriage and 
           there's no time for a honeymoon.  The local team dominates 
           numerically.  Danny, Big Boy, Milano, Eddie, Curtis, Irma, 
           Bannerman - spread around the room, working phones, etc.  
           Their counterparts from Robbery - Eve, WHALEN, PINK, DOBLER, 
           HUMBLE - pitching in amidst unfamiliar surroundings.

                        for a month.  Marquis Willis, the

                        wikipidia of crime that you said 
                        you got on a leash.  So where is 
                        he?

                                 WHALEN
                        I called him a dozen times, he 
                        never got back to me.

                                 KLINE
                        I’m sorry... You're waiting for him 
                        to return your call?

           Frank, returning from the hospital with Eddie enters the room 
           catches 7th Squad eyes.  Silent communion; Robbery Squad 
           oblivious except for Kline.

           EXT. UPTOWN DANCE CLUB — NIGHT

           Maquetumba walking a dark corridor.  He's alone.  Fucking 
           with his phone as he steps past kegs and glass racks.  
           Distracted, as he pushes through a fire door and into
           THE SERVICE ALLEY

           Two steps out.  He stops.  What the fuck?  A BROWN VAN 
           hogging the alley.  But look quick, because the SIDE DOOR IS 
           FLYING OPEN and - Behind him - TWO GUYS IN HOODS -

                                 MAQUETUMBA
                        What the fu-

           CHUNK - CHUNK - two baseball bats into his back and he's down 
           and they're already bum-rushing him into the van, as the 
           doors close and engine revs and... they're gone.

           EXT. STATE PARK TRAIL — NIGHT

           THE BROWN VAN off-roading through thick woods.

           INT. MOVING BROWN VAN

           Eddie driving.  Frank riding shotgun.  Danny, Milano and Big 
           Boy in back.  The only person wearing a hood now is 
           Maquetumba.  In fact, that's all he's wearing - handcuffed 
           and naked on the cold, bouncing floor.  He's also the only 
           one talking -

                                 MAQUETUMBA
                        You motherfuckers! - you hear me?  
                        You got any idea who you're playing 
                        with?  Whoever the fuck you are, 
                        you better straighten this shit out 
                        right now or I swear on my mother's 
                        eyes, I will fuck you up if it's 
                        the last thing -

           Big Boy kicks him hard in the gut and -

           EXT. STATE PARK TRAIL -

           THE VAN stops.  Doors fly open.  Danny and Big Boy dragging 
           Maquetumba, naked and hooded, through the woods.  Frank and 
           Eddie behind them.

                                 MAQUETUMBA
                        WHAT DO YOU WANT?  WHO ARE YOU?  
                        TELL ME WHO YOU ARE OR -

           Until suddenly they stop — because -

           RIGHT THERE - AN OPEN GRAVE

           Ten feet deep and raw.  Danny and Big Boy forcing Maquetumba 
           to his knees at the edge.  A huge tattoo inked across his 
           back: A crowned gothic-styled “M”.

           Frank and Eddie behind him.  Frank pulling a pistol, checking 
           the clip, making sure Maquetumba hears it.
                                 MAQUETUMBA
                        Shit, man, please, whoever you are, 
                        please, man, don't kill me!  
                        Please, just tell me what you 
                        want...

           Danny rips the hood from Maquetumba’s head, grabbing a 
           handful of hair at the same time, forcing him to stare down 
           into the grave as Frank puts the gun barrel to his ear.

                                 MAQUETUMBA
                        Oh, God... Jesus, please... I don't 
                        want to die... please...

           When suddenly — BOOOOMMMM.

           Frank - the gun - Maquetumba lurching forward - this gasping 
           sound - falling - handcuffed - down onto his face in the dead 
           leaves and dirt below...

           But not shot.  They punked him.  Frank tucking the pistol 
           away.

                                 FRANK
                        You ever go near Norma Almonte 
                        again and I swear, I'll stuff you 
                        with your mother's head.

           THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAVE

           Maquetumba in spasming shock.  Fetal curl.  Listening to 
           footsteps disappear into the woods.

           INT. THE MOVING BROWN VAN — NIGHT

           Mission accomplished.  Vibe loose.  Danny in back going 
           through Maquetumba’s coat pockets.

                                 DANNY
                        Holy shit.  Look at this... 
                        [Maquetumba's flash roll]

                                 FRANK
                        How much?

                                 DANNY
                        Gotta be five, six grand.

           Sounds like a party, Boss.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, for Norma.  Pass it up.

           Danny hands it forward; digging back into Maquetumba's coat.
                                 DANNY
                        Okay, this I'm keeping...

           A gorgeous, pearl-handled switchblade.  Unique to begin with; 
           then there's the ebony engraving - that same crowned gothic-
           styled “M” that was tattooed on Maquetumba’s back.

           Danny flipping it open and closed.  THE BLADE glinting in the 
           sun, as THE VAN speeds along the highway.

           Old, beat-up, cramped but neat; house-proud.  Frank and

                        in the papers.

                        I don’t read papers.  Street’s my

                        You go somewheres else with a 
                        question like that.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m just saying.

                        She’s the best thing that ever 
                        happened to me.  And someone hurts

           A woman, SHI, 30, pulling her coat on as she leaves her 
           apartment.

           It's a small building.  Drab and dark, but quiet.  Nothing 
           going on as Shi makes her way down the murky stairs, so 
           focused on not tripping, she's surprised to see:

           all huddled up there waiting.  Flak jackets and guns.

                        hamper, I think.

           They pass her back and back.

                                 SHI (CONTD)
                        Can’t you like, come back, do this 
                        later?

           Frank and Eddie sharing a look.

                                 SHI (CONTD)
                        Shit, now he’s gonna think it was 
                        me.

           INT. DRAYTON APARTMENT - SAME

           We're looking at THE DOOR, hearing the sound of A VIDEO GAME 
           in the BG.  And then - CRASH - THERE GOES THE DOOR - Curtis - 
           Milano - Danny -  guns drawn - flooding in.

                                 CURTIS
                        POLICE! - FREEZE! - NYPD!

           REVERSE TO SEE JAYCEE DRAYTON

           sitting at a wobbly TV table.  A huge man, hands in mid-air, 
           caught literally in the midst of cutting down a two-ounce bag 
           of cocaine.  A felony tableau.

           THE BOY is eight.  He's staring at the cops that have just 
           materialized in his living room as if they're just another 
           chapter in the video game playing out behind him on the TV.
                                 MILANO
                        Jaycee Drayton?

                                 DRAYTON
                        She do this?

                                 CURTIS
                        Put your hands up, sir.

                                 DRAYTON
                             (calling past him)
                        YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS, SHI?

           Eddie moving to the boy.  Frank circling back by the window.

                                 CURTIS
                        Just put your hands up, Jaycee.

                                 DRAYTON
                        THIS MEANS I'M GONE FOR GOOD, 
                        BITCH!
                             (standing now and raising 
                              his hands)
                        THIS A GUARANTEED FIFTEEN YEARS, 
                        SHI!  THAT'S MANDATORY!  THAT'S THE 
                        FUCKING BASELINE, SHI!  THAT'S IT 
                        FOR ME!

                                 FRANK
                        You know the drill, Jaycee.  We can 
                        cuff you hard or easy.

           Drayton turns.  Like he didn't realize Frank was back there.  
           Like suddenly all the air just went out of him.

                                 DRAYTON
                        Can I hug my son?

                                 MILANO
                        We'll make time for that later.

                                 DRAYTON
                        There's no later for me, bro.

                                 FRANK
                        I say yes, we got no problems, 
                        right?

                                 DRAYTON
                        No, sir.

           Frank nods.  Drayton moving slowly to THE BOY, taking him in 
           his arms.
                                 FRANK
                        Get a drug unit up here.  This has 
                        nothing to do with us.

           SUDDENLY DRAYTON IN MOTION

           Explosive - no time to react — SLAMMING INTO FRANK - 
           linebacker hard - lifting him off his feet - total forward 
           motion, but there's nowhere to go except - THE WINDOW...

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME (CONTD)

           CRASH - glass splintering — this DRAYTON/FRANK cannonball 
           blasting out of A SECOND FLOOR WINDOW - falling and... THUD.

           Frank coughs.  Opens his eyes.  He's alive.  Drayton's body 
           beneath him like a mattress.  But Drayton's not moving.  
           Frank - horrified - rolling away - looking back up to the 
           window - TO SEE:

                                 THE BOY
                        staring down.

           EXT. SIDEWALK — 45 MIN. LATER

           Loitering cops.  An ambulance.  Nothing but aftermath.

           INT. BAR ACROSS FROM THE DRAYTON APARTMENT — SAME

           Frank, Eddie and Danny are recuperating.

                                 EDDIE
                        I swear to God, Frank, I saw you go 
                        out.

           Kline, quietly seething, walks in.

                                 EDDIE
                        Ah Christ...

                        See, most cops, most decent cops.  
                        Anybody done what Denny here did 
                        would’ve quit the job the same day.  
                        But no.  Not Denny.  No, Denny, he 
                        spends the next twenty years ass-
                        kissing his way up the ladder.  One 
                        kiss at a time.
                                 FRANK

                        what he done the bosses are the 
                        only ones who’ll have anything to 
                        do with him.  So what else is there 
                        but to be a boss yourself.  The 
                        higher up you go the less you see 
                        of the real cops below.

                                 EDDIE
                        You know when it’ll be OK to stop 
                        climbing, Denny?  When everyone who 
                        knows about you on this job is

           Before Eddie can go for him Danny and Frank have him 
           restrained, Danny hustling him out into the night.

           Kline, despite his fury, hasn’t moved a muscle.  Frank 
           settles in front of his drink.

                        That’s a little paranoid, don’t you 
                        think? Even for you.

           Frank’s cell rings.  He steps out of earshot.

           Tito Rivera and Eric Kowalski being escorted out of the

           EXT. IN THE SHADOW OF SHEA STADIUM - 20 MIN. LATER

           Deserted, save for Frank’s car.

           INT. CAR - FRANK AND CASTRO

                                 FRANK
                        So where is he?

                                 CASTRO
                        Guys always late.  Like clockwork.  
                        He’ll be here soon.  I wouldn’t 
                        drag you out for nothing.

                                 FRANK
                             (settling in)
                        I saw your brother the other night.  
                        I think he’s using again.  He gave 
                        me a hug, it was like grabbing a 
                        bundle of sticks.

                                 CASTRO
                        Jesus, I’ll straighten him out.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah?  Who’s gonna straighten you 
                        out?

                                 CASTRO
                        You know, I know everybody says 
                        this, but this last bid I‘m doing?

                                 FRANK
                        You were railroaded.

                                 CASTRO
                        No.  I’m not saying totally, but I 
                        was a lamb.  A sacrificial lamb. 
                        Give us Barabbas, and the guy did.   
                        Served me up like a tv fuckin' 
                        dinner.  I am just finishing up 
                        three years of someone else’s time, 
                        time I can’t get back.

                                 FRANK
                        You and Gino... What did your old 
                        man ever do to deserve kids like 
                        you two?

                                 CASTRO
                        Hey.  It wasn’t so easy in that 
                        house.

                                 FRANK
                        Poor you.
           ANOTHER CAR PULLS UP BEHIND OF THEM

                                 CASTRO
                             (suddenly hyper)
                        Nah, I’m just sayin’...

                                 FRANK
                        That’s him?

                                 CASTRO
                        What?  Yeah.

                                 FRANK
                        So?

                                 CASTRO
                        Yeah, OK...

           Castro exits the car.

           Frank, bushed, slides down a little, watches via the rear 
           view mirror through heavy lidded eyes.

           FRANK’S POV - REAR VIEW MIRROR — CASTRO

           walks up, leans into the driver’s window, steps back produces 
           a hand cannon and BLASTS OF LIGHT, one, two,

           then shifting angles,

           TWO MORE BLASTS INTO THE BACK SEAT

           Frank half rises out of the car, fumbling for his own gun, 
           but before he can get himself together Castro is first GONE, 
           then, RIGHT BEHIND FRANK, his gun to his head.

                                 FRANK
                        THE FUCK YOU DO!

                                 CASTRO
                             (taking Frank’s piece, 
                              tossing it)
                        JUST GET IN THE CAR! GET IN THE 
                        CAR!

                                 FRANK
                             (has no choice)
                        You little motherfucker.

                                 CASTRO
                             (sliding in)
                        DRIVE!

           Frank peels out.
           INT. FRANK’S CAR- DRIVING FAST AND BLIND

           Castro still has his gun to Frank’s head.  Frank is coldly 
           livid; silent.

                                 CASTRO
                        ...Three years I did for that rat 
                        bastard cono motherfucker!  Three 
                        years he’s out here eatin’ and 
                        ballin’ and partyin’ and getting 
                        high ‘cause I’m in the stinking 
                        joint... Every night dealin’ with 
                        another...
                             (Frank's silence freaking 
                              him out)
                        Are you listening to me?  I know I 
                        abused you here but I got a deal 
                        for you, okay?  I got a deal where 
                        everybody gets to win -
                             (never finishing because)
                        Frank just locked up the brakes as 
                        he slammed HIS FIST INTO CASTRO'S 
                        FACE and

           EXT. THE CAR

           SKIDDING TO A STOP - DOOR FLYING OPEN — Frank and Castro 
           wrestling for the gun.

           Frank gets his hands on it but Castro kicks him in the ribs, 
           already bruised from his earlier flyer out the window, Frank 
           gasping in pain.  Castro stepping back with the gun as Frank 
           struggles to his feet.

                                 FRANK
                        YOU STUPID FUCK! - YOU GOT A DEAL 
                        FOR ME? — EVERYBODY’S GONNA WIN?

                                 CASTRO
                        Wait!  Frank!  Wait!

                                 FRANK
                        WHAT DO I WIN, HUH?

                                 CASTRO
                        STOP!  You gotta - I got what you 
                        want - I know who you're looking 
                        for!  The hitters from the club - 
                        I'm the guy who knows!
                             (please)
                        I swear, Frank.  I will make this 
                        right.

                                 FRANK
                        Are you outta your mind?
                                 CASTRO
                        You cover me, I cover you.  You 
                        want these names, I need an alibi.
                             (freaked but determined)
                        But you try and take me in for this 
                        — tomorrow, the next day, whenever, 
                        I got nothing to lose.  I'm gonna 
                        give you up, say you knew what was 
                        going down the whole time tonight 
                        ‘cause you wanted those guys so 
                        bad.  Please.  Don’t make me do 
                        that.  But!  You let me walk, I’ll 
                        give you them on a platter.  Is 
                        good for everybody.

           Frank is speechless.

                                 CASTRO
                        Please.
                             (starts backing away)
                        You're like my second father to me.
                             (into the shadows)
                        Please.

           And he’s gone.

           In shock, Frank just stands there breathing, wide-eyed.  Then 
           coming out of it, he slides back in the car, grabs his cell.

           CLOSE ON — DIALING 91...

           Frank can’t bring himself to dial 911.

           Frank pulling out.

           EXT. DEATH CAR STREET - 5 MIN. LATER

           Frank rolling by.  Scans telephone and power poles for 
           surveillance cameras.  Nothing.  Frank hobbles out to 
           retrieve his tossed gun.  Takes off again.

           EXT. STREET CORNER PAYPHONE

           Frank dialing.

                                 OPERATOR
                        What’s your emergency.

           Frank hangs up.

           INT/EXT. FRANK IN CAR - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE

           Frank dials.

                                 EDDIE (OS)
                        Hello.
                                 FRANK
                        Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                        Frank, what’s up?
                             (Frank can’t talk)
                        Frank, you there?

           Frank hangs up. Sits glassy for a beat.  Then flips, tearing 
           and pounding anything he can get his hands on.

           EXT. DEATH CAR STREET - SAME

           Just the death car with its bullet shattered windows; nothing 
           stirring.

           A rear door kicks open. No one exiting for a beat.

           Then a young flashily-dressed woman, sobbing, crawls out on 
           her hands and knees.  Rising on shaky pins, she runs away.  
           She seems to be limping, but she’s just hoofing it, wearing 
           one high-heeled shoe.

           INT. DEATH CAR

           Two dead, one in back, one in front; young street players 
           staring off unblinking through blood-masked eyes.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM ROBBERY SQUAD - SAME

           Marquis Willis sits hunched in a chair, worried.  Pink, 
           Whalen and Eve, leaning against the walls.

           Kline strolls in a circle around Marquis, who twists and 
           twists to keep his bug eyes on Kline.

           Kline produces an arrest warrant which he holds over Marquis’ 
           head as he continues to circle.

                                 KLINE
                        Here’s how it’s been working.  You 
                        jerk him [Whalen] off with your 
                        bullshit nowhere tips, buy yourself 
                        more time on the street, he jerks 
                        me off for the overtime, maybe buy 
                        that new sander he’s been wanting 
                        at Home Depot and IM THE HORSE'S 
                        ASS GETS STUCK WITH THE TAB.

           KLINE drops the unexecuted warrant into Marquis’ lap, as his 
           squad stares.

                                 KLINE (CONTD)

                        And so are you...

           EXT. FRANK’S HOUSE — MIDNIGHT

           Frank exiting his car; bracing.

           INT. FRANK’S HOUSE — KITCHEN

           Frank sitting there, glass of scotch; fucked.

           Dana, in a bathrobe, comes in behind him, slides her hands 
           inside his shirt, down his chest.  Stops.

                                 DANA
                        What’s wrong.

                                 FRANK
                             (turning)
                        Rough day.

                                 DANA
                             (re: his face)
                        Jesus, Frank...

           Dana moves her hands to Frank’s shoulders, his back, and he 
           flinches.  Startled, she gently takes off his shirt.  Traces 
           the bruising, the abrasions.

                                 DANA (CONTD)
                        Let me get something.

                                 FRANK
                        Wait...

           Frank struggles with wanting to tell her about the jam he’s 
           in; can’t.

                                 DANA
                        What happened.

                                 FRANK
                        No.

           Dana doesn’t press, he’s been a police as long as they’ve 
           known each other.  Still, she at least wants to patch him up.  
           But Frank just won’t let go of her.
           She gives up fighting him.  Misreading his physical vibe as 
           just some post-close call sexual ardency, she takes his hand 
           and slides it inside her bathrobe; lightly covers it as he 
           gently roams beneath the cotton, his face on her breast.

           INT. BATHROOM, SHOWER GOING

           Frank holding her under the stream as they have slow standing 
           sex; no need to race through it.  They have all the time in 
           the world.  Or do they.

           ON Frank — his chin over her shoulder, haunted.

           INT. SOME BEDROOM — SAME

           Kline is fucking like he’s on train tracks and the Dixie 
           Special is barreling down the line.  Ardent; a rutting bull; 
           the woman beneath him holding on for the ride.  He comes and 
           collapses as if punctured.  He rolls off the lucky lady.

           It’s Eve Samuels.

           Kline sits on the edge of the bed staring off; whatever had 
           been chasing him is still there in his eyes.  He gets up and 
           gets dressed; Eve watching him, her own expression 
           unreadable.  She’s used to his post-coital silence.

                                 KLINE
                             (leaving)
                        See you tomorrow.

           The door closes.  Eve reaches for a cigarette.

           INT. FRANK’S BEDROOM — 7:00 AM

           On his back, face in the pillow.  Lola comes in. Climbs up, 
           studies him.  She stands on the mattress, lifts a foot.

           ON Lola, expressionless, and there she goes, first one foot 
           then the other, tottering on his back like she’s in a log-
           rolling contest.

                        Couldn’t you just say that?

                                 LOLA
                        I like this way.

                              her)
                        Do you now...

           She's squealing and laughing pretending to try and get away.  
           Frank is in momentary heaven.

           Lola finally rolls away, grabs the bedroom remote to find her 
           shows.

           THE SCREEN

           Channels passing quickly: Cartoons, NY 1 News shot of the 
           death car in Queens, cartoons, gameshows, cart...

           Frank grabs the remote flips back to the death car.

                        So we pick up this kid Castro, 
                        seems he went away on the testimony 
                        of the body in the front seat.  
                        This Raoul Targer.
                                 FRANK
                        Nello.  I know the kid since he was 
                        little, a real piece of work, been 
                        my CI on and off for years.

                                 BILLY
                        Well, that’s what we need to 
                        square.  Castro says he was with 
                        you last night?

                        Setting up a meet with a snitch?

                                 FRANK
                        He claimed he had somebody with a 
                        name for me on that club murder 
                        were working.  The guy never 
                        showed.  Two hours of my life I’ll 
                        never get back.

                                 SISK
                        Where were you two waiting?

                             (careful now)
                        Where?  Where’d he say?

           Sisk doesn’t answer, just stares at him.

                                 BILLY
                        He claims City Island.

                                 FRANK
                             (whew)
                        Can you believe he had me drive all 
                        the way up there for nothing?

           Sisk continues to stare.

                                 FRANK (CONTD)
                        So what’s happening with your 
                        thing, got any other leads?

                                 BILLY
                        The vics were animals, no shortage 
                        of possibles, but for the moment 
                        it’s a whodunit.

                                 FRANK
                        I hear you.
                                 BILLY
                        Only good news is we think there’s 
                        a witness out there.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah?

                        his johnson.  Got a high-heeled 
                        shoe and an earring back there too.  
                        I’m thinking some pross was down 
                        low when the fireworks went off, 
                        snuck away after the shooter

                                 CASTRO (OS)
                        Yeah, right.  But I’m a man of my 
                        word.  Got a pen?  The dudes you 
                        looking for?  I know two.  Plus I

                        We’re pretty much done with the 
                        Chinaman’s staff, got six

                        coke collar but no one’s jumping 
                        out at us.

           Instead of responding, Frank’s checking the stalls.  Making 
           sure they're the only ones in here, before -

                        Go for a sandwich.  Head over to 
                        the 66.  I want you to run a couple 
                        names. There's a phone number too.  
                        See if you can hustle up the cell 
                        sites.  Start with the day of the 
                        robbery.

           on, Kline looks insane.

                        lift weights together... deal some 
                        X together.  We think they ripped 
                        off and killed their connection 
                        together.  Flemmi, when they went 
                        to talk to him about it, he didn't 
                        like the way he was being spoken to 
                        and had a little steroid meltdown 
                        which resulted in a nineteen-month 
                        incarceration at Downstate...

                                 IRMA
                        Hodes made a friend inside - 
                        Phillip Higgins.  Mr. Higgins has 
                        lot of paperwork with his name on 
                        it.  Armed robbery, Ag assault, 
                        Manslaughter - he's sort of Mr. 
                        Flemmi's guidance counselor up 
                        there.

                                 FRANK
                        How did you get to him?

           Irma waves Danny the floor.

                                 DANNY
                        The phone number you gave us?  It 
                        belongs to Mr.  Flemmi's sister.  
                        We picked up two cell sites at the 
                        scene last Wednesday morning.

                                 FRANK
                        Alright, that’s three.  Anybody 
                        else?

                                 EDDIE
                        I guess we’ll find out soon enough.

           They all take a moment, contemplating what’s to come

           EXT. 7th PRECINCT - NIGHT

           Kline's phone ringing as he hits the street.

           Eve at the kitchen table.  Her husband sitting across from 
           her, wolfing down his supper.
                                 EVE
                        I'm sitting here with Mark.

                        Okay...

                        He just got home and he's telling 
                        me Frank Bruno's name came up today 
                        on that double in Queens.

                                 KLINE (PHONE)
                        Came up how?

                                 EVE
                        As an alibi.

           EXT. QUEENS PRECINCT — MORNING

           Estab. shot.

           INT. SQUAD ROOM — SAME

           Kline is sitting with DETECTIVE SAMUELS, Eve’s husband.

                                 KLINE
                        I don’t understand, it’s your catch 
                        but you didn’t go?

                                 SAMUELS
                        I had a shitload of paperwork plus 
                        our boss wanted to go. You know, a 
                        lieu to talk to a lieu.

                                 KLINE
                        And Lieutenant Bruno said he was 
                        with this guy, what’s his name?

                                 SISK (OS)
                        Castro... Nello Castro...

           Kline turns, gives Sisk the onceover.

                                 KLINE
                        And where’d he say the two of them 
                        were last night?

                                 SISK
                        He didn’t.

                                 SAMUELS
                        I thought you said he said City 
                        Island.

                                 SISK
                        That’s what he was told.
           Once again Kline gives Sisk the onceover.

                                 KLINE
                             (to Sisk)
                        So how are you doing tracking down 
                        your pross eye-wit?

                                 SISK
                        Talk to him.

                                 SAMUELS
                        Were backed up the yin yang here.  
                        Besides, those two?  We’re talking 
                        misdemeanor homicides.

           Kline nods, clocking the expression of disgust on Sisk’s 
           face.

                                 SAMUELS (CONTD)
                        Hey, by the way, my wife says she 
                        loves working under you.

                                 KLINE
                        No kidding.
                             (fighting down a guffaw)
                        I enjoy having her under me.
                             (cell goes off)
                        Excuse me.  Yeah...

           Kline’s face drains.

           INT. TASK FORCE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Kline rushing us in, and then stopping cold.  We see it as he 
           does - it's another shabby space, but prepped for a meeting: 
           banquet tables, easels against the wall, maps and diagrams 
           taped up for display.

           Frank alone here.  Seated at the table.  Waiting for Kline to 
           absorb the materials.

           PICTURES - blow-ups of the mug shots on the table - tell us 
           all we need to know - Hodes, Flemmi, Higgins and a new face, 
           we'll call Beckley.

                                 FRANK
                        We got a location for them out in 
                        Brooklyn, got eyes on it as we 
                        speak.
                             (beat)
                        I'm telling everyone we couldn't've 
                        done it without you.
                                 KLINE
                        Fuck you.
                             (getting a grip)
                        When does Mancini get here?

                                 FRANK
                        About an hour.
                             (standing now)
                        Thought you might want to get up to 
                        speed.

           Frank walks.  Kline standing there.  Fighting the panic.

           INT. TASK FORCE CONFERENCE ROOM - 1 HOUR

           Mancini addressing the combined 7th Squad and Robbery teams.

                        443 37th Street, always separately, 
                        between the hours of 9am and 
                        noon...

           KEY IN ON that garage mid-block, silent, gate down as we 
           hear:

                        Given their pedigrees and the 
                        likelihood of resistance, 
                        tomorrow’s game plan is simple.

           on loading dock across the street, sipping a beer and eating 
           a sandwich, dressed like a forklift operator on break.

                        Wait until they’re all inside, then 
                        pick them off one by one as they 
                        leave.  Throw an interview into the 
                        first guy we grab and hopefully 
                        we’ll get some intel on exactly who 
                        and how many are behind that

           The BLUE VAN is cut off in a squealing pincers, 7th Squad 
           flying out of three cars with drawn guns.

           Milano flying backwards.
           Big Boy, Curtis, Bannerman, Irma bellowing and firing into 
           the car.

           And then it’s over — calm to chaos to aftermath in 5 seconds.

           Some ambiguous stirring in there, maybe, or some sharp noise -

                        That motherfucker... I knew it.

           Eddie looks beseechingly at Frank like a chained pitbull — 
           EVERYBODY reduced to dog states.

                                 FRANK
                             (to Eddie)
                        OK.  GO, GO!

           Eddie tears off in his car to stop the assault on the garage.

           Kline, gun drawn - his ear to the garage door, then gestures 
           for the RAM.

           GARAGE DOOR — THE RAM

           BLAM — NOTHING.  BLAM — NOTHING.  Then,
           BLAM - BREAKTHROUGH

           As soon as the door is down, from the shadows there comes 
           automatic fire; two shooters in there lying in wait.

           Pink goes down, everyone else takes cover, then with Kline 
           leading the way, return fire; a withering fusillade that 
           overkills one shooter and sends the second diving into A 
           SECOND VAN inside the garage.

           THE SHOOTER floors it directly at Kline who sidesteps like a 
           matador.  And along with the rest of Robbery forms a gauntlet 
           of fire as this second van barrels through.

           KLINE’S POV — THE VAN,

           past them now, rolls a few hundred feet — then gently comes 
           to a stop.

           As Robbery Squad attends to PINK, KLINE stands there 
           retroactively terrorized, victorious.

           Then Eddie comes flying at him from the sidelines; livid, 
           swinging two-fisted.

                                 EDDIE
                        HOLD YOUR FUCKING POSITION!

           Eddie and Kline start trading blows.  Frank comes running out 
           of his car to break it up.  Eve, tending to the injured Pink, 
           sees:

           EVE’S POV — THE DARK MAW OF THE NOW-DOORLESS GARAGE

                        SHOOTER!

           And fires; others firing; the fifth man returning fire; more 
           chaos... Smoke clears.

           Dana and Eddie’s wife JEAN and THREE SONS.  Tears flowing 
           freely.  Danny pacing mindlessly; his grief souring into

           as the threat lands - he just keeps walking as he pretends it 
           means nothing.

           EXT. STATEN ISLAND FUNERAL PARADE - DAY

           MONTAGE SHOTS:

           BOOTS MARCHING ON ASPHALT - FIFTY UNIFORMED OFFICERS getting 
           off AN NYPD BUS — LOCAL RESIDENTS lining the sidewalk.

           A RIDERLESS HORSE, skittish on the pavement - BAGPIPERS 
           MARCHING, instruments held quietly at their side, still 
           nothing but THE DRUM.

           STOIC COP FACES - A LINE OF BLACK CARS rolling slowly.

           THE DRUMS - A BLUR OF MARCHING UNIFORMS.

           THE CHURCH STEPS - a mass of dress blues, standing at ease, 
           waiting for the cortege to arrive.

           THE CHURCH STEPS - Frank, Danny, Big Boy, Irma, Bannerman, 
           Milano, Curtis.

           And directly behind them, the Robbery Squad.

           That drumbeat GETTING CLOSER and...

           THE Mayor and Commissioner Coyle getting out of a limo, just 
           in time - the DRUMS ONLY A BLOCK AWAY.
           CHURCH STEPS — Kline arriving late, moving for his spot with 
           the Robbery Squad when...

           Danny sees him coming - stiffens - and then turns his back. 
           And then Big Boy turns away... then Milano... now Irma... 
           until THE ENTIRE 7TH SQUAD has turned its back on Kline as he 
           takes his position, and...

           The CAMERA FINDS the Mayor and Police Commissioner standing 
           with Mancini and seeing this.

                                 P.C.
                        What the hell's going on here?

           Mancini staring daggers at Frank, as the DRUMS PEAK and...

           The ABOUT-FACED 7th Squad is now nose to nose, eyes into eyes 
           with the FRONT FACING Robbery Squad; every face rigid; 
           unreadable.

                                 MASTER AT ARMS
                        ATTENNN-HUTTT!!!

           TWO HUNDRED COPS straightening instantly as the BAGPIPES  
           BEGIN THEIR DIRGE and the CORTEGE rolls in and...

           KLINE’S POV — DOWN THE STAIRS

           Eddie’s wife, kids, and brother Tito emerging from a black 
           sedan.

           Then walking up the church steps, TITO (who was ratted out by 
           Kline in 1985) glaring murderously as he passes Kline.

           Kline staring stoically ahead.  Head high.  Mortified but 
           unyielding.

           INT. IAB INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           A small, cold room.  LT. NEELE is 40, a tightly wound guy in 
           the right job.  His #2, SGT. MARCY, running the tape 
           recorder.  Dennis Kline across the table with his DBA 
           ATTORNEY.

                                 NEELE
                        ...this interview will be logged as 
                        Internal Affairs Bureau 
                        investigation number 6217-07.  Lt. 
                        Kline is represented here today by 
                        DBA attorney, Mr. Eric Gordon...

                                                              TIME CUT:

           THE IAB INTERVIEW ROOM

           Everything the same, except:
                                 FRANK
                        We had a game plan in place.  Lt. 
                        Kline knew that game plan.  No one 
                        was ever supposed to take that door 
                        because these guys were too 
                        violent.
                           How could any experienced 
                        detective go into a factory where 
                        we had every reason to believe that 
                        an unknown number of people were 
                        armed right after a police involved 
                        shooting 6 blocks away.
                           After that incident I intended 
                        to call ESU and have them take over 
                        the operation but all efforts to 
                        contact Detective Kline went 
                        nowhere because  he shut off his 
                        radio.

           TO -

                                 KLINE
                        I instructed my people to turn off 
                        their radios because I didn’t want 
                        to be standing in front of that  
                        door and suddenly hearing chatter.
                           Things seemed totally out of 
                        control in the street.  Lt. Bruno 
                        took off to handle that and I was 
                        concerned because I heard Detective 
                        Benitez say earlier that he thought 
                        the two in the car were raised up 
                        and I didn’t know if at that point 
                        they had communicated a warning to 
                        the two...
                             (swallow)
                        the three perps still in the 
                        factory.  I then heard what I 
                        believed to be a shot in there, and 
                        I felt I had no choice but to enter 
                        that location because I feared 
                        someone’s life could be in danger.

           TO -

                                 FRANK
                        I wanted that place secured and 
                        held.  They weren’t going anywhere 
                        and we had all the time in the 
                        world to be as safe as we needed to 
                        be.

                                 FRANK (CONTD)
                           In my opinion Detective Kline 
                        had every intention to go in there 
                        despite anyone’s game plan, he knew 
                        exactly what was going to happen if 
                        he tried to take that door, he did 
                        it anyhow and as a result a highly 
                        decorated veteran of the force, 
                        Detective First Grade Edward 
                        Benitez... is dead.

           ON Kline.

           INT. 7th SQUAD LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           Frank cleaning out Eddie's locker.  Looking up,

                                 MANCINI
                        Need a hand?

                                 FRANK
                        Look.

           Shows Mancini a framed photo of Eddie and his family, his 
           wife, those three young boys, Eddie’s explosive smile...

                                 MANCINI
                        Breaks your heart.

                                 FRANK
                        Uh-huh [say your piece].  So...

                                 MANCINI
                        You gotta lay back on Kline.  
                        That's the word from upstairs.  We 
                        dropped the bad guys.

                                 FRANK
                        Except for the one that did Eddie.

                                 MANCINI
                        Nets closing in.  That's the story 
                        they want to tell.

                                 FRANK
                        And Eddie?

                                 MANCINI
                        He's a hero.

                                 FRANK
                        So fuck him twice, right?

                                 MANCINI
                        I'm the messenger, Frank.
                             (flat out)

                        Pull down Kline, you're going with 
                        him.

                                 FRANK
                        What.  You're still talking about 
                        Division Captain?

                                 MANCINI
                        They'll go another way.

                                 FRANK
                        With Kline out of the picture who 
                        gives a shit.

                                 MANCINI
                             (beat)
                        None of this is gonna bring Eddie 
                        back.

                                 FRANK
                        I want Kline's badge.

           Mancini nods.  He tried.

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

           Kline huddled with Lt. Neele.  Utterly off-the-record; they'd 
           both get crushed for this.

                                 NEELE
                             (incredulous)
                        It’s a dead cop Tommy, it’s too 
                        big...

                                 KLINE
                        Don't tell me that.

                                 NEELE
                        What're you talking about?  You 
                        think we could ignore you, if this 
                        was going the other way?

                                 KLINE
                        You owe me, Pete.  I want it now.

                                 NEELE
                        The fact I'm here is a favor.
                             (not about to be bullied)
                        I've got no civilian complaints and 
                        four dead scumbags that don't need 
                        to go to trial.  I could issue a 
                        report next week and put this thing 
                        to bed for good.  What I can't do, 
                        is push back a well respected 
                        lieutenant who lost a man.

                        Frank Bruno to shut up.

                                 KLINE
                        He's killing me, isn't he?

                                 NEELE
                        He's sure trying.

           Dinner table.  Frank, Dana, and Lola.  All three of them 
           going through the motions.  Frank’s cell rings.

                        Sorry to disturb you, but I got a

           INT. QUEENS DANCE CLUB - NIGHT

           LOUD, crazy and crowded.  JOELLE at the edge of the dance 
           floor, trying to negotiate with A POTENTIAL CUSTOMER over the 
           music, when - OUT OF NOWHERE

           Kline - like a falcon - SNATCH! - already has her arm - 
           already hustling for the door - Joelle's struggling uselessly 
           under the techno beat.

           INT. THE UNMARKED TAURUS - NIGHT

           Sisk up front.  Kline in the back with

                                 JOELLE
                        The other cop.

           Kline hesitates.  Bingo.  Victory.  Self-disgust.  Back in 
           the cop-fucking business.

                              rummaging)
                        This where you live?

                                 JOELLE

                        problems?  Give him a call.  But if 
                        he reaches out for you and you’re 
                        not there?  The problem’s gonna be 
                        yours, do you understand?

           Joelle still terrorized nods like a bobble-head doll.

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE TAURUS - NIGHT

           Sisk not quite sure what's going on.

                        Property Room.

           EXT. THREE-STORY MOTEL BY JFK - NIGHT

           Façade — Three levels of external doors and balconies 
           connected by crisscrossing stairs.

           Stillness; then we see ESU cops silently clamber up those 
           cross-hatched stairs like Busby Berkeley dancers with 
           automatic weapons.

           EXT. THIRD FLOOR DOOR

           COP, backed by that silent army, threading a fiber-optic 
           camera under the door.

           CLOSE ON — GRAINY VIDEO

           NUDE WOMAN smoking on bed, watching TV.  NUDE TATTOOED MAN 
           emerging from bathroom.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM

           The nude man; it’s the short psycho that beat the bouncer to 
           death in the Chinaman’s robbery.  He laughs at something on 
           the TV.

           The DOOR EXPLODES INWARDS — A FLOOD OF COPS.

           Screaming, the woman tumbles off the bed.  The Psycho however 
           is another story.
           BALLS UP NAKED, he starts FIGHTING his way through those 
           heavily armed police; bug-eyed, TRAINED, crazy-fearless; 
           four/five ESU COPS going down before he’s finally stopped by 
           the preponderance of guns; then just stands there snarling; 
           still thinking about it...

           Frank, impassive, armed with an assault rifle, slowly emerges 
           from the crowd to stand toe to toe with the guy who killed 
           Eddie.

           They eyeball each other for a beat, the psycho looking like 
           he wants to tear out Frank’s throat with his teeth.  THEN..

           Frank abruptly SMASHES him in the face with the butt of the 
           rifle.

           EXT. 7TH PRECINCT - 30 MIN. LATER

           The psycho, cuffed, bloody-mouthed, wearing only a filthy 
           pair of sweatpants, is being hustled into the station.

           He passes Frank on his way in, grins wolfishly at him through 
           blood-rimmed teeth as Frank’s cell rings.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah.

           INT. BAR — SAME

           He hangs up.

           INT. BAR

           Dennis looks like he’s contemplating Frank’s suggestion.  
           Then hardening, he dials Sisk.

           Morning drop-off.  Frank’s car parked in the scrum.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Frank at the wheel.  Lola unbuckling.

                                 FRANK
                        You got everything?

                                 LOLA

                                 LOLA
                        Yah.

           He's waiting.  She smiles, relents.  A kiss on the cheek and 
           there she goes.  Frank just about to pull away, when he 
           stops...

           HIS WINDSHIELD POV — MANCINI

           stepping off the curb.  TWO SENIOR DETECTIVES right behind 
           him - guys Frank knows.

                                 FRANK
                        What happened?

                                 MANCINI
                        We gotta talk.

                                 FRANK
                        About what?
                                 MANCINI
                        There's a place about ten blocks 
                        up.
                             (one of the guys)
                        Bunky's gonna ride with you.
                             (the tough part)
                        You gotta give me your phone.

           That takes a moment to digest.

                                 FRANK
                        And my gun?

                                 MANCINI
                        Just till we get there.

           Frank knows.  Knows it all.  Knows it's bad.  Knows there's 
           no good in arguing.

           FRANK’S POV — SISK,

           the arresting officer of record, standing against a second 
           sedan, staring back at him in that unblinking way of his, 
           then, as if having second thoughts about taking this Kline-
           like road to the top, looking away.

           INT. EMPTY GARAGE - DAY

           Couple chairs.  Frank in one of them.  Mancini and another  
           guy, CAPT. ZUNIS across from him.  Half-a-dozen senior NYPD 
           FACES and Sisk at the fringes.

                                 MANCINI
                        We need to talk about that night. 
                        You want to tell me your side of 
                        it?

           FRANK, knowing it’s too late now, knowing, as any cop does, 
           that saying nothing is better than saying anything, shakes 
           his head.

                                 ZUNIS
                        For crissake, Frank, let's get the 
                        details and put this thing to rest.

           Still nothing.

                                 MANCINI
                        We're trying to get a handle here. 
                        Once this gets official...

                                 FRANK
                             (as close as he can to 
                              pleading his case)
                        Chief, you be me right now.
                                 MANCINI
                        I can’t imagine being you right 
                        now.  Where’s Nello Castro.  Do you 
                        know?

           Frank shakes his head.  Could mean “No, I don’t,” or “I’m 
           done talking.”

                                 ZUNIS
                        Frank.  We can't help you after 
                        this.

                                 FRANK
                        I want a lawyer.

           INT. MOVING UNMARKED CAR - DAY

           Frank in the backseat with Capt. Zunis.  Sisk driving.  Some 
           other CAPTAIN up front.  No joy in this for anyone.  Vibe 
           tightening as they near the Queens courthouse.

           INT. VARIOUS SHOTS/BOOKING AREA QUEEN'S COURTHOUSE - DAY

           A line-up.  Frank one of ten guys in chairs facing a one-way 
           window, as we begin to hear:

                                 A.D.A. BARNES (OS)
                        ...I'm A.D.A. Barnes, this is Lt. 
                        Neele from Internal Affairs.

           Frank getting fingerprinted as...

                                 A.D.A. BARNES (OS)
                        ...You need to know that you've 
                        been positively identified as the 
                        driver of a vehicle used in the 
                        commission of a First Degree 
                        Murder...

           Frank getting a mugshot as...

                                 A.D.A. BARNES (OS)
                        ...the Murder One charge will 
                        include special circumstances, as 
                        we believe the homicide was carried 
                        out for the purpose of retribution 
                        for prior testimony...

           Dt. Sisk leading Frank (still uncuffed) through the booking 
           area - COPS silent as they pass - no one really sure how to 
           react, as...
                                 A.D.A. BARNES
                        Nello Castro is also being charged 
                        with Murder One, there's a warrant 
                        out for his arrest, and an active 
                        investigation as to his 
                        whereabouts.

           INT. BROOKLYN HOSPITAL - DAY

           Dana at work.  She's just been called to the nurses’ station - 
           A phone call.

                                 DANA (PHONE)
                        Hello?
                             (listening a moment)
                        Where are you?
                             (beat)
                        For what?
                             (jumping in)
                        - Wait, Frank, slow down -
                             (impatient now)
                        I am - I just -
                             (longer beat)
                        I don't understand...

           THE CAMERA PULLS BACK - Just watch her stand there and try to 
           make sense of what we know he's trying to tell her.

           INT. QUEENS COURTHOUSE - DAY

           COURT OFFICERS keeping the crowd of REPORTERS and 
           PHOTOGRAPHERS cordoned back.  The normal retail clients of 
           this building - junkies, dealers, and car thieves - are all 
           slouched around the room, waiting their turn as

           THE CAMERA FINDS DANA

           on an empty bench near the front.  She's in shock.  Mancini, 
           ZUNIS and several other cops doing their best to shield her 
           from the room.

           AT THE BENCH

           JUDGE FREEMAN presiding.  Frank listening to his attorney, 
           MR. OTT argue it out with A.D.A. BARNES.

                                 A.D.A. BARNES
                        ...it's a Capital Case, Your Honor.  
                        Mr. Bruno's accomplice, we believe, 
                        has already taken flight.

                                 MR. OTT
                        Lieutenant Bruno...
                                 A.D.A. BARNES
                        The defendant, Your Honor, is 
                        charged with being both chauffeur 
                        and alibi in a Capital Murder Case.  
                        Until The State has apprehended and 
                        charged Mr. Castro, we think the 
                        defendant needs to remain in 
                        custody.

           Frank meeting Dana's gaze.

                                 MR. OTT
                        Frank Bruno's put over twenty-five 
                        years of his life on the line for 
                        the people of this City.  He's been 
                        a tireless public servant, a credit 
                        to the department, and pillar of 
                        this community.  The State's demand 
                        for custody is absurd -

                                 JUDGE FREEMAN
                        I'm afraid, Mr. Ott, I couldn't 
                        have said it any better.  The 
                        defendant's been a beneficiary of 
                        the public trust all these years, 
                        and there's strong evidence that 
                        our faith was misplaced.  I'm 
                        denying bail and setting a court 
                        date on October seven...
                             (gavel down and)
                        Shock around the room.  Audibly.  
                        Frank just staggered...

                                 MR. OTT
                        Hang in.  Just hang in, Frank.  
                        We'll work it out.

           Frank turning back and

           There's Dana, completely confused - Mancini crouched beside 
           her, trying to explain it before she starts crying.

           EXT. BAR — NIGHT

           Kline hammered, alone at the short end of the bar, watching 
           news coverage of Frank’s arrest on the wall-mounted TV.

           SAME TV FOOTAGE

           Playing in a darkened motel room, the shifting silvery 
           castings of the screen illuminating the foot of a bed 
           littered with take-out debris, moving up to prone legs, tin-
           foil vials, a scorched glass pipe.
                                 NELLO CASTRO
                        at the headboard.  Stark staring at 
                        the TV.

           A RADIO flares from some other room and Castro jumps - GUN IN 
           HAND - a freak spasm of speed-fueled, fugitive paranoia.  
           Standing there in his underwear, heart pounding, trying to 
           push that crazy shit down.

           INT. RIKER'S ISLAND INTAKE UNIT - NIGHT

           Gateway to hell.  Frank with A NEW BUNCH OF PRISONERS, all of 
           them waiting to be processed,

           EXT. FRONT OF KLINE’S QUEENS HOME - NIGHT

           Kline, drunk in the shadows of the front yard, as if screwing 
           up the courage to enter his own home.

           INT. RIKER'S ISLAND PROTECTIVE UNIT - NIGHT

           Frank in a jumpsuit.  Waiting with TWO CORRECTIONS OFFICERS 
           for A SERIES OF STEEL CAGE DOORS to swing open and reveal a 
           narrow, airless cell block.

           INT. KLINE’S KITCHEN — NIGHT

           Kline at the dining table, smoking.  His wife, Lori stands 
           against the counter staring at him; hasn’t seen him drunk in 
           years.

                                 LORI
                        Dennis, were you involved with this 
                        Frank Bruno business?

           With the careful gestures of a drunk too drunk to know how 
           obviously drunk he appears:

                                 KLINE
                        No.

                                 LORI
                        Then why... Look at you...

                                 KLINE
                        I’m nowhere on that.

                                 LORI
                        Try again.

                                 KLINE
                             (surrenders)
                        It’s gone too far.  I just 
                        wanted...
                                 LORI
                        What.  You wanted what.

           Kline struggles to his feet, goes to a cabinet; and pulls out 
           a bottle.

                                 KLINE
                        I’ll stop tomorrow.  I did it once, 
                        I can do it again.

                                 LORI
                        You know, Dennis, you’re always in 
                        such pain...

           He turns to her, the wifely tenderness of her voice.

                                 LORI (CONTD)
                        But after twenty years?  It’s all 
                        so goddamn uninteresting.

           She walks out of the room.

           INT. RIKER’S ISOLATION CELL - NIGHT

           A six-by-nine, cinderblock tomb.  Frank perched on the 
           sleeping slab.  Sitting there, trying not to lose his mind.  
           Trying and failing, as the LIGHTS go out.

           INT. DANA AND FRANK’S BEDROOM — 3:00 AM

           The trill of the phone slicing through the murk.

                             (torn from sleep, Lola in 
                              bed with her)
                        Hello... Hello...
                             (crackling)
                        Who is this.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM — SAME

           Nello Castro on his bed; glassy-eyed, his cell phone upright 
           and open in his slack palm.

                                 DANA (OS)
                             (coming through tinny)
                        Hello!  Goddamnit!

           INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE IAB HEARING ROOM -DAY

           Kline is standing there with Mancini, IAB investigators 
           filing past them into the hearing room.  Big day.

                                 MANCINI
                        You want it from the horse’s mouth?
                             (Kline impassive)
                                 (MORE)

                        They’re gonna clear you today.
                             (silent relief)
                        Without Frank to raise a stink...
                             (Mancini shrugs)
                        But you know what I think of you, 
                        don’t you?

                                 KLINE
                             (inured to slings and 
                              arrows)
                        So, this thing I’m lined up for... 
                        You're going to fight it?

                                 MANCINI
                        Me?
                             (disgusted)
                        With what’s happening around here 
                        these days?  Sometimes this 
                        department gets the bosses it 
                        deserves.

           Mancini walks.

           INT. RIKER'S ISLAND VISITORS UNIT - DAY

           Frank across the table from Mr. Ott and Dana.  A CORRECTIONS 
           OFFICER by the door.

                                 OTT
                        The problem isn't people wanting to 
                        believe - we're not gonna have any 
                        trouble with that.  Will it cost 
                        you your badge?  Yes.  And the 
                        financials?  The pension?  That we 
                        can argue about.  
                             (beat)
                        Earlier, you could've possibly 
                        gotten out of this just by telling 
                        what you knew.  But now that you're 
                        in the system, we've passed the 
                        point of no return and it's all 
                        predicated on having Mr. Castro 
                        with us to confirm the story.

                                 FRANK
                        I was screwed either way.  And what 
                        cop with more than two minutes on 
                        this job would ever open his mouth 
                        in a situation like that.  For 
                        Christ's sake, I brought the lead 
                        in the next day!  Where else do 
                        they think it came from?  Why else 
                        would I do this?
                                 MR. OTT
                        You're not listening, Frank.  
                        There's no desire to go after you 
                        for this, but without Castro on the 
                        record there's a limit how far they 
                        can go.

                                 FRANK
                        What's the offer?

                                 MR. OTT
                        Without Castro, Manslaughter One.  
                        It's five to ten, you'd do three 
                        and change.

                                 DANA
                        You mean years?

           Confirmation in the silence.

                                 FRANK
                        Guess somebody damn well better 
                        find Castro.

                                 MR. OTT
                        The offer's not going anywhere.

           Dana fighting tears now.

                                 FRANK
                             (to Ott, re: the guard)
                        Can you...

           Mr. Ott will walk to the door and get the guard to bend the 
           rules and look the other way, as Frank takes Dana’s hands.

                                 FRANK
                        Dana, they're gonna find him.

                                 DANA
                        Oh Jesus, what do I tell Lola?

                                 FRANK
                        Castro's gonna turn up.  I know it.  
                        But until he does, you've got to 
                        hang in.  Not just for Lola, for 
                        me.  Because I can deal with this.  
                        I can handle this, as long as I 
                        know you're okay.  I need you to be 
                        okay.

           She nods.  Trying.  Tears coming no matter what she does.

           INT. KLINE’S OFFICE — DAY

           Kline buried in paperwork.  Eve Samuels knocks, comes in.

           EXT. UKRANIAN SOCIAL HALL — EVENING

           Second Avenue, Alphabet City.  Three men at the door.  Two 
           bouncers and Detective Mohawk Milano.  Handmade sign: 
           “FRIENDS OF FRANK BRUNO”...

           AT THE DOOR

           Cops, detectives, bosses, neighborhood people forking over a 
           thirty-dollar donation.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED BOSS
                        Fuck it, take another thirty too.

           MILANO’S POV — AN UNMARKED CAR

           across the street, two detectives getting out.

                                 MILANO
                             (to bouncers)
                        No way...

           He walks inside to avoid the faceoff.

                        It’s also private, fucknuts.  And 
                        you ain’t getting in.

           INT. UKRAINIAN CLUB — SAME

           It’s mobbed; and run by Frank’s squad to help out his family.

           A PAN of the joint shows us:

           Danny, drinking as much as he’s pouring, running the cash 
           bar.

           Big Boy hawking lottery tickets.  And through an open door...
           THE BACK ROOM

           A makeshift CASINO.  Irma and Curtis running POKER GAMES, 
           Bannerman the CRAPS TABLE.

           Throughout we see familiar faces; the Robbery Squad, Mancini, 
           Norma and Christo, Cinta, the reporters Celona and Daly, any 
           and everybody whoever had dealings with Frank.  People 
           drinking, eating, gambling, dropping shekels right and left.

           And in the midst of all this is Dana, the guest of honor and 
           recipient of this fundraiser.

           EXT. FRONT DOOR

           Kline standing there holding out his thirty bucks as if 
           daring them not to take it.

           The bouncers look to Milano, who shrugs; fuck it, take his 
           money.

           INT. SOCIAL CLUB

           When Kline makes his entrance, there’s a low-key ripple in 
           the front room — not a melodramatic silence but an instant 
           peripheral wariness, a glitch in the party vibe.

           Kline toughing it out (like he did at Eddie’s funeral) just 
           walks on in.

           ANGLE - THE CASH BAR

                                 DANNY
                             (the drunk bartender)
                        Fuck’s he doing here...

           Kline heads to the bar.  Still livid over Eddie’s death, 
           Danny just walks off, stranding him.

                                 WHALEN
                             (strained)
                        Hey boss, glad you made it.

           KLINE’S POV — DANA,

           talking to Norma and Christo.

                                 NORMA
                             (pressing cash)
                        You take this, from us.

           Dana is distracted by Kline standing there waiting his turn.
           BIG BOY’S POV - KLINE, DANA

                                 BIG BOY
                        Somebody should get him away from 
                        her.

                                 DANNY
                             (drunk)
                        I’m on it.

                                 KLINE
                        Dana... If there’s anything I can 
                        do...

           Danny comes up alongside Kline, stands unnervingly close, 
           looking up at him but silent.

                                 KLINE
                             (tries to ignore him)
                        ...anything you need...

           Dana - at a loss for words.

                                 BIG BOY
                             (steering her away)
                        Dana, come over, they want you for 
                        the lottery draw.

                                 DANA
                             (to Big Boy re: Kline)
                        What does he want from me?

           Kline standing there alone now except for Danny, still 
           looking up at him, still unnervingly close.

                                 DANNY
                        Eddie Benitez says hello.

           Then we see: Danny is taking a leak against Kline’s leg.  
           Kline’s first reaction is mortified paralysis.

           His second is to HAUL OFF AND BELT DANNY halfway across the 
           suddenly silent room.

                                 KLINE
                        YOU'RE FUCKING FINISHED!

                                 DANNY
                             (from the floor)
                        What.  You're gonna take me out 
                        too?  Fuck you and fuck this job.

           Everything stops now, everyone staring impassively at Kline, 
           who glares back defiantly, then with as much pissed-on 
           dignity as he can muster, heads for the door.
           CLOSE ON KLINE — WALKING ACROSS THE ROOM

           A terrible transformation - all ambivalence and guilt erased 
           from his features; I AM WHO I AM.  I WILL BE WHO YOU WANT ME 
           TO BE.  The door closes behind him.

                                 COP (OS)
                        Clean up in aisle three.

           Some laughter and then the festivities resume as if Kline had 
           never been there.

           INT. HALLWAY/MASTER BEDROOM - FRANK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dana coming up the hall.  It's late and she looks tired.

           She can hear Lola crying and...

           There she is in Dana's bed, where she's been every night 
           since Frank was arrested.

                        What if you just can’t stop being 
                        sad?

           Dana about to try and answer, when the PHONE RINGS.

                        Who is it?

           Dana, waving her quiet...

           EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE PAYPHONE - NIGHT

           Castro's just scored.  He's loaded and sloppy.

                                 CASTRO
                        ...I needed to tell you, ‘cause 
                        there's a lot of negativity going 
                        around right now, but Frank's a 
                        good guy... very excellent guy, and 
                        I’m sorry how this went down.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - FRANK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dana stunned and frantic and trying to hide it.

                                 DANA

                        Ten-four, Chief.  I'm gone.

           And the radio goes dead.

                        You're serious?

           Kline just glares at her until she folds beneath his 
           ferocious will.  Slowing the truck and turning for the exit.

           Kline standing outside talking to a few BOSSES, the 
           conversation sober, muted; most likely about Dana.

           KLINE’S POV — EVE

           exiting 1PP with a cardboard box.

           EVE’S POV — KLINE

           excusing himself from the power kabal, handshakes all around, 
           heading her way.  She reluctantly stops, but won’t put down 
           her stuff.

                        We have a summer place around 
                        there. Now it’ll be our year-round.

                              the bosses,)
                        You're so outraged you’re uprooting 
                        your whole life, why didn’t you

                                 EVE
                        Because none of them ever wants to 
                        know anything like this.

           DANA'S CASKET being lowered into the ground.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL Frank at the graveside.  A flower in his 
           cuffed hands.  Stepping forward as he gets the a nod from his 
           PRISON ESCORT.  Dropping the flower into the grave.

           FORTY STUNNED PEOPLE trying to deal with complexities of the 
           moment.  A hungover Danny and the rest of the 7th Squad, 
           their wives... Mancini... and Lola standing with DANA'S 
           PARENTS.  A wreck.

                                 FRANK
                             (to his Escort)
                        Can I just... Without the cuffs.  
                        Please.

                        I’m sorry, Frank.

           Catching this, Mancini comes over and just stares at the guy 
           until he relents.

                                 FRANK
                        Thank you.
           Mancini nods.  Backing away as Lola rushes into Frank's 
           arms... Mourners turning away to rein it in.

                                 FRANK
                        You just have to wait for me.

                                 LOLA
                        I don’t want to.  I can’t.

                                 FRANK
                        You have to.  We have to wait for 
                        each other.

                        I know.  I know.  I know.

           Frank being led back to THE CORRECTIONS VAN.  Waiting for THE 
           ESCORTS to unlock the door, when he notices -

           Eve Samuels standing beside a car.  Like she's been here the 
           whole time.  Like she's been afraid, or ashamed to join the 
           other mourners.

                                 ESCORT
                        Let's go, Frank.

           FRANK pondering that, as he climbs into the van.

           EXT. DOWNSTATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY

           The door opens.  Frank emerges with a duffel bag.  Standing

           Frank standing beside the highway, traffic whipping by.  This 
           is where Dana died.

           A CAR HORN SOUNDS from behind him.  A GYPSY CAB waiting 
           impatiently in the service lane.

           Frank not to be rushed.  And not just here to say goodbye. 
           Something a bit more calculating about the way he's looking 
           around.  Once a detective...

                        I got the boot a few days early. 
                        They needed my room.

           They embrace deeply.

                        What do you want, what do you need,

                                 FRANK
                        I could use a bath, a real bath.

                                 NORMA
                        Yes.  Sure.  You know where it is.

                                 FRANK
                        Thank you, Mami.

                        You should have seen him at the

                        pounds.

           Frank and Danny at the otherwise deserted bar.  The place is 
           being swabbed from the night before.

           Danny rocked out - long hair, inked up - but the eyes are 
           shot.  Something whipped about him.

                                 DANNY
                        I hung for about half a year but 
                        Kline pretty much good and hounded 
                        me out.  And this?  It’s alright.  
                        I mean the hours suck.  They close 
                        out the registers at 3:45.  You get 
                        a ragged crowd in here some nights, 
                        it takes a jackhammer to get them 
                        out.

                        This guy Sisk.  The guy from Queens 
                        who brought me in?  I hear he's a 
                        Captain now.

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah, talk about fast track.  He’s 
                        gotta be the greenest Captain in

                        What’re you thinking?

                                 FRANK
                        The same shit I've been chasing in 
                        my head for five years.  Why would  
                        Castro come back for Dana if he 
                        wasn’t gonna help her?  Why would 
                        they be speeding up the Expressway 
                        if there wasn’t someone chasing 
                        them?

                        I don't know, Frank, I went that 
                        way for a while.  Everybody's 
                        telling me I gotta  move on. If I 
                        dwell on things...

                                 FRANK
                        No, I hear you.

                                 DANNY
                        I miss those times.  I can’t even 
                        tell you how much.  Eddie... you... 
                        I loved the job.  Really loved it.

                                 FRANK
                        Forget it.  I'm sorry I brought it 
                        up.

           Frank nodding.  Letting him off the hook, rising to leave,

                        Yeah, lighten up, sweetie.
                             (laughing at him now)
                        Wrong.  Cause there goes Danny 
                        right at him - out onto the 
                        sidewalk - out of the zone and - 
                        CHAOS -

           PUNCHES FLYING — DANNY GETTING IN A FEW GOOD SHOTS, HE’S MORE 
           OF A SLUGGER THAN THEY EXPECTED, BUT THERE’S TOO MANY OF THEM 
           - CROWD scattering - LATIN DUDES all over DANNY - HUGE 
           BOUNCER wading out - CLIPPED FROM BEHIND - THE DOORMAN 
           CALLING FOR "BACKUP!" and -

           DANNY ON THE SIDEWALK - jacket pulled over his head - 
           surrounded -

           TWO MORE BOUNCERS - out of the club - charging into the 
           street - THE LATIN DUDES running toward TENTH AVENUE - 
           laughing and YELLING -

           Danny helped to his feet.  Mouth bloodied.  Pants ripped.  
           And his leather jacket is gone.

                                 DANNY
                        - Fuck - MY JACKET! -
                             (about to give chase-)
                        Going nowhere, because huge bouncer 
                        is holding him back.

                                 HUGE BOUNCER
                        What the hell, Danny?

           Danny looking back.  Everyone staring.  Like it's his fault.

           INT. NORMA'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Frank heading out.  Norma having coffee.

                                 NORMA
                        You sleep okay?

                                 FRANK
                        Pretty good, yeah.
                             (pause)
                        Let me ask.  Do you still have 
                        Christos piece?

                                 NORMA
                        Christo didn’t have no piece.
                             (Frank stares at her)
                        He swore off all that nonsense 
                        years ago, you know that.

           Frank keeps staring at her until she just has to look away.
           INT. VACANT PUBLIC HOUSING APARTMENT - DAY

           THE KNIFE.  Maquetumba's knife.  The stolen switchblade with 
           the CROWNED GOTHIC “M”.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL Maquetumba staring at it.  LATIN DUDE #1 
           standing at attention, proud to be making this offering.

                                 MAQUETUMBA
                        Where'd you find this?

           DANNY'S WALLET lands next to the knife.  His driver's license 
           photo smiling back behind a plastic liner.

           EXT. WHITE PLAINS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           End of the day.  KIDS swarming out.

           Key in on one girl standing there  flirting with a boy in a 
           car - the girl absently straightening up from the driver’s 
           window, looking around, then stooping back down to the boy 
           then slowly straightening up again; — STUNNED — At first she 
           can’t move then - She's trance-walking.  Then running -

           REVERSE TO FRANK

           standing with Lola’s grandmother.  Watching Lola come -  
           opening his arms and gathering her in - both of them 
           overwhelmed, until -

                                 LOLA
                             (breathless)
                        They told me tomorrow.  I was gonna 
                        stay home tomorrow.

                                 FRANK
                        I couldn’t wait.

           EXT. WHITE PLAINS RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

           Frank and Lola walking alone.

                                 LOLA
                        Grandma said you can stay.  She 
                        wants you to.  There's a room 
                        downstairs and everything.

                                 FRANK
                        I can't.  Not yet.

                                 LOLA
                             (stopping in her tracks)
                        What?  Why?
                                 FRANK
                        I'm not ready yet.  To be around 
                        people.

                                 LOLA
                        I’m ‘people’?

                                 FRANK
                        No.  No.  Of course not.  Baby, 
                        listen... So many things happened 
                        that I never understood.  I just 
                        need a little more time to...

                                 LOLA
                        More time?

                                 FRANK
                        I messed up so bad for you, Lola.  
                        And you're good now, I can see it.  
                        Just let me... I need for it to be, 
                        I need for me to be right with you.

                                 LOLA
                        Why didn't you let me visit you 
                        more?

                                 FRANK
                        I couldn't stand to see you go.  
                        Every time you left it was like the 
                        first time all over again.

           She stops.  They're near the house.

                                 LOLA
                        You're gonna come and live with us.  
                        You just are.

                                 FRANK
                        I will.  Very soon.  Then I’ll 
                        never leave you again.  
                             (trying not to break)
                        I gotta get the train.

           He pulls her toward him.  Embracing her deeply.  Finally, she 
           pulls away.  Frank watches her go.

           INT. KLINE'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

           Kline wearing a tuxedo, stares solemnly into the mirror as he 
           adjusts his tie.

                                 SISK
                        He went up and saw his daughter.  
                        Took the train back...
                                 KLINE
                        How's he look?

                                 SISK
                        Older.  Tired.

           Kline nods grimly.  What did he expect?

                                 SISK (CONTD)
                        I’d say, don’t we all but some more 
                        than others, you know what I mean?

           Kline silences him with a stare.

           INT. APARTMENT PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           Danny getting out of his car.  Makes his way toward the 
           elevator, when -

           THREE GUYS jump him hard and -

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM/NORMA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Frank with Christo’S GUN.  Slapping the clip.

                                 NORMA
                        There’s two cops downstairs.

                                 FRANK
                        I saw that.  The roof still open?

                                 NORMA
                        I guess.  I don't go up there.
                             (re: the gun)
                        Maybe you should think about your 
                        daughter.

           Frank nods.  Gives a kiss goodbye.  He's leaving.

           INT. VACANT PUBLIC HOUSING APT.- DAY

           Barren.  Danny strapped to a chair, taking a brutal beating.  
           (Note: this sequence will remain day, even as we flash ahead 
           to night.)

                                 MAQUETUMBA
                        Who, asshole?  Who ordered it?
                             (circling slowly)
                        ‘Cause I know it wasn't you.

           Danny staring ahead.  Giving nothing.

           INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

           Kline in back with his new wife CARLA, both dressed for some 
           formal affair.
           INT. VACANT APT.- DAY

           CRACK - DANNY'S HEAD snapping back from the blow and -

           EXT. CLINTON STREET ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Frank jumping down to A FIRE ESCAPE and -

           INT. VACANT APT. - DAY

           Danny bloodied beyond recognition.  Just aware enough to hear 
           the SOUND OF THE SWITCHBLADE FLICKING OPEN beside his ear.

                                 MAQUETUMBA
                        You wanna be a hero?  Let’s see if 
                        you're a hero without your balls.  
                        One more chance, hero.  Tell me who 
                        put that shit together or I'm gonna 
                        stuff your nuts in your mouth.

           INT. HILTON HOTEL PROMENADE - NIGHT

           Formal charity event.  Must be eight hundred people in the 
           ballroom nearby.  And there's Kline coming through with new 
           wife Carla.

           INT. VACANT APT.- DAY

           Maquetumba closing in.  The knife disappearing below frame.

                                 MAQUETUMBA
                        Last chance, hero...

           Danny mumbling... teeth shattered...

                                 MAQUETUMBA (CONTD)
                        I didn't hear you...

           And now Maquetumba leans in close - so close that we can't 
           hear what Danny's saying.  But he's saying something... 
           saying enough that Maquetumba nods grimly in satisfaction...

           INT. HILTON HOTEL MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Kline alone in here washing his hands.  Looking up, into the 
           mirror to see -

                                 FRANK
                             (gun right on him)
                        Don't move.  I want you to see your 
                        head explode.

           Kline frozen.  No fear, though, just watchful.
                                 FRANK
                        I know everything.  I know you were 
                        behind my arrest.  I know you used 
                        Dana as bait for Castro.  And I 
                        know it was you and your people who 
                        drove her into that truck.

                                 KLINE
                        We all fucked up.

                                 FRANK
                        No.  I fucked up.  You?  You’re 
                        something else.  You’re a monster.  
                        Eddie.  My wife, my daughter, my 
                        family...

                                 KLINE
                        Things went too far.

                                 FRANK
                        Is that what you tell yourself?

                                 KLINE
                        All you had to do was ease off of 
                        me.

                                 FRANK
                             (gun to his head)
                        I don't think you'll be back at 
                        this party next year, Tommy.

           Kline silent almost waiting for it.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m taking all this to the papers 
                        but here’s your out.
                             (lays down the gun on the 
                              sink)
                        Nine rounds.
                             (walking away)
                        Do yourself a favor and use one of 
                        them.

           As Frank walks to the door Kline picks up the gun.

                                 KLINE
                             (explodes)
                        YOU THINK I’M GOING TO DO MYSELF? 
                        YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SHOULD BLOW HIS 
                        OWN BRAINS OUT.
                             (Frank pauses, one hand on 
                              the door)
                        IT WAS YOU THAT PUT ALL THIS IN 
                        MOTION!  IT WAS YOU WHO KILLED HER!  
                        All you had to do was take your 
                        foot off my throat.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KLINE (CONTD)
                        I begged you to!  I begged you stop 
                        forcing my hand.  And even then all 
                        you had to do was play ball with 
                        them, just tell them what happened 
                        that night.  But no.  Not you.  So 
                        you killed her just like you’ve 
                        been killing me every day for the 
                        last twenty years, you and Eddie 
                        and all of you.  Day after day 
                        cutting me up, cutting me out.
                             (pleading)
                        I was a kid, Frank and they were 
                        going to take it all away from me.  
                        All I ever wanted.  You have no 
                        idea.  But you wouldn’t let up.  
                        None of you.  All you had to do was 
                        say it’s enough, say Dennis, you 
                        paid in full, offer me your hand 
                        and say, enough.
                             (hellish musing)
                        You know what those bastards said 
                        to me that day?  “Do the right 
                        thing here and you’ll land on your 
                        feet like nothing happened.”
                             (beat)
                        Like nothing happened... Can you 
                        imagine that?

           Frank, with his back to Kline, momentarily falters, Kline’s 
           words under his skin, then walks out of the bathroom.

           INT. BALLROOM PROMENADE - NIGHT

           Kline striding out of the men's room.  And he's got the gun, 
           chasing Frank -

           INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Kline jogging down - eyes scanning - pushing wildly through 
           THE CROWD.

           EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Clogged with cars and guests and partygoers.  Kline rushing 
           out with the gun at his side and -

           HIS POV - FRANK

           walking away up darkened 56th St.

                                 KLINE
                             (pursuing)
                        YOU THINK I’M GOING TO KILL MYSELF?
                                 (MORE)
                                 KLINE (CONTD)
                             (then just standing there, 
                              halfway up the side 
                              street, shouting at 
                              Frank’s diminishing 
                              silhouette)
                        I DIE EVERY DAY!
                             (turning suddenly, 
                              because)

           A MOTORCYCLE has just pulled up beside him.  TWO RIDERS, both 
           in black, head to toe.

                                 GUY IN BACK
                        Kline?

                                 KLINE
                             (seething)
                        What!

                                 GUY IN BACK
                        Remember me?
                             (raising his hand and)

           Kline blinks.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. VACANT APT. - DAY

           Danny mumbling... teeth shattered... mouth all fucked up ...

                                 MAQUETUMBA
                        I didn't hear you...

           And now Maquetumba leans in close -

                                 DANNY
                        ...Kline... Tommy Kline...

           INT. GRAND CENTRAL - DAY

           Frank walking to A NEWSSTAND.  Pulling chocolate from the 
           display.  Handing it to the COUNTER GUY -

           HIS POV - NEWSPAPER - “POLICE HONCHO GUNNED DOWN IN MIDTOWN.”

           Frank stalled there for a moment, until -

                                 COUNTER GUY
                        You want a paper?
                                 FRANK
                             (haunted; was Kline right?  
                              In part, yeah)
                        No.

           And he pays.  And he walks.  And the camera follows him into 
           the terminal...

           And there's Lola waiting.

           The two of them heading off toward the train that will take 
           them to White Plains, as we...

                                                              FADE OUT.
