                        My point exactly. It's totally 
                        subjective. Verizon simply has the 
                        highest transmission output and the 
                        best coverage.

                        Then why don't you buy stock.

                        I do own stock.  Look, when the Mossad

           A MUSCULAR YOUNG MAN in a shirt and tie, passing in the opposite

                        Right. So anyway, when I leave here I 
                        use my phone which, as I was trying to 
                        explain, even gets signal in that 
                        sketchy stretch outside the gates - to 
                        text the wife that the 'rabbit is 
                        running' - and to initiate Operation

           A pretty little 9 YEAR-OLD GIRL sits in a suburban kitchen, 
           reading Lewis Carroll's Through The Looking Glass.

           Not perplexed at all, the girl answers the door.  Standing on

           onto the lawn in a back yard WAY overdone in an Alice in

           The guard smiles, accepting Salt's identification: Which says:

           Salt places his hand on the BIOMETRIC SENSOR as he runs it.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Say, you guys ever clean this thing? 
                        You know, plenty of other fellows - 
                        not me - don't wash their hands after 
                        taking a leak. Right now, I could be 
                        one step removed from touching the 
                        genitals of a dozen different guys. 

           The scanner beeps.  The Security Officer smiles.

                                 SECURITY OFFICER
                        It's cleaned every morning, Sir.
                            (handing back ID)
                        Have a nice day. 

           The security arm goes up and the CRASH BARRIERS go down ... 

           But before Salt can drive on, both he and the Security Officer 
           REALIZE a MAN is standing in front of his car. 

           Unshaven, exhausted - HUNTED green eyes ... 

           Instantly the Security Officer's AR-15 is off his shoulder.

                        Stop where you are!  Do not approach 
                        the gate. I repeat - do not approach 
                        the gate! 

           The man raises his hands ...

                                 MAN
                        Don't shoot ... 

           Putting them behind his head, he drops to his knees ...

                                 MAN (CONT'D)
                        My name is Oleg Vassily Taktaroff.  
                        And I am a Russian spy. 

           Salt closes his eyes - fuck ...

           EXT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

           Through a wall of reinforced glass the RUSSIAN can be seen now 
           seated at a table in an empty room. SALT and WINTER observe him 
           from a room jammed with monitoring equipment. 

           Salt clocks his watch - sighs.  Looks to Winter.

                                 SALT
                        Cold War's ... well - cold.  You 
                        realize that, don't you? 

                                 WINTER
                        Given my office is next door to the 
                        Syria desk, it's a bit hard to forget. 
                            (turns to him)
                        Look, this guy could have something.  
                        Ex-Soviet republic - predominantly 
                        Islamic - still has a couple nukes? 
                        Something sexy.  Something that could 
                        give us some juice again, Brother.

           He massages Salt's shoulder.

                                 WINTER (CONT'D)
                        Half hour - you're back on the road. 
                        Promise.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

           Salt sits opposite the Russian. The man pantomimes a CIGARETTE. 
           Salt produces a pack, shakes one out.  The man takes two.

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        What can I call you?

                        Thank you, Ed. 

           Salt speaks now in unflawed Russian.

                                 SALT
                        So now that we're best pals - why 
                        don't you be a mensch and tell me why 
                        exactly it is you're here. 

           The man smiles.

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        Your Russian - it's nice ... 

           Salt sits stone-faced - waiting ...

                                 TAKTAROFF (CONT'D)
                        You don't know me, yet you dislike me.

                                 SALT
                        Sorry, I'm not much for traitors. 

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        But I'm not betraying you.

                                 SALT
                        Still. Strikes me as a character flaw.

           Taktaroff is silent a moment.  Nods ...

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        I have cancer.

                                 SALT
                        Wonderful. You're selling out your 
                        motherland for the price of chemo. So 
                        you can waste air for, what? another
                        year?  What's the population of the 
                        R.F. these days? 150 million? 160?

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        I thought you' be pleased.  Getting so 
                        much for so little ...

                                 SALT
                        I might be delighted if only I knew 
                        what I was getting, Oleg.

           Salt plays a tough game - but it's one he's good at. Taktaroff 
           grinds out what's left of his cigarette. Lights the second.

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        Can I give you some history?

                                 SALT
                        I have a master's in Russian studies, 
                        but hey - if you can tell me something 
                        new, by all means - educate me ... 

           Taktaroff smiles ...

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        I don't think they taught this in your 
                        Russian studies class ... 

           They regard each other.  Salt turns up his hands. Well??

                        1966.  The Cold War, as you know, was 
                        sub-zero. In a gymnasium in Grozny, 
                        500 miles south of ...

                        Stalingrad - yes I know.  Oleg - it's 
                        my daughter's birthday.  So if you 
                        have something useful, possibly even 
                        current - I'm all ears.  Otherwise, I 
                        do have other, better places to be. 

           Taktaroff just looks back at him, smoking his cigarette. After a 
           moment, Salt sighs - sitting back ...

                        A gymnasium - in Grozny ... 

           The ROOM fades away, replaced by a SOVIET GYMNASIUM, packed with 
           hardened state-sponsored athletes. A WRESTLER, body a continuous 
           knot of muscle crowned by the brutal stub of a head... 

           Strains, pinned to the mat in the choking grip of an equally 
           powerful opponent.  Veins bulge as he struggles for air ...

                        ... a Soviet Olympic wrestler named 
                        Eugene Fyorodovich Chenkov met for the 
                        first time a top Russian chess 
                        champion by name of Anja Nureykova.

           As EUGENE struggles, his eyes by chance connect with those of a 
           YOUNG WOMAN who, along with some other young Russian women, is 
           being given a tour of the facility by an apparachnik.

           And all the world - the cold gymnasium, the stinking mat, the 
           crushing weight of his opponent - it all fades away for him. 

           Replaced - by the magnetic intensity of their shared gaze. 

           Abruptly, Oleg wriggles out of his opponent's grasp and WRAPS 
           him up like a python - defeating him with crushing ease. 

           Eyes finding Anja who is being led away by the apparachnik. Her 
           own eyes fastened over her shoulder ... onto his ...

                        They were married within two weeks ... 

           A simple but beautiful Russian Orthodox ceremony. Followed by 
           powerful, primitive love-making ...

                        And 9 months later - a child. 

           In Eugene's brutally powerful, cracked and calloused hands, is 
           cradled a NEWBORN child. 

           He stares at it with depthless wonder.  There is no doubt ... 
           This child - in these hands - will be protected ...

                                 TAKTAROFF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Nine months after that, both parents 
                        were shot. 

           EUGENE, in a cold, dark basement lost somewhere beneath the 
           Russian permafrost ... 

           He grits his teeth as he braces for the bullet. 

           ANJA, stares back at her own executioners in the women's prison.  
           An all-female firing squad led by a thick-waisted female 
           Colonel.  They raise their rifles. 

           Anja, expressionless but for a single tear that freezes halfway 
           down her face.

           ... and in turn placed into a pair of PALLID HANDS that wear a 
           RING bearing the STAR OF THE REPUBLIC - the highest and most 
           sinister political award of the Cold War. 

           The RING'S OWNER, the two halves of his face displaced by a 
           jagged purple keloid scar that strikes diagonally down it... 

           ... watches as the KGB CAR pulls away from the LONELY ROMANOV
           ERA MANOR HOUSE, driving away into the bleak countryside. 

           Child in his hands, he turns and re-enters the old house.

                        The Cold War was at it's coldest and

                        be America who would be crushed ...

           SOMEWHERE in the dark of the manor house, the infant Child lies 
           in an unlined basket on a table.  Alone.  Wailing.

                        Kruschev's weapon would be espionage.

                        But such spies as he had - were deeply 
                        flawed.  Limited by heavy accents and 
                        complete ignorance of any culture but 
                        their own.  Kruschev recognized that 
                        if Russia was to win this war, she 
                        must take a radical step ...

           Morning.  The small bundles that no longer shiver are dumped 
           without sentiment into an icy pit behind the manor.

           FROZEN, nine naked 5 year-old boys, lips dark blue ... 

           ... struggle against the icy torrent.  Dragging EMPTY BUCKETS 
           filling with thundering current, that drag like lead weights. 

           Boy after boy drops, succumbing to the brutal cold. But not the 
           FIRST BOY, who trudges on ... 

           Staring ahead through the icy spray with his FATHER'S EYES, even 
           as it freezes on his face like his mother's last tear. 

           Eugene.  His father's namesake. 

           EUGENE, now 7, sits in a CLASS with his 8 remaining classmates.

           The Pallid Man stands at a blackboard instructing the class who 
           dutifully repeats without any trace of accent.

                        'Groovy'.  'Far out'.  'Out of sight'. 

           OLDER still now, Eugene sits with his FIVE remaining classmates 
           intently watching EASY RIDER - taking copious notes.

           His 4 remaining classmates give way, collapsing to the hard 
           floor. But Eugene, staring ahead ... continues on ... and on ...

                                 TAKTAROFF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And in every possibly applicable 
                        fighting style ... 

           A row of instructors, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean - even 
           an ex-American heavyweight champ, stand at the edge of the mat. 

           Watching as TWO TEN YEAR-OLDS brutally battle, using with great 
           expertise a deadly mix of fighting styles. 

           Eugene K.O.s his opponent with a right hook that sends the other 
           10 year old in a spiraling 720 that leaves him unconscious. 

           Blood pouring from an open wound in his own forehead, Eugene 
           turns expressionless to his instructors to receive their 
           immediate and uncompromising critical evaluation.

                                 TAKTAROFF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        They were taught to be self-
                        sufficient; to think on their own ... 

           Eugene, at 11, repels down onto the icy peak of a Siberian 
           glacier. COPTER that brought him, winging away into the horizon. 

           He watches it go - with nothing but ragged Siberian peaks 
           stretching between him and the ceaseless horizon.

                                 TAKTAROFF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        To be masters of strategic thought; to 
                        excel under the most extreme pressure. 

           Eugene slaps a SPEED-CLOCK and intently studies the CHESS BOARD.  
           His PALLID GUARDIAN stands by with a RIDING CROP. 

           Across from Eugene - his opponent - another dry-eyed boy, whose 
           face is swollen and purple from repeated blows.

                                 TAKTAROFF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And to have absolutely no feelings. 
                        Whatsoever. 

           Outside the manor in the cold Russian autumn. Eugene is alone 
           now in the class.  The sole survivor. Only his RUSSIAN WOLFHOUND 
           remains.  The Pallid Man nods. 

           Eugene breaks the dog's neck.

                                 TAKTAROFF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        ... even on graduation day. 

           The Pallid Man now hands the boy his MAKAROV PISTOL.  The 12 
           year-old puts it to his instructor's head and pulls the trigger.

           The SAME DARK CAR that brought him a dozen years before waits. 

           He climbs in and it pulls away down the desolate, crooked road, 
           leaving behind the old manor house forever.

                                 TAKTAROFF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        He was taken to Moscow, where his 
                        training continued ... 

           Eugene steps out of the car into snowy ST. PETERS SQUARE, a 
           fresh-faced, good-looking Russian teenager ... 

           Who could just as easily be American.

                                 TAKTAROFF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        He was trained in the arts of 
                        seduction... 

           A darkened apartment, in the shadows and moonlight, Eugene 
           kisses an attractive teenaged Russian girl in bell-bottoms. His 
           hand moves up under her sweater to her breast. 

           Abruptly, all the LIGHTS snap on, the walls of the SET pull away 
           and a stern Russian woman storms onstage ... 

           Shouting at Eugene, she shows him the correct way to massage the 
           female breast, roughly demonstrating on the girl ... 

           Eugene nods attentively and duplicates the move himself. The 
           instructor nods - better ...

                                 TAKTAROFF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        In the arts of interrogation ... 

           Eugene circles some unfortunate in the same dark cellar his 
           father was executed 15 years before, screaming at him 
           alternately in Russian, then in perfect American. 

           He brutally punches the subject in the face, sending teeth 
           flying.  Then softens, kneeling by the man's side, massaging his 
           neck, speaking soothingly to him ... 

           The man tied to the chair begins to weep ...

                                 TAKTAROFF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And being interrogated. 

           BAM! Eugene, tied to a chair, is punched square in the face for 
           the nth time by a Russian powerlifting champion, while a thin 
           sinister man circles, whispering insidious questions. 

           But Eugene only smiles through the blood.

                        Fuck you, Commie. 

           BAM! the powerlifter hits him again.

                                 TAKTAROFF (V.O.)
                        But most of all - he was trained to 
                        survive. 

           In the KREMLIN, for an audience of Brezhnev and the Russian 
           commistat, Eugene, a 16 year-old kid, with his father's body, 
           his mother's face, and the cunning and brains of both ... 

           Takes on every one of his childhood fight-instructors. 

           Simultaneously. 

           And cripplingly defeats them all - delivering the coup de gras 
           to the Russian powerlifter, breaking him down as though he were 
           no more than a Urals spring mountain-flower... 

           Only the quick intervention of soldiers with Kalishnikovs
           prevents Eugene from instinctively killing his final opponent. 

           Brezhnev leads the entire commistat in applause. But it makes... 

           No visible impression on Eugene...

                                 TAKTAROFF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And then - at 17 - he was sent to 
                        America. 

           The door to a PAN-AM JET opens and a teenager in BELL- BOTTOMS, 
           TENNIS RACKET under his arm - pauses at the top of the stairs. 

           Absorbing his new home ... 

           DISSOLVING back into the Langley interrogation room ... 

           Where SALT blinks back to reality ... 

           Cocking his head, not sure if he ...

                                 SALT
                        Are you ... saying this person ... is 
                        here ... in the United States ...

           Takaroff says nothing.  Salt swallows - a chill in the air.

           Taktaroff smiles the softest of smiles.

           DEF-COM 4.  People moving, phones ringing.  SALT stabs a finger 
           at a Communications Technician.

           The SOUND of someone CLEARING their throat turns every head.

           Winter nods for Salt to join him at the window.  Salt does.

                        What about it ... ?

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        You tell me. 

           Salt studies the other man for a moment ...

                                 SALT
                        Code name for the holy grail of Soviet 
                        espionage.  We knew you were doing 
                        everything you could to steal it from 
                        us at the end of the Cold War, only...
                            (hesitates)
                        ...only we could never figure out what 
                        it was you were trying to steal ...

           Taktaroff smiles, amused.  Shakes his head.

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        That's because KA-88 was the most 
                        closely kept secret of the USSR.
                            (leans forward)
                        There is, my American friend, a fatal 
                        flaw in your market-driven economy.

                        KA-88 is a real-world scenario that 
                        would allow any 3rd party to start a 
                        domino-effect that would bring this 
                        entire country crashing in on itself 
                        in a matter of weeks.

           Salt stares at him.

                                 SALT
                        But ... why would we have something 
                        like that?

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        Have it?  My friend, you invented it.

           Salt blinks back at him an instant.  Then hardens.

                                 SALT
                        Bullshit. Why would the CIA generate 
                        scenarios for America's destruction?

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        The best defense is to anticipate the 
                        offense.  What difference?  KA-88
                        represents the Achilles heel of this 
                        entire country.  

           The mirth fades from his smile.

                                 TAKTAROFF (CONT'D)
                        And 2 days ago, Eugene Chenkov got it. 

           Salt blinks at him ...

                                 SALT
                        ... what do you ... mean ... 

           Taktaroff sits back.

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        KA-88 was Chenkov's sole purpose. For 
                        7 years before the Cold War ended he'd 
                        been focused solely on obtaining this 
                        single document. Protecting his cover, 
                        climbing the ranks, obtaining security 
                        clearance after security clearance - 
                        waiting for the day when he could be 
                        alone in a room with KA-88.

           Salt, still for an instant, swallows ...

                                 SALT
                        ... and then . . . ?

                            (shrugs)
                        And then - it all ended. USSR crumbled 
                        and he went to sleep.  For over 10 
                        years, he slept; a slumbering dragon.
                            (nods)
                        Until two weeks ago.  When the dragon 
                        was awakened again. 

           Salt's jaw works.

                                 SALT
                        I don't believe it. It'd be an act of 
                        war. The Kremlin's smarter than that. 

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        Smart enough to realize what you 
                        don't.  That for one nation to rise, 
                        another must fall.  

           He shrugs. 

                                 TAKTAROFF (CONT'D)
                        Think what you like - but Chenkov is a 
                        machine whose parts are moving again. 
                        If he's allowed to leave this facility 
                        today, he will initiate the beginning 
                        of an irreversible freefall in your 
                        market-economy's by executing the 
                        first step in the KA-88 scenario.

           Salt swallows - almost afraid to ask ...

                                 SALT
                        ... which is ... ?

                                 TAKTAROFF
                        Very simple ... 

           He grinds his cigarette into the ashtray.

                                 TAKTAROFF (CONT'D)
                        Chenkov will assassinate the new 
                        President-Elect of your United States. 

           Time - grinds to a halt.  Taktaroff nods ...

                                 TAKTAROFF (CONT'D)
                        High-powered rifle; at the AIDS summit 
                        in Philadelphia tomorrow afternoon. 

           Salt can only stare back at the other man.

                        Give me a name.

           Salt pounds the table.

                        I missed my daughter's birthday for

           But SALT abruptly stops.  Quietly CLAPPING.  Taktaroff stares.

                        Nicely done.  You almost had me going

                        Chenkov and probably not even a KA-88.  

           Standing, he tosses the rest of the pack of cigarettes.

           WINTER stands staring at a wall as SALT - stunned look - numbly

                                 SALT

           Salt shakes his head and drops his WALLET along with his PHONE 
           into the envelope which Peabody smirkingly seals.

           The RUSSIAN FILE open in his hands ...

                        1984.  18 year-old, Edwin A. Salt, 
                        a state tennis champion from 
                        Wisconsin receives an invitation to 
                        travel with players from 36 other 
                        states to the USSR for a friendly 
                        tournament. Young Edwin's parents 
                        had been killed in a car crash four 
                        years earlier.

                        The trip to Russia changed my life
                        Winter.  I've told you this before.

                        when I signed up for this fucking

                        of our economy that could be stolen by

                        In every instance, the graph indicates 
                        frankness.  No signs of deception.

                                 WINTER
                        So, in your opinion, he's telling 
                        the truth.

                                 CIA POLYGRAPH TECH
                        It's not an exact science - but yes.

           Winter takes the graph out of the man's hand. Studies it - 
           jaw working.  Shows it back ...

                                 WINTER
                        Let me ask you - in 30 years - have 
                        you ever seen a graph this perfect? 

           The Technician blinks at the graph.  Hesitates ...

                                 CIA POLYGRAPH TECH
                        ... it's ... hard to say ...

                                 WINTER
                        You mean no. Why?  Because you've 
                        never come up against anyone so 
                        well-trained to beat the machine. 

           INT. POLYGRAPH ROOM

           Winter, Peabody and several agents enter as the last sensor 
           is removed from Salt. Salt's eyes quietly meet Winter's.

                                 SALT
                        I told you I was telling the truth. 

           But Winter just says ...

                                 WINTER
                        Catch ...

           Salt, surprised, catches the CEL-PHONE Winter tosses him. 

           Winter holds up the PHOTO of SALT shaking GORBACHEV'S hand 
           when he was a young tennis-playing teenager visiting Russia.

                                 WINTER (CONT'D)
                        Thought you were left-handed Salt? 

           Salt has caught the phone with his RIGHT hand.

                                 SALT
                        I can catch a phone with either 
                        hand Winter. And I think if you'll 
                        check you'll find Gorbachev was 
                        left-handed.   

           But Winter only coldly takes his phone back from Salt.

                                 WINTER
                        It has always been my opinion ...

                        there exist far more conclusive 
                        tools for eliciting truth than the 
                        polygraph.

           INT. SERVICE TUNNEL

           Winter leads as Salt, HANDS cuffed behind him, is hustled 
           through the warren of nuclear-hardened tunnels under Langley. 

           Salt clocks their progress with deepening concern.

                                 SALT
                        Winter...where are you taking me... 

           Winter says nothing.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        What are you going to do with me... 

           Winter remains unresponsive.  They stop outside a SHORT STEEL 
           DOOR.  Salt registers it with mounting panic.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        Wait I ... I want to talk to an 
                        attorney ... 

           Winter just waits as PEABODY unlocks the door ...

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        Jesus christ Winter wait - even if 
                        I were a spy I'd have some right to 
                        due-process! 

           Now, finally, Winter looks at him.

                                 WINTER
                        I think the view is - given this 
                        represents an intelligence breach 
                        of potentially fatal proportions, 
                        in this particular instance certain 
                        constitutional guarantees will have 
                        to be ... set aside.

           The empty look in his eyes chills Salt to the bone.            
           He swallows, nearly trembling ...

                                 SALT
                        ... can I at least call my wife... 

           Winter just looks back at him - expressionless.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        ... oh winter ...
           INT. EMPTY CONCRETE ROOM

           The door BURSTS open, Salt rushed in fighting and struggling.

                                 SALT
                        Winter you can't do this!  We don't 
                        do this anymore.

           Forced down to his knees, head pushed into an EMPTY TIN PAIL.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        Winter! Wint..!

           His protests are drowned out by a HOSE one of the agents 
           shoves gushing down into the pail - filling it with water. 

           While Salt struggles, drowning, Winter watches his watch ... 

           Finally, he nods to Peabody who yanks Salt up in a huge gasp.

                                 WINTER
                        Where is KA-88?

                                 SALT
                        Winter I swear..

           Peabody shoves his head back down into the pail. 

           Winter watches his watch .... 

           Time ... ticks by ... 

           Shrugs to Peabody.  Who hauls Salt back up choking.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        Winter for God's sake, I have a 
                        wife and child!!!

                                 WINTER
                        Then - for their sake - tell me. 

           Salt looks at him.  Dripping water, mouth working; trying to 
           think of something, of anything ...

                                 SALT
                        ... KA-88 ... is ... is ...
                            (reaching)
                        ... I ... I hid it! In an office!

                                 WINTER
                        Which one?

           Salt's blinks - brain racing, mouth working ...

                                 SALT
                        N...!

           Peabody slams his head back under the water. 

           Winter pensively studies the dimly lit room . . . 

           Finally, he sighs and nods to Peabody who, with a vague look 
           of disappointment, hauls up Salt violently coughing.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        Winter listen to me! Alexi Fodorovich!
                        The FSB Agent I killed in '98! It's 
                        policy we verify our kills!  I have 
                        polaroids at my house!  Check!  I'm 
                        telling the truth! 

           Winter sighs.  Shakes his head at Peabody.

                                 WINTER
                        He's not going to tell us anything 
                        this way ... 

           Peabody nods, another agent handing him a SMALL BLACK CASE. 
           Winter pulls SOMETHING from his pocket and shows it to Salt.

                                 WINTER (CONT'D)
                        Found in your briefcase. One-way to 
                        Philadelphia; this afternoon ... 

           A PLANE TICKET.  Salt blinks at it, dripping ...

                                 SALT
                        That's not mine ...

                                 WINTER
                        So much for your kid's fucking
                        birthday party, Salt.

                                 SALT
                        It's not mine!

                            (Peabody)
                        I shouldn't be here for this. 

           Peabody shrugs, nodding, and begins rolling up his sleeves.

                                 SALT
                        Winter . . .

                        Try to be philosophical about it, 
                        Salt. 

           He sighs.  And heads for the door ...

                                 SALT
                        Winter ....

           Closing it behind him with a mortal clank of heavy locks.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        Winter!

           Peabody OPENS the black case on a small table.

                                 PEABODY
                        I always knew there was something 
                        screwy with you, Salt. Everything 
                        came too easy. 

           Seeing the four non-descript BROWN BOTTLES and package of 
           DISPOSABLE HYPODERMICS inside - Salt violently recoils.

                                 SALT
                        No!  That shit melts spinal cords! 
                        We don't even use it anymore!

                                 PEABODY
                            (filling a hypodermic)
                        You could always just tell us Salt.

                                 SALT
                        Peabody I'm begging you! Don't put 
                        that stuff in me!  It'll put me in 
                        a coma!

                                 PEABODY
                        So you see how important it is that 
                        you tell us where KA-88 is ... 

           He nods to an Agent, who forces Salt to turn away on his knees 
           as Peabody approaches with the needle.

                                 SALT
                        Peabody! Think about it! If the 
                        Seven Dwarves said 99% certainty 
                        the file is authentic. That means 
                        there's a one in a hundred chance 
                        I'm telling the truth!! 

           Peabody presses the needle's tip to the back of Salt's neck.

                        Agents disappear all the time Salt.

           He PUSHES the needle sinking into the flesh of Salt's neck. 
           Salt is in tears.

                                 SALT
                        At least let me say goodbye to my 
                        family first you son of a bitch...

                                 PEABODY
                        The woods are lovely, dark and 
                        deep... 

           His thumb presses to flood the chemicals into Salt's spine ... 

           When he FEELS a white-hot flash of pain LEAP up his arm. 

           REALIZING that SALT, having snapped his head round, has BITTEN, 
           like a mother-fucking WOLF, DEEP into the flesh of his wrist. 

           Peabody SCREAMS as SALT ... 

           Hitting his feet, hands cuffed behind him, does a cartwheel over 
           the top of Peabody's arm, SNAPPING it like a piece of chalk. 

           As Peabody melts screaming, Salt lands on both feet - facing the 
           OTHER FOUR astounded men in the room.  Panting, desperate ...

                                 SALT
                        Please. Just let me talk to my wife 
                        and kid first ...

           The other four exchange a startled glance ... 

           And RUSH. But Salt is gone. And when they turn - he is there. 

           Proceeding, HANDS cuffed behind, to literally dismantle them. 

           An instant and a half and it is over - leaving Salt standing 
           alone amidst a room of twisted bodies. 

           BANG! the door flies open and HALF A DOZEN more agents burst 
           into the tiny concrete room, GUNS drawn. 

           JUMPING through his bound wrists, Salt grabs the first man 
           through, tying him into a pretzel of crunching cartilage. 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

           The room is filled with the flash and explosion of gunfire 
           and three seconds later, only one man is left standing. 

           Edwin A. Salt.

           INT. C.I.A CORRIDOR - DAY

           WINTER bursts out into a corridor erupting in chaos. PEABODY, 
           arm in an emergency pressure-cast, is being hurried his way.

                                 WINTER

           INT. COMM ROOM

           Winter skids in.

           INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

           The ALARMS begin clanging as SALT moves at pace down a hall. 
           LOOKING for something.

           INT. CIA ENTRANCE - DAY

           The whole place accelerates into overdrive.  BLAST SHIELDS 
           sliding over the doors as Security Teams skid into position.

           EXT. ROOF - DAY

           SNIPERS drop into position across the rooftops as STEEL 
           SHUTTERING closes over all the windows ...

           INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

           Salt slides into a remote corridor.  LIGHTS flicking off, 
           replacing with flashing emergency red. Redoubles his pace.

           INT. SECURITY HUB

           Winter bursts in - hundreds of surveillance feeds are being 
           cycled and scanned by the technicians there.

                        Evacuate ahead, isolate and seal!

           INT. CORRIDOR

           Salt skids into a hall of REINFORCED STEEL DOORS - rushing down, 
           kicking each open in turn, until he FINDS what he's looking for.

           INT. HOLDING CELL

           OLEG TAKTAROFF looks up, startled, as the door of his stark 
           holding cell bursts open and he sees Salt COMING FOR HIM. 

           Quickly readjusting something in his mouth, BITING DOWN as ... 

           Salt grabs him and forces his mouth open.  GLASS sparkles in the 
           man's teeth as the light fades from his eyes. Cyanide.

                                 SALT
                        Who sent you!

           He shakes him.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        Who sent you!

           But Oleg is gone.  Salt strips the WATCH off his wrist.

           INT. CORRIDOR

           Salt skids back out. SECURITY DOORS are clanging closed ahead. 

           INT. SECURITY HUB

           Winter watches the monitor as SALT heads the other direction.

                                 WINTER
                        What about the other exits??

                        not going anywhere.

           Winter thinks a second - then blinks - realizing something.

                                 WINTER
                        What about weapons??  Is there an

                        No Sir - just intel offices. 

           Winter looks relieved.  AGENT BOTTOMS, an academic-looking young 
           Yale graduate, looks at him quizzically.

                                 BOTTOMS
                        I don't understand. Where's he 
                        going to go? Why're you so worried? 

           Winters looks at him like he's nuts.

                                 WINTER
                        Because I've worked this guy for 17 
                        years.  Trust me, we've got a major 
                        fucking problem on our hands.

           INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

           SALT skids into another corridor - STEEL DOORS at the far end 
           SLAMMING into place. Knows - he's TRAPPED.

           INT. SURVEILLANCE HUB - DAY

           With satisfaction, Winter nods.

                                 WINTER
                        Now gas him.

           The Security Tech looks up startled.

           Salt is running back, testing doors, FEELING walls. Searching

           A THICK YELLOW GAS begins seeping out the ventilation ducts.

           Sharply halting, he snatches back his sleeve and quickly 
           activates the STOPWATCH function on his wristwatch.

           INT. SECURITY HUB - DAY

           Winter raises his own watch.

           His lip twitches.

                        And I'm not talking search and

           FIRE-EXTINGUISHER ... 

           WALL THERMOMETER... 

           TELESCOPE at the window. 

           He jumps up on the desk, stripping the cover off the FLUORESCENT

           Twisting the metal caps off the ends ...

           Wiping the tears from his watering EYES, SALT skids to the 
           window - grabs the PLANT FOOD sitting next to the GERANIUMS. 

           SPINS the box - zeroing the contents.  AMMONIUM NITRATE ...

           Rushing back to the desk, he sends the fertilizer spilling 
           across the open NEWSPAPER lying there ... 

           GRABS the decorative NAUTICAL THERMOMETER off the wall, 
           shattering it against the side of the desk ... 

           Draining the MERCURY over the ammonium nitrate. 

           GRABBING the fire extinguisher off the wall, he inverts it 
           and BLASTS the mixture with pure depressurized CO2 - freezing 
           the liquid instantly into crystals.

           Into the bathroom where he grabs the ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH off 
           the sink, tossing away the interchangeable head and ...

           Skidding back to the TELESCOPE where, HANDS SHAKING, he uses

           UNSCREW the eyepiece and front lens of the scope.

                                 CHASEN (CONTâ€™D)
                        I presume an exhaustive search of his 
                        house has been conducted.

           Shifting uncomfortably - Winter coughs ... 

                                 WINTER
                        Actually, uh - it appears Salt altered 
                        his place of domicile 6 months ago. We 
                        don't know why exactly, but where I... 
                            (shit-eating)
                        I'm confident we'll know any moment... 

           Chasen regards him with cool loathing.

                                 CHASEN
                        This is a private matter, Ted. A CIA 
                        matter.  If Salt gets to Philadelphia, 
                        it becomes a public matter.  
                            (shakes head)
                        If it becomes a public matter, some 
                        among us - who feel they've already 
                        tumbled as far down in this world as 
                        they possibly can ...
                            (nods)
                        Will discover they were mistaken.

           Winter's Adam's apple bobs hard as he manages a nod.

           INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

           Winter converges with his agents - moving quickly. 

                                 WINTER
                        Where the fuck did Salt get a phone??

           Peabody - pale - holds a MANILA ENVELOPE in his good hand.

                                 PEABODY
                        I uh - re-checked his personal effects 
                        Sir and... well, I don't understand...

                        His phone - it's ... it's not there...

           Winter blinks at the envelope an instant.  Flushes red.

                                 WINTER
                        It's not there - you fucking vegetable 
                        - because it never was there. 

           Peabody blinks back, cow-like.

                                 WINTER (CONTâ€™D)
                        Prestidigitation!  Amateur fucking
                        sleight-of-hand. Like pulling jelly 
                        beans from little girl's ears.  It's 
                        not there because he never dropped it 
                        in the envelope in the first place!

           He slashes his furious eyes toward Bottoms.

                        Notify Secret Service. Let them know 
                        Salt's coming at the President-Elect.

                        Screw Chasen!  If he developed some 
                        unauthorized scenario during the Cold 
                        War and now it's come back to bite his 
                        ass, that's his problem.  Alert them.

                                 BOTTOMS
                        Sir, if they didn't back down from 
                        Jerusalem for the President, they 
                        surely won't back down from Philly on 
                        the President-Elect - not for one man.

                                 WINTER
                        That's their business - but at least 
                        they'll have the intel they need to 
                        reinforce their detail and properly 
                        protect our President-to-be.

                        And we won't burn for Chasen. 

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        But Sir, how do you know ... ?

           Winter's eyes flutter at the politically naive young agent ...

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Well - how do you know Salt's going 
                        for the President-Elect?  And not 
                        really just trying to get back to 
                        see his family one last time ... ? 

           Winter's masked contempt mutates into a half-smile. 

                                 WINTER
                        Simple.  Because - like everything 
                        else about Edwin A. Salt - his 
                        family is total and utter bullshit.

           EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

           A big 18-wheeler turns a corner, SALT stepping off the back. 

           Checking both ways, he walks quickly away down the sidewalk. 
           Pushing his hands into his jacket pockets ... 

           And remembering ...

                                 WINTER PRE-LAP
                        Congratulations ... 

           INT. WINTER'S OFFICE - DAY - PAST

           A YOUNGER, confused SALT faces a YOUNGER WINTER across his desk.

                                 SALT
                        Congratulations?  On what ... ?

                                 WINTER
                        Your marriage.

           He tosses a PHOTO across.  Salt picks it up.  A YOUNG, PRETTY 
           FACE. Future mother of his daughter. He blinks up, surprised ...

                                 WINTER (CONTâ€™D)
                        Russian national, working locally at

                        us.  Whether she knows it or not.   

           Salt blinks back down at the woman - her bright expressive eyes.  
           Winter yawns, leaning expansively back in his chair.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Summer day.  The sun-bathers are out.  SALT, in shorts, scans. 
           Zeroing what he knew he'd find here. 

           Light-haired and pretty, a YOUNGER VERSION of his future wife 
           sits under a tree, reading Through the Looking Glass in RUSSIAN. 

           Salt wanders a casual path that passes him close by. He pauses.

                                 SALT
                        Ah ... excuse me ...

           Her flashing eyes glance up ...

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        I'm so sorry - do you speak English? 

           She holds on him a mildly amused moment.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Can I help you ... ? 

           Her accent is both lyrical and beautiful.

                                 SALT
                        Oh - good.  Well, listen, I'm sorry - 
                        don't get alarmed - but you have a 
                        huge spider in your hair... 

           Her eyes flutter momentarily - then restabilize on him.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Thank you.

           She makes no other move.  An awkward beat ...

                                 YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Is there something else?

                                 SALT
                        Well I ... no ... I just thought you'd 
                        like to know - that's all. 

           She nods.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        And this generally works for you? It 
                        has a certain staged quality.

                        Lady, there's a spider in your hair.  
                        I just thought you'd like to know it. 

           He starts to walk away ...

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Then take it out and show it to me.

           He stops.  Looking back into her challenging eyes ... 

           With a shrug, he returns and, kneeling, works for a moment to  
           remove something from her hair which he starts to toss away ...

                                 YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Wait - I thought you were going to 
                        show it to me.

           Salt pauses, looking into her flashing green eyes. 

                                 SALT
                        You really don't believe me do you?  
                        You really don't believe there was a 
                        spider in your hair.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        No, I don't.

           He studies her a beat.  Smiles.

                                 SALT
                        If I open my hand - and there really 
                        is a spider in it - will you still go 
                        to dinner with me? 

           She cocks her head a curious look - has to smile too.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        I wasn't going to dinner with you in 
                        the first place.

                                 SALT
                        Possibly not. But would you go anyway. 
                        Even if the spider turned out to be 
                        real? 

           She looks at him with a confounded sort of curiosity.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        ... I ... don't know yet ...

                        What if there's no spider at all? 

           Salt just shrugs.  She hesitates still ... looking at him ... 

           Then, voice almost a whisper ... nods ...

                        ... now, it's a jumping spider ... 

           Extending it slowly toward her ...

                        ... so ...

           Imperceptibly, she swallows.  Takes her eyes from his hand ... 

           Putting them instead into his own, as his hand stops before her 
           face... 

           His fingers bloom open ... 

           But still ...

           She does not look.  Until, finally ... 

           She must. 

           Empty.

           She releases her held breath.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        Seven tonight okay?

           She looks at him, surprised.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        But there was no spider.

                                 SALT
                        I know.
                            (soft smile)

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Salt and KATJA sit at the bar, Kat out of breath from laughter.

                                 KATJA
                        'I Am The Walrus'!?  That's priceless.

                                 SALT
                        Hey - it was like, a Top 10 hit. And, 
                        it's based on a poem from my favorite 
                        book.  What's your favorite song.

                                 KATJA
                        Not 'I Am The Walrus'. 'I am he as you 
                        are he as you are me, goo goo g'joob'!

           She laughs brightly.

                                 SALT
                        How did we get on this anyway.  I 
                        thought we were talking about you.

                                 KATJA
                        No, we were talking this shady import-
                        export thing you're into and you 
                        quickly changed the subject.

                                 SALT
                        Look, not everyone involved in import-
                        export is a drug dealer. Somebody's 
                        got to be a real import/exporter.

                                 KATJA
                        Yeah.  Of drugs!

           She raises a shot of VODKA, intertwining her arm with his.

                        Like I said - cheers.

           They drink, Katja slamming her glass upside down on the bar.

           Salt looks at her - surprised. Thinks. Draws a deep breath ...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SALT
                        Sometimes ... I dunno ... I feel so 
                        ... fucking alone. In this world.  And 
                        then I hate myself for being so weak.

                                 KATJA
                        So which is the worst trait - the 
                        hating or the feeling?

           He looks at her frankly.

                                 SALT
                        Both.  

           They hold each other's eyes a moment.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        And you - what's yours?

           She thinks a moment.  Then nods.

                                 KATJA
                        Trust.  Because for me love and trust 
                        are the same.  When I trust, I trust 
                        completely.  And I've been burned.

           He studies her.  Fascinated by ... her way ... 

                                 SALT
                        Best trait ...

           She smiles. Shrugs.

                                 KATJA
                        You'll think this is incredibly 
                        unoriginal.  Trust.  Because no matter 
                        how badly I've been burned, I don't 
                        think I'll ever stop loving.

           He continues looking at her a deep  moment.

           INT. BAR BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Salt leans on the sink. LOOKING at himself in the MIRROR.

           EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY - PRESENT

           Back in the present, Salt blinks back to reality.  He stands on 
           a corner - observing a HOUSE in Reston, Virginia. 

           Glancing both directions, he starts to cross the street, but the 
           appearance of a THICKSET MAN walking out his front door and down 
           to the end of the driveway to light a cigarette ... 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           FREEZES him. Salt hovers - one foot off the curb, one on ...

           EXT. SALT'S HOUSE - DAY

           The THICKSET MAN doesn't make Salt till he's 3 steps away and by 
           then it's way too late. Larynx broken, he drops as Salt passes.

           EXT. SALT'S FRONT DOOR - DAY

           Salt minutely listens at his door.  Pushes it gently open ... 

           INT. SALT'S HOUSE - DAY

           WHAM! he is PISTOL-WHIPPED by a man standing just inside. 

           But instead of going down, SALT just goes for the guy.  But a 
           half-dozen more GUNS bring him up short. 

           His hands float ...  there are quite a few people in his house. 
           All look RUSSIAN and none look especially friendly.

                                 RUSSIAN MAN
                        Respect his space - he'll kill you as 
                        soon as look at you - only faster. 

           Salt's eyes move - warily assessing each of them ...

                                 SALT
                        Look ... I don't know who you are, or 
                        what you're doing in my house - and 
                        frankly I don't care -  I just want to 
                        know where my wife and kid are ...

                                 RUSSIAN MAN
                            (laughs)
                        Oh come on - you're not going to try 
                        to convince us you risked coming here 
                        just for your family, are you Chenkov?

           Salt double-takes him.  Chenkov?

                                 RUSSIAN MAN (CONTâ€™D)
                        You came for the same reason we did.

           Salt blinks another instant. Then shakes his head. Has to laugh.

                                 RUSSIAN MAN (CONTâ€™D)
                        You think this is a joke, Chenkov?

                                 SALT
                            (still chuckling)
                        Yeah.  God's joke.  On me.

                                 RUSSIAN MAN
                        I know your name's Chenkov.

                                 SALT
                        Why? What makes you so sure? 

           The Man smiles.

                                 RUSSIAN MAN
                        The simple fact I met a man in a diner 
                        two weeks ago who agreed to kill the 
                        future President of the United States. 
                            (nods)
                        And you are that man.

           All amusement drops out of Salt's face.  

                                 SALT
                        What ... ?

           He looks - stark - to the other Russians staring down their guns 
           at him ...

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        I swear to you - I've never this man

                        Where's KA-88!

                                 SALT
                        Goddamit, will you listen to me?  I'm 
                        not who you think I am!

           GUNS cock all around the room.

                                 RUSSIAN MAN
                        Your safe!  Where is it?!?

                        don't even have a safe.  There's no

                                 SECOND RUSSIAN MAN
                        I found the safe.

           Salt sighs.  Fuck ...

           INT. BEDROOM WALK-IN CLOSET - DAY

           They stand encircling the FLOOR SAFE that's been exposed.

                                 RUSSIAN MAN
                        Open it.

           Salt looks at him.  The Russian cocks his weapon.

                                 RUSSIAN MAN (CONTâ€™D)
                        I really mean it.

           Without much choice, Salt sighs, kneels and spins the dial.

                                 RUSSIAN MAN (CONTâ€™D)
                        When it's open, you don't reach in ...

           The safe clicks open, door sliding away sideways.

                                 RUSSIAN MAN (CONTâ€™D)
                        Now step back - I said step back.

           Standing, Salt takes a step back from the safe. The Russian 
           points his gun into his face ...

                                 THE MAN
                        10 seconds. Think your final thoughts. 
                        Ten ... nine...

           But to the surprise of all - SALT says:

                                 SALT
                        Three ...

           Startled glances.  What the ... ?

                        Two ...

           He shrugs.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        One.

           TSCHING! a REVOLVER spring-loaded in the safe JUMPS upward ...

           CONTINUED:

           Rising to just about chest-level where Salt ... 

           ... snatches it out of the air and within the same instant - has 
           placed it forcefully against the nearest man's forehead.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        Do svidanie.

           POW! he blows the man away and the 6X6 closet goes to hell in a 
           firefight that churns it into a shit-storm of lead and plaster. 

           When it is over, ONLY ONE MAN stands amidst the settling dust. 

           SALT kneels back to the safe, quickly extracting a THIN MANILA 
           ENVELOPE and stowing it inside his jacket.  Starts to rise ...

           But stops.  Eye CAUGHT by something in the safe.  He hesitates. 
           Then, reaching back in - withdraws a FRAMED PHOTO ...

           HE & KATJA - smiling on their wedding day ...

           INT. ALTAR - RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH - DAY - PAST

           POP! A flashbulb flashes.  TWO SETS OF PRESSED LIPS part.    

                                 PRIEST
                        Katja and Edwin - you are now as one.

           FLOWERS come showering down ...

           EXT. RECEPTION - DAY

           Audience clapping, Salt and Kat stand at their WEDDING CAKE. 
           Flipping the CAKE-KNIFE in his hand with startling precision, 
           Salt politely proffers it to a slightly-startled Kat. Smiles.

                                 SALT
                        Cut the cake?

           She holds a curious beat. Then, taking the knife, she places his 
           hand over hers - allowing it to guide hers as the cameras flash 
           and the first cut is made into the confection of their union. 

           EXT. RECEPTION - DAY

           GLUMLY, Winter stands with SALT.  Watching as KATJA, trim and 
           beautiful, laughs her musical laugh with the wedding guests.

                                 WINTER
                        Wouldn't you know it - the week you 
                        get married the Wall comes down.  

           He practically spits in his champagne.

           He sighs - sympathetically massages Salt's shoulder.

                                 WINTER (CONTâ€™D)
                        Stick it out a while anyway, Brother. 
                        Hopefully things'll turn our way again 
                        and she'll turn out handy after all. 

           He shrugs again and, seeing KATJA approaching laughing, TINY 
           PIECE of WEDDING CAKE on a napkin in her hand, clears out.

                                 KATJA
                        Hyenas!  Can you believe this is all 
                        they left us?? Who are these people??

           Salt regards the tiny remaining fragment of cake.  Smiles ...

                                 SALT
                        Nothing that can't be broken in two...

           Taking it, he efficiently crumbles it into 2 equal pieces and 
           STARTS to pop his half into his mouth when she catches his hand.  

           Holding his eyes, she gently pulls his piece forward.  Taking  
           it softly into her own mouth.  

           Then raises her own piece to his lips ...  

           He looks back a curious moment. Then - takes it into his mouth

           INT. SALT'S HOUSE - DAY - PRESENT

           Salt's eyes blink back to focus on the PHOTO of him and Katja.

           Outside, the sounds of CARS screeching up.

           EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

           The SWAT team hits the door at full impact, batter-ramming it 
           down as they stream in just ahead of WINTER and his people. 

           But as soon as they're in - Winter can smell it ... 

           Salt's gone.

           INT. CLOSET - DAY

           They stand over the BODIES littering the floor.  A GROAN.   
           Winter kneels, pulling the RUSSIAN MAN'S bloody face to his.

           The Russian coughs feebly. Winters shakes him - speaks RUSSIAN.

                                 WINTER (CONT'D)
                        Who are you? I'll let you die in this 
                        crappy closet!  Who do you work for! 

           But the man dies anyway.  Winter drops him with disgust.  
           BOTTOMS, rifling through the open floor-safe, looks up ...

                                 BOTTOMS

                        There are options ...

                        If civilian casualty isn't a priority 
                        issue and Salt's carrying his phone...
                            (nods)
                        We can target a surface-to-air missile 
                        onto its signal if he turns it on.
                            (shrugs)
                        'Reach out and touch someone'.

           Winter looks for a moment like he's almost considering this 
           insane proposal. BOTTOMS rises from searching the SAFE ...

                                 BOTTOMS 
                        Uh, Sir ...

           He hands Winter a SET OF POLAROIDS he pulled from the safe. 
           Candid photos of a RUDDY HEAVY-SET MAN, HEAD blown half-away.

                        If I'm not mistaken - that's Alexi
                        Fodorovich. The FSB Colonel Salt was 
                        ordered to kill in '98... 

           Winter stares a rigid beat at the photos. Then snaps them back.

                                 WINTER
                        Fabrications. I'd expect nothing less.

           ARMSTRONG breathlessly arrives - clutching a DOCUMENT.

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        From a locked drawer in his desk ... 

           Looks uneasy as his boss takes and examines it. 

                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT'D)
                        A CIA psychological profile...
                            (hesitates)
                        Yours Sir ...

           Winter stares at the document - hands trembling.  Very abruptly, 
           he crumples it, pockets it, and heads wordlessly for the door.

                                 BOTTOMS
                        But Sir ...

           Winter pauses hovering in the doorway - but does not look back.    
           Nervous, Bottoms apologetically gestures with the POLAROIDS ...

                                 BOTTOMS (CONTâ€™D)
                        Why would Chenkov fabricate evidence 
                        of a kill and not show the Bureau... ?

           It is a beat before Winter turns. But when he does, in his eye 
           is the very dangerous look of a man mocked and played the fool.  

                                 WINTER
                        Maybe because he wasn't asked.  Maybe 
                        because, at the time, we trusted him.

           He steps back in - face moving aggressively close to Bottoms'. 

                                 WINTER (CONT'D)
                        A defecting Russian spy told us an 
                        unpleasant truth today. You resist 
                        that truth, Bottoms, because you still 
                        believe in humanity and you yourself 
                        are still a good person at heart. What 
                        you're failing to take into account - 
                        is that he is not.  That he is a 
                        inveterate and remorseless liar. Would 
                        you like to know how I'm so sure?

           He leans his face closer to the other man.

                                 WINTER (CONT'D)
                        Because he's spent the last 15 years 
                        lying for me.

                                 INTERROGATOR PRE-LAP
                        Once more - you're a spy for the 
                        United States, yes, Mr. 'Freeman'...
           INT. TURKISH INTERROGATION ROOM - PAST

           Salt GRITS HIS TEETH as ELECTRICITY surges through his body.   
           Slumping when it relents - HANGING spread-eagled by 4 chains. 

           His TURKISH INTERROGATOR circling ...

                                 SALT
                            (panting)
                        I swear to you ... I swear to God on 
                        everything holy, I swear on the lives 
                        of my fucking children!  I'm not who 
                        you keep saying I am. I'm a business 
                        man from California, I've got a wife, 
                        three kids, a dog, a fucking goldfish.

                                 INTERROGATOR
                        Again the children's names please?

                                 SALT
                        Alexander, Bobby, Lori; my wife's name 
                        is Carol - what do you want me to say!  
                        I'll say it; I'll say anything ... 
                            (breaking down/weeping)
                        I just want to get back to my family.

           Without prompting, the TECHNICIAN at the GENERATOR throws the 
           switch, sending another huge surge of ELECTRICITY through Salt. 

           Arching his body, teeth grinding audibly - until it stops again. 

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                            (deranged/weeping)
                        Carol ... Carol ... baby ...

                                 INTERROGATOR
                        This can go on every day for years.   
                        I won't be here, of course ...
                            (technician)
                        But he will. Costing less even than 
                        the electricity he sleepily uses   
                        electrocuting you day in and day out. 

           He lifts Salt's chin with his riding crop.

                                 INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
                        Won't you just tell me who you really 
                        are - Mr.'Freeman'?

           EXT. TURKISH PRISON YARD - DAY

           Bitter cold. Haggard, SALT stares at mountains visible thru the 
           rusting fence.  A few other prisoners shuffle round the yard ...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           One stops next to him - speaks in Turkish.

                                 PRISONER
                        Cigarette?

           Salt looks at him.  Shakes his head.

                                 SALT
                        Sorry.  Don't speak Turkish.

           The Prisoner nods - lights one of his own, exhales in ENGLISH.

                                 PRISONER
                        Beautiful this time of year ...

           Salt glances at him again - surprised.

                                 PRISONER (CONT'D)
                        Not to worry. I'm a relation. Distant. 
                        But 'Family' nonetheless ...

           Salt watches him cautiously.  The other man's voice lowers.

                                 PRISONER (CONT'D)
                        Our 'Family' asked that I reinforce 
                        your awareness that, because this 
                        country has certain strategic value to 
                        Russia, it is of utmost gravity she... 
                            (a glance round)
                        ... not discover we may be cultivating 
                        our own competitive presence here...

           Salt's gaze slackens.

                                 PRISONER (CONT'D)
                        And that - no matter how strenuous it 
                        may become for you in this place ...

           He nods, handing Salt a CIGARETTE.

                                 PRISONER (CONT'D)
                        You have your 'Family's total support.

           The prisoner shuffles off.  Salt watches him go for a moment. 
           Then CRUSHES the cigarette in his hand.

           Into his palm rolls a GLASS CAPSULE.  Marked CYANIDE.

           INT. DARK TURKISH PRISON CELL - DAY - PAST

           Bruised. Filthy. Exhausted. SALT squats hunched against a wall. 
           In a sliver of LIGHT that somehow lost its way into this hell...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He contemplates the tiny GLASS CAPSULE in his fingers...

           Freedom ...

           ABRUPTLY, the heavy door swings open.  His TURKISH INTERROGATOR 
           standing framed in the doorway, riding crop tapping at his side.  

           He looks pissed.

           INT. PRISON EXIT - TURKEY - DAY

           When the buzzer sounds a very worn, very RELIEVED-looking SALT 
           walks through the door to freedom, met by an AMERICAN DIPLOMAT.

                                 SALT
                        Friend, I thought it was the Midnite
                        Express or Vitamin C for me for sure. 
                        I don't know how you did it but... 

                                 AMERICAN DIPLOMAT
                        We didn't.  

           Salt blinks - confused. The Diplomat steps aside, nodding ...

                                 AMERICAN DIPLOMAT (CONT'D)
                        She did.

           Allowing Salt to see - KATJA - standing back at the door.    
           Face glowing, tears in her eyes.

           Stunned, Salt's eyes snap back. The Diplomat lowers his voice.

                                 AMERICAN DIPLOMAT (CONT'D)
                        Don't worry. Your cover's intact. As 
                        far as she knows, Turkey mistook you 
                        for an American businessman named 
                        'Freeman' who had Russian mob ties. 

                                 SALT
                        But how... did she ... ?

                                 AMERICAN DIPLOMAT
                        Brass balls. 3 phones worn out on her 
                        calls.  No joke.  My poor secretary's 
                        got post-traumatic stress now.  
                            (shakes head)
                        Once she found out where you were, it 
                        wasn't up to us anymore. Heaven and 
                        earth were gonna get moved or she was 
                        gonna freakin' invade Turkey herself.

           He nods to SALT'S INTERROGATOR who stands by watching intently.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 AMERICAN CONSUL 
                        I suggest we get moving before Allah 
                        Akbar here changes his mind ...

           INT. CAR - DAY

           In the back of the U.S. Embassy car, Katja takes Salt's hand 
           tightly in her own as Ankara rolls by. 

                                 SALT
                        Kat ... I ...

           But she just squeezes his hand - their WEDDING RINGS glittering 
           side-by-side in their tangled fingers ... 

                                 KATJA
                        Don't say anything.

           Shakes her head ...  

                                 KATJA (CONT'D)
                        I just want to look at you ...

           He looks back. Trying to grasp - the dragons stirring within ...

                                 PRE-LAP VOICE
                        Right this way, Mr. Walken ...

           INT. BANK - DAY - PRESENT

           Salt blinks back to reality.  A smiling BANK MANAGER stands in 
           front of him, handing him back A PASSPORT.  Salt takes it ...

                                 SALT
                        Thank you.  It's 'Walker'.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        So sorry.  Right this way, Mr. Walker.

           INT. BANK PRIVACY CUBICLE - DAY

           Salt opens a SAFE DEPOSIT BOX. Inside, only two items ...

           A GOLDEN WEDDING RING ...

           And a BRASS LOCKER KEY.

           Pocketing them both, he walks out.

           EXT. BANK - DAY

           But as he exits ...

           CONTINUED:

           WHAM! a HALF DOZEN BLACK CARS slam sideways into the curb. 

           Spilling guns and men like a falling shelf of books ....

           EXT. SIDEWALKS - DAY

           PINBALLING through the crowd - SALT RUNS. 

           INT. ALLEY - DAY

           Ducks into an alley - CARS roaring at him from both directions. 

           Darts quickly through a doorway.

           INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

           Racing upwards, taking steps three at a time.

           INT. RENOVATION FLOOR - DAY

           Bursting breathless out of the stairwell into an empty floor 
           undergoing extensive renovation.  

           WHAM! his pursuers explode through behind him, lighting up the 
           exposed concrete and drywall with small-arms fire as Salt ...

           INT. RENOVATION ROOM - DAY

           Dodges through the next doorway into a a DEAD-END ROOM. Outer 
           walls gone - sprawling city exposed 27 stories below. 

           End of the line.  Behind - he can hear them COMING.

           He kicks open the final door - a SMALL UTILITY ROOM.

           INT. UTILITY CLOSET

           A narrow closet four feet wide - ten tall.  HEARING ...

           His pursuers slamming into the room behind, he ...

           Swings himself upward just as the walls around him ERUPT in an 
           implosion of plaster ...

           Wedging himself high up between the walls as the bullets chew 
           through them below with the flash and explosion of fire.

           Devouring and destroying everything in the space beneath ... 

           Tornado of lead RISING higher and higher up the wall until...  

           Fire and bullets flash mere millimeters beneath his face ....

           CONTINUED:

           Burning his eye-lashes burn away. 

           He closes those eyes ...

           And - suddenly - it stops.

           His eyes pop back open - ears pricking.  Whispering and the 
           distinctive sound of reloading coming from the next room ...

           Dropping down he quickly ...

           INT. RENOVATION ROOM - DAY

           Steps, hands floating, into the next room, where click PEABODY 
           and 3 AGENTS - just finishing reloading - glance sharply up.

                                 SALT
                        Say, could we please not tell my wife 
                        about these little meetings of ours?

           PEABODY just smiles, shakes his head, and sticking his gun under 
           an arm, gets a cigarette out with his good hand. 

                                 PEABODY
                        I'm glad you're enjoying your joke 
                        Salt. Laugh while the laughing's good.

                                 SALT
                        Come on, Peabody. I'm sorry about your 
                        arm, but for Christ's sake, you don't 
                        really think I'm a Russian spy do you?

                                 PEABODY
                        Why shouldn't I?

                                 SALT
                            (quietly)
                        Maybe because Winter told you I'm not. 

           The other three Agents exchange a startled glance.  Peabody has 
           to chuckle.  Shaking his head again, he lights the cigarette ...

                                 PEABODY
                        Divide and conquer - that it Salt? 

           Salt's jaw tightens.

                                 SALT
                        Look - kill me, disappear me; I don't 
                        care.  It's the job; I'm prepared. But 
                        for crissakes, my wife and kid don't 
                        know what I really do.

                        I just don't come home one day? It'll 
                        destroy them.  All I want - is to say 
                        goodbye.

                                 PEABODY
                        How touching.  But from what we could 
                        tell - Salt - your wife and kid don't 
                        even live in that crap house with you.

           Salt's lips tighten.  Saying nothing.  Peabody raises his gun. 
           As do the THREE OTHER widely-separated Agents ... 

                                 SALT
                        Just let me finish my business. Then  
                        you can do whatever you want to me.

                                 PEABODY
                        Salt - I'm already going to do 
                        whatever I want to you.

           Salt glances at the cold faces around the room ... 

           The writing's on the wall. They're going to kill him.           
           He shrugs, sighs and nods at Peabody's CIGARETTE ...

                                 SALT
                        Last drag then? For the condemned? 

           Peabody just breathes SMOKE into Salt's face with a 'yeah, like 
           I'm gonna fall for that' look.  Salt coughs.

                                 PEABODY
                        Here's what's going to happen.  I'm 
                        going to count to five - and then I'm 
                        going to pull this trigger.  If you're 
                        Salt, and you're really just trying to 
                        get back to see your family one last 
                        time - you'll die.  Because Salt was 
                        never as fast as Peabody ...

           He smiles faintly.

                                 PEABODY (CONT'D)
                        But if you are fast enough to get this 
                        gun away from me - then you're Chenkov
                        and you're a traitor on your way to 
                        kill the President-Elect - which pays 
                        you out one bonus milli-second of life 
                        before my colleagues here ... 

           He nods to the OTHER THREE AGENTS with guns on Salt ...

           A cold smile travels round the room.

                        So let's see - who you really are ... 

           Four clicks as four guns cock.  Peabody ... leveling his 
           revolver three inches from Salt's head - starts his count.

                                 PEABODY (CONT'D)
                        O...

           PAPAPOW! the other 3 men around the room drop dead.

           Blinking, Peabody looks from their sprawled bodies, to his 
           astonishingly empty hand ... 

           To SALT - whom he sees, in addition to HOLDING HIS GUN, is also 
           now also smoking his CIGARETTE. Salt blows smoke into his face.

                                 SALT
                        The woods are lovely, dark and deep...

           EXT. BUILDING DAY - DAY

           A silently screaming man comes flying out of the 27th floor. 

           The man is not Edwin A. Salt.

           INT. 27TH FLOOR - DAY

           HE ... stands in the cold wind blowing through the open walls. 
           Looking down at the HANDS that just threw a man to his death. 

           They are trembling.

           INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY - PAST

           Into those same trembling hands is placed a NEWBORN child. 

           HIS DAUGHTER NADJA, less than a minute old, pink and silent. 

           Salt stares into the tiny wondrous face ...

           Juggernauts he never knew - stirring within him ... 

           Placing his daughter back into the hands of the nurse, he goes 
           to the bedside of KATJA - exhausted from her titanic battle with 
           the forces of nothingness to secure the victory of life.

           Kneeling at her bedside like a knight before his queen, he takes 
           her pallid hand and, placing it to his head ... closes his eyes.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK PLAYGROUND - DAY - PAST

           Not far from where they first met - Salt and Katja sit watching 
           their 4 YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER play laughing with the other children. 

           NADJA, pink-cheeked, tow-headed and beautiful, frolics happily 
           with the other children in the playground. 

           Asian, Jewish, Arabic, Hispanic, Caucasian, Black ... 

           A faraway look in her eyes, Katja watches the greatest social 
           experiment in the history of mankind - AMERICA. 

           Looks to her husband.  Who has been watching her watch it.

                                 KATJA
                        This is a great country you have, Ed. 

           Salt looks back at her - a million parts moving behind his eyes. 
           Reaching, he takes her hand ...

                                 SALT
                        Yes.  It is.

           INT. MUSEUM - DAY - PAST

           SALT, KATJA and NADJA, atop Salt's shoulders, stand before The 
           Farewell of Telemachus and Eucharis - David's tender portrait of 
           two young lovers and their wordless final embrace. 

           Telemachus looks frankly out from the canvas while Eucharis
           rests her cheek on her lover's shoulder, trying to capture into 
           her heart for the rest of all time this final moment.

                                 KATJA
                        He reminds me of you ... 

           Salt looks curiously at his wife.

                                 SALT
                        He doesn't look anything like me ... 

           She just smiles back at him - and simply says ...

                                 KATJA
                        I know.  But she loves him.

           He blinks back - into her open, honest gaze.

           SALT - at Winter's desk - stares at surveillance PHOTOS of the

           But still, Salt struggles.

           EXT. BUS STATION - NIGHT - PRESENT

           SALT blinks at the BUS DRIVER, standing outside a GREYHOUND BUS.

                        I can see up his nose.

           Nadja chooses her weapons and the two quietly go to work.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING - PAST

           SALT sits reading the morning paper, oblivious that he does so 
           in FULL MAKE-UP - resembling the unholy offspring of a circus 
           clown and a hirsute transvestite. 

           He periodically glances over the top of the paper to Katja and 
           Nadja who appear to be doing everything in their power to 
           contain internal explosions of laughter.  Finally, he gives up.

                                 SALT
                        Okay - what ... ?

                        because we ... love you?  Right Nad?

           They look at each other.  Burst out laughing. 

           Salt blinks at them.  Then, setting down the paper, he stalks 
           off to the bathroom. Katja and Nadja exchange a glance.

                        Oh you've done it now. You've pushed a

           INT. CLOSET - MORNING - PAST

           Katja and Nadja skid into a closet, hiding behind SALT'S COAT. 

           Blood pounding in their ears, they hold their breath, listening. 

           Katja's fingers becoming aware ... 

           Of a SEALED LETTER - peeking from the pocket her hands rests on. 

           Left by some anonymous sender ... 

           For the owner of the coat to find after fond farewells ... 

           Intuitive weight of destiny descending upon her, she draws the 
           letter out.  And turns it over - cold fist closing within ... 

           As she sees ...

                        Not only was his whole marriage a sham 
                        but now it turns out he's not even 
                        fucking married anymore.  He'd been 
                        keeping it from us.  His wife filed 
                        for legal separation 6 months ago and 
                        all that crap about his rich family 
                        life and his daughter's birthday party 
                        was just that - bullshit.

           INT. SALT & KATJA'S HOME - MORNING - PAST

           Salt stands by, crushed, as Katja, LETTER open in her hand, 
           alternates between rage and tears.

                                 KATJA
                        Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch 
                        me. Do not touch me you mother fucker!

           She snaps the letter in his face.

                                 KATJA (CONT'D)
                        You told her your name was Yuri! That 
                        you were Russian???  What the fuck is 
                        wrong with you!?!  Who are you??  I 
                        thought I knew you!  I trusted you ...

           And suddenly, it all goes out of her again.  She wilts down to 
           the floor, arms wrapped round her body.

                                 KATJA (CONT'D)
                        I trusted you ... I trusted you ... 

           Salt feels like dying.

           INT. CIA CORRIDORS - DAY - PRESENT

           WINTER moves at speed just ahead of Bottoms and Armstrong.

                                 WINTER
                        Shake my hand - Chasen's being run up 
                        a pole and I've been put in charge.  

           Dubiously, Bottoms and Armstrong shake the proffered hand.

           Salt blinks at the CHECKOUT GIRL who nods to the BIG BOX OF 
           MATCHES, FOLDING BUCK KNIFE and BALL OF TWINE between them.

                                 CHECKOUT GIRL

           Shaking it off, Salt nods, pays, takes his items and heads out.
           EXT. SUPERMARKET - DAY - PRESENT

           He stops beside the 25 cent mechanical horse. A LIGHT RAIN is 
           falling. The store PARKING LOT is filled with ARMED RUSSIANS. 

           WHO - WITHOUT REGARD for the store behind - open fire. 

           Behind Salt - the great panes of glass - begin dropping ... 

           A WOMAN carrying a SMALL CHILD spirals downward - SHOT ... 

           A breath ... 

           Salt steps down off the curb...

           EXT. SUPERMARKET - DAY - PAST

           ... following KATJA, ignoring him as she carries a bag of 
           groceries towards her car.

                                 SALT
                        Kat, please, I'm begging you - don't 
                        do this ...

           She just continues straight ahead.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        What does it solve??  How does it make 
                        anything better?

           He gets in front of her.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        Please Kat, I ...

           He searches, trying to grasp what he himself is feeling. 
           Suddenly, all at once - it hits him.  He looks at her ...

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        Kat, I'm scared.

           She looks back - surprised by the confession. But shakes it off.

                                 KATJA
                        Scared of what Ed?  Being alone?  
                        Weren't you alone when you met me ...? 

           She cradles the grocery bag as she opens her trunk.

                                 KATJA (CONT'D)
                        You can do it again.

           CONTINUED:

           Shutting the trunk, she heads for the driver's side. Salt feels 
           everything going into a freefall panic. 

                                 SALT
                        Kat wait - listen - I got this great 
                        idea for Nadie's birthday ... 

           But she only pauses in the door of her car ...

                                 KATJA
                        Just one thing.  Was the spider in her 
                        hair real, Ed? 

           Then gets in and drives off, leaving him there ...

           EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - DAY - PRESENT

           ... standing in the middle of the parking lot.  Behind, between 
           him and the store, the remains of a WAR-ZONE ... 

           A dozen dead Russian operatives sprawled behind ... 

           In Salt's hands, TWO EMPTY, SMOKING GUNS ... 

           He tosses them on the hood of a car - sizzling in rain water.

           EXT. HELIPAD - DAY - PRESENT

           Winter yells as he, Bottoms and Armstrong fight their way 
           through the rain and rotorwash to the waiting CHOPPER. 

                                 WINTER
                        I've been greenlit to use all force to 
                        stop Chenkov. Now that prick's gonna
                        learn firsthand what they mean when 
                        they say 'wrath of God'. 

           He nods at them from the bottom of the chopper's steps.

           Salt sits across from Katja.  Both silent.  Finally ...

                        I wouldn't have blamed you.  If you 
                        hadn't come ...

           She looks like she almost didn't.

                        I had to be honest finally. 

           She watches him - unreadable.

                        I want - need to - tell you what I do.

                        What I really do ...

           She sits.  Silent.  He shakes his head, eyes glistening.

                                 SALT (CONT'D)
                        I'm an Intelligence Officer, Kat.

           Her face doesn't change.  But, invisibly, she swallows.

                        Intelligence Agency ... ?  What does 
                        that ... mean...?  

           Salt looks back at her a long time.  Finally, he nods.

                                 SALT
                        My name is Eugene Porovich Chenkov.

           the KEY he retrieved from the safe-deposit box ... 

           Removing a LONG BRIEFCASE and quickly walking away.

           Salt enters, heading purposefully into the first stall ...

           He opens the case. Inside, a RIFLE with a SNIPER'S SCOPE gleams.

                        A cell inside the Kremlin discovered

                        And that if I didn't do exactly as 
                        they said, they'd expose me.  And then 
                        go after the only two things I care 
                        about in this world.  

           He snaps the case closed, bundles it under his arm and exits.

           INT. CIA JET - DAY

           Armstrong hangs up the jet-phone. He looks to Winter - pale.

           EXT. PENNSYLVANIA CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           Choppers are airborne over the heart of downtown Philadelphia. 
           Streets and parking lots surrounding the massive complex jammed 
           with civilians and traffic police. 

           NEWS CREWS broadcast out of the parking lot.

           EXT. LOADING DOCK - DAY

           The docks are busy with caterers organizing final details - each 
           entrance manned by a local Philly police officer. 

           At the lift entrance a POLICE OFFICER nursing a cup of coffee... 

           NOTICES a MAN - who has materialized out of literally nowhere - 
           coming at him fast in an overcoat and carrying a longish case.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Hey - you can't come through here ... 

           But the man doesn't slow.  DROPPING his coffee, the cop reaches 
           for his gun but SALT knocks it away and ... 

           STRIPS the man's handcuffs as he ducks under, snapping one end 
           round a wrist and twisting the man into a figure-8 with the POP! 
           of a dislocating shoulder ...

           As he SNAP!s the cuff around the man's ankle. A PUNCH to the 
           side of the neck puts the man into black unconsciousness.

           The SECRET SERVICE AGENT on guard here turns to see SALT coming 
           at him down the corridor, case in hand - fast. 

           He goes for his gun, but Salt's faster, putting it into the air. 

           BREAKING THE MAN'S NECK with the same hand. CATCHING his RADIO 
           HEADSET and putting it on before his body even hits the ground.

           BURSTING into the long room.  Immediately spotting the RIFLE, 
           left leaning against the catastrophically cracked mirror.  

           But the SPY himself - is gone.

                                 WINTER
                        Block it off!  Seal everything!  Don't 
                        let him get out of here! 

           Pale, he picks up the rifle - whose sophisticated camera radio-
           tap SCOPE gives a black and white window down onto the floor 
           where a SECRET SERVICE MEDIVAC TEAM is deploying rapidly in.

           He raises from the dead man's jacket, what looks for all the 
           world ... like a RADIO DETONATOR.

                                 BOTTOMS

           He's staring over Winter's shoulder at the SCREEN on the rifle's 
           BIG SCOPE. Reaching, he twists - zooming the scope's image-feed.

           On the convention floor, Paramedics have just opened up the HEAD-
           SHOT secret service agent's jacket ... 

           Revealing a chest STRAPPED WITH HIGH-EXPLOSIVES.

           Had just saved the life of our next United States President.

           EXT. DINER - DAY - PAST

           Salt is sitting at the bar when A MAN - now dead and familiar as 
           the same RUSSIAN MAN whom he found waiting for him in his house 
           in Virginia with his thugs - takes the seat next to him.

                                 RUSSIAN MAN
                        Have you gotten KA-88 yet? 

           Salt just gives an irritated look.

                        How can I steal something that doesn't 
                        exist? It was disinformation. Invented 
                        by the CIA to keep KGB off-balance. 

           The Russian smiles a slight smile.

                                 RUSSIAN MAN
                        It might interest you to know - we've 
                        made another friend inside Langely.  
                        And that's not what he tells us.

                                 SALT
                        Well, I'd post-date the check if I 
                        were you because if your new friend's 
                        a spy and his lips were moving when he 
                        did - he was lying.

                                 RUSSIAN MAN
                        Perhaps. Except this spy, who has seen 
                        what you claim doesn't exist, has - as 
                        an act of faith - outlined for us its

           The Russian exchanges a glance with 2 OTHER MEN who join him on

                        he took it to keep it from being used  
                        against us ...
                            (an invisible swallow)
                        And that he maybe didn't miss at all.  
                            (a hesitation)
                        Maybe he hit what he was aiming for. 
                        And saved our next President of the 
                        United States. 

           They hold on each other.

                                 BOTTOMS 
                            (a swallow)
                        Yes Sir ... it is. 

                                 WINTER
                        May I offer an alternative scenario?

                            (relieved)
                        I was actually hoping you might Sir... 

           BLAM! a smoking hole appears in the document Bottoms holds and, 
           an astonished look on his young face, he drops dead. 

           Winters now points the GUN he'd quietly drawn down at the floor. 

           Methodically FIRING into it as he calmly pockets the document.

           Abruptly the elevator doors open.  A HALF DOZEN CIA agents  
           standing there - guns drawn - stunned to see Bottoms dead.

                                 WINTER
                        He was in the shaft!  He's probably 
                        out of the building by now!  Go!

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA SIDEWALKS - DAY

           SALT RUNS, caroming through the crowd. Breathlessly punching a 
           NUMBER into his phone and thrusting it to his ear as he goes.

                        Three.

           EXT. CONVENTION CENTER PARKING LOT - DAY

           Winter moves at a run towards the cars with Armstrong.

                                 WINTER
                        Light up the boards. Chenkov is armed, 
                        extraordinarily dangerous and to be 
                        put down on sight without question.
                            (another Agent)
                        And I want a dragnet dropped over this 
                        city like the hammer of God.  Every 
                        street, every artery out - I want it 
                        blocked, barred and barricaded. 

           Skidding to the cars with MAPS of Philly spread across hoods.

                                 WINTER (CONTâ€™D)
                        He's on foot. I want every train 
                        station, bus terminal, river-boat or 
                        pogo-stick in a 10-block radius.

                                 AGENT
                        Nothing inside those parameters ...
                            (nods)
                        But there is this ...

           He taps the MAP spread on the hood of the car. 

                                 AGENT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Four blocks due east of here ...

                        Russian Consulate. 

           Winter blinks - astonished.

                                 WINTER
                        Christ that's where he's taking KA-88!  

           He spins to the others.

                                 WINTER (CONTâ€™D)
                        We have to stop him.

           EXT. SIDEWALKS - DAY

           SALT skids to a panting halt across from the RUSSIAN CONSULATE. 

           In either direction, FEDERAL CARS come skidding round the 
           corners down-block.  He darts into traffic.
           EXT. RUSSIAN CONSULATE - DAY

           From either direction a small army of Federal Vehicles comes 
           skidding up, Federal Agents jumping out of cars everywhere.

           WINTER meets an AGENT already quickly returning from the 
           UNIFORMED RUSSIANS who stiffly guard the Consulate gate.

                                 AGENT 1
                        No-go.  The only way we're getting in 
                        is if we break the lock.

           Winter glares at the Consulate like an enemy fortress ..

                                 WINTER
                        90 seconds and KA-88'll be the screen-
                        saver on every computer in the 
                        Kremlin... 
                            (Agent/suddenly)
                        Fill the roofs.  First one with 
                        crosshairs - put his brains out.

           As the Agent dashes off, Armstrong look to Winter, surprised.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Sir - by the Vienna Convention this is 
                        Russian soil. Any aggressive act could 
                        be technically classified as an act of 
                        war ... 

                                 WINTER
                        And the forcible theft of KA-88? How 
                        do you classify that?  'Technically'?  

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        But ... Sir ... we donâ€™t even know 
                        heâ€™s in there for sure ...

           ANOTHER AGENT skids breathlessly up.

                                 AGENT 2
                        Sir!  We found out where the wife went 
                        after she left Chenkov!

           He pauses, catching his breath - and nods.

                                 AGENT 2 (CONTâ€™D)

           INT. RUSSIAN CONSULATE LOBBY - DAY - PRESENT

           Standing at a colleague's desk at the periphery of the CROWDED 
           LOBBY of people waiting for visas and other consular business...

           KATJA is staring at the NEWS on a work-mate's computer.

                                 CNN ANCHOR
                        ... we don't know the President's 
                        condition at this point but as earlier 
                        indicated, the FBI has released the 
                        name of 'Edwin A. Salt' whom they are 
                        characterizing as a 'terror suspect'. 

                                 WORKMATE
                        Wasn't that your name ... ?

           Katja, stunned, blinks over at her friend ...

                                 KATJA
                        Wh.. what ... ?

                                 KATJA'S WORKMATE
                        'Salt'. Wasn't that your married name? 

           Kat blinks back a reeling instant ... head ... shaking ...

                                 KATJA
                        no ... no not Salt ... 'Saltz' ...

           Her friend shrugs, returning her attention to the screen. In a 
           shell-shocked daze, Kat gathers her papers and, turning, takes 
           two steps - running SMACK into SOMEONE ...

           Blinks up to see SALT standing there.  She stares a stunned fish 
           instant ...

                                 KATJA (CONTâ€™D)
                        Ed ... Ewin ...

           Her mouth drops ...

                                 KATJA (CONTâ€™D)
                        What ... the hell ... are you doing 
                        here ... ?

                                 SALT
                        You wouldnâ€™t take my calls; evidently 
                        didnâ€™t listen to my messages ...
                            (shakes head)
                        I had no choice.

           CONTINUED:

                                 KATJA
                        ... choice ... ? ...to what ...?

                                 SALT
                        Get you.

           She blinks at him a second.

                                 KATJA
                        Get me... ? You mean...to go with you?

                                 SALT
                        Kat - I just pulled my thumb out of a 
                        dam holding back 30 years of secrets. 
                        A lot of people around this world are 
                        going to be extremely unhappy and no 
                        one close to me is going to be safe.

           She looks back at him a disbelieving instant.

                                 KATJA
                        Ed ... I donâ€™t care what you did. I 
                        wouldnâ€™t go with you to hell just to 
                        drop you off.

           But he is right back at her - just as intense.

                                 SALT
                        Kat - listen to me - under normal 
                        circumstances, if I were you - I 
                        wouldn't trust me either ...  

           He nods.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        But trust me ...
                            (shakes head)
                        These aren't normal circumstances. 

           His eyes are deadly serious.  

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        For for your sake and Nadjaâ€™s - you 
                        need to come with me.  Right now.

           Her own eyes hesitate - a floating, unbalanced instant.       
           Then abruptly RE-HARDEN ...

           But before she can retort POW! the COMPUTER SCREEN at her elbow 
           explodes in a spray of glass.  People scream and yell everywhere 
           as EVERYONE - including SALT and KAT - gets down.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           On the floor with Kat, Salt looks quickly from the spiderwebbed
           BULLETHOLE in the window - to the CONSULATE SECURITY MONITORS.

           Where Winter and his people are storming through the gates.  

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                            (Kat)
                        Look at your phone.

           She blinks at him. Then does. The SIGNAL BARS abruptly go DEAD.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Powerâ€™s next. Winter'll use everything 
                        including lethal force to stop what I 
                        know from making it out of here today. 
                        Which means stopping me ...

           He nods meaningfully into her eyes ...

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        And anyone I might have told.

           MUFFLED SHOUTING.  A gasp goes through the prostrate crowd.    
           On the CLOSED-CIRCUIT MONITORS, Winter and his weapons teams, 
           flowing through the crashed OUTER CONSULATE DOORS ...

           Are brutally overwhelming the Russian Consular Guards there.

           Whump! the monitors go BLANK as Consulate POWER abruptly dies.   
           With a panicked murmur, the crowd's frightened eyes turn to the 
           Consulate's BIG INNER DOORS. Salt, steady, looks back to Kat ... 

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        I locked them on my way in ...

           WHAM! the big doors shudder - but Salt's eyes stay on Kat ... 

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        But he will get through.  And when he 
                        does - if you and I are still here - 
                        that's when he'll start shooting. 
                            (shakes head)
                        I won't die.  And - like it or not - 
                        neither will you ...
                            (nods/crowd around them)
                        But others will.

           Crack! the DOORS shake again - starting to give way.  Salt eyes 
           remain locked into Kat's - torn and deeply struggling ...

           She looks to the Consulate's back entrance.  Him ...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 KATJA
                        You honestly think you're that good?

           He looks back at her a hard instant.  

                                 SALT
                        Depends on what I'm fighting for.

           INT. CONSULATE BACK STAIRWELL - DAY

           Salt and Kat burst out into the back stairs just as a CIA AGENT 
           hits the top step, gun slamming out - 3 inches from Salt's face.

           A heart-pounding micro-instant.  He pulls the trigger.  

           But Salt's hand is there first - RACKING back the slide and 
           ejecting the bullet cartwheeling out the ejection port as he 
           catches it in air with that same hand while his ...

           OTHER HAND simultaneously ejects the gun's dropping magazine...

           Catching that too while, in the same instant, his KNEE slams 
           into the side of the Agent's head - putting him OUT.

           In an instant, the ELECTRIFICATION of charged energy - vanishes.

           Salt looks to KATJA who stands jaw-dropped and stock-still. With 
           a snap! and click! he loads the bullet and mag back in the gun. 

                                 SALT
                        Let's go.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           KAT and SALT burst out into the garage at a breathless run.

                                 KATJA
                        But Ed - I don't understand.  Why 
                        would Winter want to kill you? 

                                 SALT
                        Same reason you did.

           He skids up to a CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE - quickly unlocking it.  
           She pauses, blinking at the big car ...

                                 KATJA
                            (to herself)
                        ... he knew I'd come ...

           Quickly shakes it off ...    

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 KATJA (CONTâ€™D)
                        Ed, what're you talking about?  The 
                        reason I did??

           He jumps in, engine roaring to life, passenger window powering 
           down, looking out.

                                 SALT
                        I betrayed him.  Coming?

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The car slams out and merges into the camouflage of traffic just 
           as FEDERAL VEHICLES come screaming around the corner down-block.

           Katja watches over her shoulder as they screech into a blockade 
           in front of the garage just exited.  They didn't see them.

           Looks to Salt, expertly spinning the wheel, power-sliding them 
           out of sight around the next corner.

                                 KATJA
                        You betrayed me by lying. How could 
                        you betray Winter by lying when lying 
                        is practically Rule Number One in the 
                        Good Housekeeping handbook for spies? 

                                 SALT
                        Easy ... 
                            (shrugs)
                        I broke Rule Number One. 

           He looks at her.  Deep breath.  Shakes head.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        When I was recruited, spy-wise, I was 
                        100% on the level.  Every word out of 
                        my mouth - who I was, what I believed 
                        in - flat-out lies.  But then - time 
                        passed; the words stayed the same... 
                            (shrugs)
                        But the truth changed ... 
                            (nods)
                        That's how I betrayed Winter. One day 
                        my lies stopped being lies.  And I 
                        never told him. 

           He looks at her.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        And after a point, it wasn't the lies 
                        between us anymore either, Kat ...
                            (shakes head)
                                 (MORE)

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:
                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        It was the fact I didn't tell you 
                        they'd become the truth. 

           He skids the car to the curb and slaps it in park ...

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        On the floor - by your feet. 

           Before she can say anything, he grabs a BAG out of the back and 
           is dashing up the steps of the SCHOOL he parked in front of.  

           Her eyes move - to the PINK BOX she now realizes sits wrapped in 
           twine by her feet.  A swallow ...  She reaches down ...

           INT. RUSSIAN CONSULATE LOBBY - DAY

           FUNCTIONARIES for the US and Russia argue loudly while WINTER 
           stands angrily in his own head at the eye of the hurricane. 

           ARMSTRONG skids breathlessly up. 

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Security cameras track Salt entry to 
                        exit ...
                            (shakes head)
                        No stops, no contact with anyone 
                        except his wife.

           His voice rises - almost hopeful.

                                 ARMSTRONG (CONTâ€™D)
                        Maybe he really did just come here to 
                        see her after all ...

           Winter spares him a withering look.

                                 WINTER
                        Did you actually study stupidity in 
                        college?  If he'd just wanted to say 
                        goodbye, he would have said it.  His 
                        wife is the hand-off - get it?

           He is already moving towards the doors.

                                 WINTER (CONTâ€™D)
                        They're going to try to leave the 
                        country with KA-88. Confirm lock-down 
                        and blockade of all city exodus.  Get 
                        me a chopper and put everything we've 
                        got on the school their kid goes to. 
                        If they make one stop - that'll be it.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        But ... Sir - if Salt doesn't care 
                        about his family - why would he risk 
                        stopping for his daughter ... ?

           Winter stops, looking fiercely back at him from the door.

                                 WINTER
                        Do I look like I have the capacity to  
                        explain what goes on inside the brain 
                        of a sociopath?

           INT. CAR - DAY

           KATJA sits alone.  BOX open on her lap ...

           Her hands, her lips - are minutely shaking.  

           Inside is a CAKE in the shape of a WHITE RABBIT WITH A POCKET-
           WATCH. In icing, the words Eat Me - surrounded by NINE CANDLES. 

           She quickly smears away a TEAR before it drops onto the cake.

           INT. CARVER ELEMENTARY CORRIDOR - LOCKERS DAY

           The hall is emptying out as kids head into their next class. 
           NADJA, balancing her books on a knee, closes up her locker.

           STARTLED to see a large WALRUS standing there. 

                                 WALRUS
                        Hey Little Girl - are you Alice?

           A glistening grows in the girl's wide eyes.  She ... 

                                 NADJA
                        Dad!

           ... throws her arms around him.  Removing the Walrus head, Salt 
           kneels, squeezing her tight - his own eyes glistening. 

           From behind her ears, he MAGICALLY produces 2 JELLY BEANS.

                                 SALT
                        Red or green?

           She doesn't even look at them.

                                 NADJA
                        Whichever takes me with you ...
           INT. CAR - DAY

           KAT watches surprised as Nad jumps into the back seat ...  

                                 NADJA
                        Hi Mom!  

                                 KATJA
                        Hello Hon ...

                                 NADJA
                        Dad's back.  

           Kat looks to Salt, jumping in behind the wheel.

                                 KATJA
                        Yeah ... I noticed that ...

           A SHADOW sweeps the windshield.  Salt takes a quick glance up.  
           A HELICOPTER hovers above the rising CANYON OF BUILDINGS.

           Looks back.  SEVERAL BLOCKS BEHIND - from their high vantage at 
           the hill-crest Carver Elementary sits on ...

           The BRISTLING LIGHTS of dozens of law enforcement vehicles. Kat 
           sees the same thing coming at them from the opposite direction.  

           A minute - tops. She looks to Salt - face etched with worry.

                                 KATJA (CONTâ€™D)
                        We're not going to make it, are we...  

                                 SALT
                        Piece of cake.

           She looks back at him with disbelief.

                                 KATJA
                        Are you seriously saying there's even 
                        a chance of us getting out of this...? 

                                 SALT
                        No.  I'm saying I'd like a piece of 
                        cake.

           He nods at the CAKE in her lap.  Using the BOX OF MATCHES he 
           bought at the grocery store with the twine, he quickly lights 
           the candles and displays the cake for Nadja in the back.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Sorry I was late, Angel ...

           Nad squeals, bouncing on the back seat. Salt starts to sing ... 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        'Haaaappy Birthday - to you ... 

           Kat, watching her husband with a kind of perplexed amazement - 
           finds herself picking up the next verse ...

                                 KATJA
                        'Haaaappy Birthday to you ...          

           They hold each other's eyes - then look back to Nad ...

                                 SALT AND KATJA
                        Happy Birthday dear Naaaadja ...     
                        Happy Biiiirthday to you...'           

           Nadja laughs, claps and, leaning forward, blows round the cake. 

                                 SALT
                        Make a wish?

                                 NADJA
                        Yuh-huh ...

           He glances through the windshield. The FEDERAL VEHICLES are 
           hardly 2 blocks away - fighting towards them in traffic ...

           His eyes remain intently focused a moment. Abruptly he turns to 
           Kat, snapping open the BUCK KNIFE with startling precision.

           She freezes for a moment.  But he just smiles.

                                 SALT
                        Cut the cake? 

           Relaxing, she smiles too, taking the knife. But stops - paused 
           on the unorthodox shape of the rabbit-and-pocketwatch cake.

                                 KATJA
                        ... how do I cut it ... ?

                                 SALT
                        Three equal pieces?

                                 KATJA
                            (looks at him)
                        But ...

           Flummoxed, she looks back to the cake ...

                                 KATJA (CONTâ€™D)
                        It doesn't go into three pieces ...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           He says nothing.  She looks over - seeing the faintest smile 
           floating on his lips.  He shrugs.

                                 SALT
                        So what do we do ... ? 

           Kat studies him - trying to figure where he's going with this. 
           Shrugging, she picks up the whole cake and offers it back ...

                                 KATJA
                        First bite for the Birthday Girl?

           Nad doesn't need to be asked twice. Plunging her face into the 
           cake, she comes away munching, face plastered in icing.

                                 SALT
                        How is it, Babe?

           Cheeks bulging, Nad pops up two thumbs.  Salt looks to Kat.  She 
           appears uncertain what to now do with the rest of the cake ...

           Salt nods out the windshield.  Freed from traffic, the LAW-
           ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES racing towards them are seconds away.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        If we're gonna have that piece of 
                        cake, I guess we oughta have it ...

           She studies him.  Starts to raise the cake to her mouth ... 

           But Salt catches her hand.  And her eyes ...

           Pulling her hand from her mouth, he brings it instead to his.

           Taking her bite into his own mouth ...  

           And removing the cake from her hand he puts it back to her lips.  

           Her eyes blur as - suddenly - she understands.  With all the 
           gratefulness of a human heart she takes his bite into her mouth.

           Salt's eyes glisten back.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Happy birthday ...

           And, as the FEDERAL CARS come screaming up at them from either 
           direction, Salt slams it into gear and stands on it ...

           Tires smoking under them as the car auto-gyros on its smoking 
           tires out from the curb and as the Federal Cars ...

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Come ROARING up, he guns it hard left - the only direction open - 
           threading the needle of two Federal Cars that slam head-on into 
           each other just behind, as Edwin A. Salt ...

           Blasts his family onto the FREEWAY ENTRANCE opposite the school.

           INT. CAR

           Nadja - her father's daughter - seems to be actually enjoying 
           this - but Kat - from the real world - is holding on for dear 
           life as they POWER-SLIDE out onto the busy freeway. 

                                 KATJA

                                 SALT
                        Don't worry - I'll take care of you.  

           She looks back - studying the husband she just met ... 

                                 KATJA
                        Promise ... ?

                        I'll do better than that.

           Pulling a GUN, he swings it past startled Kat's face and ...

           Pow! puts a bullet through the front quarter-panel of the CAR 
           they are passing, BLOWING it's alternator and electrical system.   

           As that car - suddenly dead - fades away, Salt swings the gun 
           back out his own window and pow! kills the CAR on that side.  

           Both dying, weaving cars bringing all trailing TRAFFIC skidding 
           to a log-jammed HALT on the freeway behind them.

           INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

           High above, WINTER'S COPTER sweeps past over the TRAFFIC-JAM 
           Salt just created - effectively CLEARING the interstate below.

                        the bridge - 3 miles and counting.

                        He won't get to it, if I can help it. 
                        It'll take a lot more than little 
                        traffic games to keep me off his ass. 

           EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

           A FLEET of OPEN-TOPPED HUMVEES blasts at 90 on the shoulders 
           round the barrier of stopped cars and back onto the interstate.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Speedometer ticking 80, Salt looks from HIS PHONE to Kat 

                                 SALT
                        Kat - my phone doesn't have signal ...

           A numb instant - then realizing what he is asking, she finds HER 
           PHONE and hands it to him.  Dialing, he slaps it to his ear.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                            (phone)
                        Coming up on arrival.

           Killing the connection, he nods to the FLAT-BED 18-WHEELER they 
           are coming up at fast on the interstate ahead.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Our ticket out.

           Kat blinks at it ...

                                 KATJA
                        Ticket?  It's a truck ...  

                                 SALT
                        Fine - boarding pass.

           Abruptly, the back window explodes and DROPS.  Salt immediately 
           CLOCKS the HUMVEES racing up behind them in the rear-view.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Nadja - down Baby-Girl!  Now!

           But, with her father's instincts, the girl's already down as

                        There's an armor plate in the trunk!

           ... grabbing her, he pushes her down just as a bullet bursts her 
           headrest.  Punching the accelerator to the floor.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Hold on ...

           Kat peeks up. Sees they're about to hit the back of the flatbed.

                                 KATJA
                        Edwin!

           But BAM! - too late.  Passing under the back of the speeding 
           flatbed, the Lincoln's nose slams the 18 wheeler's mud-flaps.

           A bursting squeal of smoke as it bounces back off the truck's 
           quad-set screaming rear wheels. 

           Salt hits CRUISE-CONTROL - matching speed with the big truck.

                                 SALT
                        Ears!  Cover!

           He hits a Radio Shack switch, CORDITE lining the WINDSHIELD ...

           Blowing - windshield ejecting upward like a fighter-pilot into 
           wind where it goes whipping back down the interstate ...

           EXPLODING a mortar of glass shrapnel as it hits the 1st HUMVEE 
           racing up behind - ripping past the two ducking CIA Agents who 
           were just standing to open fire over the SUV's windshield.

           As that vehicle goes veering screeching off the highway, Salt 
           scrambles up over the dash and out onto the Lincoln's hood ...

           Speeding nose-nuzzled drafting beneath the truck ahead's flat-
           bed back edge like a baby whale swimming beneath it's mother.

           GLANCES - up the truck's long, flat bed into the truck cab where 
           his eyes MEET the driver's in the rear-view mirror. 

           The DRIVER nods. Turning, Salt thrusts a hand back into the car.

           Katja hesitates - looking at the hand - then up into his eyes.

           A last instant ...    

           Then quickly reaching into the back seat, she hoists Nadie out 
           to Salt who lifts the girl up onto the truck's speeding flatbed.  

           Thrusting her own hand up, she allows him to pull her out and 
           lift her up onto the wind-rushing bed of the truck beside Nad.  

           Her eyes immediately clocking the 3 REMAINING HUMVEES speeding 
           up to fill the hole vacated by the first one.  Salt sees it to.  

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Just get up to the front of the truck! 

           He quickly thrusts the GUN up into her unfamiliar hands.

                                 KATJA
                        But ... what about you?

           His eyes snap left. Their speeding collective of truck and car 
           is BEARING DOWN FAST on an OBLIVIOUS MOTORCYCLE COP ahead ... 

                                 SALT
                        Just get up there!

           And to her astonishment, he swings back through the Lincoln's 
           windshield, dropping neatly back into the driver's seat and ...

           Wrenching the wheel - veering out hard from beneath the semi ...

           Screeching back out onto open road - Lincoln swinging out wide, 
           clipping just past the startled Motor-Cop's rear wheel and ...

           Stomping it - Salt surges the big car forward ... 

           Blasting past the motorcycle cop and ...

           SNATCHING the man's GUN out of its holster as he shoots by. 

           Hitting the convertible's TOP RELEASE, letting the wind RIP IT 
           flying away back down the interstate as he ...

           Leaps to his feet, wind lofting him sailing over the back seats, 
           where he lands skidding to the rear edge of the car's trunk ... 

           Just as Humvees 2 and 3 surge up to slam the rear of the car ...

           PA-POW! he puts two precisely timed shots into the wheels of the 
           Lead Humvee, sending it into a spin that COLLIDES into its twin, 
           carrying them spiraling away in a wheel-smoking locked scream...

           CONTINUED: (3)

           TOPLESS HUMVEE 4 coming roaring up behind, its 2 SHOOTERS rising 
           above its windshield, shouldering AUTOMATIC RIFLES and lighting
           the trunk Salt stands on into a grenade of spitting metal ...

           HE responds putting a SINGLE SHOT through its on-coming grill...

           BLOWING the hood-lock and releasing the hood into the catching 
           90mph wind that slams it backward like a 150 pound RAT-TRAP that  
           crushes the windshield and panickedly ducking snipers flat. 

           SALT whirls. SEES the FLYING DUTCHMAN LINCOLN on whose trunk he 
           stands is veering sharply across the lanes TOWARDS the flatbed.

           KAT and NAD can only watch wide-eyed atop its bed as the big car 
           carrying Salt sheers towards them ...  

           All 3 simultaneously knowing - even were Salt to dive into the 
           Lincoln's back seat - the big car just rides INCHES too high ...

           To pass under the flatbed and avoid a devastating parallel 
           collision with the vehicle carrying Salt's wife and daughter.  

           10 feet and one quarter second from catastrophic impact, SALT 
           fires four blurring shots through the car's four corners.

           BLOWING all four of the car's tires simultaneously ...

           SLAMMING the car FOUR INCHES down onto its rims ...

           As he himself leaps upward ...

           CAR shrieking on its rims away beneath him in a grinding 
           sideways sliding spray of sparks ...

           As it just barely clears passing beneath the speeding flat-bed.

           And away out the other side as SALT lands, light as a canary, on 
           the flat-bed - skidding to a stop beside Katja and Nad.  Agape.  

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        You two cool?

           Numbly, Kat nods.  He gives thumbs up.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Good.  Me too.

           Kat nods dazed at the DRIVER in the cab of their rig.

                                 KATJA
                        What about him?

                        money pumping iron in jail for a year 
                        than most people make in ten working.

           He glances back down the interstate.  Checks his watch.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Right on time ...

           Kat and Nadja look startled back to see a LEAR JET coming in 
           fast for touch-down on the traffic-cleared interstate behind.

           INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

           The EXPRESSION of fury on Winter's face as he wings over the 
           MASSED WRECKAGE of Humvees below, drops slack as a LEAR JET 
           ROARS past beneath - headed in for a landing on the freeway.

                                 WINTER
                        Oh ... shit ...

           He snatches his helmet mike to his mouth. 

                                 WINTER (CONTâ€™D)
                                He's got a jet!  The semi!  
                        A jet!
                        We have to take him out on the semi!

                        Sir - we can't.  He just took us out. 
                        We've got nothing till they reach the 
                        blockade on the bridge ...

           Winter's mind races an angry instant.

                                 WINTER
                        The Secret Service's anti-aircraft 
                        battery - did we pull it with us??

                        Uh - possibly Sir but ...

           But Winter has already killed connection, snapping at the Pilot.

                                 WINTER
                        Get me to that bridge!

           EXT. SEMI FLAT-BED - DAY

           Wind rushing their hair, Kat, Nad and Salt watch as, incredibly, 
           the JET touches down in a burst on the interstate behind them.

           CONTINUED:

           Engines winding, the rolling plane pulls parallel with the 
           speeding flat-bed - fuselage easing up beside mere meters away.

           PLANE'S WING, extended out over the speeding flatbed, creeping 
           up its length toward them like a mother bird's sheltering wing.

           Salt looks to Katja who is speechless.  Shrugs.  

                                 SALT
                        Once you fly private - you just can't 
                        go back.

           Directly opposite, the racing Lear Jet's door opens, a HEAVY-SET 
           MAN telescoping the stairs down out over the speeding asphalt...

           Salt winks at him and shouts to Katja over the wind.  

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Alexi Fodorovich! I did him a favor 
                        once!  Now he's doing one for us!

           Kat looks to the ruddy-faced RUSSIAN who grins and tips his hat.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        You first!  I'll hand Nad over!

           She hesitates. Jet stairs little more than a gangplank bridging 
           the fury of flying cement separating truck from plane ... 

           Salt glances ahead.  Coming up fast - a BRIDGE BLOCKED BY DOZENS 
           of vehicles.  His eyes return to Kat.  Deeply calm.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        I promised you I'd take care of you...

           A beat in those eyes.  Then, slipping her hand into his, she ... 

           Steps out over the howling void - making the wildly vibrating 
           stairs, grabbing Alexi's waiting hand, and quickly turning back.  

           Across the river of wind Salt, on a knee, looks into Nad's eyes.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Sorry I missed your birthday, Doll.  

           The girl just shakes her head - and smiles beyond her years.

                                 NADJA
                        You didn't miss it, Dad.  You made it.

           The look in his eyes says it all.  She knows him. She knows him. 
           He combs his fingers once through her hair. Hands her his PHONE.

           She willingly takes it and, standing, he lifts the girl across 
           to Kat - but as Alexi pulls her inside, the TRUCK...

           Abruptly drifts left, closing the gap between itself and the 
           racing plane. Kat retreats up into the doorway of the plane.

           Where she reaches across the rushing chasm to Salt ...

                        This first!

           He hands across the MANILA ENVELOPE.  She looks at him ...

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        It took me ten years to get it.  I 
                        can't afford to lose it now!

           Grabbing the envelope, she hands it to Alexi and thrusts her 
           hand back across the gap. 

           Stretching across - he clasps his hand around hers ...

           But makes no move to step across the void. Her eyes leap to his.  
           A sad smile haunts his lips.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        That day in the park - when I opened

           She looks back.  He nods ...

                        But now - it's definitely there ... 

           And opens his hand.  Realizing, she lunges to grab it back...

                                 KATJA
                        Edwin!

           But his fingers slip away - falling back across the void.

                                 SALT
                        You'll only be safe without me.

           Ahead, the BLOCKADE is coming at them fast.

                        As long as you're in possession of 
                        what's in that envelope ...
                            (a soft smile)
                        There's nothing anyone can do to me. 

           He looks to Nadja, holding Alexi's meaty hand in the doorway.

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        And you, Princess - I think your wish 
                        just might come true.

           They share a smile.

           Salt looks to the BLOCKADED BRIDGE mere moments away ahead. If 
           the racing plane doesn't take off, and now, it'll crash into it.

           He looks back to his family.  Swallows invisibly. 

                                 SALT (CONTâ€™D)
                        Goodbye.

           Trembling, Kat's glistening eyes never part his as the plane's 
           wheels rise up from the interstate, lifting her away ...

           Her husband becoming a diminishing figure that stands on the 
           flatbed of a truck speeding out onto the high bridge below ...

           As her plane blasts over the tops of the VEHICLES BLOCKING it. 

                                 ALEXI FODOROVICH
                            (Russian/Kat)
                        We have to close the door ...

           Below, the truck her husband stands upon slams its brakes and 
           goes into a smoking slide out on the tall, blockaded bridge.

           Kat lowers her eyes a moment ... nods.

           EXT. BRIDGE - ROADBLOCK - DAY

           More than 100 Federal and local law enforcement officers brace 
           as the big semi comes SKIDDING sideways towards their vehicles.   

           Stopping mere smoking meters away from their barricade.  

           GUNS converge everywhere instantly.  As SALT - hands raised - 
           drops down, his eyes connect with Winter's gleaming own ... 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WINTER
                        Hiya Salt.  Hear the woods are lovely 
                        this time of year ... 

           But Salt just smiles back.

                                 SALT
                        Be sure to send a postcard. 

           Smirk transforming into a scowl, Winter shoots Armstrong a look.  
           Well?? Covering his PHONE, Armstrong reluctantly nods. 

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Eyes in the sky confirm - he gave her 
                        an envelope and his phone. 

           Winter looks coldly from the LEAR JET winging away from them... 

           To SALT, corralled 30 feet away at the bridge's dizzying rail by 
           the rifles of a DOZEN NATIONAL GUARDSMEN.  And then Armstrong...

                                 WINTER
                        Shoot it down. 

           Armstrong stiffens - startled.  

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Sir, there's a nine-year old child on 
                        that plane...

                                 WINTER
                            (coolly)
                        And what's in that envelope endangers 
                        every child in this country.  Do it.

           Armstrong glances to SALT - almost desperate.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Sir - we're 2 miles from the airport.  
                        A SAM could lock onto another plane's 
                        exhaust ....

                                 WINTER
                            (temper rising)
                        Did you not say she's carrying Salt's 
                        phone?  Target its signal and fire.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        But Sir, we're not even certain KA-88
                        is what's actually in that envelope...

                            (turns/points toward Salt)
                        That spy over there just moved a 
                        mountain to put it in her hands. You 
                        tell me. What the fuck else could be 
                        in that envelope that's so important?  
                        Now shoot the goddam plane down!

           A swallow.  Armstrong nods to the Secret Service ...  

           INT. PRIVATE JET - DAY

           KATJA buckles Nadja in - SALT'S PHONE and ENVELOPE in her lap...

           EXT. BRIDGE - ROADBLOCK - DAY

           At gunpoint, SALT can only watch as - WHOOSH! - the ROCKET 
           blasts off out of the Secret Service mobile missile battery - 
           streaking away after the Lear Jet like a dog after a bird ...

           Off Salt's blank response, Winter smirks toward Armstrong. 

                                 WINTER
                        Still think he's human?  It's only my 
                        god-daughter and I can barely watch. 

           Almost disappointed, Armstrong looks to Salt - facing the guns 
           at the railing without expression - hands behind his head.

           NOT SEEING KAT'S PHONE slip from Salt's SLEEVE - into his hand.

           INT. PLANE - DAY

           Kat CONSIDERS the ENVELOPE.  As if it might contain a snake ...

           EXT. BRIDGE - ROADBLOCK - DAY

           WINTER spectates with poorly disguised satisfaction as the 
           missile closes on the plane.  Abruptly, HIS PHONE rings... 

           Annoyed, he flicks it sharply out...

                                 WINTER
                        Yes what??

           But the VOICE that comes back  ... 

                                 VOICE
                        Do try to be philosophical about it, 
                        Winter ... 

           Causes his features - to go slack.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He blinks a stunned beat. Then snaps round to SALT. Corralled in 
           the semi-circle of National Guard over by the bridge's railing.

           Every set of National Guard eyes stares up after the missile...

           But SALT'S - KAT'S PHONE at his ear - are looking directly back 
           into Winter's.  His lips' quiet smile - forming a single word... 

                                 SALT'S VOICE
                        Verizon ...

           Winter stares back a ringing beat as ...  

           All at once ... it hits him ... 

           He LOOKS at the Nokia in his hand.  Identical in every way to 
           his own Nokia, except, instead of Cingular, the screen says... 

           He FLASHES BACK ... 

           To the POLYGRAPH ROOM - TOSSING his phone to SALT.

                                 WINTER
                        Funny Salt - I thought you were left-
                        handed ... 

           SALT hands him back ... a Nokia phone. 

                                 WINTER'S VOICE
                        Prestidigitation!  Amateur fucking
                        sleight-of-hand. Like pulling jelly 
                        beans from little girl's ears ...

           WINTER'S EYES SHOOT UP.  His phone-screen now says VERIZON.

           He spins round just in time - to see THE ROCKET... 

           Streaming back down at him. 

           ARMSTRONG - and all the others who saw the missile's turn ...

           Clearing like a swarm of rats the hell away from him.  

           Leaving him only time to snap his eyes back to ... 

                                 WINTER
                        SALT!

           Before the missile's VAPORIZING EXPLOSION rocks the bridge.  

           WHEN everyone dazedly finds their feet again, tiny pieces of 
           Winter are still pelting down everywhere like soft bits of rain.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           The anti-aircraft gunnery sergeant looks dazed Armstrong's way.

                                 GUNNERY SERGEANT
                        Sir ... ?  The plane ... ?

           Armstrong hesitates, looking after the distantly receding plane. 
           Then shakes quietly his head, turning to the National Guardsmen.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        No. We got who we came for ...

           But the National Guardsmen - just finding their own feet...

           Realize that Armstrong is now staring past them. Horrified.

           Their eyes - and all others - TURN.   

           To that place at bridge's edge where EDWIN A. SALT had stood at 
           gunpoint a moment before... 

           Occupied now only by AIR.

           INT. PLANE - DAY

           Warily, Kat shakes ENVELOPE's contents into her hand. A SINGLE 
           SCRAP OF PAPER.  Turns it over ...  Swallows ...

                                 KATJA
                        Nad ...

                                 NADJA
                        Yuh-huh, Mom ... ?

           Kat stares at the paper trembling microscopically in her hand.

                                 KATJA
                        What was it you wished for ... ?

           The girl smiles and shrugs.  That's easy ...

                                 NADJA
                        Just that - on my next birthday - we'd 
                        all be together again.

           Kat's eyes fill. On the scrap of paper trembling in her fingers, 
           in a loopy scrawl - are 3 brief words.  Ten years in the making.

           I love you ...

           EXT. BRIDGE - ROADBLOCK - DAY

           ARMSTRONG and the others hit the bridge railing - panickedly
           scanning the surface of the water far below ... 

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Not a ripple.  Not a bubble.  Nothing.  Armstrong spins, looking 
           in every direction.  But all he can see for certain is that ...  

           Edwin A. Salt - formerly Eugene Chenkov - is gone.

           EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

           WET PANT-LEGS, emerging from the river, pause in the shallows.

           A SCUBA MASK and TANK splash into the water - followed by FINS  
           removed from feet raised out of the water one at a time ...   

           Those feet step onto shore and slip into a waiting pair of COMFY 
           SHOES while a hand retrieves a LOUIS VUITTON valise from a bush.

           The feet then proceed - strolling their owner out of frame.

                                 VOICE SINGING
                        'I am he as you are he as you are me 
                        and we are all together.  I am the 
                        Walrus - goo goo g'joob...'
