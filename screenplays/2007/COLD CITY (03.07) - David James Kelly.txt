                             THE DIE SONG
           INT.  THE MACHO LIZARD - DAY

           Cop bar way down Sunset.  An eye-fry spear of So-Cal 
           sunglare strafes two men at a back booth:

           ELMER FRINT (52), an LAPD Chief of Detectives badge and a 
           .38 Colt Police Positive ride his hip.

           DWIGHT MUELLER (47), pulls a bottle of Romilar CF cough 
           syrup from his jacket, knocks back a long shot, stifles a 
           codeine belch.

                                 DWIGHT
                        How many dead?

                                 ELMER
                        Officially, just the first one.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Unofficially?

                                 ELMER
                        Nine.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Fuck.

                                 ELMER
                        Man who loves his work.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Maybe his mother told him:  “If 
                        you can’t do something right, 
                        don’t do it at all.”

                                 ELMER
                        May-be.

           He slides a Polaroid of a YOUNG WOMAN across the table.

                                 ELMER (CONT’D)
                        This woman is the only one to see 
                        the killer and live.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Who took this?

                                 ELMER
                        Reason to believe the killer did.  
                        Found at the scene.  Beside body 
                        #9.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Got yourself an eyeball wit.

                                 ELMER
                        If we could find her.

                                 DWIGHT
                        She don’t wanna be body #10.

                                 ELMER
                        Killer “signs” each of the bodies.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Sounds like a spic gang tag.  You 
                        run it through R&I?

                                 ELMER
                        And the monicker file.  No hits.

                        Talk about the women.

                                 ELMER
                        All nine had records.  Multiple 
                        busts, solicitation--

                                 DWIGHT
                        --’cause who’s gonna miss a few 
                        diced whores?

                                 ELMER
                        They all matter...

                                 DWIGHT
                        ...or none of them matter.

           Elmer nods; Dwight nods; something old-enduring between 
           them.

                                 DWIGHT (CONT’D)
                        How old are they?

                                 ELMER
                        Were they, you mean.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Don’t ever tell me what I mean 
                        again, old shoe.

                                 ELMER
                        Twelve to forty-four.

                                 DWIGHT
                        twelve.

                        for their continued silence.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Borrowed fucken’ time.

                        Added to which, the public eye’s 
                        fixed on the Manson trial.  His 
                        antics are a useful smokescreen.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Mr. Gringo makes Manson look like 
                        righteous cat shit.

                                 ELMER
                        Our city fathers know another 
                        madman amuck would not bode well 
                        for the upcoming elections.  Our 
                        constituents could lose faith.  
                        Heads could roll.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Sounds like nine already have.

                                 ELMER 
                        The internal consensus is, this 
                        would best be handled by someone 
                        outside the Department...someone 
                        unencumbered by the slow modus of 
                        jurisprudence.

                                 DWIGHT

                        There’s a bounty.  We tapped the 
                        Benevolent Fund.  Guys kicked in;

           Dwight’s half over the table, stopped by Elmer’s .38 jam-
           cocked under his chin.

           Something breaks wide open inside both their eyes.  They 
           fall back, trembling and fury-fucked.

           chaser.  The juice starts to grab him; he grooves on 
           passing sights:

           Homeless Vietnam vets sucking T-bird short dogs, 
           comparing disabilities; Black Panthers waving pickets 
           “Off the Pigs!”; Manson groupie chicks carving swatstikas 
           in each other’s foreheads.

           He’s bad-tripping Bennies/Romilar.  He sucks air.  He 
           fist-rolls his eyes.  He wills the terrors away.  The 
           dead whores vanish.  Then:

           In the rearview:  an unmarked LAPD FELONY CAR tailing him 
           --that whip antenna a dead give-away.

           Dwight parks front of this ramshackle liquor mart in

                        us who thought you got a raw deal

           Dwight flicks his eyes off Walt, onto Fred.  Fred meets 
           the big man’s gaze evenly.

                                 DWIGHT

                        Noted.

           Dwight turns, walks back, gets in the Buick/peels out; 
           Fred/Walt dive in the F-Car, fishtail out of the alley 
           and in pursuit.

           INT./EXT.  BUICK (TRAVELING) - NEXT

           Dwight eye-flicks the rearview:  F-Car right on his tail.  
           Dwight spins a hard-sudden left.  Fred gets the red light 
           behind him.  Buys Dwight a lead of seconds.  He hurtles 
           past a NORM’S DINER, sees:

           TWO L.A. COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES walking from their 
           prowl car into the diner, the deputies a pair of big 
           black dudes with some swagger.  Dwight jerks the wheel--

           EXT.  NORM’S (PARKING LOT) - NEXT

           --and the Buick ka-thunks into the lot.  Dwight brodies 
           into a space, leaves the engine running, sprints for the 
           diner.

           INT.  NORM’S - NEXT

           Dwight makes the DEPUTIES at a back booth.  Their name 
           tags read:  JACE and WOMACK (both 30s).  Dwight rushes to 
           them feigning full-on freak out.

           the Buick out of the Norm’s lot.  He grins like in spite

           Dwight ducks inside this busted-ass strip joint in 
           Gardena.

           INT.  THE GLITTER DOME - NEXT

           Funereal veil of cigarette smoke.  Patrons with clammy 
           hands and cold-cut breath.

           On the bar TV:  Manson groupie chicks outside Hall of 
           Justice jail, heads shaved, Squeaky Fromme shrieking:  
           “You better watch your children because Judgement Day is 
           coming!”

           Dwight snags a rear table.  A B-GIRL (a young 21), in a 
           Catholic school girl uniform abmush-vamps him.

                                 B-GIRL

                        hey, ask anybody.

           She licks her lips.  Dwight sees her rainbow-colored 
           braces.

                        Now, hey...

           Lights dim.  A half-zonked LOUNGE BAND kicks up the 
           instrumental for Going Out of My Head.  A violet pin-spot 
           flares, star-lights a WOMAN center stage:

           VICKY LIND (46), in a rank rhinestone get-up; she starts 
           to sing, her voice all wet-ashes and generic vodka.

                                 VICKY
                        Well I think I’m goin’ out of my 
                        head / yes, I think I’m goin’ out 
                        of my head / over you, over you...

           Dwight pops 2 Bennies with a Romilar chaser.

                                 VICKY (CONT’D)
                        Well I want you to want me / I 
                        need you so badly / I can’t think 
                        of anything but you...

           Vicky/the club/the music --all transformed into a codeine-
           jacked funhouse in Dwight’s mind.  Vicky’s a pulsing 
           violet angel in slow-mo.

                                 VICKY (CONT’D)
                        I see you each morning but you 
                        just walk by / you don’t even know 
                        I exist...

           Dwight trips she’s singing just to HIM.  A tear works its 
           way down through his beard.  He brushes it away --BAM-- 
           his high boomerangs HARD.  He sees:

           NINE DEAD WHORES, NAKED-EVISCERATED, AT THE TABLES AROUND 
           HIM, THEIR FACES SNOW WHITE FROM MORGUE POWDER, UGLY 
           ZIPPER SUTURES ACROSS THEIR TORSOS, STARING AT HIM WITH 
           SOMEHOW SAD SMILES.

                                 VICKY (CONT’D)
                        ...out of my head over you / out 
                        of my head day and night / night 
                        and day and night/ wrong or 
                        right...

           Dwight reels; shit clatters.  The dead whores VANISH.  
           Dwight looks to the stage, sees Vicky as she REALLY is:

           Her bruised thighs.  Her nicotine teeth.  Her smile 
           sadder than the dead girls’.

                        heart / there’s no reason why my 
                        being shy should keep us apart...

           She starts to strip.  Patrons hump their tables.  Dwight 
           looks away.
           INT.  THE GLITTER DOME  (DRESSING ROOM) - NEXT

           Dwight stands outside a dressing room marked with an old 
           gold star.  His knock is almost shy.

                                 VICKY (O.S.)
                        Come on, yeah--

           Dwight opens the door.  Vicky, sitting there smoking; she 
           looks him up and down.

                                 VICKY (CONT’D)
                        Well, goddamn, then.

                                 DWIGHT
                        It’s important.  You know I 
                        wouldn’t come, it wasn’t.

                                 VICKY
                        Been some kinda while.

                        You stayin’?

           He shuts the door and sinks down on a ratty cot.

                                 VICKY (CONT’D)
                        Catch the show?

                                 DWIGHT
                        Just missed it.

                        Nice work if you can get it.  And 
                        I can still get it.

                                 DWIGHT
                        You look the same.

                        Kinda look?

                                 VICKY
                        Look like you used to get.  Like 
                        you’re sitting on something big.

                                 DWIGHT

                                 VICKY
                        So what’s to it?

                                 VICKY
                        I hear things.  The street girls 
                        whisper.  He’s got ‘em scared bad.

                        Elmer threatened to bust you to

                        Just for a week or two; just for

           Dwight yanks his wad; he skims c-notes.

                                 VICKY
                        What is this?  Some kinda half-ass 
                        penance?

                        You think this psycho might come

                        Dwight.  Is that what you think of 
                        me?  That I am?  I’m a singer, you

                        He scares you.  He reminds you of

                        --of Jane.

           Dwight grabs her wrists; forces eye-to-eye.

                                 DWIGHT
                        This bastard’s done nine already;

           He crumples back, just done.  Vicky, gentle as she can:

                                 VICKY
                        Still know how to talk your way 
                        into a woman’s heart.

           He proffers the money; she takes it.

                        Not the money; you do this thing, 
                        you might not come all the way out 
                        this time.  Or is that the way you

                                 DWIGHT
                        Not more.  Different.

                                 VICKY
                        But I was alive, Dwight.  I was 
                        alive and right there and I 
                        waited.  Waited for you to love 
                        me, then to let me in, then to 
                        come back.  I waited and longer 
                        than I wanna admit, ‘cause you’d 
                        think I was some kinda sucker.

                                 DWIGHT
                        I could never think that.

                                 VICKY
                        And here you are and all these 
                        years and it took more dead girls 
                        to bring you back through my door.

           Silence.  Their breathing.

           He grabs her, she grabs back; their hands go all over; 
           she falls back on the cot, she pulls off her shift, she 
           tears it, Dwight kicks off his shoes, he trips out of his 
           pants, pocket change goes flying, he falls down on top of 
           her still in his socks and she pulls him in.

           The clutch, they make small funny sounds; they taste each 
           other and kiss tears off each other and keep their eyes 
           open so they don’t miss any of it; they key a tempo, they 
           fuse hard; and when they come, close together, they fall 
           down together in the dark.

           INT.  THE GLITTER DOME (DRESSING ROOM) - NEXT

           Dwight, sitting up, dressing.  Vicky, smoking, sheets 
           pooled around her, watching him.

                                 VICKY
                        Your eyes still do that thing.

           He stands to leave.

                        Dwight?  When you find him...when

                        dark place, I want you to think of 
                        me.  Me loving you.  And waiting.

                        Will you do that?

           He leans over.  He so gently kisses her forehead;

                        I always did, Victoria Lind.

           EXT.  MARLOWE HOTEL - EVENING

           Dwight trudges toward his hotel, the Ithaca resting over 
           one shoulder.  Fat black clouds hang over Downtown.  Pre-
           storm winds whoop piss-grit around his ankles.

           INT.  MARLOWE HOTEL (LOBBY) - NEXT

           Dwight hits the lobby, sees:  WALT KOHNER, leaning 
           against the bank of tenant’s mailboxes, the Legion Gringo 
           murder book in one pot roast fist.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Where’s the choirboy?

                                 WALT
                        Had him go for coffee.

           Walt kicks Dwight in the balls.  Dwight eats floor.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Ya get your rocks off makin’ me 
                        look stupid in front a those porch 
                        monkeys?

           Dwight retches bile through a grin.

                                 DWIGHT
                        They’ll be tag-team Tootsie 
                        Rollin’ your wife tonight--

           Walt kicks Dwight’s kidneys.  Dwight shuts up and curls 
           up.  Walt steps on Dwight’s face, bears down:

                                 WALT
                        News flash, Flash:  You’re gonna 
                        find Gringo, then stand down.  I 
                        cancel his ticket, I reap the

                        You try’n shake me again, I will 
                        fuck your ass up so bad God 
                        himself will look away.

           Walt pulls his .38, jams the barrel to Dwight’s skull.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Now:  sound off we’re clear or 
                        I’ll paint this fuckin’ foyer with 
                        your brains and claim justifiable.

                        Address me as “sir,” you scrote.

                                 DWIGHT
                        --clear, sir.

           Walt drops the murder book on Dwight.  Dead whore 
           glossies skitter across linoleum.

                                 WALT
                        Clean up --you look like a fuckin’ 
                        dog’s breakfast.

           Walt holsters up.  He walks off whistling.

           INT.  MARLOWE HOTEL (DWIGHT’S BATHROOM) - NIGHT

           Dwight, naked in the tub, dinged up from Walt’s beat-
           down.  Murder book open before him.  Nine dead whores.  
           Just names on a page, now:

           Sarah Bryson.  Viola Robles.  Bertina Dorcas.  Mimi 
           Spangler.  Chandra Urzen.  Alma Beaudorf.  Gladys 
           Kupcinet.  Ora Kern.  And #9:  Michelle White.

           Dwight guzzles Romilar.  Words blip off the coroner’s 
           report:  “post-mortem sexual assault,”  “surgical 
           precision,” “wrongful death.”

           Dwight guzzles Romilar.  Crime scene pix/morgue glossies; 
           unspeakable subliminal flickers in his mind’s eye:  
           Severed limbs.  Arterial spray.  “Legion Gringo” carved 
           into each victim:  the monster’s signature, gore-writ.  
           Dwight jumps; he sees:

           BLOOD IN THE CRIME SCENE PIX GUSHING RED OUT OF THE 
           PHOTOS, ALL OVER HIM, FLOODING THE TUB, WATER GOING PINK 
           TO SCARLET, THE DEAD WHORES’ SILENT SCREAMS SOUNDING OFF 
           IN HIS HEAD ALL AT ONCE A SYMPHONY OF HELL.

           --AND:  the Polaroid of the one that got away, only 
           living witness to Legion Gringo, staring up at Dwight 
           from beneath the water.

           Her eyes say:  SAVE ME.

           CONTINUED:

           She’s the last thing Dwight sees as he plunges his head 
           under the water, screaming, praying for oblivion to take 
           him.

           OVER BLACK; --superimpose--

                                 TUESDAY   DECEMBER 30 

           INT.  MARLOWE HOTEL (DWIGHT’S BATHROOM) - PRE-DAWN

           Dwight, passed out in the tub.  Vomit dries in his lap.  
           Rain tick-taps the window.

           He bolts upright, limbs thrashing, sucking air like a man 
           drowning in blood.

           INT.  MARLOWE HOTEL (DWIGHT’S KITCHENETTE) - NEXT

           Dwight:  smoking, showered, combed, a clean shirt; at his 
           kitchen table.  He lays the Ithaca in a Vendome Flowers 
           box; the shotgun crinkle-crushes long-dead petals.

           He ties the box with some faded ribbon.  A low timpani 
           roll of thunder and Downtown’s a drab storm-smear.

           INT.  MARLOWE HOTEL (HALLWAY) - NEXT

           Dwight, flower box tucked under arm, knocks on a 
           NEIGHBOR’S DOOR.

           BELLAMY (61), in mystery-stained Fruit of the Looms, 
           opens up, yawns.

                                 BELLAMY
                        This better be good.  I was fuck-
                        dreaming Mary Poppins and she 
                        tasted like Peppermint Schnapps.

           INT./EXT.  MARLOWE HOTEL (LOBBY) - NEXT

           Bellamy exits the lobby, Dwight hangs back.  Bellamy goes 
           up to the F-CAR; Fred/Walt, looking like shit after their 
           all-night stake out.  They glance at Bellamy; glance away 
           bored.

           Bellamy takes out his dick, starts PISSING on the car; 
           Fred/Walt leap out, chase him down the sidewalk; Dwight 
           jolts out of the lobby in the opposite direction.

           EXT.  MARLOWE HOTEL - NEXT

           Dwight skates around the corner/skids to a halt:  FRED is 
           leaning against the Buick, in the drizzle, just grinning 
           his grin.

                        Mr. Mueller, I gotta say:  You’re 
                        the least disappointing legend 
                        I’ve ever met.

                                 DWIGHT
                        So what, we just stand here in the 
                        rain like two French faggots in a 
                        French film?

                                 FRED
                        All the same to you, I’d rather 
                        not.  All the same, I’d rather get 
                        started.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Started what?

                                 FRED
                        Legion Gringo.  We go as a team.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Kohner already thinks he’s gettin’ 
                        the bounty--

                                 FRED
                        I couldn’t care less about the 
                        money.

           Dwight searches his eyes for bullshit.  Finding none:

                                 DWIGHT
                        What’s your angle here, choirboy?

                                 FRED
                        Funny thing?  I was a choirboy.  
                        And an altar boy.  Went to 
                        Seminary school, studied with the 
                        Jesuits.  I was raised to believe 
                        in two things:  Good and Evil.  
                        But, see, I couldn’t spend my life 
                        hiding from evil, behind a pulpit 
                        or a turned-up collar.  I became a 
                        policeman and I saw --and I do 
                        believe-- that between Good and 
                        Evil, just maybe, lies Justice.
                               (beat)
                        A case like this...a killer like 
                        this:  That’s my Holy Grail.

                                 DWIGHT
                        So go get him.

                                 FRED
                        I don’t know how.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Ask your partner.

                                 FRED
                        Kohner’s washed up and dirty as 
                        the inside of a goat.  This is 
                        beyond him.

                                 FRED
                        That you’re erratic, unsound and 
                        feared on the streets.  That 
                        you’re convinced that if you can’t 
                        avenge these girls, you don’t 
                        deserve to live yourself.  That no 
                        one else in this man’s Department 
                        cares as much for absolute 
                        justice.
                               (beat)
                        I’ll bet everything on you.

                                 DWIGHT
                        I don’t work well with others.

                                 FRED
                        Then Kohner and I stay on you like 
                        a tin-can tail.  Gringo slips 
                        through the cracks and more girls 
                        take a ride on the pale horse.

           Dwight snaps/lunges; Fred kicks out his legs.  Dwight 
           eats pavement.  Fred gets his .38 in Dwight’s face.

                                 DWIGHT
                        You fucken’ virgin, you know shit-

                        Fuck you, Nancy Drew--

                        We cherish the same thing above 
                        all else:  Innocence.

                                 DWIGHT
                        You cunt, you’ll make a groovy

                                 FRED
                        We hate the same thing above all 
                        else:  Those who defile it.

                                 DWIGHT
                        I just want the money.

                                 FRED
                        Then who is Jane?

           Dwight snarls, rears up; Fred cocks the .38 an inch from 
           his eye.

                                 DWIGHT
                        How many men you shot weren’t made 
                        a paper?

                        You ditch Kohner and this kicks 
                        out, you’ll be back in a bluesuit 
                        rousting piss bums on the Row.

                                 FRED
                        All the more incentive we get the 
                        bad guy.

           The two of them locked eye to eye under this cold weeping 
           sunrise.

                                 DWIGHT
                        You roll with me, it’s the 
                        boonies, the bad bush, the dark 
                        dream of the heart.  I’m gonna 
                        bury this Gringo cocksucker for 
                        all time.  It won’t be pretty and 
                        it won’t be Hoyle.  We go as long 
                        as we draw breath.  We go until 
                        end-of-watch.

           Fred slowly eases down the .38’s hammer, steps off 
           Dwight, offers his hand, helps him up.

                                 FRED
                        End-of-watch.

           Their hands stay clasped a beat, framing the moment.

                                 DWIGHT
                        When’d you grow big enough balls 
                        to think you could run this down?

                                 FRED
                        Last night.  In my evening prayer.

                        I’d appreciate it if you didn’t 
                        take that name in vain.

           Fred pushes his glasses up his nose and grins:

           Dwight jams the Polaroid of The One That Got Away in a

                        Tell me why.

                                 DWIGHT
                        It’s in her eyes.

           Dwight taps the Polaroid.  Fred peers through the blur 
           and sees the girl’s dope-pinned eyes.

                                 FRED

           Dwight/Fred stand at the front gate of Kim’s palatial 
           estate high in the Hollywood Hills.  Fred presses the 
           visitor’s buzzer.  A VIETNAMESE-ACCENTED VOICE crackles 
           back at him:

           Before Dwight can answer:  the main gate grinds back, 
           revealing:  A HALF-DOZEN VIETNAMESE BODYGUARDS, holding 
           their AK-47s at port arms.

           EXT.  HANOI HILTON - NEXT

           Bodyguards march Dwight/Fred through canopy jungle 
           imported from ‘Nam.  Mr. Kim’s palatial villa, The Hanoi 
           Hilton, is glimpsed through rustles of Nipi palm.

                        duking it out with French Intel 
                        for control of the poppy fields.

           Frangipani blossoms flutter down around them; jungle rats

           INT.  HANOI HILTON  (SOLARIUM) - NEXT

           Bodyguards usher Dwight/Fred inside.  Fred wipes steam 
           off his glasses, pushes them up his nose.

           Stained glass windows depict Kama Sutra fuck-tableaus.  A 
           Victrola cranks out an Edith Piaf lover’s lament.

           A DOZEN YOUNG GIRLS, late-teens; an All-American white 
           bread harem; clad in silk scanties.  Glazed eyes/wan 
           smiles; they hang on every word of THE MAN in the center 
           of the room:

           LE VAN KIM (57), sipping Pernod.  His accent is musical, 
           cultured French.

                        Gentlemen.  A tantalizing

                        a most dreary afternoon.

                        How could I possibly forget?  The 
                        young lady you so impetuously 
                        relieved from my company was quite 
                        popular with my patrons.  Losing 
                        her was cause for great woe, to 
                        both my heart and purse.

                        To be sure.

           They trade eye-ball fuck-yous.  Fred steps up.

                                 FRED
                        We’re looking for a girl.

                                 LE VAN KIM
                        Then we are most well-met,

                        Pity.  I had hoped yours was a

                                 FRED
                        The girl is an eyeball witness to 
                        a string of murders.

           Dwight pulls the Polaroid, flashes it.

                        from star witness to chop suey.

           Dwight eye-flicks the HAREM.  A beautiful, raven-haired 
           girl flinches on “chop suey.”

           She is:  MOONBEAM (e20s).  Dwight doesn’t let on he’s hip 
           to her reaction.

                                 LE VAN KIM
                        The feminine form is God’s chef du 
                        oeuvre.  One who would desecrate 
                        such perfection is a most

                        Then help us find her.

                        She was one of mine, oui.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Was?

                        I dismissed her a fortnight ago.  
                        Her charms were manifold but she 
                        possessed a penchant for 
                        narcotics; an intolerable vice 
                        amongst my flock.

                                 FRED

                        Your tone betrays distaste.

                                 FRED
                        Probably because I find you 
                        distasteful.

                                 LE VAN KIM
                        The harem tradition extends time 
                        out of mind, from Venetian 
                        ambassadors to the Turkish sultans 
                        of old.

                                 FRED
                        It’s an abomination.

                                 LE VAN KIM
                        My palais shelters my flock from 
                        such as the man you seek.  They 
                        want for nothing, they require 
                        only love, and desire nothing but 
                        to return it.  Your happiness is 
                        their happiness...

           Kim snaps his fingers come-hither style.  TWO GIRLS break 
           off the HAREM, zombie-drift over to Fred.

                        ...why not make them happy, 
                        sergent?

           Fred eases the girls off;

                                 FRED
                        I’m married.

                                 LE VAN KIM
                        She must be a great beauty to 
                        inspire such loyalty.  How I would 
                        love to help her realize her full 
                        potential.

                                 FRED
                        What did you say?

           Fred bullet-charges Kim.  Bodyguards raise their AKs.  
           Everybody freezes.  Dwight indicates Fred with a head-
           tilt.  He shrugs, goofs on Fred:

                                 DWIGHT
                        Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

           A couple pretty long seconds.  Kim smiles.  Dwight 
           smiles.  Fred steams.  Kim flips the bodyguards a signal; 
           they lower their AKs.

                        For old time’s sake, a name and 
                        we’re gone.

                                 LE VAN KIM
                        In that regard I can proffer no 
                        assistance.  I christen each 
                        member of my flock anew.  It helps 
                        in breaking old habits and 
                        tiresome inhibitions.

                        That name mean anything to you?

                                 LE VAN KIM
                        I know it as the nom de guerre of

           Dwight up-ticks his chin at the HAREM.

                                 DWIGHT
                        I wouldn’t mind partaking in some 
                        delights myself.

           Dwight forces on a sleazoid grin.

                                 DWIGHT (CONT’D)
                        With the Sultan’s permission.

           Kim returns Dwight’s sleazoid grin genuine.

                                 LE VAN KIM
                        Your obstreperous sergent is not 
                        one of the world as you and I.  We 
                        make no apologies for our base 
                        appetites, no?

                                 DWIGHT
                        Life’s too short for apologies.

           Fred’s shocked still.  Kim produces a handkerchief.  
           HAREM falls into line; they stare at Dwight like sex-
           orphans sizing up potential parents.

                                 LE VAN KIM 
                        When the Sultan pleased to choose 
                        a damsel, they would abandon all 
                        modesty, indulge in all breeds of 
                        wanton carriage to earn his 
                        affection...

           Kim lays the handkerchief over Dwight’s palm.

                                 LE VAN KIM (CONT’D)
                        ...when he had chosen, he dropped 
                        a handkerchief at the feet of his 
                        femme, and the true revels began.  
                        So shall you:  Choose:

           Dwight walks the HAREM.  He stops at the last girl:  
           MOONBEAM.  He drops the handkerchief; it see-saws down 
           onto one perfect pale freckled foot.  Moonbeam smiles.

                                 DWIGHT
                        --You.

                                 LE VAN KIM
                        Charmante!  She will make your 
                        “Lazarus” rise again and again.  
                        Take her; teach her --fuck her.

           Dwight nods like his head’s on a stick; Moonbeam takes 
           his hand.  Fred blocks their exit, stone furious.

                                 FRED

           Dwight bulls past him, Moonbeam on his arm, as--

           Edith Piaf sings them out:

                        Mon amant m’a quitte’ mais je vois

           INT.  HANOI HILTON (BEDCHAMBER) - NEXT

           Frolicking plastic cherubs.  Lysol-come stench under 
           Jasmine incense.  A gilt-edged mirror above the pink-
           frilly four-poster bed; on the bed:

           MOONBEAM, a low-rent Lolita, rubbing her thighs together.

                                 MOONBEAM
                        Name...your...fuck...

           She TRIES for sultry seductress.  She GETS forlorn play-
           acting.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Don’t talk like that.

                                 MOONBEAM
                        Why not?  You like a little girl 
                        lost?  You wanna be the Big Bad 
                        Wolf?

                        No.  But she smiled.

           He blows her a kiss.  Evangeline giggles, catches it, 
           sends one after him out the door.

           EXT.  HANOI HILTON - DAY

           Main gate grinds back.  Dwight steps out.  Fred by the 
           Buick, cold-eyed.

           CHAPTER PRESIDENT BILLY BATTIS (49), steps up:  Smallest 
           dude in the room --and by far the scariest.

                        This here’s a private social club,

           under a blood orange sun.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Let’s say I wanna join.  What’d I 
                        hafta do?  Go on welfare and suck 
                        a tailpipe.

           Bikers stand in unison, their mamas hopping off their 
           laps.  A pair of bikers by the POOL TABLE thud their 
           leaded cues softly on their palms.

                                 BILLY
                        I don’t think you know where you 
                        are, mother-dog.

                        lookin’ for her.  Really lookin’.

           Grumble-rumbles from the bikers.  Billy holds up a hand; 
           gets instant silence.

                                 BILLY
                        We might could have somethin’ in

                        Not in the biblical sense.  What’s 
                        your stake in her?

           Billy eye-signals the pool table bikers.  They swing 
           their cues at the back of Dwight’s knees.  Dwight flails 
           forward; Billy catches his head, jerks his chin up.

                                 BILLY
                        Problem solved.

           Dwight spits in his face.  Billy head-butts Dwight; blood 
           sprays from his nose.  Dwight goes for the Colt; Pool 
           Table Biker cues it out of his hand; a MAMA kicks it 
           under a table.

           Two Bikers hoist Dwight sag-standing.  Billy sidles up.

                        wake up, or if you’re just crazy 
                        as a shit-house rat.  Ain’t no 
                        never-mind to me.  I killed crazy-
                        men before.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Where is she?

           Pool Table Bikers thwap Dwight’s ribs with their cues.

                                 BILLY
                        I believe I was speakin’.
                               (beat)
                        Little Miss Moffat had pussynality 
                        to spare.  I made her for a stone 
                        junkie quick enough --trouble was, 
                        she was also a stone cocktease.  
                        She ran up a free taste tab of my 
                        dope and still wouldn’t get off 
                        some leg.  Before we could teach 
                        her the way of the snake, she 
                        lammed with my personal stash.

           Billy unbuckles his studded BIKE CHAIN BELT.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Bein’ you’re a friend of the 
                        family, maybe you could enlighten 
                        me as to that bitch booster’s 
                        whereabouts.

           Dwight gags blood out his nose; clears his mouth:

                                 DWIGHT
                        You stink.

                                 MOTORCYCLE MAMA (O.S.)
                        Man, that is one wiggy cat!

           Billy sighs like his gerbil just shit the bed.

                        World of Hurt, brother...

           He slides off the chain belt, cocks his arm way back.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        ...ticket for one--

           Dwight shuts his eyes, gets ready for it.  BLAM!  
           Everybody jumps/spins/ducks.

           FRED, holding the Ithaca, just shot the ceiling.  Blasted 
           tile bits drift down around him; he chambers a shell.

                                 FRED
                        Let him go.  Or all you cats take 
                        a permanent skid.

           Billy nods.  Bikers release Dwight; he slumps down the 
           side of the bar, looks up at Fred.

                                 DWIGHT
                        ...was that really five minutes?

           Dwight grins bloody; Fred grins back.  His glasses start 
           a sweat-slide down his nose; his hand automatically comes 
           off the pump to push them back up.

                                 BILLY
                        Take ‘em.

           Pool table biker swings his cue.  Fred ducks.  Cue misses 
           Fred, hits the other pool table biker in the throat; he 
           falls, croaks, gurgles.

           Fred slams the Ithaca’s butt into the pool cue biker’s 
           jaw, drops him.  Dwight launches himself up at Billy, 
           batter-rams him against the bar.

           A biker throws Yukon Jack in Fred’s face, blinds him.  He 
           drops the Ithaca.  Biker wades in; Fred punches blind.

           Billy spins; he/Dwight hit the wall; Nazi helmets tumble 
           off a shelf, rain on their heads.  A Motorcycle Mama war-
           cries, leaps on Fred’s back.

           He spins, momentum carries the mama airborne, right into 
           the Yukon Jack biker, toppling them in a hairy heap.

           Billy squirms free/scampers, grabs up the Colt from the 
           floor.  Dwight charges him, slips on blood and beer.

           Billy drags himself up the side of the bar with one arm, 
           levels the Colt at Dwight’s head with the other.

           FRED GRABS BILLY’S ARM ON THE BAR, SLAMS THE PALM FLAT, 
           PULLS A SWITCHBLADE, STABS THROUGH BILLY’S HAND, PINNING 
           HIM TO THE BAR.

           Billy’s girl-scream takes the fight out of his club.  He 
           drops the Colt; Dwight reflex-catches it.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

           Fred covers the room with his .38.  Dwight jams the Colt 
           barrel up Billy’s nose.

                                 FRED
                        Where were we?

           Fred twists the switchblade; bone-metal squeal.

                        hand, man, I need my hand to ride.

           Dwight nods.  Fred jerks the switchblade out.  Billy 
           slides to the floor like a bag of Crisco.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)

           Dwight/Fred turn, find the owner of the voice:  A 
           humongous biker by the commode, missed the whole fight:

           HANK MOONJEANS (24), acne scars and tree-trunk arms.

           Dwight grabs his necktie and drags him out the door.

           INT.  SCHWAB’S - AFTERNOON

           Ingenues spin dress-hiked lazy on their stools, making 
           Lana Turner eyes at no one at all.

           Dwight/Fred camped out, a back table, a FREE PRESS open 
           before them.

           Dwight’s head tipped back, napkin tufts plug his bloody 
           nose.

                                 FRED
                        That’s not how you stop a bloody

                        stop a bloody nose?

           Fred digs in his pocket and pulls out a QUARTER.

                                 FRED
                        Put this between your lower lip 
                        and lower teeth.

                        My hand to God.

           Dwight takes the QUARTER, sticks it between his lower 
           lip/lower teeth; it juts like a hood ornament.

           Fred pulls out the SWITCHBLADE, wipes off Billy’s blood.

                        Besides, my wife makes a “jamming”

                                 DWIGHT
                        Yeah?

                        Jammin’.

           They crack up.  These two guys, sidearms and 
           switchblades, beaten and bloody, laughing their asses 
           off.  They look a little crazy.  They draw stares.  They 
           don’t fucking care.

           EXT.  SCHWAB’S - DUSK

           Dwight/Fred hit the sidewalk, duck in the Buick.  Sky 
           like lead; rain bullet-pissing the city.

                                 DWIGHT
                        We crap out the Vogue, we hit Six

                        Least now we know where our killer

                        Why couldn’t the fucker read 
                        Peanuts?

           Static/chatter out of Dwight’s radio in the glove-box.

           Dwight’s face goes black as the dark side of the moon.

                                 DWIGHT
                        182nd and Crenshaw, she said?

                                 FRED
                        Yeah, why?  You know it?
           EXT.  THE GLITTER DOME - NEXT

           Arc lights, bluesuits, plainclothes, SID, media, 
           rubberneckers; an LAPD ghetto bird flashes the scene with 
           its belly lights.

           Dwight white-knuckles the Buick to a stop at a saw-horse 
           barricade, jolts out, Fred trying to keep up.  A rookie 
           BLUESUIT tries to hold him back.

                                 ROOKIE BLUESUIT
                        Police personnel, on--

           Dwight hurls the Bluesuit to the ground.  Fred badges the 
           two of them a swath to the Dome.

                                 FRED
                        Let us through, please, a little 
                        room, folks--

           Siren-scream.  Dwight/Fred pass the CORONER, dictating to 
           his ASSISTANT:

                                 CORONER
                        ...placing the victim’s time of 
                        death approximately between three 
                        and six AM this morning...

           Flash-bulb flares line-drive Dwight’s eyes.  He gets the 
           front doors.  ELMER, setting up a chain of command, WALT 
           KOHNER beside him.

                                 WALT

                        Fuck you, Judas.

                        She’s not dead--

           He rushes the doors.  Elmer catches him f lush in the 
           doorway.

                                 ELMER
                        You don’t want to see this.

                                 FRED
                        Sir, if I may--

                                 DWIGHT
                        Just tell me she’s not dead.

           Dwight breaks free, lunges for Walt.  Short, savage 
           scuffle.  Bluesuits pry them apart.

                                 ELMER
                        Listen to me now, son.

           Elmer takes hold of Dwight, eye to eye and gently--

                                 ELMER (CONT’D)
                        It’s over.

                        Not over, nothing’s over, don’t

                                 ELMER
                        He wanted her found.  He’s 
                        laughing at us.

                                 DWIGHT
                        He did her ‘cause I’m close.  Yank

                                 ELMER
                        I can’t contain this.  The world 
                        sniffs blood.

                        We’ll take care of her.  You go

                                 ELMER
                        We can’t save them, Dwight.  Not

                        I’m so sorry.

           He lets go, he turns head down, starts to walk off.

           Elmer stops; he half-turns back.  Rain washes away his 
           tears.  He manages an old-man’s nod.

                                 ELMER
                        you got your day.

           Dwight charges past him for the Glitter Dome.  Elmer 
           snags his arm and pulls him close.

                                 ELMER (CONT’D)
                        But, and I am saying this as your 
                        friend:  You do not need to see 
                        what’s in there.

           Dwight wrenches free and inside, Fred just behind him.

           INT.  THE GLITTER DOME (BACKSTAGE) - NEXT

           A gauntlet of STRIPPERS.  Dwight walks their midst, Fred 
           beside him.  The strippers lower their eyes as they pass.

           The DRESSING ROOM with the old gold star.  Fred badges a 
           BLUESUIT.  Dwight eases the door open; his fingers raise 
           tiny black clouds of fingerprint dust.

           INT.  THE GLITTER DOME (DRESSING ROOM) - NEXT

           Dwight/Fred step inside.  It’s dark.  There’s blood-
           stink.  They see it at the same time:

                                 FRED
                        Jesus wept...

           VICKY, naked on the cot, splayed out, ripped up the 
           middle, the cot a swamp of blood and HER EYES ARE GONE.

           Bloody-hand scrawled on the vanity mirror:

                                  open season on whores

           Dwight watches a FLY land in one of her empty eye 
           sockets.

           He punches the mirror.  Bluesuits pile into the room.  
           Try to pull him out.  He keeps punching.  Strippers 
           scream.  Fred calls his name over and over.  Dwight 
           punches the world into a billion bloody shards.  

           INT.  ST. VIBIANA’S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

           Dwight comes to sneezing at incense.  He’s slumped in a 
           pew before a bank of votive candles.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

           The congregation:  piss bums, dopers on the nod, blood

           Fred, lighting candles one by one.

                                 FRED
                        The Jesuits used to say:  Better 
                        to light a candle than curse the 
                        darkness.  The flame is a prayer, 
                        that helps all lost souls get to 
                        heaven.  For our girls.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Why’d you bring me here?

                                 FRED
                        I come here every day.  At end-of-
                        watch.  It’s peaceful; it’s a 
                        place of love and forgiveness.  
                        It’s not home and it’s not the 
                        Job.  It’s a place I can just Be.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Do you “pray?”

                                 FRED
                        Sure.

                                 FRED
                        Strength.

           Fred lights 9 candles.  He pauses.  Lights a 10th.

                                 FRED (CONT’D)

                        Summer of ‘61.  Young girls going 
                        gone.  Killer kept them.  Did bad 
                        things.  When he was, finished, 
                        he’d go out, buy them a nice new 
                        dress and bury them alive.  He 
                        wanted them pretty when he put ‘em 
                        under.  Press baptized him

                        white-shirts for a task force; 
                        they kicked loose one man, 
                        detached duty.  He chose the only 
                        other badge fool enough to care 
                        and gave me my catechism:  “They

                        and luck like the devil himself;

                        So I made Jane my daughter.  I

                        her...she struck fire in my heart.

                        needle, hardballin’ flake and 
                        Mexican brown.  First I thought

                        couldn’t see when I was straight, 
                        made me some better cop.  But it 
                        was bullshit --I was runnin’, from 
                        HER.

                        We caught a break.  Ernie Moran.  
                        Panty-sniffer, peeping tom, seemed 
                        the type might be movin’ into the 
                        Big Leagues.  Found him in 
                        MacArthur Park with a bloody sock 
                        that matched Jane’s...and he was 
                        covered in mud, like he’d been 
                        digging...

                        Elmer gave me the interrogation.  
                        I’d been up three days, was 
                        cruising thirty thousand feet on 
                        the dope.  I worked him non-stop.  
                        I grew old in that room.  And in 
                        the end, goddamn me, I broke him.  
                        He confessed.  And I fucking wept.
                               (beat)
                        Then I asked him the last 
                        question, the only question, the 
                        Jane question:  Where is she?  And 
                        he started to laugh; he laughed at 
                        me so I hit him.  He kept 
                        laughing; I kept hitting.  Before 
                        they pulled me off, I’d beat him 
                        to death, so stoned I didn’t feel 
                        I’d broke every bone in my hands.

                        he told Jane my name when he put

                        I couldn’t fucking die.  Because 
                        of HER.  I knew then what would 
                        hurt worse than death:  I quit the 
                        shit cold and started my tour in

           INT.  FRED’S HOUSE (DEN) - NEXT

           Dwight comes to/de-gums his eyes.  TV flicker-glow 
           reveals:  Fred, asleep in an easy chair, his 2-year old 
           DAUGHTER held in his arms.

           On TV:  Sesame Street, Gordon & The Anything Muppets 
           singing:  Consider Yourself At Home.  Fred’s DAUGHTER 
           sees Dwight’s awake.

           She laughs; she gurgles, she waves.  Fred stirs.  Dwight 
           holds a bloodied hand to his lips and goes “shhhhh...”  
           She gives him this funny smile then drifts off.

           Dwight does, too.

           Dwight comes to.  Fred’s sitting beside him, like on

                        My father was a drunk.  My mother 
                        tried to leave him and he put her 
                        head through a plate-glass window 
                        to “ugly her up,” so she could 
                        never re-marry.  It worked.  She

                        Junkie-thin and sweating in twenty 
                        below.  Told Boyle to give him 
                        money.  Boyle tried to tell this 
                        kid where he was, that there was 
                        no money, but there was soup, and 
                        a bed, and fellowship.  That this

                        And he died in my arms.  Looking

                        what I saw in his eyes was Fear.

           Fred barrels the Buick down a ghost-town quiet Hollywood.

           Dwight throws a glance of some slight consent.

                        You should pick a place.  Forget 
                        where she could be.  Her body, I 
                        mean.  Pick a place you think 
                        she’d like and where she’d rest in 
                        peace and go there and say 
                        goodbye.  I think she’d like that.

           Dwight/Fred tromp down sidewalk stairs into this basement 
           shop.  Mondo bizarro:  B-movie memorabilia, occult 
           oddities; Apollo moon rocks, wolfsbane, a taxidermist-

           WINDOM (40s), the proprietor, smoking a hookah.

                                 WINDOM
                        Journeymen, welcome to my outlet 
                        of the occult, my bazaar of the

                                 WINDOM
                        Mr. Windom was my father.  I’m 
                        Windom.

                        Like to ask you some questions.

                                 WINDOM
                        My late wife was clairvoyant.  
                        Upon her departing our dimension, 
                        she willed her psychic endowment 
                        to me.  Indulge me?

           Fred shrugs.  Dwight rolls his eyes.  Windom zones out, a 
           hand to his forehead, eyes closed.

                        business.

                                 FRED
                        You could say that.

                                 WINDOM
                        There’s been a death.  More than 
                        one.

           Fred/Dwight’s eyes narrow ever so slight.

                                 FRED
                        More than a few.

                                 WINDOM
                        You’re after a great and terrible 
                        man.

                                 FRED

           INT.  SIX DEMON BAG (BACK ROOM) - NEXT

           Dwight/Fred hunched over a cluttered counter; room flick-
           buzzes with black light.  WINDOM, with a jeweler’s care, 
           lays out a very old GRAPHIC NOVEL.  Style-wise, it’s a 
           crude Gothic forbear of the Amazing Stories/Thrilling 
           Tales variety.

           The title page reads (in German):  THE DIE SONG, VOL. 1, 
           CHRONICLE 7.

                                 WINDOM
                        All answers to come from The Die 
                        Song bein with the question of 
                        Leopold Braendis...

           With tweezers, Windom opens to the first page.  As he 
           tells the tale, he turns the pages, the muted, blood-
           tinted images unfolding concurrent.

                        Legend would have it he was born 
                        on All Saint’s Day, 1911, during a 
                        Black Mass held in the Harz 
                        mountains.

                        His father was a Count, his mother 
                        a chambermaid of his employ.  
                        Young Braendis was one of many 
                        bastards, denied his father’s 
                        patronage, banished to the 
                        servant’s quarters where he was 
                        reviled by the other “low 
                        children.”  He grew fond of 
                        trapping rodents; conducing 
                        “experiments” on them.  His 
                        younger sister, Viola, was his 
                        assistant  --until her 
                        disappearance in 1921.  Her body 
                        was never found, though soon after 
                        Braendis seemed to lose interest 
                        in rodents...

                        Braendis developed an extensive 
                        interior fantasy life, complete 
                        with an alter ego.

                        Whom he imbued with all the

                        Physical strength, an iron will, 
                        derring-do.  When he was Braendis, 
                        he was a whelp and a bed-wetter.  
                        When he was Legion, at night, 
                        always at night, he became 
                        invincible and would venture the 
                        countryside to sate his dark 
                        appetites.

                        They were the only kind who would 
                        consort with him, so vile was his 
                        bearing.  They offered brief 
                        physical release, but it was never 
                        enough; he grew to hate them, the 
                        power they held over him.  And his 
                        urges began to consume him.  
                        Whore’s laughter, real and 
                        imagined, haunted him.  His soul’s 
                        schism grew; Legion began to 
                        consume Leopold.

                        gladdened his heart and pierced 
                        his soul.

                        believed he heard was her soul.  
                        That her soul was singing to HIM, 
                        begging him to free her from her 
                        pitiful existence.  This sound, 
                        that only he could hear, he called 
                        The Die Song.

                        He killed her.

                        Butchered her by moonlight.  Her 
                        Die Song ringing in his ears, he 
                        rushed back to his room to 
                        chronicle the occasion.  And, wet-
                        black with her blood, he gave 
                        birth to the first issue of The 
                        Die Song.  It, and each issue 
                        thereafter, inked in its victims 
                        blood.

           Windom tweezer-turns pages; tiny dried blood motes twist-
           float up off the pages.  We see “Legion Gringo” 
           eviscerating dozens of prostitutes in World War II era 
           German provincial settings.

                        The novels were an open secret in

                        swooned.  It was something of a 
                        coup to own a Braendis original.  
                        There were those who thought him a 
                        genius.  Hitler was rumored to be

           Watchband.

           Dwight/Fred grab seats in the back, eye-scan the crowd.

                                 FRED
                        Nobody who looks like our girl.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Little early yet to be kicking the 
                        gong.

           On the screen:  Aldo Ray as LAPD SGT. WALT LORIMER and 
           MICHAEL EVANS as SGT. MATT TWEEDY.  

                                 ALDO RAY
                        “It’s these longhairs, Matt...I 
                        just don’t like ‘em.”

                                 MICHAEL EVANS
                        “Me either, Walt.  But maybe, 
                        through communication, we can 
                        understand them.”

           Aldo as “Walt” jukes Fred;

                                 FRED
                        What’s your static with Kohner?

                                 DWIGHT
                        We did a Vice tour back in ‘52.  
                        He’d shake down whores for their 
                        cash, then bust ‘em anyway, let 
                        ‘em catch a beatin’ from their 
                        Daddy-O’s.  I tried to call him 
                        off, he said go fuck myself.
                               (beat)
                        Everybody but Walt knew his old 
                        lady was spendin’ a lot of time at 
                        a jazz joint over on Newton.  And 
                        a few horizontal mornings with a 
                        side man who tromboned at said 
                        joint.  I tried to warn him off 
                        one last time.  He went on his 
                        merry way.  So I snapped some 
                        shots of Mrs. Kohner at her 
                        trombone lessons and put ‘em up in 
                        every muster room in the city.

                                 FRED
                        Good Lord.  Did he retaliate?

                                 DWIGHT
                        Who you think leaked the Moran 
                        snuff to the Grand Jury?

           CONTINUED:

           Dwight chugs Romilar.  Fred taps his toes to Chocolate 
           Watchband.  Dwight shoots him a look.  Fred quits his toe-
           tapping.

           INT.  THE VOGUE THEATER - AFTERNOON

           Five hours/3 screenings of Riot on the Sunset Strip 
           later.  Dwight/Fred watch longhair shenanigans with eyes 
           dull as cold gravy.

           A GIRL walks down the aisle past them; they perk up; 
           she’s the right age/right type; she eye-scans the crowd.  
           She spots a FAT GEEK (30s) munching popcorn down front.

           THE GIRL plops down next to THE GEEK.  They confer.  Her 
           head disappears in his lap.  As he head drops, 
           Dwight/Fred catch a glimpse:  her junkie pallor.  her 
           blonde hair.  her dope pinned eyes.  --AND THEY KNOW HER--

           They stand up at the same time.

                                 FRED
                        How you want to play it?

                                 DWIGHT
                        Soft and not spook her.  You run 
                        interference, I get her in the 
                        car.

           They split up, walk to the front of the theater from the 
           two parallel main aisles.  They get to her row.  They 
           walk towards the center.  Dwight signals Fred to hang 
           back.  Dwight edges his way to the center of the row.

           THE GIRL’S head, bobbing up and down in the GEEK’S LAP.

                                 GEEK
                        Yeh, baby, you could suck milk 
                        from a crowbar...

           Dwight watches this sad fucking spectacle; he thrums like 
           a bull pissing nails.  He chokes out:

                                 DWIGHT
                        Kathy.

           She looks up at him:  KATHY MOFFAT (18), wheat-belt 
           beauty on the skids; dope and running for her life taking 
           their toll.

           Her eyes hay-wire.  She comes up swinging  A PAIR OF 
           HANDCUFFS CUFFED TO HER RIGHT WRIST; the cuff slices 
           Dwight’s forehead.

           Dwight falls, eats armrest; Kathy scrambles over him, 
           tears out of the theater.  Fred behind her in a dead run.
           EXT.  CITY STREET - NEXT

           Kathy running, full-out, kicking her shoes off.  Fred 
           behind her, gaining.  Dwight huffing/puffing in the rear.

           She turns down an alley --dead end.  She hits the chain 
           link fence at the end, starts to climb; Fred pulls her 
           down.

                                 FRED
                        Miss, it’s alright--

           She kicks him in the balls.  Fred dipsy-doodles into a 
           trash pile.  Dwight rounds the alley, sees Kathy on the 
           fence, she’s almost over, he’s got her leg, she falls, he 
           catches her.

                                 KATHY
                        Lemme go, cocksucker--

           She fights like a rattlesnake in a trash bag.  He holds 
           her.  She spits/snots/sobs all over him.  He holds her.

                                 DWIGHT
                        It’s alright you’re okay you’re 
                        safe now I’ve got you it’s alright 
                        just there now there...

           His big arms bind her.  She sobs her fight out spent.  
           Her dangling feet with pink-painted toes gently scrap 
           asphalt.

           They spin in this slow-grief waltz.

           INT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (ROOM 909) - NEXT

           Faded-glory hotel at the ass end of the Sunset Strip.  
           Fred opens the door to the room.  Dwight steps past him, 
           Kathy in his arms.  He lays her on the bed.

           Fred shuts/chains the door.  Kathy comes around a bit, 
           sits up, draws her knees under her chin.

                                 FRED
                        You don’t have to be afraid.

                                 KATHY
                        The fuck’re you guys?

                                 FRED
                        I’m Sergeant Melba, LAPD.  This is 
                        Mr. Mueller.

                                 DWIGHT
                        We been looking for you.

                                 KATHY
                        Are you Vice?  This is a humbug 
                        roust--

                        We know what you saw.

                                 KATHY
                        I didn’t see shit, man --what I 
                        saw?

                                 DWIGHT
                        Tell us about The Die Song.

           She’s off the bed like a shot, huddling in the corner, 
           snared-rabbit, terrified.

                                 KATHY
                        He sent you to find me to kill me 
                        didn’t he didn’t he fuck--

                        Man that tried to hurt you? 

                                 DWIGHT
                        We’re gonna put him under the 
                        world.

           Her eyes flick back/forth; her eyes take on this freaky 
           glow.  Her smile comes on WRONG.

                                 KATHY
                        --listen--

           She wipes her nose on her sleeve;

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        I need somethin’, maybe you guys 
                        could get it for me?  If you could 
                        just score for me, just a 
                        taste...it’s been two days and I’m 
                        hurtin’ for certain.

                                 FRED
                        You’re coming down.  You’re going 
                        to stay down.

                                 KATHY
                        I don’t, I don’t got any money, 
                        but I can make you feel good.  
                        Real good.  Both of you.  How you 
                        like it?  You wanna double dip me?

                                 DWIGHT
                        How old are you?

                                 KATHY
                        I’m, I’m still tight, I promise.

           Dwight grabs her wrists, forces eye-to-eye.  Her sleeves 
           hike up.  Fred winces at the TRACK MARKS.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                        me, fuck me, just please--

           He pulls his Romilar, holds it up to her lips.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Drink some a this, it’ll level you 
                        out.

                                 KATHY
                        --you know about it?

           Dwight’s sleeve hikes up; his forearm touches Kathy’s.  
           She sees his OLD TRACK MARKS.  They understand each 
           other.  She sips Romilar.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Better, now?

                                 KATHY
                        No, like shit.

           She sips some more.  Her eyes go from dope-jag to codeine-
           cruise.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Give me your hand.

           He gently inspects her HANDCUFFED WRIST.

                                 FRED
                        Then my key should work.

           It does.  Fred pops the cuffs off.  Dwight briefly 
           inspects them, pockets them.

                                 FRED (CONT’D)
                        Is that better, Kathy?

                        Sorry about your balls, Fred.

           Fred blanches.  Dwight smothers a chuckle.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        So you found me, so whoopee, so

                        You gonna bust him?

                        He’ll never see the inside of a 
                        jail cell --you understand?

           Kathy nods.

                                 FRED
                        We need your help to find him.

                        You’re a brave, brave girl to be 
                        alive; but there’s one more thing 
                        you need to do.

                        Just tell how it happened.  What

                                 DWIGHT
                        Be brave just a little bit longer.

           She sips Romilar; she closes her eyes.

                                 KATHY
                        I was on the street.  No place to 
                        go.  I met a girl.  Named 
                        Michelle.

           Dwight/Fred share a look:  MICHELLE WHITE, VICTIM #9.

                                 FRED
                        She was a prostitute?

                                 KATHY
                        She was my friend.  She told me I 
                        could make good money if I wanted 
                        to bad enough...
                               (beat)
                        She was all alone, too.  She said 
                        it was a dangerous thing, being 
                        alone, and the two of us could 
                        look out for each other; like 
                        sisters...

                        She started me turning tricks.  
                        We’d flag down the johns, they’d 
                        drive us to hot-pillow joins --you 
                        know, fuck-pads.  The john would 
                        rent the room, then whoever he 
                        wanted would go in an’ do him and 
                        the other one would wait ‘till 
                        they were done.  We were living.

           EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Kathy & MICHELLE WHITE (20s), strung-out redhead, on a 
           corner, shivering/sharing drags of a smoke.

                                 KATHY (V.O.)
                        It was Christmas Eve and cold.  
                        Michelle said lots of square johns 
                        got lonely on the Eve.  It was 
                        like the dark side of the moon and 
                        we were gonna call it quits...

                                 DWIGHT (V.O.)
                        But something stopped you.

           A CAR DRIFTS TO A STOP ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE GIRLS’ 
           CORNER.  IDLES.

                                 KATHY (V.O.)
                        A man.  In a car.

                                 FRED (V.O.)
                        What kind of car?

                                 KATHY
                        I dunno cars.  Gray.  A real dull 
                        sled.

           A BIG WHIP ANTENNA RIG ON THE BACK OF THE CAR.

                                 DWIGHT (V.O.)
                        Did it have a whip antenna on the 
                        back?

                                 KATHY (V.O.)
                        How’d you know that?

                                 DWIGHT (V.O.)
                        Never mind.  Go on.

           THE CAR JUST WAITS, CHUGGING PLUMES OF DRAGON-BREATH 
           EXHAUST.

                                 KATHY (V.O.)
                        Man in the car asked us our names; 
                        we told him; he said they were 
                        pretty names for pretty girls.

           THE DRIVER’S FACE IS CLOAKED IN SHADOWS.  The girls start 
           to cross the street; a gloved HAND comes out the window, 
           halts them.

                                 KATHY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        He didn’t want us to get in the 
                        car.  He told us to meet him at 
                        the Come On Inn.  Couple blocks’ 
                        walk.  He’d be waiting in room 7.  
                        Like he had it already set up.

           DRIVER’S HAND COMES OUT THE WINDOW WITH TWO ONE HUNDRED 
           DOLLAR BILLS; HE SLOWLY TEARS THEM IN HALF, LETS THE TWO 
           TORN HALVES FLUTTER TO THE STREET.

                                 KATHY (V.O.)
                        He said if we wanted the other 
                        half, we’d show.

                        We showed.

           INT.  COME ON INN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Cabin-style motel hell-hole.  Murphy bed pushed into the 
           wall.  A pair of Halogen work lights on tripods throw 
           blinding light at the front door.  Like a stage set 
           waiting for performers.

           Kathy/Michelle stand there, blinded by the lights, unable 
           to see THE MAN at the far end of the room.

           We see DWIGHT/FRED, to the side of the action, PHYSICALLY 
           PRESENT in the flashback.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Which one a you did he want?

                                 KATHY
                        Both of us, same time.  He said he 
                        got extra lonely at Christmastime.
                               (beat)
                        It was no big deal...we’d done 
                        each other before.

                                 FRED
                        So:  You’re in this room:

                                 KATHY
                        --and the bed’s up and there’s 
                        these lights and it’s all wrong.

                                 DWIGHT
                        But you needed the money--

                                 KATHY
                        --but we needed the money and we 
                        were used to plenty worse than 
                        this, so we stayed.

           A PAIR OF SMITH & WESSON HANDCUFFS slide-clatter across 
           the floor, stop up against Kathy’s foot.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Get in them.

           HIS VOICE LIKE BONE DUST ON DEAD LEAVES.

                        I don’t wanna.

                               (aside/to Dwight)
                        And it sounded like he was 
                        smiling.

                                 MICHELLE
                               (to Kathy)
                        ‘s okay...Daddy just knows we been 
                        extra naughty this year.

           Kathy snaps one cuff around her wrist; ratchets go click-
           click-click.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        That’s a girl.

                                 MICHELLE
                        How ‘bout me, Santa Baby?

                        Remove your clothes.

           Michelle shucks a boot.

                                 MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Do it slow.

           She slow-shrugs off her other boot; she unzips her mini-
           skirt.  She pulls off her halter.  She’s naked now under 
           the hot lights.

                                 MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Dance for me.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I need some tunes to shimmy.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        There’s music all around, if you 
                        listen close enough.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Your dough, your show.

           She dances.  Room silent but for her dirty bare feet 
           scuffing mangy carpet and THE MAN’S steady breathing and 
           KATHY’s cuffs, jingling the radiator.

           FLASH.  FLASH.  FLASH.  White/orbs supernova flare:  A 
           POLAROID CAMERA, flashbulbs strobing the room.

           We HEAR the prints slide out, slip to the floor; Michelle 
           blinks, catches ghost-strobes of THE MAN, his face 
           blocked by the CAMERA.

                        pleased.

           FLASHES STOP.  Michelle finishes her dance with a sad 
           little flourish.

                                 MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Come to me.

           Michelle walks to the far end of the room, squints at 
           Halogen glare, stops just short of the darkness.

                                 MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)

                        That soft, sweet sound, clinging 
                        to the air?

                        I don’t hear nothin’ man.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        It’s so, so soft...you’ll have to 
                        listen so, so close to hear it.  
                        And when you do hear it...that 
                        means you’re ready.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Look, do you wanna screw or talk 
                        about music?

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        It’s your Die Song.

           THE MAN’S ARM LASHES OUT OF THE DARK, SEIZES MICHELLE’S 
           HAND, PULLS HER OFF HER FEET, INTO THE BLACKNESS.

           Kathy wrenches her chains; from the dark:  a wet, ripping 
           sound, a choked-off scream.  Kathy shock-stilled.  She 
           peers past the lights into the perfect darkness.

           A RIVER OF BLOOD flows from the darkness, across the 
           carpet, towards Kathy; she sees her own face reflected 
           back in the creeping red tide.

                                 MAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I hear yours, too, Kathy.  Your 
                        Die Song.  I’ve heard so many.  
                        So, so many.  But your is among 
                        the sweetest.  A lullaby fit for 
                        angels.  Do you hear it?

           CONTINUED: (3)

           She throws her weight; metal squeal; pipe SNAPS.  She 
           falls back, surprised at her sudden freedom.  She 
           stumbles up, falls at the door, heavy crazy footsteps 
           behind her; she spills out into cold night.

           She zigzag flees from the Come On Inn, throws a wobbly 
           glance back, sees:  THE MAN, silhouetted in the doorway, 
           light pouring out around him, watching her departure.

           He raises a hand in farewell.  A promise to meet again.

                        I didn’t want my parents to know

                        They won’t.

           She lies back on the bed.  She looks very young and very 
           tired.

                                 KATHY
                        He said his name was “Dwight.”

           She drift-yawns off to sleep, “Dwight” still on her lips.

           Fred pulls Dwight into the bathroom; they’re nerve-
           shredded/sweating, hemmed in each other’s faces.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Say it was me --would I use my 
                        righteous name?

                                 FRED
                        If you expected both girls to be

                        I’m sorry, I just--

                                 DWIGHT
                        --you were just bein’ a cop.

                                 FRED
                        Then where’s she get “Dwight?”

                                 DWIGHT 
                        Logic it out:  Somebody’s tryin’ 
                        to serve me up.  How else would 
                        they get to Vicky?  An’ don’t say 
                        I did her, too, ‘cause you and 
                        Kohner watchdogged me all that 
                        night.

                                 FRED
                        How’d you tumble Gringo’s car had 
                        a whip antenna?

           Dwight fishes KATHY’S HANDCUFFS from his pocket.

                        Smith & Wesson cuffs.

                                 FRED
                        A savvy civilian could score

           Dwight holds the cuffs up under the light; there is a 
           tiny SMEAR OF NAIL POLISH by the keyhole.

                                 DWIGHT
                        That’s a cop who doesn’t wanna 
                        lose his cuffs in a post-bust 
                        clusterfuck.

                                 FRED
                        A cop.

                                 DWIGHT
                        A cop could B&E the motel rooms 
                        prior to the murders to avoid ID 
                        by the desk clerk, grid wipe the 
                        scenes of trace evidence, could

                        eyeball wits to keep Gringo outta 
                        the papers.  A cop who handled the 
                        field interrogations, had access 
                        to the kill-sites, could obfuscate 
                        evidence and divert the thrust of 
                        the investigation onto somebody 
                        else.
                               (beat)
                        Onto me.

                                 FRED
                        A cop who knows your name.

                                 DWIGHT
                        And hates me like cancer.

                        He wastes the first one, maybe 
                        it’s an accident, he does another 
                        and another; he’s hot for it, he 
                        racks up nine --one gets away.  
                        Now he needs a fall guy.

                                 FRED
                        Somebody who fits the profile.

                        Coroner put Vicky’s time of death 
                        early AM Tuesday.  But you and

                        I did.  Kohner was drunk, said he 
                        wasn’t gonna camp out all night on 
                        your account so he left me for

           Dwight settles in beside the bed.  Kathy whimpers in her 
           sleep; the blanket falls off her foot; she shivers.  
           Dwight pulls the blanket back up.

           A radio plays two rooms over.  Some one hit wonder mourns 
           The One That Got Away.

           Fred, in the RECORDS ROOM.  Place is new-year’s-eve-
           empty.  He’s laying out WALT KOHNER’S arrest reports into 
           two piles, repeating two words like a mantra, depending 
           on which pile he lays the file.

           Dwight snaps awake; eyes to the bed --SHE’S GONE-- his

                        We’re supposed to marry the boy

                        You don’t like saying “ex.”

                        Is that because you still loved

                        She was a stone heartbreaker.

           Dwight looks away, fights off a vertigo of grief.

                                 KATHY
                        I’m sorry how I talked to you and 
                        your friend before.  That wasn’t 
                        really me.

                        By the way, your friend?  He’s a

                                 DWIGHT

                        I bet he shits rulers.

           Dwight cracks up; Kathy cracks up; she has this big 
           honking laugh, like it’s too big for her smile.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        Hey:  You wanna see somethin’ 
                        funny?

                                 DWIGHT
                        Yeah, I do.

           Kathy digs in her purse; pulls out a FADED PINK RIBBON, 
           little gold letters almost rubbed off read:  “MISS TEEN 
           KEOKUK, IOWA, 1967.”

                                 KATHY
                        Didn’t know you had Miss Teen

                        Laugh it up, smart-ass, but it was 
                        a big deal.  I was in a parade, I 
                        had my own float and everything.

                                 DWIGHT

           CONTINUED: (3)

           They’re laughing so hard they’re crying; it tapers off.  
           Dwight hands her back the RIBBON, suddenly solemn.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        You have to go, now.

                                 KATHY
                        To end it.

                        Better you stay here.  Hang on the 
                        balcony and dig on the party; 
                        should be a helluva show.

           He stands to leave.  She stands with him

                                 DWIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Promise me you’ll be here when I

                                 DWIGHT
                        It’s a promise.

                        --to die.

           He brushes a strand of hair off her forehead; turns away.

                                 KATHY
                        Hey?  Happy New Year?

                        Jury’s out.

           He walks out fast.  He doesn’t look back.
           EXT.  WALT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dwight in the Buick; parked on a residential street in 
           Silverlake.  Christmas lights on houses up and down the 
           block --but NOT on the house he’s watch-dogging:  WALT 
           KOHNER’S shabby rancher.

           From some other house:  Frankie Avalon croons “Silent 
           Night.”

           A neighbor’s glowing PLASTIC LAWN NATIVITY lights 
           Dwight’s face; he pops two Bennies/a Romilar chaser.

           Dwight gets out, diddy-bops up to Walt’s front door, the 
           Colt pressed to his leg.  He leans on the doorbell for 
           twenty seconds.  No lights; no movement; nobody home.

           He walks around the side of the house through the empty 
           carport, into the backyard--

           EXT.  WALT’S HOUSE (BACKYARD) - CONTINUOUS

           --and sees a screened-in back porch, screen door 
           unlatched.  He opens it, dodges yard junk, braces the 
           back house door, gouges the jam with Gringo’s HANDCUFFS 
           ratchet; he snaps wood and throws his weight.  Door pops 
           open.

           INT.  WALT’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NEXT

           Dwight prowls by moonlight/touch only:  Bowling trophies.  
           Plates and crusts of stuff everywhere.  A picture of a 
           YOUNGER WALT arm-wrestling Ernest Borgnine.

           Under the soiled mattress:  A .12 gauge Remington PUMP 
           SHOTGUN.  Dwight ejects the shells, pockets them, SLIDES 
           THE PUMP BACK UNDER THE MATTRESS.

           INT.  WALT’S HOUSE (BASEMENT) - NEXT

           Dwight tugs the bare bulb light pull-chain.  Boxes of 
           glommed swag:  cartons of Pall Malls, cases of Cutty 
           Sark; a work bench, tools pell-mell strewn over it.

           A greasy coat of dust over everything --EXCEPT-- that box 
           in the corner.  Dust-free.  Dwight kneels, uses the cuffs 
           ratchet to gouge loose a flap of cardboard.

           Inside:  THE DIE SONG, VOL. 1, CHRONICLE 1, lovingly 
           wrapped in plastic.  Dwight digs through the box; it’s 
           FULL OF DIE SONG CHRONICLES, all apparent originals.  His 
           fingers tear through the plastic sheaths --the blood-ink 
           smears all over his shaking hands.

           KA-CHOCK.  Pump slide of a shotgun being racked upside 
           Dwight’s ear in stereo.

                        junkie.

           Dwight pivots his peripherals:  Walt Kohner covering him 
           with the REMINGTON .12 GAUGE.

                                 WALT (O.S.) (CONT’D)

                        lean, motherfucker, like to push 
                        it down.  Those palms come off the 
                        wall, I’ll turn your head into a 
                        fuckin’ canoe.

                        whores--

           Walt kicks Dwight’s legs apart; Dwight eats wall.

                                 WALT
                        I say ya could talk?

           He finds the Colt, tosses it away.

                        Turn around, face me --do it slow 
                        motion.

           Dwight turns around slow.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Now:  What shit you talkin’?

                                 WALT
                        What about Jane?

           Dwight rushes Walt.  Walt pulls the Remington’s trigger.  
           CLICK.  Walt swings the shotgun like a club, glances a 
           blow of Dwight’s jaw, takes out the ceiling light, room 
           goes to moonlight.

           Walt drives Dwight against the work-bench, bears down on 
           his neck with the Remington, trying to crush his hyoid 
           bone; Dwight’s face goes blue to black.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Dwight bites down on Walt’s hand, shakes his head like a 
           rat-killing dog; he bites down to bone; blood sprays his 
           face; veins flap; Dwight almost tears Walt’s thumb out; 
           Walt screams, the shotgun slips from his ripped hand.

           Dwight’s flailing hand finds a can of PAINT on the work-
           bench; he round-houses it.

           Can smacks --POCK-- into Walt’s skull, so hard the lid 
           pops off; blue paint splatters clear across the cellar.

           INT.  THE OFF HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           All-nite Downtown coffee dive.  A SHORT-ORDER COOK (50s) 
           manning the grill.  A MARY KAY COSMETICS SALESWOMAN 
           (30s), in her pink dress, at her lonely table, eating a 
           Sundae.

           Fred, at a window booth, Walt Kohner’s arrest reports 
           stacked before him, his coffee long cold.

           ELMER FRINT steps inside, sits across from Fred.  Short-
           order Cook makes a “Want anything?” gesture; Elmer shoos 
           him away.

                                 FRED
                               (sotto voce)
                        Thank you for meeting me, sir.

                                 ELMER
                        Is all this cloak and dagger 
                        really necessary, Sergeant?

                                 FRED
                        What I have to say seemed better 
                        said outside the station.  It 
                        involves a brother officer.

                                 ELMER
                        In what capacity?

                        As a suspect in the nine whore 
                        murders, sir.

                                 ELMER
                        That’s a grave allegation.

                                 FRED
                        My partner and I feel it’s one 
                        well-founded.

                                 ELMER
                        Sergeant Kohner?

                                 FRED
                        No, sir.  Dwight Mueller.  
                        Sergeant Kohner is the suspect.
           INT.  WALT’S HOUSE (BASEMENT) - THAT MOMENT

           Walt comes to.  Dwight covers him with the Colt.  Walt 
           wipes paint/blood off his face.

                                 WALT
                        Ya killed my head, ya scrote.

           Dwight rolls a bottle of Cutty over to Walt.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Have a little oil, Tin man.

                        all alone, you couldn’t get it up

                        She laughs at you and you just

                        excessive force complaints and 
                        narcotics abuse.

           blows his ribs out his back.  Pistol concussion shatters 
           the Off Hollywood’s windows.

           Elmer looks thoughtful as he:  slides out of the booth 
           and turns, VERY SLOWLY:  The Short Order cook is standing 
           by the grill, a hash-slinger still in one hand.  The Cook 
           slowly starts to raise his hands in surrender.

           Elmer shoots him.  Cook’s whites pop/flare over his 
           heart.  He bounces off the griddle and hits the floor.

           Elmer turns, VERY SLOWLY:   the Mary Kay Saleswoman is 
           frozen at her table --a spoon of ice cream hovering at 
           her lips.

           jitters, then it doesn’t.   Scorched blood and brain 
           matter and gun-smoke all over.   Reverb dies to silence.

           Fred, from his dying place on the floor, watches Elmer 
           VERY SLOWLY walk over and kneel beside him.  Elmer’s care-
           worn face is all kindly concern:

                        And that’s on you.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Walt steps back; Dwight stands to the gas.  Buick peels 
           out into the night.  Walt pads over to his neighbor’s 
           lawn, to the GLOWING NATIVITY SET.

           He plops down in the manger.  He loads the SHELL into the 
           Remington.  He takes off his shoes.  He rubs his toes in 
           frost-tipped grass.

           Walt looks down at the glowing BABY JESUS.

                                 WALT
                               (grins)
                        Ya got off easy.

           He crams the shotgun barrel into his mouth.  His toe 
           finds the trigger.

           Muzzle roar.  A jerk and a flop.  Blood sprays the wise 
           men.

           EXT.  THE OFF HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           The Off Hollywood is dark.  The “closed” sign dangles in 
           the doorway.  The Buick’s headlights strafe the windows.

           INT.  THE OFF HOLLYWOOD - NEXT

           Dwight tries the door; locked.  He smashes the glass with 
           the Colt, he stumble-trips inside; finger-fumbles the 
           lights on.

           His eyes roam the massacre.  Fred, dead at Dwight’s feet, 
           his eyes open, his chest a bloody ruin, his heart shot 
           out, point-blank.

           Dwight holds him.  Their foreheads touch.  A moment.

           Heard in the distance:  muffled explosions, tapering off 
           to contrails of whistle-screams.  

           Dwight looks out the window:  a daisy chain of FIREWORKS 
           scatter-gunning across the Hollywood nightscape.

           He eases Fred back down; he closes Fred’s eyes.

                                 DWIGHT
                        end-of-watch.

           He gently pushes Fred’s glasses back up his nose and sets 
           them right.

           INT.  ELMER’S CAR (TRAVELING) - NEXT

           Elmer, in his gray unmarked Matador F-car, cruising 
           parallel to Sunset Boulevard, down Melrose, using his 
           signals, driving the speed limit.

           As he drives, he hums some tune only he can hear.
           EXT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (ROOM 909/BALCONY) - NEXT

           Kathy walks onto the balcony, leans over the railing; we 
           see the Sunset Strip from her vantage:

           Revellers scream; standstill traffic; a blizzard of 
           streamers/confetti.  

           Fireworks burst red/blue/green.  They light up Kathy’s 
           eyes; comets in her eyes.

           INT.  BUICK (TRAVELING) - NEXT

           Dwight, gunning it hard, whips in/out of traffic, blows 
           signals, leans on the horn.

           INT./EXT.  ELMER’S CAR (TRAVELING) - NEXT

           Elmer pulls up to Melrose & Crescent Heights.  An. L.A. 
           County Sheriff’s barricade blocks forward passage.  
           Detour leads AWAY from Sunset.

           Elmer pulls his car to the curb, abandons it, pounds 
           pavement.  He melts into the stream of REVELLERS heading 
           up to Sunset via Crescent Heights.

           INT.  BUICK (TRAVELING) - NEXT

           Dwight drives one-handed; he pops Bennies, he chugs 
           Romilar.  He sees A DEAD GIRL in the middle of the road.

                                 DWIGHT
                        --jesus fuck--

           He jerks the wheel/jumps the curb, Buick slams a light 
           pole, sparks rain down, hiss-rattle-silence.

           EXT.  CRESCENT HEIGHTS - NEXT

           Elmer, in the middle of the massive pulsing crowd 
           partying its way toward Sunset.

           Between the bobbing hippie heads, he can just make out 
           the spires of the ESPERANZA HOTEL spiking the horizon.

           EXT.  SWEETZER AVE. - NEXT

           Dwight spills out of the Buick, impact-fucked.  Revellers 
           with noise-makers and party hats flood by him, oblivious.

           Dwight sees the County Sheriff’s blockade up ahead at 
           Crescent.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He jams the Colt in his waistband; he starts up Sweetzer, 
           limping on a dead run up to Sunset.

           EXT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL - NEXT

           Elmer hits Sunset/the end of the Strip.  The Citibank 
           clock reads 11:39 PM.

           Across the street/beyond the crowd:  The Esperanza.  
           Elmer shoves his way towards it.

           EXT.  SUNSET BLVD. - NEXT

           Dwight stumbles off Sweetzer onto Sunset.  Crowd-roar 
           decibel off the charts.  Strippers writhe naked on top of 
           parked cars; Arthur Blessit lugs his cross; bikers roar 
           their Harleys down the sidewalk, scatter ‘nam vet winos 
           in party hats; Pachuco gangsters flip over a Sheriff’s 
           prowl car, chanting “Gestapo!  Gestapo!”

           The Turtles are playing at Pandora’s Box:  Grim Reaper of 
           Love sends Dwight on his way.

           INT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (LOBBY) - NEXT

           Elmer crosses the tinsel-draped lobby; heads for the 
           elevator, steps inside, pushes the 9th floor button.  
           Ding and the doors slide shut.

           EXT.  SUNSET BLVD. - NEXT

           A dog pisses on a pile of burning rubber Nixon masks; 
           bottles of Dom Perignon rain from roof of the Playboy 
           Club --foam and glass torpedo the strip; Dwight gags 
           confetti out his nose, charges forward.

           INT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (9TH FLOOR HALLWAY) - NEXT

           Ding and elevator doors slide open.  Elmer steps out into 
           the hall.  He draws his gun, knocks on the door of Room 

           A HIPPIE DUDE opens the door; Elmer peers past him --
           hippie central, grass, guitars, jugs of wine.

                                 HIPPIE DUDE
                        You lookin’ for a party, man?

                                 ELMER
                        I’m sorry.  I have the wrong room.

           Hippie Dude shrugs, shuts the door.  Elmer moves on to 
           Room 901.  He knocks.
           EXT.  SUNSET BLVD. - NEXT

           A platoon of Black Panthers charge an L.A. County 
           Sheriff’s riot squad; Sheriff’s pop tear gas; smoke 
           phantasms across the Strip...smoke turns the revellers 
           into wraiths; Sunset itself transmuted into this noxious 
           alien dreamscape.

           INT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (9TH FLOOR HALLWAY) - NEXT

           Elmer, outside Room 904.  He knocks.  No answer.  He 
           tries the door --unlocked.  He opens it, steps inside:

           SOME DEAD GUY in a NEAL ARMSTRONG T-SHIRT that reads:  
           “One Small Step For Man...” is hanging from a NOOSE; his 
           body twists around slow on the rope, revealing the words 
           on the back of his t-shirt:

           “...One Giant Leap For Mankind.”

           EXT.  SUNSET BLVD. - NEXT

           Dwight stumbles through the smoke into a street corner re-
           enactment of the TATE SLAYINGS:  Faux Manson groupie 
           chicks chant “Charlie, Charlie” --as they spray ketchup 
           over a pregnant Sharon Tate look-a-like lying before 
           them.

           A fake KNIFE with a spring blade is raised and plunged 
           into “Sharon.”  She mock dies; faux groupies push her 
           knees apart, dig between them.

           Groupies pull out a red-spattered plastic BABY DOLL, hold 
           it up to the detonating sky, their lips pulled back, 
           feral, tongues licking at red droplets --they pay homage, 
           they offer sacrifice to some dark god only they can see.

           A CHARLES MANSON LOOK-A-LIKE rises up from the sidewalk 
           abattoir, his glittering eyes coming to rest on Dwight:

                                 “CHARLES MANSON”
                        Join us...

           Dwight pulls the Colt, fires into the air, scatters the 
           Manson wannabes; he bulldozes through them, throwing 
           elbows; they fall away, stare up at him with eyes pale as 
           milk glass; he bludgeons a path, weeping/screaming, and 
           finds himself at the entrance to The Esperanza Hotel.

           EXT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (ROOM 909/BALCONY) - NEXT

           Kathy, watching the fireworks.  Her eyes fall to the fire 
           escape of the TENEMENT building directly across from her 
           balcony.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A swinger’s party rages inside; a LITTLE GIRL in a fairy 
           costume, wings/a wand, is out on the fire escape, ignored 
           and all alone.

           Kathy waves; the little girl doesn’t see her.  Kathy 
           stands on tiptoes, waves her pink Miss Iowa ribbon --the 
           little girl sees her then, her face lights up.  She waves 
           back.

           INT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (9TH FLOOR HALLWAY) - NEXT

           Elmer steps up to Room 909.  He knocks on the door.

           EXT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (ROOM 909/BALCONY) - NEXT

           Kathy wheels around at the KNOCKING --sees a shadow under 
           the door.  Sees the KNOB twisting as the shadow tries it, 
           and she knows.

           To her left:  Room 908’s balcony, maybe three feet away.  
           Down:  down is a nine story drop.

           INT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (9TH FLOOR HALLWAY) - NEXT

           Elmer draws back, kicks the door; the frame shudders.

           EXT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (ROOM 909/BALCONY) - NEXT

           Kathy looks back, sees the door buckle under Elmer’s 
           kick; she swings a leg over the railing, losing a shoe on 
           909’s balcony; she hoists herself up/over, reaches for 
           908’s balcony--

           --she MISSES.  She grabs air.  Her body swings out under 
           her.  She catches a glimpse of the LITTLE GIRL in the 
           fairy costume waving goodbye...

           Her fingers scrape metal.  She GRABS.  She HEAVES.  She 
           grunts, hauls herself up/over, sweating adrenaline, she 
           sprawls onto 908’s BALCONY.

           INT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (ROOM 909) - NEXT

           Door explodes in/chain snaps.  Elmer enters, gun up.  
           Checks bathroom.  Bedroom.  Under the bed.  No one there.  
           Curtains fluttering from the open balcony door.  He steps 
           onto the balcony.  No one here.  He holsters up, starts 
           to turn away.

           A GIRL’S SHOE is lying on the balcony.  He smiles.

                                 ELMER
                        You cunning bitch.
           INT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (9TH FLOOR HALLWAY) - NEXT

           Kathy bolts out of room 908.  Elmer bolts out of room 
           909.  They collide in the hall.  He drops his gun.  Kathy 
           starts to crawl away, panting.

           Elmer calmly collects his weapon--

                                 ELMER
                        Can you hear it now, Kathy?

           She claws carpet; she belly-writhes forward.

                                 ELMER (CONT’D)
                        Can you hear your Die Song?

           She drags herself a last few feet, to the elevator, 
           tearing her fingernails out on carpet tacks; she looks 
           up.  Elmer’s standing over her.  He raises his gun.  He 
           sights down the back of her head.

                                 ELMER (CONT’D)
                        I wish I had time for something a 
                        bit more personal, but this will 
                        have to do, for us both...

           Kathy shuts her eyes.  She gets ready for an explosion 
           and then nothingness.

           DING.  ELEVATOR DOORS SLIDE OPEN --AND DWIGHT’S INSIDE, 
           EYE TO EYE WITH ELMER.

           Elmer shoots first --bullet hits Dwight’s collar bone, 
           spins him around; throws smoke and bone chips.  Dwight 
           falls in a heap in the elevator.

           A SERVICE DOOR bangs open at the end of the hallway.  
           Kathy’s footsteps disappearing behind it.  Door swings 
           shut; Elmer eyes the faded letters:  ROOF ACCESS ONLY.

                                 ELMER (CONT’D)
                        One more verse.

           EXT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (ROOFTOP) - NEXT

           Kathy crouch-runs across the roof.  Fireworks back-
           scatter a rosy flame across the sky around her.  She 
           ducks behind a duct.

           INT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (9TH FLOOR HALLWAY) - NEXT

           Elevator doors ding, start to slide shut.  DWIGHT’S 
           BALLED AND BLOODY FIST SLAMS DOWN ON THE TRACK, STOPPING 
           THEM.
           EXT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (ROOFTOP) - NEXT

           Elmer steps out of the roof access doorway, eye-scans the 
           rooftop.

           INT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (9TH FLOOR HALLWAY) - NEXT

           Dwight drags himself into the hallway.  His sheared 
           collar bone pokes out through his jacket; he’s blacking 
           out; he bangs his head on the floor to stay conscious.

           He grips the Colt, braces his legs, forces his body up; 
           his collar bone scrapes the wall as he slowly rises.

                                 DWIGHT
                        not yet, goddamn you, not yet--

           He starts for the roof access door at the end of the 
           hall, leaving a bloody smear trail along the wallpaper.

           EXT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (ROOFTOP) - NEXT

           Kathy sprints behind another duct.  She grabs up a 
           baseball-bat length of REBAR from an abandoned pile; she 
           wraps her hands around it; waits.

           She hazards a look:  Elmer, coming towards her.

           INT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (9TH FLOOR HALLWAY) - NEXT

           Dwight reels, the hallway dips; his vision blurs.  He 
           retches blood and bile.  He falls to one knee.

           IN THE ROOMS AROUND HIM, HE SEES HIS DEAD:  THE NINE DEAD 
           WHORES, VICKY, FRED...THEY ARE ALL AS THEY WERE IN LIFE:  
           NO MORGUE TERRORS OR BLOODY SMILES --THEY JUST STARE AT 
           HIM, WAITING TO SEE WHAT HE’LL DO NEXT.

           Dwight’s calvary:  he forces himself back standing; he 
           hears his bones gnashing.  He takes a step.  Hallway’s 
           eight miles long --he takes another step.

           EXT.  ESPERANZA HOTEL (ROOFTOP) - NEXT

           Elmer sees the pink Miss Iowa ribbon fluttering from 
           behind a duct.

                                 ELMER
                        You can’t hide, Kathy.  I hear 
                        you.  I’ve always heard you.  Your 
                        Die Song is a beacon.  You’ll hear 
                        it so soon.  I promise you, it’s 
                        your time...

           He steps around the duct.  Nobody there.  Just a ribbon 
           hooked on a screw.
                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           KATHY SWINGS THE REBAR at Elmer’s head; slicing his 
           temple; he drops his gun; blood flows, slicks his face.

           Kathy swings again.  Elmer side-steps.  Her swing-
           momentum carries her off her feet; she falls; he’s on 
           her.

                                 KATHY
                        --offa me, bastard--

           He’s choking her life away; her arms flail; he’s too 
           strong; she’s fading.

                                 ELMER
                        Don’t you know it, even now?  Your 
                        whole life has been prologue to 
                        this moment.  My life, too.  
                        Darkness and then a chorus of 
                        angels to sing you home.

           Elmer smiles/cries at the same time; half his face is 
           blood-blacked, like war-paint.

                                 ELMER (CONT’D)
                        Hushabye...

           Her eyes flutter shut; her arms slip to her sides.

                                 DWIGHT (O.S.)
                        Legion Gringo.

           This VOICE whipsaws across the roof.  Elmer wheels around 
           to face it, Kathy his shield, his eyes blazing over her 
           shoulder at THE MAN framed in the roof access doorway:

           DWIGHT MUELLER, trembling under the weight of 
           consciousness; only the bloody wreckage of a man remains-- 
           his beat-dog eyes blaze righteous fury, his ringing voice 
           shot through with shattered nobility and purpose.

                                 DWIGHT (CONT’D)
                        That name mean anything to you?

                        That name is me.

                                 DWIGHT
                        I know it.  And I know you killed 
                        those whores.  And Fred.  And 
                        Vicky.  And God knows how many 
                        else.

                        You led me right to her.  I knew 
                        you wouldn’t disappoint.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Let her go.

                        I can’t do that.

                                 DWIGHT
                        I’m not askin’, old shoe.

                                 ELMER
                        Don’t play at a hero, Dwight.  You 
                        never wore it very well.  Drop 
                        your weapon.

                                 DWIGHT
                        I do, you’ll kill us both.

                                 ELMER
                        You don’t, I’ll shoot her face 
                        off.

           Dwight can’t risk shooting.  Blood-loss/shock has 
           Elmer/Kathy tripling in his vision.

                                 ELMER (CONT’D)
                        And you’re already lousy with 
                        ghosts.

           Dwight sways; the Colt weighs a thousand pounds; he lets 
           it slip from his grip.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Now wh--

           Elmer’s .38, booming in the night, gunshots mingling 
           withe fireworks.  Dwight shot through the pelvis; hardly 
           feels it hit him; he’s on the ground, looking up at 
           fireworks setting the stars on fire.

           Elmer lays Kathy down, goes to Dwight.  Dwight reaches 
           for the Colt, but Elmer toes it away, like a choke-hazard 
           toy from a toddler.

                        How many you done?

                                 ELMER
                        I couldn’t say.  It seemed a 
                        vanity to keep count.  To slight 
                        them that way.

                        And that was when I knew:  We 
                        couldn’t save them.  No matter how 
                        much we loved them.  I was a 
                        father, a policeman...then one day 
                        I woke up...and I wasn’t there.

                                 ELMER
                        A volume was found in a Vice bust 
                        you and Kohner made in ‘52.  He 
                        booked it as collateral smut and 
                        forgot about it.  It sat in a box 
                        under the P.A.B. for eight years.  
                        When you killed Moran, I had to 
                        show cause to prevent your 
                        indictment for murder.  In 
                        reviewing your arrest reports, I 
                        came across, quite by chance, The 
                        Die Song.  In an old box, in a 
                        forgotten file, I found my 
                        deliverance.

                        In her way, in her way Jane made 
                        us, both.

           Dwight snarls, rears up feebly; Elmer toes his jutting 
           collar bone.  Dwight screams/falls back down.

                                 ELMER (CONT’D)
                        Enough of that, now.  Just let the 
                        darkness take you; take you all 
                        the way down.  Down to the dark.  
                        To all your waiting dead.  To 
                        Jane.

                                 DWIGHT
                        Her name sounds like shit in your 
                        mouth.

                                 ELMER
                        I can hear it now, Dwight.  Your 
                        Die Song.  For one so coarse, it’s 
                        actually quite sweet.

           Dwight’s eyes flutter shut; hot tears spring out.

                                 ELMER (CONT’D)

           Elmer kneels beside Dwight, lays a soothing hand over his

           Dwight’s hand lashes up, grips Elmer’s neck, pulls him 
           last-rites-close:

           Dwight wrenches the knife in, hilt-deep.  Blood pumps out

           twitches out still, settling down sickly warm, his last 
           breath blown out on Dwight’s neck:  Elmer dies looking 
           surprised.

           Dwight shrugs Elmer’s dead weight off his chest, lies 
           there.  Kathy finds him,  holds his hand, the two of them 
           looking up at the sky.

           The last of the fireworks tearing holes in the night like

           Dwight and Kathy, on the platform.  Dwight limps, his 
           arm’s in a sling, he’s bandaged up --he’s healing.  Kathy 
           wears a sundress and a hat; she’s de-junked; she glows.  
           She’s a prairie sunset.

           hug their folks goodbye; hippies serenade other hippies 
           on board with a trail of tossed rose petals.

                                 KATHY
                        You think Iowa’s ready for the 
                        triumphant return of Miss Teen 
                        Keokuk, 1968?

                                 DWIGHT
                        I think...I think you’ll knock ‘em 
                        dead.

           They hold each other.  While she’s not looking, Dwight 
           slips the roll of c-notes in her purse; the train throws 
           steam.

           Kathy stands on her tiptoes and gives him a kiss.  The 
           platform empties around them.  Kiss holds.  She breaks 
           it.  Dwight blushes furiously.

                                 DWIGHT (CONT’D)
                        What was that for?

                                 KATHY
                        Just a long goodbye.

           She turns, walks through the trail of rose petals, boards 
           the train.  Train cranks up; starts its roll out of the 
           station.

           A window slides down:  IT’S KATHY.  Dwight starts 
           hobbling alongside the train, keeping pace.  She opens 
           her palm --the PINK MISS IOWA RIBBON unfurls, floats 
           down; Dwight catches it in his fist.

           They don’t say anything.  It’s a last look.  Train picks 
           up speed.  Dwight limps along, huffing for breath.  He 
           falls behind, wheezing.  The train clears the station.

           She’s gone.  Bits of a memory, now:  Her goofy laugh, 
           holding her on the rooftop, that kiss.

           Dwight doesn’t know he’s crying.

           He watches the trail melt into the soggy salmon sunset:  
           The One That Got away.

                                 DWIGHT (V.O.)
                        Jane, after all these years...I 
                        find you...

           EXT.  ECHO PARK - DUSK

           Dwight sits on a park bench at Echo Lake.  Young lovers 
           dodge ducks in row-boats.  A kid with a kite.  A pair of 
           oldsters hold hands in the gazebo.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DWIGHT (V.O.)
                        ...I don’t know if you’re anywhere 
                        near here, or if you can hear 
                        me...but I picked this spot 
                        because a friend thought it wise 
                        and it seemed as good a place as 
                        any to say goodbye.
                               (beat)
                        I’ll always think of it now as 
                        your place...and I hope, for you, 
                        that if one half of a love knows 
                        where the other half lies, then 
                        that person can never truly be 
                        alone.

           Dwight kneels.  He lays Kathy’s PINK RIBBON down in the 
           grass.  He presses his fingertips to his lips.  And 
           presses his fingers to the ribbon.

                                 DWIGHT (CONT’D)
                        I love you.

           INT.  ST. VIBIANA’S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

           Dwight shoulders his way through the big wooden doors, 
           limps to the bank of votive candles, kneels stiffly.  He 
           starts lighting candles, one by one.

                                 DWIGHT (V.O.)
                        I heard it told it’s better to 
                        light a candle than curse the 
                        darkness.  These days, I light a 
                        candle and curse the darkness, 
                        and, for now, that sees me through 
                        the watches of the night.

           He finishes lighting candles; too many to count.

                                 DWIGHT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I light ones for the nine dead 
                        whores.  For Vicky.  And for the 
                        choirboy.

           He stands to leave, shuffles to the doors.

                                 DWIGHT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And I send up a heathen’s prayer.  
                        To all those I’ve saved...all 
                        those I’ve failed...and all those 
                        yet to come.

           He passes by the last pew, stops, his back to the 
           congregation.

                                 DWIGHT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I pray that we might find each 
                        other at end-of-watch.  That we 
                        may know one another, even in the 
                        dark.  And I pray that we will 
                        share some small warmth...

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He turns back, looks over the congregation:  piss bums, 
           dopers, juicers, whores, the old Mex ladies and their 
           rosaries.  The forgotten.  The forlorn.  The fucked and 
           the forsaken.

           Dwight slides into a pew, takes his rightful place among 
           them.

                                 DWIGHT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...in the cold city.

           And waits for his dead.
