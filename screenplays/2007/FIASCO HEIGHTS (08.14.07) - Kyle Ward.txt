           WE OPEN ON A CITY LIMIT SIGN:

                     WELCOME TO FIASCO HEIGHTS
                       Population: 733,966

           And what makes this sign so unique are the successive BULLET 
           HOLES throughout it -as well as- the fact that 733,966 has 
           been crossed out repeatedly and replaced with lower numbers.

           NOW - THE CAMERA ROCKETS INTO THE SKY, WHERE WE GET A FULL 
           FRONTAL VIEW OF... THE GRIMMEST METROPOLIS YOU’VE EVER SEEN. 
           Lurid skyscrapers. Gothic architecture. You won’t find this 
           place on a map.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Fiasco Heights. You drive to hell 
                        and back, you just might find the 
                        place.

           Camera pushes in closer now, gliding aerially above an arched 
           bridge stretching across a cloud of mist. The only entrance 
           into Fiasco Heights. And so, we converge into a sea of neon.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        It’s a dead end turn with only one 
                        end in sight...

           We sweep left, looping past a GARBAGE TRUCK dumping an entire 
           load of bodybags into the bay. Swooping right, we hover 
           through a city park -while- two mobsters shovel fresh dirt 
           onto a makeshift grave site. 

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Right and wrong are afterthoughts 
                        here. Everyone’s decked in the same 
                        dark shade of gray...

           A stroke of lightning streaks across the sky. It outlines the 
           city in raw illumination -as- we track through the rooftops. 
           Gunshots, sirens... echoing all around us like static noise.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        All sins forgiven, never forgotten. 
                        No laws. No saving grace. Morality 
                        is a fallen angel in this town.

           Cue the rain. Heavy rain. A torrential downpour.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        And here, the angels fall faster 
                        than the raindrops.

           Our sky tour draws to a close as we come to THE WATER TOWER 
           BUILDING, standing tall within the city’s axis.  

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        The cycle is as endless as it is 
                        vicious. It begins here.

                        It ends here. And a whole lot’a 
                        people die in between.

           SMASH TITLE:        FIASCO HEIGHTS           :ROLL TITLE 

           EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

           Camera cranes onto the roof, where we’ll find some sorry sap 
           dangling over the edge, starring straight into 47 stories of 
           pure gravity. Looks like he’s spent his evening getting his 
           face fist-fucked into ground beef. And...

           Three anonymous thugs watch with a smile. One of them holds a 
           lit match beneath the clothesline that’s keeping him around.

           LUCKY DOYLE screams bloody murder -as- the clothesline begins 
           to drop. We zoom into his face, then...

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        STOP.

                        That’s me. Lucky Doyle. The 
                        unluckiest bastard you’ll ever 
                        catch narratin’ stories. See, I’ve 
                        got what you’d call a winning 
                        problem. In that it never happens.

           INSERT A SERIES OF FLASH CUTS WITH SUBS:

           “MONDAY” -  Lucky losing his chips at a POKER TABLE.

           “TUESDAY” - CRAPS TABLE. The dice go snake eyes.

           “WEDNESDAY” - HORSE RACES. His horse comes in dead last.

           “THURSDAY” -  Back to losing his ass at the POKER TABLE.

           “FRIDAY” - Despondent as more chips are swiped away.

                        Wasn’t always like this though. Got 
                        my start as a PI. Independent firm. 
                        That’s before I got hung on things 
                        like blackjack and horse #5...

                        So here I am, stuck in first gear & 
                        double overtime. Losing streaks 
                        like mine only hit in fatal doses, 
                        and I’m comin’ down with a fever.

                        It all started this mornin’. That’s 
                        when things hit the shitter. So 
                        let’s just start from the beginning.

           SMASH SUB:         “THE BEGINNING”

           LUCKY DOYLE stands outside the biggest church you’ve ever 
           seen. More gold crucifixes than heaven itself. Rubys. Jewels. 
           Religion is obviously big business here.

           Lucky steps up to TWO BOUNCERS, arms crossed.

                        Holy Mary. Holy Mary. Holy Mary.

           The bouncers step aside. One of them opens the door.

           INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Lucky shuts himself inside an elegant confessional.

                                 LUCKY
                        Forgive me father, I’ve sinned. 
                        It’s been three days since my last 
                        confession.

           The window opens to reveal FATHER PISARRO, an elderly priest 
           with graying hair and a moustache to match. 

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                     (thick Irish accent)
                        Three days? You were just in here 
                        yesterday, Doyle. 

                                 LUCKY
                        I sinned again... and... I need to 
                        put fifty grand on tonight’s fight.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Are you screwin’ with me? My book 
                        has you a quarter in the hole. You 
                        need to pay up, Doyle... collection 
                        box is next to the holy water.

                        See, that’s part of my confession. 
                        I ain’t got the money. Was hoping 
                        to get by on that whole “forgive my 
                        debts” thing.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                     (with a chuckle)
                        That’s just a limp clause. You want 
                        your debts erased, better find 
                        another church. This one’s 
                        Catholic. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Well, actually, I was hoping you’d 
                        let me play my debt. Spot me the 
                        money and ride it on tonight’s 
                        fight. I hear there’s a patsy in 
                        the ring.

           Father Pisarro shakes his head in disgust.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Look, I’ll forgive your sins, say a 
                        little prayer... I’ll even throw in 
                        a blessing free of charge. But your 
                        bets are no good here, Doyle. 

           Lucky gets desperate.

                                 LUCKY
                        Father Pisarro, this fight is a no 
                        brainer. I win, you win - blessings 
                        all around. I need this! Call it 
                        amazing grace in tens and twenties.

           Father Pisarro slams the window in his face. Lucky sits back 
           a beaten man. UNTIL -- THE DOOR TO THE BOOTH SWINGS OPEN. 

           Now - A HUGE, MUSCULAR GOON IN A PRIEST’S COLLAR GRABS LUCKY 
           BY THE SHIRT. He RIPS him from the confessional and SLAMS him 
           against the wall. 

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Lucky -- meet THE POPE.

           The Pope pushes his forearm into Lucky’s throat.

                                 THE POPE
                        Hear you got a tithing problem, 
                        punk!!

           Lucky replies with, “Ugghhh.”

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Now, listen up. I’m feeling a 
                        little religious today, so let’s

                        grinning by the 12th round, Pope’s 
                        gonna give you a Judas neck 
                        massage. 

           The Pope drops Lucky -- he falls like a twisted cement bag.

                        Alright Father. I get it.

           Pope grabs Lucky and begins dragging him to the door.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Good. Now go with God. And get the 
                        fuck outta here, my son.

           ANGLE ON: Lucky being dragged across the purple carpet. Past 
           a HOLY WATER HOT TUB at full capacity. Past the rehearsing 
           boy’s choir at full hum. And past a row of roulette tables.

                        broad’s disappearin’ act! Zippo!! 
                        So I ain’t got shit to spill on ya.
                     (changing gears)
                        God, if you’re up there... I’ll do 
                        anything...

           SLAM! Flask spits a few chips of porcelain from his mouth.

                                 FLASK
                     (relenting)
                        Okay - okay. Fiasco Heights. My 
                        brother Sweats has seen her there. 
                        Says she’s got something valuable 
                        that he’d love to get his paws on.  
                        Everyone would for that mater. So 
                        I’d start lookin’ for another prom 
                        date... chances are she’s already 
                        dead. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You been talkin’ to your brother 
                        again, aye Flask? Tell me, who else 
                        ya been chattin’ to? You tip the 
                        outfit I was headed back this way?
                     (silence)
                        Did you!?!

                                 FLASK
                        You’re damn right I did!

           KILLER PULLS THE HAMMER BACK NOW. 

           Flask loses his nerve. He tears up like a school girl just 
           cut from cheerleading try outs.

                                 FLASK 
                        I’m gonna miss my family. I got two 
                        little boys. A wife. This is gonna 
                        be hard on them. Please, God...

                        (cid:13)                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Quit playin’ like a family man, 
                        Flask. You’re just another one of 
                        the bad guys.

           Killer stays calm, professional. And we can tell he’s one 
           cool motherfucker just by the suave in his voice. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You finished?

                                 FLASK
                        Yeah. I’m finished.

           Killer slowly lifts his face to the florescent light. He’s a 
           striking presence, crisp and clean cut. Chiseled jawline. 
           Lean build. Dirty blonde hair - with a hint of charm and 
           menace in his eye. This is Nick Prine (aka NICK THE SAINT).

                                 NICK THE SAINT 
                        Say the word.

           Flask hesitates. He takes a deep breath - his last deep 
           breath - then closes his eyes.

                                 FLASK
                        Amen.

           And suddenly, Flask reaches back for A SWITCHBLADE strapped 
           to his ankle. He quickly pops the blade, but Nick doesn’t 
           give him a chance to do much else. 

           BAM!!!

           A SPRAY OF BLOODY PULP FRECKLES THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE A B-
           POSITIVE RAIN SHOWER, AS...

           SCENE FREEZES: on Nick’s semi-vicious glare. 

           SLAM SUB:         “NICK THE SAINT”

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Meet Nick the Saint. He’s what we 
                        call a professional “trigger”. 
                        That’s a gun for hire for all you 
                        tourists who don’t speak the 
                        language.  

           AND SCENE FLIPS COUNTERCLOCKWISE LIKE THE CHAMBER OF A 
           REVOLVER, transitioning us into A MONTAGE OF NICK FIRING FROM 
           VARIOUS ANGLES.  ALL STYLISH KILLS.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        He’s one of the best -- resume is 
                        nothin’ but gold stars.

           THEN SCENE REVOLVES BACK TO:

           The bathroom. Nick signs the cross over Flask’s corpse, then 
           kneels down and begins frisking it over...
                                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Try not to let the blood n’ guts 
                        turn ya sideways. Nicky believes in 
                        things like final prayers - last 
                        rites. He’s one of the good guys.

           ...And Nick removes Flask’s wallet and steals a twenty.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Well, as good as it gets in this 
                        story anyway.

           Nick cleans up in the mirror, wipes some blood from his chin. 

           INT. THE LAST CHANCE DINER - CONTINUOUS

           The patrons sit motionless as a blood-splattered Nick 
           approaches the counter. He slides the twenty to the waitress, 
           and takes one long sip from his pre-ordered ROOT BEER FLOAT. 
           Maybe even licks some whipped cream off the spoon. 

           Then, he winks at a little girl starring nearby... turns... 
           slaps the skipping jukebox... and exits the diner. 

           EXT. THE LAST CHANCE DINER - CONTINUOUS

           It’s raining again. Wind ripping across the open road. And 
           all we can make out is a flashing NEON SIGN as Nick exits the 
           diner.

                        “THE LAST CHANCE”

           It’s an old grease-pit tucked within the trees of the highway 
           shoulder. A metallic glimmer fading to rust.

           Streaks of blue neon outline Nick’s face in sharp flashes as 
           he adjusts the fit of his Fedora. He steps into the pouring 
           rain, waiting. Until...

           HEADLIGHTS. A TAXI CAB screeches into the parking lot and 
           slams to a stop beside Nick. He gets in.

           INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

           Leather seats ripped from years of wear. Floor sprinkled with 
           trash and cigarette ash. This ride has stories.

                                 CABBIE
                        Where to fella?

                        Oh, that don’t exist anymore. See, 
                        ‘bout a year back Tony Fingers got 
                        waxed, and his crew was taken over 
                        by that Jewish gang on the East 
                        Side. Now, they got the whole damn 
                        block in yarmulkes. You ever seen 
                        an Italian in a yarmulke? It’s 
                        worth full fuckin’ admission. 
                     (beat)
                        It’s called the Synagogue Inn now.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Just take me to the cheapest place 
                        you know. I ain’t stayin’ long.

                                 CABBIE
                     (turning back)
                        You sure you wanna go this road? 
                        They don’t call this the Last 
                        Chance for nothing.

           Nick jars the rain from his overcoat, and gives Cabbie a nod 
           that says “Just drive”. And so our driver pops the clutch. 

                                 CABBIE
                        Well. Consider it a fare’s warning.

           FOOT HITS THE GAS - ENGINE REVS - TIRES SQUEAL - RUBBER BURNS

           The cab speeds into the night leaving the “Last Chance” in a 
           cloud of smoke. Neon fades into the background.

                                 CABBIE
                        More damn rain - happens twice a 
                        day now. Friggin’ place is a flood 
                        with traffic lights. 
                     (beat)
                        In for business or pleasure?

           Nick whips out A LIGHTER and fires up a fresh smoke.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Business.

                                 CABBIE
                        What kind of business? 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Mine.

           Cabbie takes this as his cue to ease up on the questions. 

           Passing a sign now:

              5 MILES TO FIASCO HEIGHTS - WHERE IT’S ALWAYS SUNNY!!

           Cabbie grips the wheel tight and rounds a slick curve. Nick 
           glides across the back seat. 
                                           (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)

           And Nick leans forward as we enter THE FIASCO BAY BRIDGE.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (CONT’D)
                        Ya know what, driver? I might use 
                        you after all. See, that business 
                        you asked me about... just happens 
                        to be the unfinished kind.

                                 CABBIE (DELI)
                        Then if it matters, the name’s 
                        Delicontessi. But you can call me 
                        Deli for cuts.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Fine, Deli, I’m here to find a 
                        missin’ dame... and kill anyone 
                        whose laid a goddamn hand on her 
                        between now and then.
                     (inhale-exhale)
                        Point is, I’d like to retain your 
                        services while I’m in town.

           Deli offers his card over the seat.

                                 DELI
                        Call that number anytime, 
                        anywhere... I’ll only be a minute. 
                        How do we find this missin’ gal?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        She’s the one with the long green 
                        heart. Can’t miss her.

           Cab passes along FIASCO’S TONIC REEF. Odd piers and wharfs 
           litter our view. The smell of saltwater & rotting corpses.

                                 DELI 
                        So what do they call you, friend? 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                     (hesitant)
                        I’m Nick. Nick the Saint. 

           Driver immediately angles the rear view into the back seat. 

                                 DELI
                        Jesus H. Washington! You can’t be 
                        serious. Word on the street is that 
                        The Saint was a pale horse. Dead as 
                        nails!

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Yeah, well, I guess the street’s 
                        full of shit.

           And the cab slams to a stop in front of THE FIASCO HOTEL. 
           Type of place where scumbags get nightly discounts and 
           termites are rent free. 
                                                                 (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)
                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)           SFX OVER SCENE:  DING. DING. DING.

                                            SLAM CUT TO:

           INT. BOXING ARENA - “LATER THAT NIGHT”

           Two fighters going at it in flashes of flesh and blood. Jabs 
           echoing through the arena like thunder. 

           In the 5th row, Lucky screams with clenched fists. He’s 
           cheering for his life, yelling for his fighter (RED SHORTS) 
           with blow-by-blow accuracy. And in 5, 4, 3, 2...

           BAM!!! RED SHORTS TAKES AN UPPERCUT THAT PUTS HIS LIGHTS OUT.

           And Lucky’s not so cheery anymore.

           SUPER:                  $-50,000

           We stay on Lucky’s blank expression as the above number 
           quickly BEGINS TO RISE UNTIL HITTING -$100,000. “DING”.

           ANGLE ON: THE LOSING BOXER’S EYES ROLL BACK in his head 
           seconds before he drops like a wet noodle. 

           Lucky swallows his soul when the ref calls the fight. It’s 
           wall to wall cheers as the winner celebrates his victory. And 
           across the arena, we notice A GROUP OF PRIESTS all staring at 
           Lucky from an exit tunnel. Shit... Shit...

                                  LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Shit! That’s the word for straight 
                        fucked. Smells nice n’ deep too.

           In an act of last resort, Lucky rockets out of his seat and 
           hauls ass down the aisle. He topples a few popcorn vendors in 
           his haste for the exit. And...

           The priests immediately push through the celebrating 
           spectators in hot pursuit.

           INT. BOXING ARENA - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Lucky skids around a corner, and straight into the most 
           gorgeous blonde we’ll see for the next 90 minutes. Her purse 
           is knocked across the floor as he plows into her.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        But this is when I really ran into 
                        trouble...

           FREEZE ON: HOPE CAUFIELD. She’s beautiful. Flowing blonde 
           hair, heavy shine. Fair skin. Thick red lips. Curves right 
           out of a magazine. Here’s a femme fatale to the fucking max. 
           And... she’s wearing a locket with A SAPPHIRE HEART on it.

           SLAM SUB:             “TROUBLE”
                                                 (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        I just didn’t know it yet.

           UNFREEZE: Lucky quickly reaches down to collect a few of her 
           spilled belongings. Lipstick. Virginia Slims. Etc.

                                 LUCKY
                        Really sorry, lady.

                                 HOPE
                        Just watch it, will ya? You could 
                        really hurt a gal with all that 
                        hustle.

                                 LUCKY
                        Sorry again. But what are the odds 
                        of you and me...

                                 HOPE
                        None to never.

                                 LUCKY
                        ...Okay -- gotta run.

           And he returns to a dead sprint.

           EXT. BOXING ARENA - ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           THREE PRIESTS slam through the side exit into a pissed up 
           alley. But it’s all clear, no signs of washed up gamblers. 
           The priests go back inside. 

           Slowly, Lucky steps out from behind an overturned port 
           o’potty -which- just happens to have a homeless guy currently 
           residing in it. Seconds pass, until...

           A SLEEK, BLACK CADILLAC PULLS INTO THE ALLEY.

           Lucky ducks back down just as A MYSTERIOUS FIGURE leaves the 
           arena with an arm around our girl Hope. But she isn’t happy.

           They get in the Cadillac. It pulls away. And Lucky comes up 
           for air, reading the license plate numbers aloud before the 
           car disappears completely...

                                 LUCKY
                        10K QJ1.
                     (now V.O.)
                        And there was the royal flush.

           Suddenly:

                                 PINSTRIPES (O.S.)
                     (a tad British)
                        Tough loss, aye Lucky? Bet it feels 
                        like all you can sevens at the craps 
                        buffet. Win none, lose ‘em all.

           Fuck! He knows this voice. Cautiously, Lucky turns to face...

                        The God Squad.

           WE ZOOM AROUND TO FIND THREE MEN - CAMERA ROTATES, FREEZING 
           ON EACH GANGSTER - BRANDING THEM AS #1, #2, and #3. 

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        They call ‘em that partly because 
                        they’re the loan out bruisers for 
                        the Catholic Syndicate. The other 
                        reason I’ll mention in a second. 
                        Point is, they been lookin’ to give 
                        me a lead shower ever since my 
                        checks turned to rubber and I tried 
                        to bounce the big fight.

           Zooming slowly, we come face to face with #1. A slick greaser 
           in a custom pinstripe suit. EVEN HIS HAT HAS STRIPES. When he 
           turns his head down, they meet perfectly with those on his 
           suit. Meet PINSTRIPES.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Guy on the left is Pinstripes. He’s 
                        as queer as a glass slipper. But 
                        don’t take him for a dolly, or 
                        he’ll bend ya harder than a sunset 
                        in boys town.

           ON #2. A BLACK MAN, late twenties, cleft chin. Muscular. 
           Toned. He wears a zipped up sweatshirt and a matching 
           headband. 

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        That looks like Knockout Jones. 
                        Three time undisputed champion - 
                        previous belt holder. He put Juan 
                        De Pompi in a box after the title 
                        bout a year back. I was in the 
                        fifth row.
                     (squinting)
                        At least I think that’s Knockout 
                        Jones.

           #3. THE POPE smiles viciously. Again, probably one of the 
           homeliest thugs you’ll ever lay eyes on.

                        And you’ve already met this ugly 
                        son of a bitch.

           Lucky pans the alley, trying to come up with a quick strategy.

                        We don’t want nickels, Lucky.

           AND, in a blink, Lucky tries to make a break for it! He jives 
           -then- spins straight into direct range of KNOCKOUT JONES.

           LUCKY’S POV: A RIGHT HOOK UNCOILS IN HIS FACE. BAM!

                        yourself filled in.

           Pinstripes takes a seat in front of us. A fashionable man. He 
           has a European accent... smokes cloves... and, yes, very gay.

           Lucky bites his lip. No sense dying a humiliated man.

                        I have a game as well. I call it 
                        “Get Lucky”. ‘Course, you haven’t

                        guess we’ll wager on your life.

           Pinstripes removes A POLAROID picture from his jacket. And as 
           he shows it to Lucky, we recognize it as the beautiful blonde

                        don’t have the girl in 24 ticks, 
                        our little game goes sudden death.

           He slaps Lucky, driving the point home.

           “DING. DING.” Lucky grits his teeth as Jones winds up the

           In a half-conscious daze, Lucky sits up to catch his breath. 
           The blinking neon of “ANNE’S SODA SHOP” flaring vibrantly 
           across the street. Attention turns to it. And off that we:

He has a 
           clearly visible scar. A BULLET WOUND.

                        Just a gal I’m lookin’ for.

           Nick grabs his shirt. He continues dressing as Harley moves 
           into the light. The body, the lips... she’d be perfect if not 
           on double overtime.

                                 HARLEY
                        So did ya come here to pump me for 
                        information, or notch up another 
                        free lay? Because I take it ya 
                        didn’t come back to see me.

                        Like I said, it’s about a girl. 
                        Unfortunately, you’re not it.

           Harley grabs THE PICTURE and RIPS it in front of Nick’s face.

                                 HARLEY
                        I liked you once, ya know.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        That’s the problem, doll. Cupid 
                        shoots to kill here. And apparently 
                        so do you if the money’s right.

                        You used to be a classy hustle,

                        spread like butter. What’s with it?

           Harley shoves Nick off of the bed.

                                 HARLEY
                        I thought you were gone, Nick!
                     (angry now)
                        You’ve known me for a liftetime. 
                        Don’t treat me like some cheap 
                        trick on 9 to 5 chump change.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You are cheap, Harley. But those 
                        tricks are all I’ve got.

           Harley slumps into the sheets, where Nick’s gun is nestled 
           right under his pillow. She takes it, hides it behind her:

                        It’s all peaches n’ cream to me.

           Nick slides into his overcoat and goes for the door.

                                 HARLEY
                        Wait! Nicky... no matter how many

                        only guy I kiss for free.

           He pauses momentarily... thinks a beat... then removes his 
           wallet. THE ENTIRE THING IS EMPTY. He smiles at Harley.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Right. Keep the change.

           She gives him a playful but guilty smirk as he exits.

           EXT. FIASCO AVENUE - DAWN

           A few drops of rain split against the asphalt, signaling a 
           brief intermission in the hovering storm above. As...

           An anxious NEWSBOY runs to the corner with the morning’s 
           freshest headline. He lifts the paper over his head.

                                 NEWSBOY 
                        Extra, extra!! Underdog takes “Gold 
                        Mitts” in upset match. Extra! Third

                        seconds. Hot news here!! Mormon 
                        gets released on good behavior...

           Nick stops dead upon hearing the name “MORMON”. He grabs a 
           paper and flips the kid a quarter. Browses the front page.

                                 NEWSBOY
                        Thanks mister.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No sweat, kid.

           Nick takes the last drag from his cigarette and wedges the 
           paper inside his overcoat. Here comes the rain again.

           (cid:13)           INT. ANNE’S SODA SHOP - DAWN

           LUCKY, looking more unkempt than ever, shuffles a deck of 
           cards in his hand. He only looks up as NICK enters the shop. 

           He flips the POLAROID OF HOPE to the top of his deck... 

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Here I am shufflin’ for the Queen 
                        a’ Hearts, when in walks my 
                        wildcard. And this is where the 
                        ride begins, so buckle the fuck up.

           CLOSE ON: A STREAM OF AMBER LIQUID flows into an icy mug. A 
           fresh layer of foam crests the rim, gliding down the glass.

                                 ANNE
                        Well, look who’s back? Alive. And 
                        soaked to the bone I might add.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        It’s okay. I needed a shower.

           ANNE slams the mug on the counter and plops in a scoop of ice 
           cream. 

                                 ANNE
                        One root beer float. Your usual.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Thanks Anne.

           Nick has a seat and sets down the damp paper.

                                 ANNE
                        Rumors say ya went and got yourself 
                        killed... where ya really been?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Resting. In peace. But I’m back now 
                        looking for a missin’ person.

                                 ANNE
                        But ain’t you the reason they go 
                        missin’ in the first place?

           Nick tosses the paper aside and takes a long slug off the 
           float. He loves it - pops the cherry in his mouth. Now...

           Lucky ponies up to the counter and slides HIS POLAROID of 
           Hope across the counter.

                                 LUCKY
                        Anne, you seen a gal come in here? 
                        About 5’9. Blue eyes. Reads like 
                        trouble if ya look past the blonde.

           Nick suddenly perks up on his stool -- he begins to listen.

                                 LUCKY
                        Once or twice. Likes it rough.

                        Wait a second, Cassanova...
                     (grabbing the polaroid)
                        How do you know this girl?

                                 LUCKY
                        What’s it to you, chief? 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Everything. I’m here to find her. 
                        She has something that belongs to 
                        someone who wants it sometime soon.

                                 LUCKY
                        So you know this dame?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And she never likes it rough.

                                 LUCKY
                        Look pal, finding this broad is my 
                        case. And I got a lot ridin’ on it. 
                        Like my beatin’ heart for starters. 
                        So don’t try bullyin’ me around 
                        ‘cause I ain’t doin’ your homework.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You say another word and I’ll put 
                        your beatin’ heart out of its 
                        misery.

                        What do you know about Hope?

                                 LUCKY
                        Say, you got a name pal?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No. But I love killin’ people who 
                        got ‘em. What’s yours?

           AND SUDDENLY - all the diner patrons go dead silent. Even the 
           jukebox dies. It’s like the entire place was just put on 
           mute. Every ear listening to the distant sounds of...

           AN ICE CREAM TRUCK

           A playful jingle that would seem harmless if not heralding 
           the presence of a killer. Each high-pitched note more deadly 
           than the last. This is a cruel calling card.

                                 LUCKY
                        He’s 31 flavors of trouble. That 
                        chocolate-chipped fuck.

           ONE MOTHER in a corner booth grabs her children, holding them 
           tight. Another WOMAN at the pie rack brings her OVERWEIGHT 
           CHILD in close.

           Lucky pockets his deck and lowers into a nearby booth. Other 
           patrons follow his lead and drop out of sight, holding their 
           breath in pure silence. That is, everyone but Nick...

           He calmly sits at the bar finishing his root beer float -as- 
           THE ICE CREAM TRUCK CREEPS PAST THE FRONT WINDOWS.

           Anne slowly rises as the malicious tune trails off.

                                 ANNE
                        He here for you, Nick?.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Think so.

           Nick finishes the last drop of his float. He slides the mug 
           across the bar -just as- the obese kid breaks from his 
           mother’s grasp and hauls ass out of the shop. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh my God - Tommy NO!!

           Nick turns to the window and watches the kid chase down the 
           ice cream truck. The vehicle screeches to a stop. 

                                 MOTHER
                        HELP! My baby! Somebody please help 
                        my baby!

           Anne gives Nick a look that says something like... “Get the 
           fuck off your ass and help the kid”.

           Nick shakes his head in regret, grabs the crucifix dangling 
           from his neck, and says the Cliff’s Notes version of a 
           prayer. He reaches for his gun -- but it’s not there:

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                     (to self -- realizing)
                        Harley. Damn she’s good.

           Now, Nick stands and turns to the counter.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Anne. You still servin’ the special?

           Anne smiles. She reaches under the counter and WHIPS OUT A 
           POLISHED S&W .38 SPECIAL. Sleek. Custom “J” frame. Solid 
           steel grips. She flips open the revolving cylinder.

           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                 ANNE
                        Trigger’s been taken in. Quicker 
                        than a jackrabbit on roller skates. 
                        Bad thing is... I only got one 
                        bullet.

           She stands a single HOLLOW POINT on the counter. Nick 
           hesitates for the fraction of a second.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Add it to my bill.

           Nick takes the bullet and flips the chamber. He watches it 
           spin in his grip, then slings the chamber back into socket. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT (CONT’D)
                        Fuckin’ fat kid and his ice cream.

           As he exits, Lucky slides over to the window and rips the 
           blinds apart in anticipation of this showdown.

           INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           The window slowly opens as fat kid approaches. He bluntly 
           demands his order. 

                                 FAT KID
                        Rocky Road. Double scoop.

           FROSTY eyes the child salaciously. White apron. Black bowtie. 
           Paper vendor hat angled on his forehead. If it wasn’t for the 
           enormous scar down his cheek, he’d actually look the part.

           ANGLE ON: THE FREEZER. A HALF-FROZEN CORPSE crammed in amidst 
           the tubs of ice cream. Frosty brushes a limb aside and digs 
           his scoop into the carton of Rocky Road. 

           He passes the ice cream through the window, just as...

                                 NICK THE SAINT (O.S.)
                        HEY KID -- SCRAM!!!

           Frosty comes to attention. His chapped lips curl into a 
           devilish smile. Here’s the challenge he’s been waiting for. 

           ANGLE ON: A SECOND FREEZER opens to reveal a styrofoam case 
           housing the dissembled parts of a TOMMY GUN. 

           EXT. FIASCO AVENUE - CONTINUOUS

           A DROP OF SWEAT BREAKS ACROSS NICK’S TEMPLE.

           WIND BLOWS - CLOUDS ROLL - THE TUNES OF AN ICE CREAM TRUCK

           AND SUDDENLY, WE ZOOM INTO THE REAR DOORS OF THE TRUCK AS 
           THEY BURST OPEN IN FULL FUCKING FORCE!!!

           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)           RAT-TAT-TAT... Mr. Frosty comes out in a blaze. The TOMMY GUN 
           spitting hot shells across the pavement. Muzzle flashing like 
           lighting in the palm of his hand.

           Nick runs for cover behind a battered CONTINENTAL -as- lead 
           dances around him. Bullets everywhere! POP -- the tires 
           explode! Hot ammo drilling into the automobile’s frame. 

           Now, a pause... a momentary pause. The killer’s weapon 
           dispelling smoke into the atmosphere. He admires his work.

           Nick staggers to his knee. Engine smoking over his left 
           shoulder. Glass still trickling from above. This is gonna get 
           worse and he damn well knows it.

           ANGLE ON: THE FAT KID. Dazed. Startled by the commotion. His 
           ice cream melting to the asphalt at his feet.

                                 NICK THE SAINT 
                     (signaling)
                        Kid! Move! Get outta the street!

           Mr. Frosty grits his teeth and lets it rip. The neighborhood 
           goes to hell! Bullets whizzing in every direction. Fragments 
           of brick and mortar come together in mid-air chaos.

           Frosty laughs... chime of the ice cream truck still ringing, 
           taunting, as all other noise falls away. Store fronts being 
           dismantled by the utensil of a hardened lunatic. The sinister 
           jingle bringing a sense of art to his destructive handiwork.

           Fat kid starts crying as the piercing noise of each bullet 
           strikes closer than the last. He’s paralyzed with fear...

           But, NICK MAKES HIS MOVE. He sprints across the intersection 
           and grabs the boy by the collar. Lifting him, he swings the 
           kid under his arm and dives behind a black ‘37 FORD... a 
           trail of ammo sparking at his heels. 

           Another pause. The ice cream man is ready to reload -but- 
           Nick doesn’t hesitate for one fuckin’ second. He jumps from 
           the steaming car, aims the .38 special, AND...

           BAM!

           THE SHOT ECHOES...

           A PAPER ICE CREAM HAT FLOATS IN THE WIND...

           THE GLEE JINGLE CONTINUES TO CHIME as...

           THE ICE CREAM MAN DROPS TO HIS KNEES. His head sinks - a 
           fresh wound smoking within it. Blood begins trickling down 
           his white apron as he falls. HARD.

           Local kids pour onto the street -- it’s utter shock. All 
           witnesses to the death of a childhood landmark, the ice cream 
           man face down in a puddle of blood.

           her child.

                                 MOTHER
                        Oh, baby! You’re safe! My baby!

           Nick slips the “special” into his waistline. Barrel still 
           sizzling - smoke surging in his face. He strikes a stoic pose 
           and SIGNS THE CROSS, overcoat flowing in the wind.

           A SINGLE CAMERA BULB FLASHES. 

           He makes his way through the commotion unperturbed. An 
           undaunted killer, unassuming savior.

           THEN - A SERIES OF BULBS FLASHING. This is tomorrow’s 
           headline... but Nick doesn’t care. He just presses forward, 
           out of sight. 

           BACK INSIDE THE SODA SHOP

           Lucky turns to Anne with astonishment on his face.

                                 LUCKY
                        Un-be-fuckin’-lieveable. That’s raw 
                        talent in the flesh!! 

           Lucky instantly rushes out of the diner in pursuit of Nick.

           INT. FIASCO AVENUE - CONTINUOUS 

           Nick angles his Fedora, flips his collar. Hands are shaking. 
           Here’s where we can see the shaken nerves after his gunfight.

           And without anticipation...

                                 LUCKY (O.S.)
                        I can help ya find the girl.

           Nick rips “the special” from his belt and spins to find... 
           LUCKY DOYLE holding up THE POLAROID from the diner.

                                 LUCKY
                        Spotted her at a bare knuckle brawl 
                        couple nights back.

           Nick steadies the gun.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You again! Who the hell are you!?!

                                 LUCKY
                        The name’s Doyle. Lucky Doyle.

                        and I get my own stationary.

           In a flash, Nick grabs Lucky by the collar and throws him face 
           first against a window -- gun firm to the back of his head.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I hope you ain’t prone to bullshit.

                        It’s no fib! I seen her at that 
                        fight - she was arm n’ arm with 
                        some mysterious figure.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Did you get a face?

                                 LUCKY
                        No. Hence the “mysterious” figure.

                        Look. If I saw him again, I’d be 
                        able to slip the tags on. I never 
                        forget a healthy physique.

           Nick lets Lucky go, but still keeps the “empty” gun trained.

           Nick enters his disheveled room. Choppy bits of neon spilling 
           through the blinds, as the slow twirl of a ceiling fan cuts 
           the shadows perfectly. Taking a pull from a bottle of whiskey:

                        Nobody sent me. Just thought we 
                        could help each other since we’re 
                        both bobbin’ for the same broad. We 
                        could swap 411... team up.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Team up? So there’s a deal at the 
                        bottom of your glass?

                        shoot me back there. That was 
                        traumatic.

                        I kill people for a living. Were 
                        you expecting a handshake and a 
                        warm pat on the ass?
                     (a beat)
                        Besides, I didn’t do it.

                        You’re a real sweetheart.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Yet.

           Nick opens a sock drawer that’s fully stocked with ammo. He 
           removes a DESSERT EAGLE, tucking it under the pillow of his 
           bed. Then he reloads “The Special” and holsters it along with 
           his Glock 31. Finally, he opens the snack bar and retrieves 
           TWO SMALL DETONATOR devices -- hi-tech looking shit.

           Lucky just watches.

                        Now that we’ve had our meet-cute, 
                        there are just a few things I’ll 
                        need to go over.

                        I’m famished. Do you like Thai?

           Nick and Lucky enter the elevator as the doors open. Nick 
           pushes the ground floor button...

                        You have 24 hours to come up with 
                        the girl... right?

                                 LUCKY
                        Right.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Wrong. You have 21 hours. I break 
                        for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
                        During those times, we’re off the

                        I don’t like too much attention, so 
                        you’ll have to be invisible while 
                        I’m here. Translation: just keep

                        For the most part, you are an

                        means I’ll be the only one dealing 
                        with guns, knives and other things

                        Never, and by that I mean never, 
                        tell anyone that our hips are 
                        joined. It’s called trust. And if

                        Hi. Table for two please.

           INT. RESTAURANT BOOTH - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Nick slurps up a noodle from his Pad Thai platter...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        If I take a bullet for you, which 
                        I’d rather not do under our current 
                        agreement, I’ll have to charge a 
                        small fee. Pain & grievances.

           Lucky forces a smile and sips some green tea. His expression 
           says everything...”THE FUCK? I just hired Tony Montana to 
           watch my back”.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        So. Are you good with the terms?

                                 LUCKY
                        I can live with the terms.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Good. Then our “stakes” are on the 
                        same plate until we find the gal.

                                 LUCKY
                        Okay. So. Isn’t there a contract I 
                        needed to sign? A... CT17... or 
                        whatever?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Nah. It’s all verbal. We’re good.
                     (beat)
                        Are you gonna finish your spring 
                        roll?

           Lucky looks a little perplexed as Nick scoops the last 
           remaining spring roll from his plate.

                                 LUCKY
                        Just wondering. Why do they call 
                        you “The Saint”? There’re rumors 
                        that you’re trained by thieves, 
                        protected by God... 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And on Sundays, I walk on water 
                        between the hours of 2 and 4.
                     (now deadpan)
                        Don’t believe everything you hear. 
                        Maybe for someone who kills people, 
                        I’m just a really nice fuckin’ guy.

                                 LUCKY
                        Maybe. But you ain’t some chump 
                        with an itchy finger. That I know. 
                        And folks say ya’ve never killed 
                        anyone who didn’t have it coming.

                     (to passing waitress)
                        Can you bring him the check please?

           Lucky reaches for his wallet as Nick lights up a fresh smoke.

                                 LUCKY
                        So. Ya got any leads?

                        A very dead source told me that 
                        Sweats Polino can point fingers.

                        That greasy fuck, sure. He works 
                        out of a pawn shop on Grand.

                        Say, what’s with all the heat on 
                        this piece a’ patch anyhow?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Her name is Hope. And she has 
                        something considerably valuable 
                        with her. Something everyone is 
                        gonna want to get their mitts on.

                                            WHIP PAN TO:

           EXT. INDIAN GIVER PAWN SHOP - MOMENTS LATER 

           Lucky is standing outside the front door of a small pawn 
           shop. He smiles at passersby, trying to distract them from 
           the mass pandemonium echoing from inside.

           INT. INDIAN GIVER PAWN SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           WHACK! NICK bitch-slaps a repulsive pawn shop broker across 
           the face with a violin. Three strings pop on impact.

           The broker falls backward holding his face. He’s a greasy 
           slimebag, ratty hair. Face scarred from years of acne. And he 
           is almost IDENTICAL TO FLASK. Meet twin brother... SWEATS 
           POLINO. Definitely the uglier of the two.

                     (cough)
                        It really pithed him off when you 
                        tried to jump town without thaying 
                        goodbye. That was jush fuckin’ rude.

                        she’s here. Your brother told me 
                        you’ve seen her.

                        I left because I wanted out. Plain. 
                        Simple. And non-negotiable.  

           Sweats struggles to a knee and wipes his greasy forehead.

                                 SWEATS
                        That’s what you think.  We ain’t 
                        some gang bang operation pushin’ 8 
                        balls at rethess anymore. It’s big 
                        time now. We’re turning over more 
                        coke, more heroine, and more thmiles 
                        than a fuckin’ happy meal. So, you 
                        have no idea the thower of thit 
                        you’re dancing in by whackin’ on a 
                        made guy with an antique violin. I’m 
                        a big shot in thith town!!

           WHAM! Nick splinters the violin across Sweats’ face.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And I bet you can make pussy wet 
                        just by winkin’ at it.
                     (focused)
                        Where is she? Where’s Hope?

                                 SWEATS
                     (laughing)
                        Hope? You really care about that 
                        glossed up dame? YOU’RE. THO. 
                        FUCKED. <cough><cough> And your 
                        little valentine’s gonna get fucked 
                        right alongthide ya. 
                     (cough-cough)
                        She’s playing ya, Saint. Like a 
                        puppet on chain-link wires. 

           Blood begins pouring down Sweats’ nose. Nick tosses him a 
           handkerchief from a glass counter nearby. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Here... you’re leakin’, Sweats. I 
                        think I busted a pipe or two.

                        And while I’ve got your attention, 
                        I have a message for Doughboy.

                                 SWEATS
                        Yeah, what’s that?

           Nick removes a SILENCED SIG-SAUER and aims smack between the 
           eyes.... SPHIT! SPHIT! SPHIT! Blood peppers the mirrors.

           Hearing the noise, Lucky pokes his head inside to find Nick 
           signing the cross over Sweats’ dead corpse. And... he quickly 
           shuts the door. Acts like he didn’t see a thing.

           INT. LIP LOUNGE KARAOKE CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           The nightclub is dimly lit. An Italian joint lined with red 
           leather booths and musical motifs. Rich cigar smoke actuates 
           the air softening the mood to a smooth shade of gray.

           On the stage, your typical “broad in a night club” sings and 
           tosses a few winks to her crowd. She wears a white gown, fits 
           like a glove -but- more glitter than glamour.

           Now, we slowly pull back to reveal the singer reading her 
           words from a cue. Vacant piano - no musicians on stage. And 
           we realize, she’s singing karaoke... with a splash of noir. 

           She delivers an enticing smile to some poor sap in the front 
           row (guy’s wife probably has dinner wrapped in the fridge by 
           now) then turns, winks, and blows a kiss right to the camera. 

           CAMERA HURLS BACK TO THE BAR where Nick and Lucky chip at 
           their cocktails like programmed alcoholics. They’re 
           surrounded by Italian greasers in yarmulkes. This is 
           obviously wiseguy territory.

                                 LUCKY
                        I bet she’s lip syncing.

                        Why are you trying to bet me? Were 
                        you raised under a power line?

                                 LUCKY
                        Definitely lipping.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Just stop talking, stop thinking, 
                        and stop fucking existing until I 
                        finish my drink. Please.  

           Nick turns his gaze to the lustrous lounge singer. He stares, 
           and it only takes her a second to notice.

           far as gangsters go. And PS... he’s a bonafide prick.

           He winks at Nick and makes a pumping motion with his fist. As 
           in... “Yeah. I’m fuckin’ her”.

           Nick smiles vehemently and signals for two drinks.

                                 TENDER SAL
                        I seen that look before, and it 
                        usually means I gotta mop my floors 
                        in the morning. 
                     (pouring)
                        Just play nice would ya, Nick? He’s 
                        a heavy roller now. You don’t wanna 
                        reputation for puttin’ out the 
                        wrong stars.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Stars are meant for shooting, Sal. 
                        That’s how ya wish on ‘em.

           Nick grabs the drinks and turns to Lucky.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You. Stay.

           AT McBANISTER’S BOOTH

           Nick drops in opposite McBanister. We can tell there’s a 
           rivalry here. Question is whether it’s friendly or not.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Welcome back, Nick. Mind if you 
                        join me?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Not yet anyway.

           Nick slides the fresh cocktail across the table.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        I quit.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        So we’ll drink to old habits. Or 
                        was it only the hard stuff that set 
                        your gun off?

                                 MCBANISTER
                        You’re just jealous because I had 
                        all the good gigs. I’m on contract 
                        with The Catholics now, see. Part 
                        time. Great benefits. A 401k.

           Nick lights up a fresh smoke.

                        Sorry to hear that. Thought they 
                        had enough choirboys to fondle.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Cute. Very cute. 

           McBanister laughs it off and nods to the girl on stage.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        So whatdaya think of my new 
                        squeeze? They just don’t make 
                        trophies like that anymore, eh? Too 
                        many curves.

           Nick puts on a generic smile.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Yeah. I’m lookin’ for a girl 
                        myself. Seen her?

           Nick slides Lucky’s polaroid of Hope across the table.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Why you askin’ about this dame?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Curiosity. I hear it killed a cat 
                        once.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        And it’ll kill you too if ya keep 
                        on with the questions. 
                     (beat)
                        There’s too many gals to shake at 
                        in this cum dump city. Try the lost 
                        n’ found... maybe she’ll turn up.

           McBanister starts to get edgy as his lady wraps her set. It’s 
           easy to see he’s hiding something.

                                 MCBANISTER (CONT’D)
                        Why ya really here, Nick? What for?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Good reason. Bad intention. Maybe a 
                        mix of the two?
                     (beat)
                        Her name’s Hope. Just a gal who got 
                        tossed in the wrong drink with the 
                        wrong folks. Now she’s thin air 
                        with no tracks to follow. Faded out 
                        with something of high value -- 
                        something my current employers want 
                        back.

                        You and me got history... it’s the

                     (cold)
                        I said I ain’t seen her. 
                     (colder)
                        But while there’s history on the 
                        table, I should probly let ya know 
                        that “The Mormon” was released.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        He’s out?

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Good behavior. Turned his last 
                        parole hearing into some PSA for 
                        that latter day bullshit. Not to 
                        mention, he had a wife on the 
                        committee. Those bitches are 
                        everywhere.

           Curtains fall as the stage crew resets for the next act.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        He’s workin’ for Doughboy again.
                     (cheshire grin)
                        See, I’d stiff ya myself -- but I’m 
                        givin’ ya the night off. Only since 
                        I know he’ll be lookin’ for old 
                        scores to polish up on.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Thanks for the clemency, it plays 
                        real genuine. Must be all the 
                        clergy they got ya hummin’ on. 

           McBanister opens his jacket enough to reveal the P.08 LUGER 
           holstered inside. He shakes his head.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Speakin’ of all that, I stopped to 
                        see your old gal Harley while you 
                        were out. She’s good company. Still 
                        partin’ those legs like the Red 
                        fuckin’ Sea.

           Nick LUNGES across the table -BUT- McBanister already has the 
           Lugor trained in his face. He’s clearly touched a nerve.

                                 MCBANISTER
                        I know. It’s not nice to point. And 
                        I’m usually one for manners, but 
                        you’re still crazy like a gypsy 
                        fuck, man.

                        Now. Are we done catchin’ up on 
                        times of ole?

           Nick tries to make a move -BUT NOW- every Italian in the bar 
           whips out a gun and points in his direction.

                                 NICK THE SAINT

                        And take your pet loser with ya.

           Nick holsters the gun he had poised under the table -- 
           McBanister lays down his Luger as well. It could have been a 
           tie, but we’ll never know. Then...

           Two doormen roughly escort Nick/Lucky from the club.

                        When you get sick of the four star 
                        treatment, let’s try things my way.

           INSERT INVESTIGATION MONTAGE

           SHOT: Nick/Lucky show the pic to a garbage man. It’s a “No”. 

           SHOT: Lucky talks to an albino gang at a pool hall. “No”.

           SHOT: At a pharmacy. The tattooed pharmacist shakes “No”. 

           SHOT: Flashing the pic to a biker gang at a dive bar. “No”.

           SHOT: Interrogating some poor junkie at an AA meeting. “No”.

           EXT. BLACK MARKETPLACE - DUSK - “1 HOUR LATER”

           Welcome to the black market. A street bazaar so big it makes 
           K-mart look like a garage sale. Anything can be purchased 
           here for a price: Arms, drugs, illegal immigrants. Anything.

           We PAN through the masses to find our guys. Lucky is shaking 
           hands with the PERSIAN OWNER of a small flower kiosk. But the 
           slant is... there are no flowers here. Just a smorgasbord of 
           illegal horticulture. 

           This boutique is brimming with coca plants, mushrooms, and 
           all the marijuana you can imagine. Winter Koning. White 
           Widow. B-52. Northern Lights. All labeled appropriately in a 
           mom & pop organization that could make the FDA shit bricks.

           Lucky shows the owner HOPE’S PHOTO, but Persian shakes a 
           negative and takes another hit of the Chef’s special. Now, 
           Lucky changes angles and leads us to a small newsstand nearby.

           FRONTPAGE SAM quietly sits reading an issue of LIFE MAGAZINE.

                        Not this time, Sam. I’m gettin’ 
                        outta the number business. Direct 
                        orders from God.

                        Yeah, I heard he had an eye on you. 
                        So that being the case -- I’ll keep 
                        the news to myself.

           Sam flips over the SPORTS SECTION of the most recent paper.

                        somethin’ else... 

           Lucky whips out a tattered napkin with digits scribbled 
           across it. Nick watches curiously over his shoulder.

                                 LUCKY
                        ...These digits belong to a license 
                        plate. I need to know whose. Can ya 
                        play it for me, Sam?

                                 FRONTPAGE SAM
                        Yeah, I can play it. I’ll flip ya 
                        the fresh headline in fifty ticks 
                        to an hour.

                        You’re a gem. A diamond in the

                        Let’s just hope you’re outta that 
                        slump next time I see ya. Get ya 
                        swingin’ for the fences again.

                        And that’s what got me in the slump 
                        to begin with. 

           Lucky winks to his old friend and turns away with Nick. And 
           as they walk, we’ll pass through a small construction zone -- 
           about 10 PUERTO RICANS paving a sidewalk with fresh cement.

                        Well. If you’re comparing the miracle 
                        of shaking tits to spending time with 
                        you, I’d much prefer the tits 10 to 1. 
                        Although, a case can be made that you 
                        are in fact an enormous boob. With an 
                        astoundingly profane vocabulary.

                        of a bitch, aren’t you?

           SUDDENLY, Nick has a gun to his head. AND NOW, Lucky does 
           too. All 10 “ARMED” CONSTRUCTION WORKERS surrounding them.

           Nick PUTS A HAND ON THE CEMENT TRUCK as the Puerto Ricans 
           force him over the wet concrete, leading him further down the 
           alley. And what we’ll notice... is that he has casually left 
           one of his SMALL BLINKING DEVICES on the churning truck.

                        Sorry, I don’t speak French.

                     (very articulate)
                        I believe that he said you’re about 
                        to die. With lots of profanities 
                        sprinkled in for good measure.

           Nick looks up to see MICK THE MORMON approaching out of the 
           darkness. And we can see the meaning of the word “NEMESIS” 
           just by the hatred sparkling in his glare.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Welcome back, partner. Or, I guess ex-
                        partner is more politically correct. 
                        I was never really one for details.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Details like stabbing a friend in 
                        the back. You mean “actual” details 
                        like that, right Mormon?

                        Mormon? That’s Mick The Mormon?

           Mormon steps into Nick’s personal space, pops a stick of 
           bubblegum in his mouth and blows a HUGE bubble.

                                 THE MORMON
                        You’ve got a sack of brass coming 
                        back here, Nicky. But that big 
                        swingin’ dick always draws a crowd.

           Mormon lifts up an issue of the FIASCO TIMES evening edition -
           - a picture of NICK’S SHOWDOWN AT THE DINER covers page one.

                        But I’m not here for reunions, so 
                        I’ll make this short and painful. 
                        You don’t get out of Fiasco 
                        Heights, Nick. You die here, and 
                        your soul dies here with you.  

           Nick tries to make a move, but the Puerto Rican Workers click 
           their hammers.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Careful now! We got a real life 
                        Mexican stand-off here, aye Nick?
                     (off Nick’s reserve)
                        C’mon. Where’s your sense of humor?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Never heard of him.

           The Mormon begins screwing a silencer onto his pistol. 

                                 THE MORMON
                        Thing is, you can’t quit “The 
                        Franchise” whenever ya want. It’s a 
                        syndicate, not a fuckin’ temp agency. 
                        Ain’t no paid vacations in our line 
                        of work, Saint Nick. 
                     (beat)
                        You know what a “mandate” is?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Other than a noun, it’s the last 
                        thing you’ll say before I kill 
                        everyone here holding a gun.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Don’t be silly - look around. You don’t 
                        have a spic’s chance. Literally. And 
                        they’ve got hedges to trim in the 
                        morning, so let’s expedite this thing. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        10 seconds.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Mandate. “An authoritative command 
                        handed down from the most supreme...

           BEEP.... BEEP... BEEP...

           And, The Mormon turns to the cement truck just as...

           KA-BLOOOM! A WAVE OF WET CEMENT BLOWS ACROSS THE SCENE!

           Nick grabs Lucky and ducks behind a pile-on as cement eructs 
           overhead with tsunami force. Glass shatters... metal debris 
           flies overhead... car alarms sounding off everywhere.

           Drops of cement rain down like snow flurries as the chaos 
           settles. And that’s exactly when...

           RICANS molded into place by a ton of wet concrete. NONE OF 
           THEM CAN DODGE FAST ENOUGH, moving in slow motion.

           BAM. BAM. BAM. Nick goes around the scene, putting a fresh 
           bullet in each man with a gun. It’s the easiest round of 
           target practice anyone’s ever taken aim to.

           He stops. Each victim slumped in a coat of drying cement, 
           like salt pillars streaked in blood. But THE MORMON is gone.

                                 LUCKY
                        Tickle my ass - that was gravy!!

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Shut-up and follow me. These are 
                        only the early birds...

           Nick takes off his “wet” overcoat - it clanks to the ground 
           with a THUD. He grabs Lucky’s arm and pulls him along.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (CONT’D)
                        They always travel in packs.

           And on the period of that sentence - MACHINE GUNS ECHO!!! 

                                 LUCKY
                        Sounds about right!

           Nick and Lucky race back into THE BLACK MARKETPLACE, a poker 
           table goes over as they begin tumbling through a series of 
           booths to make their escape. A HOARD OF GUNMEN BEHIND THEM.

           BOOTH > AFTER BOOTH > AFTER BOOTH > AFTER BOOTH > AFTER BOOTH

           Finally, they plow through an assemblage of Arabs admiring 
           the newest dirty-bomb prototypes... and into safe passage.

           EXT. FIASCO BOULEVARD - CONTINUOUS 

           Once on the street, Lucky hunches over to catch his breath. 

                                 LUCKY
                        I swear, I’m coming. One sec.

           Nick turns to his pathetic partner.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No stopping!

           AND LUCKY VOMITS. Everywhere. The pink kind of vomit that 
           says your lungs haven’t seen exercise in years.

           Then pukes up another batch. Round two.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Oh Jesus. I don’t believe this.

                                 LUCKY
                        Okay - I think I’m good.

           Nick and Lucky bolt across the street free and clear. Well, 
           for at least a second or two -- or however long it took for 
           those THREE FORD MODEL A TUDORS TO SCREAM AROUND THE CORNER!

           Lucky jumps forward as rapid fire clicks at his heel. In the 
           near distance, Nick finds our getaway. It’s coming right for 
           us. It’s...

           transportation method should come with a warning label. It’s 
           built on an elevated train rail -however- the passenger car 
           hangs vertically from the track, suspending over the ground.

           Nick hops onto the panel and lifts Lucky into this trolley-
           esque rail car. A supped up TUDOR only a few yards behind.

           Lucky pans the car... ENTIRE THING IS PACKED WITH SENIOR 
           CITIZENS. Obvious tourists on leave from the retirement home. 
           Cameras begin clicking, each tourist wears a sweatshirt that 
           says, “I SURVIVED FIASCO HEIGHTS”.

                                 LUCKY
                        Yes. Let’s think positive.

           Their TOUR GUIDE drops his mic and ducks for cover as...

           RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT. Fresh ammunition dances across the 
           exterior sending the tourists into a frenzy.

           “VROOOM” - ALL THREE TUDORS ARE CLOSING IN FROM BEHIND.

           Nick grabs a hand bar and leans off the open rail, unloading 
           hell into the first vehicle. No luck. Time to focus. He 
           steadies -- finger taught on the trigger -- and fires...

           CRACK! Direct hit! The bullet pierces the windshield, sending 
           the driver’s head off like a pinata. Tudor spins out of 
           control - tires giving way - and flips into pure bedlam. 

           Nick smiles as the tudor continues to mash across the 
           asphalt. THE HOOD BLOWS. ENGINE IGNITES. BOOOOOOM!

           ONE TOURIST SNAPS A PICTURE. He wears hearing aids -- thinks 
           it’s all part of the tour. Next...

           TUDOR #2 speeds up on the right, getting even with the 
           passengers, while TUDOR #3 speeds up on the left. WE’RE 
           FLANKED! But Nick steps into the middle of the car, aiming 
           his guns in opposite directions... and goes to work.

           (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)           One round in, TUDOR #2 peels from its lane and SLAMS HEAD-ON 
           INTO AN ONCOMING FOURTEEN WHEELER. The collision sending a 
           fireball the size of a boulder into the rear of our ride.

           The force alone rips us from the raised line and jars our 
           small car right off its rails. Live electricity spews from an 
           overhead conduit as the express slams to the ground,  free-
           wheeling down the hilly streets of central Fiasco. 

           BAM! GUNFIRE CONTINUES RAGING FROM THE ROGUE METRO. BAM!

           TUDOR #3 pulls back and falls in behind us. A MARKSMAN 
           stepping onto the exterior floor panel with a readied TOMMY 
           GUN in his grasp. HE LETS IT RIP!

           Nick holds firm as bullets graze his head. He isn’t dodging 
           them, merely being thrown from their path as the rail car 
           veers right, then left, then right again. 

           No more games. Saint edges around the front of the vehicle 
           taking a “hail mary” shot that blows the Marksman’s hat off. 
           Just happens most of his head is still in it.

           TUDOR #3 swerves violently, then regains control.

                        END OF THE ROAD!

           Nick turns to discover the runaway express speeding towards...

           HANGMAN’S PARK

           HE SIGNS THE CROSS...

           EXT. HANGMAN’S PARK - CONTINUOUS 

           A quiet setting. Cobblestone bridge stretching across a steep 
           decline filled with pine and cedar. White-capped moss swaying 
           within the rock of a sarconic arch. 

           We pan up to a wooden sign - HANGMAN’S PARK - which instantly 
           SPLINTERS TO PIECES as our metro explodes over the 
           cobblestone breaking 100.

           RAIL CAR NOSEDIVES THROUGH THE TREES AS WE WHIP DOWNHILL. And 
           you can bet your ass there’s been a heart attack by now.

           SMASH! The vehicle ping-pongs between two oak trees and slams 
           through a gazebo. Inertia hits like a crushing stab in the 
           back as the car lifts into the air, sailing forward... 

           ...And drives back into the earth. Nick holds his composure 
           and fires at the pursuing Tudor. Screams from every angle.

           NICK’S POV ON: A REAR BREAK LINE HANGING FROM THE EXIT PANEL. 
           Nick pushes to the back, velocity working against him as the 
           trolley goes red on the speedometer.
                                                                 (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)           AND WE’RE COMING TO A BODY OF WATER. HANGMAN’S POND. It’s 
           growing on us like we’re free falling through the trees.

           PICKING UP MORE SPEED NOW! 110. 112. 114. 

           Nick pulls himself to the rear cabin - impact no more than 40 
           yards away. He reaches for the break line... THIN EMERGENCY 
           WIRE DANGLING FROM THE EXIT PANEL. Almost got it.

           WE’RE PLOWING OVER SMALL PINES. FASTER. FASTER. FASTER...

           Suddenly, TUDOR #3 slams into the rear of the car, knocking 
           Nick over the rail and onto the Tudor’s hood. He latches onto 
           the front grill, tilting his gun over the hood. And Nick puts 
           a FULL CLIP THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- brain matter splashing 
           the windows. But then...

           Saint immediately drops from the grill, lands on his back, 
           and puts his chin to the dirt just as the Tudor whips right 
           over top him. He safely rolls out from under it, as...

           BOOOOOM! A ferocious explosion as the Tudor goes head on into 
           an oak tree. Glass, wood and metal shards fill the air.

           BACK ON LUCKY IN “THE EXPRESS”

           Gritting his teeth as the we approach the pond. THIS BUNDLE 
           OF RUNAWAY NOSTALGIA IS HEADED FOR A COLLISION. And here... 
           it... comes...

                                              ANGLE ON:

           A FULL FRONTAL OF RAIL CAR -- seconds before it slams into the 
           embankment FIRING LUCKY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD like 
           regurgitated food. He hits the water in a tremendous barrel 
           roll, like a rock skipping across its glassy surface. 

           After a beat, a few of the passengers begin stumbling off the 
           catastrophe. Minor cuts and bruises.

                                 FAT OLD WOMAN
                        I want my five motherfuckin’ 
                        dollars back!

                                 HEARING AID GUY
                        What?

           Nick brushes some dirt from his jacket, turning to find Lucky 
           UP TO HIS WAIST IN HANGMAN’S POND. Lucky spits out a mouthful 
           of water and begins to shiver. As he sloshes onto the shore:

                                 LUCKY
                     (teeth chattering)
                        D-d-don’t shay a w-w-w-word.

           And Lucky limps off through the park, agitated. Nick follows. 

                                        SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
                                                                (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)

           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)           INT. LUCKY’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           If Sam Spade had a low rent storage space with one window, 
           this would be it. Lucky sits in the corner with his feet in a 
           tub of warm water, stacks of smut magazines surround him.

           Nick walks to a small bookshelf beside him. Maybe a few 
           classic Chandler books, a few pictures of CHILDHOOD LUCKY 
           with his family -but then- a PICTURE OF LUCKY WITH A RACE 
           HORSE. Next to it is a CARTON OF GLUE. Nick picks it up. 

                                 LUCKY (O.S.)
                        Don’t touch that!

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        What? Why?

                                 LUCKY
                        That’s Lightning Suckerpunch. 
                        Aka... lucky horse #5. He’s the 
                        only family I have. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Don’t you mean had? And did you 
                        ever think that betting on anything 
                        in connection with the word 
                        “suckerpunch” was a bad idea?

                                 LUCKY
                        It was my father’s horse. I swore 
                        I’d look after him when he died. 
                        After all, Lightning was part of 
                        the family. But then I ran into 
                        trouble, the kind with dollar signs 
                        attached. So, I took Lightning to 
                        the straights and won a few bucks. 
                        Did good for a blink or two... but 
                        then he hit a 13 race loosing 
                        streak, broke his leg, and now he 
                        holds furniture together.  
                     (emotional beat)
                        As silly as it is... those are the 
                        remains of a dear friend. So 
                        please, hands off the glue.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Right. So it’s official.

                                 LUCKY
                        What?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You have down syndrome.

           Nick sits in a wooden rocking chair. Off Lucky’s sorrow:

                                 NICK THE SAINT (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I’m sorry, that was

           AND NOW... THE CAB SCREAMS TO A HAULT IN A HUGE CUL-DE-SAC!

           EXT. MCBANISTER’S PLACE - THE SUBURBS - CONTINUOUS

           It’s the almost perfect neighborhood. Lemonade stands. 
           Trimmed hedges. Picket fences on every corner. Just ignore 
           the fact that it’s all covered in graffiti. Gang turf. 

           Nick sprints toward McBanister’s home. The gate is open - 
           front door ajar. He pulls his gun and enters with caution.

           INT. MCBANISTER’S PLACE - CONTINUOUS

           The insides have been turned over. Every drawer, every shelf, 
           every room has been ransacked.

           ANGLE ON: MCBANISTER’S BODY LYING ON THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR.

           Nick kneels down in a pool of blood, lifts McBanister’s head. 

           Soon, Lucky enters to discover A BODY GUARD hanging from a 
           ceiling fan... corpse circling the room on a NOOSE.

           McBanister coughs up some blood. He’s been stabbed a few 
           times in the chest, shredded like a bowl of coleslaw.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Where is she, Pat? Tell me! 

           McBanister can barely move his lips. He points to a bookshelf 
           in the living room.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        What? What is it...?

           Nick tries to pinpoint what McBanister is aiming for.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I don’t see... was the girl here, 
                        Pat? 
                     (pleading)
                        Did she have the case? Was she her?

           McBanister nods his head, YES.

                        Where do I find her? Come on, 
                        McBanister! Where?!?

           McBanister starts to talk, but all we can hear is the 
           gurgling of blood in his throat....

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Find...the... safe.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        What safe?

           McBanister struggles.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        What’s inside it?

           And on the few remaining breathes he has left:

                                 MCBANISTER
                        Sa.. sa... sal...va...tion.

           Blood trickles from McBanister’s mouth for the last time.

                                 LUCKY 
                        Did he just say “salvation”?

           Nick nods his head, then checks McBanister’s pulse:

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        He’s dead.

                                 LUCKY
                     (re: churning guard)
                        Join the club. There’s dead folks 
                        decked all over the joint. This 
                        one’s a great centerpiece.

           Nick signs the cross over McBanister’s body. Final Respects 
           and all that jazz. Then he closes McBanister’s eyes, begins 
           reciting a prayer.

                                 LUCKY
                        Whatever they’re lookin’ for must 
                        be valuable enough to kill that sap 
                        and dig for gold spots.

           Now, Lucky walks over to the bookshelf noticing a book out of 
           place. A GIDEON BIBLE. He opens it to a bookmarked chapter, 
           where we see the outline of a key cut right into pages. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT (O.S.)
                        Salvation. 

                                 LUCKY
                        And I presume we’d need a key to 
                        find it. This “missing” key to be 
                        specific -- someone already took it.

Then he 
           stoops down to find something of interest. THE WORD “CLUE” 
           pops over AN EMPTY KETCHUP PACKET like a VH-1 bubble.

           Nick looks it over. Touches it to his tongue. Pockets it.

                     (to Lucky)
                        Mystery’s still the word, but as far 
                        as clues go, this one’s a keeper.

                                 LUCKY
                        It enough to play a lead?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        McBanister used to be a freelance 
                        trigger in Doughboy’s pocket. 
                        Lately, he’s been clockin’ in for 
                        The Catholics. Total switch-hitter.
                     (thinking)
                        Between the two syndicates, there’s 
                        either a power play in the works, or 
                        they’re both after the same thing.

                                 LUCKY
                        Your gal and her goody bag?

                                 HOPE (O.S.)
                        Or just the goody bag.

           Nicky/Lucky turn in unison to find HOPE CAUFIELD standing in 
           the bedroom doorway. She’s bruised, beaten, faint. Nick runs 
           over to her just as she collapses into his arms.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Hope!?!

                                 HOPE 
                        Right out of the past, isn’t it?

                        Jesus, Hope, what happened?

                                 HOPE
                        Got smacked around a bit. I’m 
                        usually one for free makeovers, but 
                        I don’t think the black and blue 
                        matches my shoes. 

           Hope props herself against the wall.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 HOPE
                        I was paying McBanister to help me 
                        find the case. “Salvation”.

                        cold. Boy, they sure don’t know how 
                        to treat a lady these days.

                        Gotcha. Face looks familiar.

           SUDDENLY -- POLICE SIRENS SCREAM FROM THE DISTANCE!

           Lucky rushes to the window as AN ENTIRE SQUAD OF POLICE CARS 
           SURROUND THE HOME. Each car has #52 painted on the hood.

                                 LUCKY
                        We’re patsy pot pie.

           Nick pulls his pistol and peers out the window.

                        The 52nd. It’s a set up.
                     (lowering blinds)
                        I’d back away from the window if I 
                        were you. They’re “criminal” with a 
                        Capitol One -- entire precinct is

           Nick adjusts his Fedora and takes the safety off his gun.

                        Way I pitch it, we’re all swimmin’ 
                        in the same hot water. Let’s stick 
                        together and find that case.

           CRASH -as- a GAS CANNISTER projects through the window, 
           hovering between our leads in SLOW MOTION -- SKULL AND 
           CROSSBONES spinning at it passes.

                                 LUCKY
                        Okay. We’ve got gas!

           BOOM...SPHISSS! The cannister destructs on impact. 
           Lucky/Nick/Hope cover their mouths and stay below the smoke.

           NOW - FOOTSTEPS ON THE ROOF. Hope grabs Nick’s spare gun and 
           fires into the ceiling. WE HEAR A BODY THUD, SLIDE, AND DROP 
           PAST THE WINDOW. Both Nick and Lucky stare at her in awe.

                                 HOPE
                        What? I had three brothers.
                     (moving to back door)
                        Not sure about you boys, but I 
                        don’t look good in frames. Let’s 
                        escort me out of here.

           Nick tears open a breaker box on the wall and flips a fuse, 
           killing the lights. Well, all of them except for THE 2ND 
           BLINKING PLASTIC DEVICE that he’ll mold to the front door.  

           Now, Nick goes to the back of the house and peeks out the 
           rear window. Quietly estimating the distance to an open 
           garage in the distance... his guess is about fifty feet.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        My guess is about 50 feet.

           herself. She hops into the driver’s seat. Nick and Lucky 
           stare... again.

           O’TOOLE -RED HEAD COP- KICKS IN THE FRONT DOOR, ordering a 
           platoon of blues into the pad. And what they’ll never notice, 
           is that the BLINKING DEVICE HAS STOPPED BLINKING. 3, 2, 1, 
           and...

           BOOOOOM! THE HOUSE GOES UP IN A BLAST OF BRICK AND SHINGLE. 
           RED HEAD IS THROWN TO THE STREET, fire singeing his hair. 
           Remnants of second hand furniture dropping from the sky like 
           a used rain sale... one torn sofa smashes atop a patrol car.

           And... CRASH! MCBANISTER’S CADILLAC shatters the garage door 
           and reverses through the debris. Hope grits her teeth behind 
           the wheel and plows over every picket fence in the

           Camera whips across a cemetery the size of an airport tarmac. 
           Mausoleums rising ten stories in the air, fresh graves all 
           over the place. And past the crumbling statue of an archangel 
           riddled with bullet holes, we’ll see...

           The Cadillac coming to a stop beside an enormous sanctuary.

                        brought a vendetta back with me. 
                     (turns to Hope)
                        She needs sanctuary. And I need to 
                        borrow some equipment.

           CLICK. The Monseigneur twists a SMALL CRUCIFIX beside the 
           organ, lifting the BAPTISMAL WALL to reveal a floor-to-
           ceiling armory. If it kills people, you’ll find it here.

                        Thank you, Monseigneur.

           Lucky’s in awe as Nick straps up. He swings a silenced AK-47 
           over his shoulder while Lucky plays with TWO LARGE SHOTGUNS. 
           Both are tricked up, barrels sawed down to 7” with R.I.P 
           engraved across each side.

           Nick grabs the guns from Lucky.

                        Nick was an orphan, and like many 
                        of our pupils, he was taken in here 
                        with open arms. Quite the student -- 
                        notably excelled in his training.

           Monseigneur hands Nick a fresh change of clothes. Nick 
           quickly throws on a crisp shirt and a clean overcoat.

           INT. BELL TOWER - OUR SHEPHERD OF PEACE - CONTINUOUS

           The spiral staircase leads into a musty old chamber at the 
           height of the cathedral. Creaking wood floors, layers of 
           dust, and 1/3 of the roof has broken away.

           Lucky enters to find Hope smoking a Virginia Slim, legs 
           crossed. The bell tolls just above them.

                                 HOPE
                        Hey there, Mr. Doyle. Or should I 
                        just call ya Lucky?

                        legs crossed.

           Lucky is obviously peering up her skirt through the heavy 
           cigarette smoke. Hope shifts her legs. Uncomfortably.

           Lucky removes a SMALL FLASK from inside his overcoat. He

           We turn to find Nick standing in the doorway now. Lucky looks

           Lucky takes another swig from his flask and exits the 
           chamber. And...

                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Well, you know what they say, 
                        absence makes the heart grow... 
                        suspect. 

                                 HOPE
                        C’mon, say it like you mean it.

           A beat. Then Nick kisses her. Forcefully. Almost savage.

                                 HOPE
                        That’s more like it. 

           Another kiss. Lust lingering in the air, until Hope turns 
           away -- changing moods on a dime.

                                 HOPE
                        I’m scared half to death, Nick. The 
                        sisters will kill me if I don’t 
                        find that case. And I don’t look 
                        good in bullet holes.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        What happened? Tell me everything.

                                 HOPE
                        I don’t know everything. The only 
                        fault I made was playing Mother 
                        Theresa, and now... it’s gone.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You swore to hide it. Protect it.

           Hope tries to take his hand -but- Nick pulls away.

                                 HOPE
                        But I thought I could use it to 
                        help, Nick. Cross my pretty lil 
                        heart. It just wasn’t right, the 
                        sisters keeping something so 
                        precious hidden away from the rest 
                        of the world.
                     (beat)
                        So I stashed it at that bank -- 
                        thought it’d be safe there until I 
                        figured out what to do next.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Well, now we’re gonna need to find 
                        it. Before anyone else does.

           It begins to rain. Neither moving from under the open roof. 
           They’re getting soaked, both locking gazes in the downpour. 
           Their pre-existing chemistry rising from their cores.

                                 HOPE
                        Where do we pick-up, Nick? What’s 
                        your take on romance? 
                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        It’s bad for business.

                                 HOPE
                        Don’t be silly. I’ve still got a 
                        crush and I don’t want to crush it. 
                        We fell for each other once.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I fall for a lot a’ things. But 
                        that’s all over now. Love is an 
                        emotion that just don’t stick.

                                 HOPE
                        Depends how hard ya throw it.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And you throw like a girl.

                                 HOPE
                        Oh, drop the muscle, Nicky. I know 
                        you like playin’ hearts with me. 
                        It’s why you came here in the first 
                        place. Just couldn’t let the one 
                        who got away get away... could ya?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I came here because I was paid to 
                        find that case. Trust me, Hope, 
                        Fiasco Heights is not my idea of a 
                        honeymoon tour.

           Now, Hope goes in for another kiss. Deep. Passion igniting -
           while- rain cascades around them.

                                 HOPE
                        What are you hidin’, Nick?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Skeletons. Closets of ‘em.

                                 HOPE
                        From the first day I met you I said 
                        to myself, “Now there’s a fella I 
                        wanna know inside out”. But you’re 
                        never the guy behind the gun, Nick. 
                        You’re always in front of it.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Either way, that guy’s just a sinner 
                        in saint’s clothing.

                                 HOPE
                        Well, I’d like to know him again. 
                        Sins and all.

           SUDDENLY - Lucky pokes his face back inside the door. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Yeah, I wanna know him too.

                                 LUCKY
                        Okay. Yes. I was eavesdroppin’ 
                        right outside the door. Overheard 
                        all that sappy shit... sorry. But 
                        I’m a part of this too, so I need 
                        to know whatever we need to know.

                                 HOPE
                        You pay this schmuck by the hour?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No. He’s an asshole for free.

           Nick stares at his reflection in a broken mirror, the eyes of 
           a conscience heavy killer starring right back. He yields.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        All right. Listen up, ‘cause I’m 
                        not fond of flashbacks. 
                     (beat)
                        I was on a standard liquor run 
                        about a year back...

           SUPER:               “A YEAR BACK”

           And suddenly, SNOW FLAKES begin falling all around them - 
           right there in the bell tower. The stars dim above Nick, 
           leaving only a streak of moonlight to SPOTLIGHT him.

           AND CAMERA SPINS CLOCKWISE, CHANGING THE SCENE TO:

           EXT. FIASCO BAY BRIDGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK - BLACK & WHITE

           SIX TUDOR TRUCKS wait in the middle of the bridge. It’s 
           foggy, snowing, wind so fierce it could take your face off. 
           And now, we find Nick filling a flask from a leaking LIQUOR 
           BARREL strapped down in the truck bed. Looks like there’s 
           about 10 barrels in all being transferred on this run.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        We were moving ten barrels of hard 
                        stuff up the city limits. That’s 
                        when Doughboy decided to downsize. 
                        He knew I was lookin’ to move on.

           Nick turns to find a loaded pistol in his face -and- MICK THE 
           MORMON is the one holding it.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        He ordered my partner to put the 
                        lead in my back, just for a splash 
                        of irony. I remember exactly what 
                        he said right before nudging the 
                        trigger...
                                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 THE MORMON 
                        I wish I could say the devil made 
                        me do it, but he’s not the one 
                        signin’ my checks.

           BAM! Nick goes down, snow turning red as he bleeds out.

           CAMERA WHIPS OUT OF THE FLASHBACK AND BACK ON NICK/HOPE:

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And he woulda’ shot me twice for 
                        giggles, if the cops didn’t show 
                        up. The good guys - 31st division.

           RED & BLUE LIGHTS BEGIN FLARING THROUGHOUT THE BELL TOWER.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (CONT’D)
                        Seems the Haitians we were selling 
                        to ratted our score to the FHPD. 
                        They wanted to take over our 
                        outfit, see. Mergers, 
                        acquisitions... every syndicate in 
                        town was trying to gain turf and 
                        maximize power. 
                     (beat)
                        Mormon was taken in, but the rest 
                        of Doughboy’s crew were ducks.

           GUNSHOTS ECHO AROUND THE BELL TOWER.

           EXT. CITY LIMITS - NIGHT - BLACK & WHITE

           - Nick staggers through some trees, past the city limit sign, 
           where in the distance we come to A CONVENT. A neon sign 
           blinks above the roof like a drive-in motel:

                      SISTERHOOD OF MINURVA CONVENT GETAWAY
                               “VACANCY -- FREE HBO”

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        I sucked up some leftover strength 
                        and carried myself across the 
                        bridge. Found refuge beyond the 
                        city limits. At an unusual convent.

                                 HOPE (V.O.)
                        Good thing we had a vacancy.

           - TWO NUNS rush from the convent as Nick faints at the door.

           - Nick is lying in bed while a few nuns care for him. One is 
           praying beside him, another mending his wounds. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        The sisters nursed me back into 
                        fair condition.

                        (cid:13)                                 HOPE (V.O.)
                        One in particular.

           HOPE removes the lead slug from his back with some rusted 
           tweezers. She soaks a towel in a bowl of hot water. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        She was good medicine.

           - Now, Nick and Sister Hope lie tangled in each other’s arms. 
           Sun gleaming through the blinds. They kiss -- in rapid fire. 

                                 HOPE (V.O.)
                        And fast recovery.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        Twelve months of it. Spent the 
                        entire year rehabilitatin’ myself.

           - A FEW ELDERLY NUNS hand Nick A PAYCHECK while he eats in 
           the dining hall. They speak, but we won’t make out the words.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        But before bein’ released, the 
                        sisters gave me a charge. Said I was 
                        the soldier of a worthy cause now.

           The nuns step aside revealing THE “SALVATION” CASE.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        They wouldn’t tell me what it was, 
                        but said the purest thing left in 
                        this damned world was inside it.
                     (beat)
                        They employed me to escort the case 
                        to a buyer in the east. Someone it 
                        would be safe with. It’d been at 
                        the convent for decades, see...

                                 HOPE (V.O.)
                        ...Word leaked about “salvation”, 
                        and there were too many interested 
                        parties. So I thought it’d be 
                        better locked away someplace else. 
                        It was the devout thing to do.

           - Sister Hope grabs the case while everyone sleeps. She exits 
           the convent wearing her nun’s uniform.

                                 HOPE (V.O.)
                        ...So I brought it here. Put it in 
                        a deposit box at the Savings & 
                        Loan. But lots of good that did, 
                        seeing as how the place was robbed 
                        the very next night. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT (V.O.)
                        I owed the sisters my life, so I 
                        accepted their offer. I vowed to 
                        find Hope and return the case 
                        unopened.

                                 HOPE
                        And Nicky never breaks a promise.

                     (laughs)
                        That’s the tale, huh?

                        Gettin’ taller by the minute.

                                 LUCKY
                        So this is what The Catholics are 
                        probably sniffin’ for. “Salvation”. 
                        That’s the reason they asked me to 
                        find our girl here.
                     (thinking)
                        I have a feelin’ all roads lead to 
                        heaven. If The Catholics know what 
                        “salvation” is, then at least we’ll 
                        know what we’re up against.

                                 HOPE
                        So let’s see where the straight and 
                        narrow takes us.

                        I’ll drive.

           SUPER:           “A FEW MINUTES LATER”

           INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - NIGHT

           The confessional window slides open to reveal Nick pointing 
           the .38 Special right at us. Lucky is squeezed in beside him. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Forgive me father, I’m about to 
                        kill your ass.

           FATHER PISARRO stops cold, a frightened expression. His body 
           trembling so hard he’s a 10 on the Richter. Now, Nick punches 
           through the screen and pulls his face into the square... 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I think it’s time to fess up some 
                        shit, preacher man. McBanister was 
                        runnin’ with your crew, now he’s a 
                        pale horse. What did he fall into?

                                 LUCKY
                        Besides a mystery with lots of fun 
                        clues and folks named “Whodunnit”.

           Father Pisarro starts to whimper like a little bitch.

                        is the death of His saints.”

                        Not a lick of it.

           Nick cocks “The Special”.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        You have no idea what you’re 
                        dealing with here... you’re messing 
                        with the ticking, tocking will of 
                        God.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Save it, father. We’re not drinkin’ 
                        the Kool-Aid. Just tell us what’s 
                        goin’ down. 

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        McBanister was just a part-timer. 
                        Did some work with the rest of our 
                        loan out muscle. Just blue collar 
                        stuff - picking up our strays, like 
                        Doyle here. Whatever got him killed 
                        had nothing to do with the church. 
                        He must of been swimming in high 
                        tides on his own accord.  
                     (to Lucky)
                        The Good Book still has you down as 
                        a sinner, my fuckin’ son.

                                 LUCKY
                        I found the girl. And I’ll settle 
                        up once we find her luggage. That’s 
                        what you really want.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        May be too late for miracles, Doyle.

           Nick puts the gun to Pisarro’s temple.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Why’d you hire this spade to find 
                        Hope?

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        There’s no hope in Fiasco Heights. 
                        You of all people should know that, 
                        Saint.

           Nick fires a shot into the wood beside Pisarro’s face. Which, 
           coincidentally, causes the ST. CHARLES BOYS CHOIR to cease 
           their rehearsal outside.

                        McBanister mentioned “salvation” 
                        before he fell asleep. Spill it.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        It’s merely something that we all 
                        need, but never ask for. 
                     (beat)
                        For years, we’ve been searching for 
                        it ourselves. Never come close. 
                        Frankly, I’m not sure it even 
                        exists. But in the chance that you 
                        find it, we’d be willing to reward 
                        you handsomely. 

                                 LUCKY
                        What kind of reward?

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Riches in heaven. 

           Lucky looks Pisarro in the eye...

                                 LUCKY
                        I want a full pardon from the 
                        church, and safe passage outta town 
                        for my friend here. What about it?

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        That can be arranged. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Then consider that we’ll consider 
                        it. 

           Lucky turns to Nick with an optimist’s smile, but Nick 
           acrimoniously shakes his head:

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Not a chance.

                     (back to Pisarro)
                        Yeah, no, we can’t do it.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Well, while you’re considering 
                        things, Doyle, just consider this: 
                        If you don’t have that dame by 
                        midnight, we’re gonna go from 
                        slapping your wrists to slicing ‘em 
                        wide open. You still have a few 
                        hours to make good n’ even.
                     (to Nick)
                        And Nick -- you’re in this too now. 
                        His debts on you both.

           Now, we hear footsteps outside the box... lots of them.

           neighboring box. He throws the priest down on his knees and 
           puts the gun to his head. 

           CAMERA SPINS TO REVEAL THE ENTIRE ST. CHARLES BOYS CHOIR HAS 
           SURROUNDED THE CONFESSIONALS. Brass candle snuffers in hand.

           Nick presses hard against Pisarro’s temple.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Tell the choir boys to back off, or 
                        it’s last rites on the fly.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        It’s okay boys, let these men go. 
                        They have our blessing. For now.

           Nick inches towards the door using Pisarro as a shield. Lucky 
           tries to intimidate the choir boys with a revolver -and it does- 
           seeing how it accidentally misfires into Pisarro’s foot.

           Lucky turns to Nick with a concerned look, “Ooops”.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Okay. RUN!

           And our heroes hall balls out of the church with about twenty 
           pissed off choirboys right behind them. They rip out the 
           front door to find HOPE WAITING IN THE CAR ON THE STREET. 

           Hope kick-starts the engine immediately, reversing onto the 
           sidewalk. Nick and Lucky jump in... and we’re off.

           Louis Armstrong’s 1932 version of All of Me is on the radio.

                        Barely doesn’t come in smaller sizes. 
                        That was as barely as it gets.

                        Boys, boys, relax. Let’s cap the 
                        testosterone for now. And fasten 
                        those seatbelts...

                        This has Doughboy’s scent all over 
                        it. My gut says that’s where the 
                        lines cross.

           Hope delivers a peripheral glare. Very mysterious.

                        priest on my conscience, I’d say 
                        mercy is fresh outta stock.

           Now, Nick removes the GIDEON BIBLE that he pocketed from 
           McBanister’s house. He opens it to find an odd stamp across 
           the front cover. It reads: MOTHER GOOSE’S BOOK DEPOT.

           A cobblestone alley with an assemblage of junkies huddled

                        local library - if there’s word on 
                        the street, he’s read it.

           At the end of Hampton Square, we come to a small USED BOOK 
           SHOP. A BLIND, BLACK MAN sits outside reading a brail edition 
           of The Inferno. His eyes hidden behind a massive set of 
           aviator glasses and thick dreads. And before Lucky can speak:

                                 MOTHER GOOSE
                     (slight Jamaican accent)
                        If ya come fa ah story, we closed 
                        up. I don’t rhyme no more, bredda.

           Nick slaps Goose across the face with his leather glove.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Well start rhyming, or my knuckles 
                        get anxious.

                                 LUCKY
                        Excuse me. Did you just slap my 
                        snitch with a glove? 

           Now, Nick slaps Lucky across the face with the glove.

                        What have you heard about 
                        “salvation”?

                                 MOTHER GOOSE
                        Mi ain’t heard nothin’, bwoy! 

           Nick slaps Mother Goose across the face. AGAIN.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        See. I can rhyme too.
                     (slaps him again)
                        And I’ll keep the smack on ‘til 
                        you’ve made bitch of the month, so 
                        start leakin’ the good stuff. 

                                 LUCKY
                     (trying to be hard)
                        What he means is quit duck, duck, 
                        duckin’ the question, Goose!

           Nick looks at Lucky, idiot. Slaps him in the face AGAIN.

           Hope has seen enough of this clownshow. She steps in and 
           kneels down. She takes Goose’s hand, gently stroking it.

                                 HOPE
                     (cute and charming)
                        Sir, please excuse the two buffoons 
                        behind me -- their manners are non-
                        existent most of the time. I’m just 
                        a simple girl who asks for simple 
                        favors. And at the moment, I’m 
                        caught up in a tragedy of sorts. 
                        It’s a little matter of life and 
                        death with scales tipping by the 
                        minute... that’s the tragic part of 
                        it. See, the whole predicament is 
                        my fault, and I don’t like two bits 
                        about it. So if you could pretty 
                        please tell us anything you know, 
                        it sure would make a happy lady out 
                        of a simple favor.

           She leans forward, whispering into his ear:

                                 HOPE (CONT’D)
                        And I’m generous when I’m happy.

           Shards of glass and metal hit the air as an entire ARMORED 
           TRUCK goes up in a brume of fire. A shredded tire blows right 
           over us while the truck barrel rolls through the front window 
           of the FIASCO HEIGHTS SAVINGS & LOAN BANK.

           A tidal wave of smoke blankets the street while hot debris 
           rains down like hellfire confetti. And suddenly, FIVE MEN 
           DRESSED AS VAUDEVILLE VILLAINS race through the wreckage. 
           Each of them dawns an elaborate moustache and a black cape. 

                                 VILLAIN #1 (MASTERMIND)
                     (a tad British)
                        The package is inside, lock-boxed 
                        in the central vault.

           Fresh hundreds litter the sky as the thieves enter the bank.

           VILLAIN #2 -decked in a cowboy hat- spits some chaw and 
           SHOVES A SIX SHOOTER RIGHT IN OUR FACE:

                                 VILLAIN #2 (COWBOY)
                        Loot up that bag or I’ll blow your 
                        goddamn head right off!

           VILLAIN #1 jumps on top of a checking counter, removes a 
           small PISTOL and begins firing into the ceiling.

                                 VILLAIN #1 (MASTERMIND)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, if you 
                        haven’t noticed, this is a bank 
                        robbery of heterogeneous splendor. 
                        And we, are your dazzling 
                        neighborhood bank robbers. We’d 
                        like to welcome you to the show, 
                        and declare that it’s our great 
                        pleasure to confiscate your 
                        belongings this evening. Now, 
                        everyone stay quiet and remain 
                        seated during the performance, or 
                        things are gonna get aggravated. 

           ALARM STARTS SCREAMING.

           In seconds, every customer in the bank is kissing the floor. 
           And one of every six has pissed their pants by now. Then...

           An elderly SECURITY GUARD gets a rush of courage. He reaches 
           for his weapon... UNTIL ...the point of a Winchester rifle 
           snuggles up to his temple.

           brave. They’re a rough troupe -- bad news in the flesh.

           ANGLE ON: MONEY BEING SHOVED INTO A DUFFLE BAG...

           ANGLE ON: THE BAG IS QUICKLY PASSED OVER THE COUNTER...

           AT THE VAULT

           BAM-BAM! VILLAIN #3 -visible SCORPION tattoo on his neck-  
           pops the vault guard and snatches the keys. He steps inside 
           the cage and starts dumping security boxes. 

           Diamonds. Pearls. Jewelry. He keeps jacking investments until 
           coming to AN UNNUMBERED BOX. The villain unhinges it and 
           eagerly reaches inside, removing...

           A BLACK LEATHER CASE with a RED CROSS inlaid across it. The 
           villain peels off his mustache, smiles big. And remember this 
           face? This flush, wrinkled face? You should, because it 
           belongs to our now deceased friend PATRICK MCBANISTER.

           Now, the gang rushes for the exit. COWBOY slings his COLT 
           .45’s into their holsters while McBanister secures the stolen 
           case under his cape. MASTERMIND turns to his fear-crippled 
           crowd and takes a bow...

           Goose offers the stained bill to Lucky. Smiles big, gold 
           shimmering from his mouth.

           A stripper waits at the corner counting her tips. We see a

           slowly follows as she enters a neon covered nightclub.

LOADED MOON CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           A classy joint filled with live music and second hand smoke. 
           Type of place that serves lung cancer as a side dish. Nick 
           and Lucky down their cocktails like pros -as- a jazz singer 
           kicks off a melancholy original. Then...

           SMACK! NICK IS SLAPPED ACROSS THE BACK OF THE HEAD!

                                 HARLEY (O.S.)
                        That’s for walking out on me.

           SMACK! HARLEY (decked like a cigarette girl) gets him on the 
           other cheek now.

                                 HARLEY
                        And that’s for stickin’ me with the 
                        hotel bill. You’re no good, Nick!

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Easy on the backhand, tootse. You 
                        took my money and my gun. We’re 
                        even. I’d say sorry if I could, but 
                        I can’t, ‘cause I don’t. Just ain’t 
                        my style.

           SMACK!!!

                                 HARLEY
                        Then that’s for bad style. And 
                        don’t call me tootse. I ain’t your 
                        damsel to distress.

                        She’s right... nobody says tootse 
                        nowadays. Unless it’s rainin’ 
                        maltese falcons in Chinatown.

                     (to Lucky)
                        Shut up.

           Harley lights a cigarette and gives Nick a death stare.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        All right. I’m sorry. There, I said 
                        it. And I wish we could hammer out 
                        our old shit with a bit more love and 
                        affection, but I’m here on business.

           Harley inhales and turns to Lucky.

                        Nevermind him. He’s trouble, and 
                        it’s contagious.

                                 HARLEY
                        So what’s got ya on the heel this 
                        time, Nick?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Bad religion. Catholics got us down 
                        with clocks ticking. And the plot 
                        thickens as I speak.
                     (holding up blue bill)
                        We need to see the girls.

           Nick reaches into Harley’s cigarette carton and helps 
           himself. He lights one up -as- Harley turns to Lucky.

                                 HARLEY
                        Sounds like a pinch. They got 
                        someone pinnin’ your tail?

                                 HARLEY
                        Well if it’s queer you’re speakin’, 
                        he definitely knows the language. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Oh, he’s fluent in it.

           Harley hesitates for a second. Gives Nick another eye to eye.

                                 HARLEY
                        Fine. I’ll take ya’s back to see 
                        the gals, but don’t think you’re 
                        off the hook. Me and you still have

           a masquerade wall. Harley pounds on it a few times.

           Loud music. Half-naked strippers. Pole dancing. This place 
           serves sin on the rocks.

           strippers are insanely obese. It’s a XXL nude lounge. Like a 
           whale tank at the aquarium.

           Nick and Lucky are up to their balls in strippers, so much 
           tit ‘n ass in their face it’s hard to breathe. And these are 
           the kind of lap dances that leave residue on your pants. 

           A sweaty stripper grinds her pelvis into Lucky’s waist...

                                 LUCKY
                        This is your idea of getting more 
                        information?

                                 NICK THE SAINT 
                        Yeah. Just remember... 

           Nick points to a large sign on the wall: HANDS OFF THE GALS!

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No touching.

           Now - Nick whispers into ONE FAT STRIPPER’S ear. She takes a 
           seat on his lap and leans back into him. Ouch.

                                 STRIPPER
                     (re: whisper)
                        Maybe.

           Nick holds up a ten dollar bill. She nabs it.

                        What do ya wanna know, handsome?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        A recent lift. Something of high 
                        value that’s between transaction 
                        and open ended. Savings & loan 
                        kinda gig. 

                                 STRIPPER
                        I know that gig.

           Nick holds up another ten - she snatches it quick.

           Our stripper starts to undo her skirt while facing the 
           VAUDEVILLAIN IN THE COWBOY HAT. He sits on the bed, takes a 
           pull from a bottle of bourbon.

           EXT. ALLEY - BEHIND THE LOADED MOON - CONTINUOUS

           NICK IS HURLED OUT THE DOOR, face decked in a new shade of 
           black and blue. And we come face-to-face with Lucky, who 
           dawns a BLACK EYE of his own.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        What the hell?

           A BOUNCER stands at the door with a FRANTIC STRIPPER.

                                 FRANTIC STRIPPER
                        That’s him! He grabbed my titty! You 
                        molester pervert! My titty is 
                        covered in his pervert fingerprints!

           The bouncer calms her down and shuts the door. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Unbelievable. You touched her tit?

                        What was I supposed to do? There’s 
                        a sloppy boob bouncin’ in my face, 
                        pierced nipple by the way, and...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Hey!! Is there trouble stuck to 
                        your shoe, or do they really make 
                        people in your shade of stupid!?!

                                 LUCKY
                        C’mon. You’re not the only one with 
                        a new bruise. It was all you can 
                        eat knuckle sandwiches out here. 
                        That monster-fuck hit me so hard I 
                        had the same dream twice.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        That’s a DAMN SHAME! 

           Now -- A LARGE FEMALE GOON exits the bar. She rolls up her 
           sleaves and approaches Nick/Lucky. Buzz cut. Muscles. 
           Tattoos. Hairy arms. She’s more of a man then they are.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Hiya Butch.

                                 BUTCH
                     (deep voice)
                        Nick. Welcome back. Wish I didn’t 
                        have to pound your face in, but you 
                        know the rules. No touching.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Right. No touching. My bad.
                     (to Lucky)
                        When this is all over, you’d better 
                        disappear like Houdini after a bad 
                        lay. Otherwise, I might kill you 
                        myself.

           Nick punches Butch in the chin, but it doesn’t faze her for a 
           second. She immediately grabs them both by the neck and lifts 
           them into the air. Squeezing hard. Both guys turning red.

           Suddenly ...WHAM... BUTCH takes a 2x4 across the head. She 
           (or he or whatever) goes down with a “thud”, revealing HOPE 
           behind her holding the makeshift weapon.

                                 HOPE
                        Please tell me that’s not your ex.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No, but I think he likes me.

                                 HOPE
                        Well, this has certainly been an 
                        affair to remember.

                        Who wants to remember? 
                     (re: Butch)
                        Damn, that momma puts the “ugly” in 
                        fuckin’ ugly. 

           Nick begins to stubbornly walks away. Hope and Lucky follow:

                                 LUCKY
                        Hey -- where are you going?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Well. You need to find the case to 
                        stay alive. We need to just find the 
                        case. So, in consideration of our 
                        predicament, I intend to find said 
                        case pronto, so that I can be the 
                        FUCK done with you.

                                 LUCKY
                        Just so you know, I’m putting a 
                        complaint in the comment box. Your 
                        attitude sucks.

                                 HOPE
                        He has been pretty moody.

           Nick gets to the street and whistles for a cab.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Hope, I want you to get back to the 
                        sanctuary -- tell The Monseigneur 
                        not to wait up. It’s not safe out 
                        her for a gal.

                                 HOPE
                        I can handle myself, Nick.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Just do it.

           He kisses her as the cab stops, opens her door.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        It’s only because I care.

           She kisses him back.

                                 HOPE
                        Just watch your back, Nick.

           Nick nods as she gets in. Cab pulling away as we...

TRAILER - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: BILLY WILDE -in his cowboy hat- sips a beer while 
           watching a hunting program. The BLUE PAINT BLOTCHES on his 
           face make his appearance unusual, but 100% recognizable.

           SUDDENLY - THE TRAILER JOLTS FORWARD. IT BEGINS MOVING!

                                 WILDE
                        The damn?

           Wilde runs into the kitchen and opens the window. From his 
           POV, we see his home speeding out of the trailer park.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (O.S.)
                        Nice place.

           Wilde jumps back against the refrigerator.

                                 WILDE
                        SHI-YIT! Who the hell are you? 
                        Jesus!

           Nick lays a gun on the table.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No. I’m not Jesus, but he’s a good 
                        friend of mine. Unfortunately, he’s 
                        a bit more forgiving than I am. 
                        Here, have a seat.

           Wilde squeezes into the kitchen booth across from Nick.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I’m here to ask a pair of 
                        questions. 1) Where’s the score? 
                        And 2) where’s the fucking score?

           Wilde looks at the gun - then looks at Nick. He’s serious.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        What? Would it be easier in 
                        multiple fucking choice?

                                 WILDE
                        Look. I was just recruited into 
                        that gig. Elbow grease kinda work. 
                        Then I panicked... didn’t mean to 
                        take that loot... but...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Why don’t you go get it.

           With zero hesitation, Wilde goes to the closet and returns 
           with the DUFFLE BAG OF CASH. He sets it on the table and 
           opens it. Every bill inside is covered in BLUE PAINT.

                        Here. I ain’t spent much of it 
                        seein’ how the cops been lookin’ 
                        for stains.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                     (zipping the bag)
                        Is there anything else? Anything 
                        top shelf?

                                 WILDE
                        There was a satchel. A black leather 
                        one. Hombres in the posse nabbed it 
                        quick -- said it was priceless. I 
                        got the feeling they wasn’t gonna 
                        cut me in, so that’s why I ran off 
                        with this loot here.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Who were the players? 

                                 WILDE
                        Everyone stayed masked and 
                        anonymous. Even to me. But I did 
                        overhear ‘em say somethin’ ‘bout a 
                        drop point. Some safe somewhere.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You don’t say. 

                                 WILDE
                        Yeah, I believe I just did. 
                        Anyhow’s, if things went 
                        unscripted, that was the fella’s 
                        term for bad, we was to run and ron-
                        day-voo at this here place here...

           Wilde slides a small MATCHBOOK across the table to Nick. 

           INSERT: BLACK MATCHBOOK WITH A GLOSSY LIPSTICK KISS on it. No 
           name. No location. He flips the matchbook open to find a 
           number written on the inside flap:

                                    “21”

           Nick studies it.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Blackjack.

                                 WILDE
                        Exactly. I don’t know where this is, 
                        or where it ain’t, but I’d bet a dead 
                        dingo’s dong it’s where them hombres 
                        is gonna flip that satchel. One of 
                        ‘em  even kept a key on him always.

Nick gets up, grabs the 
           bag, and goes for the door...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Thanks. You’re hospitality’s been 
                        real Southern and all. 

           He exits -AND- almost immediately WILDE RUSHES INTO HIS 
           BEDROOM - GRABS A GUN - AND SPRINTS OUT THE DOOR AFTER NICK. 
           BUT...

           HE STEPS OUT ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THE TRAILER HAS BEEN 
           PARKED IN FRONT OF THE FIASCO SAVINGS & LOAN CRIMESCENE. 

           The entire bank security detail has their weapons trained on 
           him. Nick tosses the bag of DYED CASH to the bank manager -
           while- Lucky unties the Cadillac from the trailer’s hitch. 

           WILDE DROPS HIS GUN upon the realization of being fucked.

           INT. MCBANISTER’S CADILLAC - MINUTES LATER

           Lucky hums along to the radio, as they pull into the cemetery 
           leading up to “Our Shepherd of Peace”. But then...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Awe shit!

           Lucky looks up to see a cloud of smoke rising in the 
           distance. Nick floors it -- driving between two mausoleums -- 
           rapidly approaching THE BURNING CATHEDRAL. 

           Nick slams the car to a stop, and runs into the blaze.

           INT. OUR SHEPHERD OF PEACE - CONTINUOUS

           Flames everywhere. Ash. Tumbling tapestries. Nick sifts 
           through the torched sanctuary until finding THE MONSEIGNEUR 
           pinned beneath a burning pew. Too late... he’s already dead.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No. Fuck me... no!

           Now, he looks down to find A KETCHUP PACKET bubbling against 
           the toe of his shoe. He picks it up -- identical to the one 
           he found at McBanister’s place.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        And this is when it all got up 
                        close and personal.

           Lucky trudges through and grabs Nick’s shoulder. He sees the 
           ketchup packet in his hand.

                        burger cracks -- eat there all the 
                        time. Combo #9 comes with a gram of 
                        blow and medium fry. Great value.

                        for BBQ. We’re both gettin’ tans 
                        just standing here. LET’S GO!

           Nick signs the cross over The Monseigneur’s corpse, and says 
           another quick prayer.

           INT. MCBANISTER’S CADILLAC - NIGHT

           Cue radio, Rudy Vallee’s 1931 Brother, Can You Spare A Dime.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        They took her. Doughboy and Mormon 
                        have Hope. I’m sure of it.

                                 LUCKY
                        But the case is what they really 
                        want, right?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And they’ll use her to find it.

                                 LUCKY
                        Not if we find it first.

           Nick nods.

                        The Catholics, the bank job, the 
                        Franchise... none of it adds.

           Lucky stares at the matchbook -then- an aura of brilliance 
           ignites. If light bulbs really went off overhead after strokes 
           of genius -well- we’d see about five of them right now. Or...

           Lucky puts the matchbook to his nose and takes in the scent.

                        That, my shamus friend, is a scent

           Nick snags the matchbook back and sniffs for himself.

                        It’s Jasmine with a hint of white

           AND LUCKY THROWS THE CADILLAC INTO A U-TURN.

           EXT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

           CLOSE ON: An enormous BLACK BILLBOARD WITH A GLOSSY KISS MARK. 
           Camera cranes down, finding an old bus station below the 
           billboard. And we’re smack in the middle of Chinatown:

           Neon characters flash intensely against the orange glow of 
           shaded street lamps. Flaring “take-out” signs beat against a 
           swarming fish market. We’re not lost in translation here... 
           we’re fucking drowning in it.

           INT. CHINATOWN BUS STATION - CONTINUOUS

           RON WONG LEE, an Asian greaser in an Armani suit, enters the 
           station and wanders through a maze of lockers. He stops at 
           LOCKER #21. Then, he removes A KEY and pops the locker open. 
           And inside, we’re starring right at...

           THE BLACK CASE BEARING A RED CROSS... AKA “SALVATION”.

           Wong Lee grabs the case, and cuffs it to his wrist. Then 
           exits. Never once realizing that NICK & LUCKY are watching 
           every move from the 2nd floor balcony.

                        Ron Wong Lee. Otherwise known as

                        Maybe it’s just my private eye 
                        blinkin’ here, but that doesn’t 
                        feel right. If McBanister was 
                        involved with the acting troupe, 
                        then why was he helpin’ Hope? See, 
                        unless we’re cookin’ mcguffins 
                        here, you don’t steal a priceless 
                        case just to steal a priceless 
                        case. Those robbers knew what they 
                        were after, so they had to be 
                        workin’ for somebody, right?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Well if I knew who they were, I’d 
                        ask them that question personally.

           Lucky removes the deck of playing cards from his pocket. He

                        My mentor, God rest his soul, once 
                        told me that if the investigation 
                        feels like a mirage, just drink the 
                        water. And if you’re still thirsty, 
                        then it wasn’t really water to 
                        begin with.

                        But maybe it means that our queen’s 
                        just playin’ the board, eh?
                     (changing subjects)
                        The hell do you think is in that 
                        thing anyway? Something that goes 
                        boom? Ca-ching?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I don’t give a damn what’s in it,

                        way to stop them crazies is to kill 
                        the madam, Mai Dei. Except ya got a

                        They don’t come any sweeter. Thing 
                        is, we’re here for Don Wong. I got 
                        no beef with the hookers.

           EXT. CADILLAC - CONTINUOUS

           Nick opens the trunk to reveal a wealth of guns stashed from 
           the Monseigneur. He reaches for THE TWINS. 

                                 LUCKY
                     (starring @ Red Palace)
                        Though pessimism isn’t a trait I 
                        expose regularly, I have been known 
                        to exhibit concern under 
                        unfavorable circumstance.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You think this circumstance is 
                        unfavorable?

                                 LUCKY
                        Well, I’d be lying if I said it was 
                        just fuckin’ peachy.

           Nick hands over a small DERRINGER. Lucky stares at it, 
           pathetically, in the palm of his hand.

                                 LUCKY
                        And I don’t mean to be dramatic, 
                        but can I have a bigger gun?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You’re not being dramatic. You’re 
                        being a pussy. Just point and shoot 
                        - they all do the same thing. 

                                         AND WE SMASH TO:

           INT. RED PALACE - CONTINUOUS

           Nick kicks in the door and interrupts Wong Lee in mid-hummer. 
           His hooker frantically splits -just as- Nick rests the 
           shotgun barrel on Wong’s chin.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You have a final prayer. Use it 
                        religiously.

                        Lucky, grab the case.

                        I don’t remember asking permission. 

           Lucky grabs the case -but- it’s still cuffed to Lee’s wrist.

                                 LUCKY
                        Would you mind asking him to remove 
                        the cuffs? 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Drop the cuffs, Don Wong, or I take 
                        ‘em off... hands and all.

           Wong starts to tear up.

                                 DON WONG
                        I cun’t. Do’boy is kill me if I 
                        do... 

           Nick notices A FIRE AXE resting in a glass emergency box 
           outside the room. WE HOLD ON IT FOR A SECOND.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Wong answer. 

           Nick signs the cross with his gun, then... KA-BOOOM!

           INT. RED PALACE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Nick descends a spiral staircase carrying the bloodsoaked 
           BLACK CASE. Wong Lee’s arm still dangling from it.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        See, that was cake.

           AND SUDDENLY...

           A swift kick comes out of nowhere and puts Nick on his knees. 
           CHINA DOLL #4 rushing him from the corner, screaming. Nick 
           lifts the shotgun, and... BOOM!!

           Her smoking carcass slides across the floor, slamming into a 
           table of candles and burning incense. WE SEE THE NUMBER FOUR 
           tattooed to her neck as she slumps over. Dead. 

           Now, CHINA DOLL #7 kicks the gun from his hand just as his 
           finger sets off a misguided shot. The murderess screams and 
           KICKS AT HIM AGAIN - THIS TIME DRIVING HER SHARPENED STILETTO 
           HEEL INTO HIS SHOULDER.

           SNAP. His clavicle cracks like plastic, he’s pushed against 
           the wall - stiletto sliding farther inside him. TEETH 
           GRITTING IN EXTREME PAIN. 

           He grabs her ankle and slowly begins to push her leg back. 
           With only the tip left in his flesh - HE GRABS HER BETWEEN 
           THE LEGS, using his leverage to throw her to the ground.

           (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)           NICK GOES FOR HIS WEAPON -AS- DOLL #7 JUMPS TO HER FEET:

           She lunges forward as he lifts the shotgun, barrel driving 
           into her chest and stopping any forward progress. Her jagged 
           nails claw at his cheek, but that’s where it ends... 

           BOOM! SHE’S FLUNG ACROSS THE ROOM SMASHING INTO A BUBBLING 
           FISH TANK. Glass and water floods the room. Flopping fish 
           struggling to breath. No use. A whole lot of dead fish... and 
           a dead China Doll to match.

           ANGLE ON: LUCKY. He’s struggling - already on the ground with 
           TWO vicious girls atop him. He screams high-murder as they  
           stuff a gag in his mouth. And bad luck strikes hot again.

           Nick cocks his weapon and rushes the girls in mid-torture -
           but- they scatter like flies under a swatter. He reaches down 
           and rips the gag from his Lucky’s mouth.

                                 LUCKY
                        BEHIND YOU!!

           Saint ducks JUST AS THE BLADE OF A SWORD sweeps his head 
           space. He rolls off of Lucky and takes a shot. An instant 
           miss - THIS BITCH is playing the shadows to her advantage.

           He stands and reloads - probing the shadows all the while. 
           AND POW... Nick takes a shot to the temple. He stumbles back. 
           POW... another high kick to the jaw. 

           Falling to a knee, he sees ALL OF THE FEMALE KILLERS 
           encircling him within the shadows around the room. Now...

           CHINA DOLL #3 whips a wire around his neck. She tightens - 
           life being squeezed out of him - he struggles for a drag of 
           air. 

           TIGHTER NOW. Choking. He reaches up and grips her hair. 
           Tugging so hard we can hear the roots snap. But she holds 
           firm. 

           Nick struggles to his feet with the killer on his back, 
           yanking harder than ever. His face loosing color. And... 
           THERE... Nick sees it. A PLATE OF ROTTING CHINESE FOOD.

           But there’s something else. Something that consumes his last 
           dying efforts. He goes for the plate, weakening faster. 
           Falling to the ground Nick reaches up, hand digging through 
           the moldy slop. THIS IS HIS ONLY SHOT.

           Hand wandering for it... THERE... A CHOPSTICK. He grabs it, 
           AND WITH EVERY OUNCE OF ENERGY LEFT IN HIM, he thrusts it 
           over his shoulder... STRAIGHT INTO THE EYE OF CHINA DOLL #3.

           THUMP. Her body hits the ground dead. A bloody chopstick 
           protruding from her socket. Nick rips the wire from his neck 
           and sucks in a lung-full of oxygen. 

           Now, CHINA DOLL #2 strips a beret from her hair - each toggle 
           razor sharp. She rears back and throws...

           (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)           WHISP. The blades drive into Nick’s thigh. He slumps over in 
           pain. Agony. This could be the end of the road.

           At once, the remaining killers come at him with everything 
           they’ve got - pouncing like a pack of wolves. THEN...

           BAM! A gunshot.

           Nick jerks up as one of the girls drops to the floor. Blood 
           spewing from her neck. She looks at him with tear-filled eyes 
           -and- hits the ground face first.  

           The other girls jump back, pure panic. Each of them begins to 
           cry profusely. Moaning. They immediately kneel beside their 
           fallen companion, attention no longer on Nick/Lucky.

           The Saint looks through the torn RICE PAPER WALL to see, 
           LUCKY, holding the DERRINGER he gave him at the cab.

                                 LUCKY
                        That’s her. Mai Dei.

           Saint turns to the mourning China Dolls. They crowd Mai Dei’s 
           body like a swarm of bees around their fallen queen.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        How’d you know?

           A smirk takes shape on Lucky’s face.

           ANGLE ON: Mai Dei’s tattoo. IT’S THE NUMBER FIVE.

                                 LUCKY
                        My lucky number.

           FLASH INSERT: A SLOT MACHINE. Dollar signs CA-CHING into all 
           three slots, sending A FOUNTAIN OF COINS FROM THE MACHINE.

           Lucky’s smirk transforms into a full fledged smile. He 
           hobbles over to Nick, and lifts the hitman to his feet.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT/EXT. RED PALACE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Nick/Lucky (and the case) are exiting the Red Palace. Lucky 
           reaching into a jar of RICE CANDY, stuffing his jacket with 
           it. He offers some to Nick.

                                 LUCKY
                        Rice candy?

                        Gimme that.

           Nick takes almost all of Lucky’s boxes. Lucky scoffs

                        Why? You want them reminiscing our 
                        little visit over tea time? Because 
                        I’m sure there’d be some bad 
                        fortune in those cookies. Anyway, 
                        it’s not like those gals sell 
                        tupperware or drive carpool... they 
                        wanted to kill us.

                        If it was PMS, we’d be dead already.

           Nick tosses the “SALVATION” into the back seat of the car.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        So, me and you... we’re good, 
                        right? Time to fly solo?

                        Wait -- what about The Catholics? 
                        I’m in the ground if I come up 
                        empty. And I can already feel the 
                        dirt in my pockets.  

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Well, it’s midnight. Your deadline 
                        is up, pal. That means our contract 
                        became past tense about an hour 
                        ago.

                        Yes. But a contract nonetheless.

           Lucky sits down on the curb.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        No. A fuck up is forgetting to 
                        carry the one in long division. 
                        You’re an absolute fucking

                        n’ grievance crap has been yours.

           Lucky’s at a loss for words. He sighs. All he is to anyone is 
           a loser, and his expression does the thought justice.

                        Here...

           Nick removes a wad of the BLUE BILLS from his pocket, and 
           hands it to Lucky. Then he pops a rice candy in his mouth.

                        I snatched this from the Cowboy’s 
                        trailer. It should be enough to 
                        settle your sins. Just drop it in 
                        the offering and put Fiasco Heights 
                        in your rear view. Like I’m gonna 
                        do when this is all over.

                        I finally have some leverage, and I 
                        need to go this alone. For her. If 
                        Doughboy wants salvation, he’ll 
                        have to pony up the girl.

           Lucky shrugs. Forcing a nod.

                        All because your agenda weighs more 
                        than mine. Well, fuck that noise! 
                        I’ve killed bottom feedin’ 
                        motherfuckers for less...
                     (Nick pulls out his gun)
                        Nevermind. We’re good. Deal’s a 
                        deal. But thanks for the adventure, 
                        it was... real fair n’ all.

           Nick slaps Lucky on the shoulder, shrugging him off.

                        Well. Good luck.

                        Staying alive. And all that shit.

           Nick hops into the Cadillac. The car immediately jerks 
           forward as he starts the engine. And it continues lurching 
           violently as he tries to accelerate. Our hero obviously can’t 
           drive stick. 

           Lucky watches as he coasts around the corner... out of sight.

DRY CLEANERS - NIGHT

           BLUE BILLS whip through a money counter -while- the dry 
           cleaners launder Lucky’s payback money behind a moving track.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Maybe Nick was right, just pay my 
                        dues and ride outta town. Start 
                        fresh. So I went to clean my bills. 
                        But there I am mindin’ my own 
                        business,  when...

                                 PINSTRIPES (O.S.)
                        Dirty laundry, Luck?

           And we turn to find THE ENTIRE GOD SQUAD standing behind him.

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        Cheers mate. How about we all go 
                        for a pleasure cruise? Distribute 
                        his ticket, Champ.

           Knockout Jones rears back for the hook.

                                 LUCKY
                        Wait! The money’s right here.

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        It isn’t about that anymore.

           And suddenly, Pinstripes steps aside revealing SISTER HOPE.

                                 HOPE
                        Where’s Nick? And where’s that 
                        fucking case?

           Lucky is speechless. And will remain speechless when Jones 
           levels him, triggering the swipe dissolve that takes us 
           into...

           INT. MEAT LOCKER - NIGHT

           Pounds of meat hanging from razor sharp hooks. And we dolly 
           through vertical ranks of frozen beef to find, LUCKY, hanging 
           by his collar from one of the meat hooks... FROZEN BODY BAGS 
           dangling around him.

           Lucky breathes a heavy sigh. HIS BREATH SPELLS “FUCKED” 
           ACROSS THE AIR.

                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. CORNER OF 55TH AND 5TH - NIGHT

           The busiest corner in the city as far as wholesale women go. 
           A one stop shop and go for any STD on the market.

           fresh joint. He takes her by the arm.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        How ‘bout a freebie?

           Nick is a mess. Scrapes. Bruises. Flesh wounds of the like.

                                 HARLEY
                        Jesus. What happened, Nicky?

           Harley wipes a streak of blood running from an open gash.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Cut myself shaving. 

                                 HARLEY
                        With what? A butcher knife? You’re 
                        chopped up pretty good. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Just got banged around - thought 
                        I’d see you about a fix-up. I’ll 
                        even pay by the hour.

           INT. THE FIASCO HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Nick is up to his neck in bubble bath while Harley stitches 
           him up. He grits his teeth as she dabs a wound with alcohol, 
           then seals it with gauze. 

                                 HARLEY
                        So what’s with the suitcase? You 
                        packin’ for a bad trip? 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Only kind I take.

           He winces as she dabs another wound, his fingers digging into 
           the porcelain of an antique four-legged tub.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Thanks for the stitches, babe.

           Harley swabs his lip with some cotton. Nick stares her in the 
           eye, might be some emotion there if you look hard enough.

                                 HARLEY
                        I’d mend your wounds any day, Nick. 
                        It’s why I’ve never minded ya 
                        takin’ a beating.

           The moment lingers. Then, Nick grabs Harley around the neck 
           and pulls her into the tub. She slides into him willingly, 
           taking his head from behind. They kiss. BUT NICK STOPS.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I... I can’t, Harley.

And it shows. 
           Still, she holds him under the bubbles. Caressing his back, 
           as he leans for the bourbon bottle resting in the soap dish. 

                                 HARLEY
                        I’m sorry about who I am, Nick. I 
                        thought you were gone for good. The 
                        big sleep and all that jazz. I just 
                        wish I could take it back... I used 
                        to love bein’ your only trick.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I’m over it. Besides, let’s face it, 
                        you’ll never teach kindergarten.

           Harley snuggles closer.

                                 HARLEY
                        Tell me why you’re here. You always 
                        used to say that if ya ever left 
                        this town, ya’d never look back.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And I didn’t. But no matter where 
                        you go, the life you left catches 
                        up somehow. I actually thought I 
                        could make good for all the shit 
                        I’ve done. Redemption, ya know?
                     (lights a cigarette)
                        But when you’ve seen enough people 
                        die, put enough people in the dirt, 
                        there just ain’t enough of it to go 
                        around. I’m a condemned fella, see.

                                 HARLEY
                        And who’s this gal ya been chasin’?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        She’s the only good person I’ve 
                        ever come across. That’s why I care 
                        about her so damn much.

           It hurts Harley to hear it, but she forces a smile and kisses 
           his neck again.

           OFF SCREEN: THE DOORBELL RINGS.

           Nick looks at Harley. She shrugs without a clue. Nick steps 
           out of the tub and throws on a bathrobe. 

           INT. FRONT DOOR - NICK’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Saint opens the front door to greet...

           POW!! A HARD BLOW TO THE JAW that literally lifts him off his 
           feet and into the living room. And THE POPE enters, charging 
           Nick like a juiced up bellhop with fresh headaches to deliver.
                                                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)           SLOW ON: THE POPE’S DISTORTED FACE, and we hear the SFX of a 
           BULL SNORTING. A steriod induced bull that’s coked out of its 
           fucking mind of course. 

           Nick climbs to his feet and reaches for a GUN on the coffee 
           table -but- he doesn't quite make it before POPE grabs him by 
           the robe and flings him into the wall --

           -- Exploding through the other side in an eruption of 
           drywall, and slamming into an armoire in the bedroom.

           Nick quickly jumps onto the bed and REACHES UNDER THE PILLOW. 
           HE WHIPS OUT THE DESERT EAGLE and takes a few misguided 
           shots. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. Nothing serious. 

           THE POPE enters the bedroom in a rabid charge. He grabs Nick 
           and lifts him by the robe, then ... SLAM... puts him against 
           the wall in a fierce choke hold.

           Nick struggles for air. He reaches for a full bottle of wine 
           resting on a nearby dresser -- maybe this is a good idea. 

           CRACK! Not really. The bottle shatters over The Pope’s skull 
           with no result - leaving us with nothing but 500 lbs. of 
           pissed off bad guy.

           THE POPE LAUNCHES NICK ACROSS THE ROOM. His body hits the 
           ground, sliding across the hard wood floor into the next 
           room.

                                 THE POPE
                        Honestly, I hoped you’d be bigger.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Yeah. Me too.

           SUDDENNLY - Saint grabs a HOT IRON off of an ironing board 
           and slides across the floor on his knees. He rears back...

           SMACK! Nick hooks The Pope square in the nuts with the iron, 
           Steam hissing as the thug’s sack gets branded by Black & 
           Decker. 

           Pope grabs Saint by the neck!!! Squeezing tight!!!

           IN THE BATHROOM

           Harley covers herself with suds as PINSTRIPES and JONES 
           enter. She gasps as Pinstripes saunters up close.

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        No need to be shy, just the postmen 
                        ringing. We’re here for a pick-up.

           Pinstripes grabs SALVATION and kneels to tub level. Then he 
           thrusts his hand into the water, grabbing her between the...

                        You even think about screaming, and 
                        I’ll knot your neck tighter than 
                        these tied tubes you let everyone 
                        poke around at. 
                     (stops, reconsiders)
                        On second thought...

           He pulls his gun, aims: Bang-Bang-Bang.

           EXT. THE FIASCO HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           NICK IS LAUNCHED OUT THE 15TH STORY WINDOW. DEAD FREEFALL. In 
           descent, HE CRASHES THROUGH FIVE VERTICAL NEON LETTERS 
           SPELLING OUT FIASCO. Each letter shatters into sparks as he 
           falls. F-I-A-S-C... 

           ...Saint hits the O, which doesn’t shatter - merely shifts 
           and partially breaks away from the wall. He hangs on for dear 
           life. Our hero, hanging above the city from a neon letter in 
           his bathrobe.

           The Pope appears on the fire escape and makes his way down to 
           meet us. Nick is a sitting duck.

           NOW - Nick pulls the gun from his bathrobe pocket and unloads 
           hell. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. CLICK. CLICK. And we’re empty.

           Pope smiles and begins sliding on some leather gloves. His 
           shoddy laugh telling us that Nick hasn’t landed a shot. 

           Until, of course, we catch sight of the smoke rising up from 
           his chest. The laughing stops, smiles fade, guy’s so jacked 
           up it probably took him a few seconds to feel the pain. He 
           begins to groan... slowly reaching for his own piece.

           Nick has nothing left. No defense. He hangs in silence for a 
           moment -THEN- in spontaneous desperation, HE THROWS THE EMPTY 
           DESERT EAGLE.

           CLUNK. Pope’s head kicks back as the heavy weapon beans him in 
           the face. The Pope stumbles back in a temporary daze, his arms 
           flailing about as he collides into the railing and drops over 
           the edge.

           The earth shakes as his body THUDS to the ground. A short 
           flight. Estimated time of arrival... 4 seconds.

           Nick grabs a drain pipe and glances at The Pope’s lifeless body 
           - shards of asphalt broken up all around it. The impact of the 
           fall alone has set off every car alarm in a two block radius. 
           Let’s just call this professional handiwork on the fly. 

           Nick smirks to himself and begins to shimmy down the drain 
           pipe. Upon reaching the ground, he checks Pope’s neck for 
           pulses. Nothing. Then suddenly...
                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)           HEADLIGHTS coming straight at us! Nick has a second to react, 
           but he wastes it wondering “what the fuck”! The car thwacks 
           him at the waist and sends him over the hood. 

           And while Nick lies unconscious on the pavement, the driver’s 
           side door opens -and- a PINK HIGH-HEEL SHOE steps into frame.

           INT. MEAT LOCKER - NIGHT 

           Nick opens his eyes to find himself hanging from a meat hook, 
           hands bound, with Lucky hanging just across the freezer. He 
           immediately makes a muffled cry through his duct-taped gag...

           away on BRICKS OF COCAINE. Beads of sweat drip down their 
           faces -- you can’t buy this kind of labor. 

           The kid to the right cuts - who then passes to the kid who 
           packs - who then passes to the kid who wraps. The brick is 
           then dropped in a wheelbarrow at the table’s end. It’s a 
           solid procedure.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Damn kids are the best in the 
                        business. I know it sounds bad, but 
                        it’s better than pumpin’ out 
                        sweaters or high end kicks. 

           Another kid comes by and lifts the FULL WHEELBARROW. WE STAY 
           ON HIM as he wheels it down an empty corridor and dumps the 
           load INTO A LAUNDRY SHOOT. 

           WE DROP INTO THE SHOOT ALONG WITH THE FRESH BRICKS.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Each shipment is then dumped...

           WE WHIP THROUGH THE SHOOT - OUT OF THE SHOOT - AND DROP INTO 
           THE BACK OF A STOCKED SNOW PLOW.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        ...Loaded into a dozen snow plows, 
                        and shipped out to every slum and 
                        pissed up alley in Fiasco.

           NOW - A GARAGE DOOR OPENS AS A FLEET OF SNOW PLOWS EXIT THE 
           WAREHOUSE. Each one turning into a different route than the 
           last. And the latest shipment of drugs hits the city.

           WE ZOOM IN ON: ONE OF THE BRICKS. This particular brick then 
           dissolves into another that slides across the children’s 
           table. A visual effect that proves this process is an endless 
           cycle.

                                 LUCKY (V.O.)
                        Pack. Drop. Rinse. Repeat. There’s 
                        always fresh powder in this 
                        forecast. And that’s life in the 
                        Chop-Shop.

           The kids laugh, all starring forward at a mini-television. On 
           it, A BARNEY-LIKE DINOSAUR prances along to some dumbed-down 
           lyrical catastrophe.

                                 DINO THE DINOSAUR

No use.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Mm mmmmm mmm mmmmm mmmm. Mmmm mmm

                        THE CASE. THE GOD SQUAD’s GOT IT...

           The door cracks as KNOCKOUT JONES enters the locker. He 
           pushes aside some meat and grabs Nick around the collar of 
           his robe. He lifts him off the hook.

           INT. COMMUNITY SHOWER - CHOP SHOP - FEW MOMENTS LATER

           WHACK! Nick takes a crushing hook to the jaw. WHACK! Fresh 
           DNA sprays across the room. SIX BRUTISH POLICE OFFICERS 
           (52nd) are pummeling him, just like the scene from our open. 

           The cops back-off. The chair spinning dilatorily, allowing us 
           to view Nick’s beaten face in glimpses of flickering light.

                                 DOUGHBOY (O.S.)
                        Looks like you gotta knack for 
                        musical chairs. Here you are, best 
                        seat in the house.

           As the chair spins back around, we reveal the most 
           disgusting, hideously  FAT FUCK you’ve ever laid eyes on. 
           This is DOUGHBOY, kingpin of Fiasco Heights. MICK THE MORMON 
           stands in the shadows behind him. A loyal right hand.

           He deep throats a few tater tots, then squeezes a packet of 
           ketchup right into his mouth. Notice that the ketchup packet 
           MATCHES ALL THE OTHERS that Nick has found.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        Want some tots?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I’m full.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        Suit ya’self.

           Now, Doughboy unwraps a bean burrito -and- takes a huge bite.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        I got some bones with ya, and it’s 
                        gonna be fun picking ‘em. 

           MORMON approaches Nick and backhands him with brass knuckles. 
           Blood disgorges, violently, sending another stray tooth 
           rattling across the tile.  Mormon steps back.

                     (chewing tots)
                        You’re grinnin’ all over the floor, 
                        Nick. I guess I speak for the both 
                        of us when I say we’re all smiles.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Don’t talk with your mouth full, 
                        fat lady -- you’ll never hit the 
                        high notes.

           Mormon clobbers Nick again.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        Ya know, I love watchin’ you 
                        suffer. And I don’t give a furry 
                        fuck in the summer time how long it 
                        takes.

           Nick struggles for breath.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I shoulda known you were behind 
                        this, the plot was drippin’ with 
                        grease. 

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        I’m behind everything in this town.

                        Touche.

           Mormon backhands Nick AGAIN... more flesh tears. More blood.

                        Diet pills - not really your thing.

           SMACK. This time Doughboy cracks him across the jaw with his 
           CANE, then he calls off the 52nd officers.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        Wise ass.

           The 52nd thugs leave the room.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Who pulled off the bank score?

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        I did. I assembled a crew right 
                        outta The Catholics own back yard.

           (cid:13)           SPLICE FLASHBACK: THE GETAWAY MINIVAN. Our 5 mystery robbers 
           remove their disguises revealing PINSTRIPES (villain #1), 
           WILDE (villain #2), MCBANISTER (villain #3), KNOCKOUT JONES 
           (driver), THE POPE (villain #5).

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        The God Squad works for me now. I 
                        had those puppets hit five banks 
                        ‘til they got it right. Let them 
                        keep all the proceeds though. 
                     (bite of tots)
                        See, I couldn’t have my own guys 
                        get caught shoplifting from the 
                        offering plate. No way. I ain’t 
                        gonna start a war over this.
                     (bite of burrito)
                        And that girl you been flossin’ 
                        with... what a floozy.

           SPLICE FLASHBACK: HOPE locks THE CASE away in the safe 
           deposit box at The Fiasco Savings & Loan. McBanister and 
           Pinstripes are staking out the bank, but don’t see her.

                                 DOUGHBOY
                        But we couldn’t have done it 
                        without her. She was putty, and 
                        it’s gonna be criminal when you...

           BLAM! Chunks of brain matter and burrito freckle Nick’s face, 
           bloody bone fragments splattering the walls. And we dolly 
           back to find THE MORMON HOLDING A HOT TRIGGER -- gun clearly 
           visible through the giant hole in Doughboy’s head.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Call me impatient, but I got sick 
                        of waitin’ on his monologue.

           Nick’s face is dripping with high cholesterol. 

                                 THE MORMON (CONT’D)
                        Don’t look so shocked, Nick. You 
                        should be happy I gave that fat 
                        fuck a B positive shoe shine. 

           Mormon grabs the case, and slides a chair in front of Nick.

                                 THE MORMON (CONT’D)
                        With Doughboy singin’ somewhere 
                        over the rainbow, I’m gonna run 
                        this show alone. And this case is 
                        gonna help get me started.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Why? You’re low on motive, Mormon.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Don’t need motive when there’s 
                        greed in the air. I’ve already got 
                        buyers lined up for this shit. 
                        Catholics included.

                        They offered big bucks along with a 
                        cut of their own turf. And that’s 
                        real power, Nick. Genuine fuckin’ 
                        power. So call this my own private 
                        little double-cross.

           Mormon lights up a cigar.

                                 THE MORMON (CONT’D)
                        See, unlike you, I actually know 
                        what salvation is. 
                     (inhale-exhale)
                        It’s a new recipe your crazy nun 
                        employers concocted. A drug so potent 
                        it’ll make heroin look like cough 
                        syrup. Every tweaker in the city will 
                        kill to put this shit in their arm, 
                        and one fix will cost thousands. The 
                        only thing standing in my way were the 
                        sisters - trying to keep it all for 
                        themselves. I just had to wait for the 
                        right one of them to help me... that’s 
                        when I found Hope.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        You’re a liar.

                                 THE MORMON
                        No. I’m a drug dealer. Salvation is 
                        a high so pure you’d think God was 
                        right there walkin’ you through it. 
                        So clean it feels like redemption 
                        running through your veins. So warm 
                        you’d swear you were kissed by 
                        angels. You’ll wake up feeling like 
                        a new man, with a fresh start. And 
                        after you shoot up once, you’ll 
                        never have the urge to do it twice.
                     (inhale-exhale)
                        That’s what you want, right Nick? A 
                        quick fix of redemption? 
                     (now a vicious glare)
                        But let’s just talk about how my 
                        boys two-holed your cunt-hooker.

           WHAM! NICK HEAD-BUTTS THE MORMON, blood spills from his mouth!

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        How those words taste?

           Mormon gets up and grabs a MEAT HOOK -then- swings it into 
           Nick’s shoulder. Nick flinches in pain as it pierces his 
           flesh.

           ANGLE ON: A RUSTED CAN OF LIGHTER FLUID.  Mormon grabs it, 
           begins dousing Nick. It’s soaking through his robe.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Don’t get brave. Just because I 
                        don’t drink Coke or watch R rated 
                        flicks, doesn’t mean I won’t make 
                        this hurt.

           spark his lighter and strategically place it over the central 
           drain of the shower room. Fluid trickling towards it. 

                                 THE MORMON
                        I’ll leave the lights on for ya, 
                        partner. Sweet dreams.

           Nick struggles to free himself. It’s useless - the chair 
           swivels but it won’t budge. He tries to blow out the flame. 
           He blows - and blows - and blows. But no dice.

           Then... Nick sees something. Two eyes peering from an empty 
           shaft in the wall. Someone is watching him. He looks closer.

           IT’S ONE OF THE KIDS FROM THE CHOP-SHOP BELOW.

           Nick stretches his hand into the bathrobe, reaching deeply 
           into the pocket...

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Kid. Hey kid. I need your help.
                     (kid doesn’t budge)
                        Do you like candy? Rice candy?

           ...And he tosses a small BOX OF RICE CANDY onto the floor.

                                            JUMP CUT TO:

           VICTIM #1: A gangster climbing the stairs. He’s wheezing like 
           a fat kid who just ran a mile. Gangster stops for a break and 
           takes a puff from an inhaler. But...

           As he opens his mouth for a second puff, the raw end of A 
           GLOCK 18 SELECT IS STUFFED INSIDE. Fatty’s lips quiver around 
           the barrel.

                                 NICK THE SAINT 
                        Hey Wheezy.

           BAM! The inhaler goes airborne. Nick signs the cross, then 
           checks Wheezy’s coat tag -- looks like a perfect fit. He 
           quickly removes the jacket and begins to dress.

           KNOCKOUT JONES carries a stiffer version of Lucky out of the 
           meatlocker. He sets him in a chair as TWO POLICE THUGS begin 
           strapping him down. Lucky’s teeth are still chattering.

                                 PINSTRIPES (O.S.)
                        Calm down now Eskimo, you’re 
                        speaking so fast I can’t make out 
                        the words.

                                 PINSTRIPES (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been leaking trouble from 
                        the start, Doyle.

           Pinstripes lays his hand on Lucky’s shoulder, massaging.

                                 PINSTRIPES (CONT’D)
                        Here it’s my day off and I’m about 
                        to get my suit all dirty. It’s not 
                        worth the time and a half.

                                 LUCKY
                        Don’t get anxious on coppin’ feels. 
                        I try to keep cock outta my diet.

           Pinstripes bitch slaps Lucky across the chin.

                                 PINSTRIPES
                        I’ll assume that’s just the 
                        frostbite talking. 

           CLICK... Pinstripes pops a SWITCHBLADE against Lucky’s cheek. 
           Razor sharp edge pressing into the bone, piercing his skin 
           with the tip of the blade.

                                 PINSTRIPES (CONT’D)
                        Let’s call this your divine 
                        intervention. You know, since you 
                        won’t be living through it.

           Pinstripes nods to Knockout, who opens a burlap sack and 
           begins filling it with SALT. He then slips the bag over 
           Lucky’s head and seals it at the neck with duct tape.

           Knockout now removes a GRENADE from his sweatsuit and balls 
           it up in his fist. PUNCH. JAB. HOOK. JAB. JAB. UPPERCUT. He’s 
           just pummeling Lucky’s face like a punching bag. 

           LUCKY’S MUFFLED SCREAMS ECHO as the salt drives into each 
           fresh wound along with the Champ’s knuckles. He swallows a 
           mouthful of blood & salt, then screams again.

           AND SUDDENLY -- BAM! THE ECHO OF A GUNSHOT.

           All heads turn to PINSTRIPES. He gasps, clove falling from 
           his mouth. Slowly, EVERY WHITE STRIPE IN HIS SUIT BEGINS 
           TURNING RED, blood seeping into the fabric. 

           BAM!! His chest opens in an eruption of blood, and Pinstripes 
           keels over in a lifeless pile. Behind him...

           NICK THE SAINT enters in a fume of rising smoke. TWO LOADED 
           GUNS in hand. He gives COP #1 a point blank introduction... 
           BAM! BAM!... and sends him out messy. Now...

           Nick weaves as both Knockout and COP #2 reach for their guns. 
           They unload hell -but- Nick makes his way across the room 
           using frozen body bags as cover.
                                                               (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)           THE SAINT flips on KNOCKOUT. One barrel locked and loaded.

           BOOM! NICK PUTS A HOLE IN JONES, his body thuds the wall and 
           drops clean. But remember that grenade he was using as a 
           punching weight? Well, it slowly rolls across the floor... 
           and the pin doesn’t seem to be in it. 

           Nick dives just as... BoooooooooM!

           Every wood plank in the ground splinters at the force of 
           discharge. Floor blasting in an eruption of debris causing 
           all of our players to free-fall into the factory floor.

           Nick drops onto a cocaine cumbered table, while Lucky smashes 
           to the ground in his chair. He’s out cold.   

           NICK STANDS COVERED IN POWDER -- CHILDREN ARE SCREAMING, 
           RUNNING RAMPANT ALL AROUND US... bolting for the exits.

           BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM. BAM.

           COP #2 starts firing like a guerilla on overtime -as- Nick 
           tosses one of the tables on end and kicks it toward him... 
           FIRING THROUGH THE WOOD AS IT SLIDES ACROSS THE FLOOR.

           THE DINOSAUR MUSIC PLAYS OS -UNTIL- A BULLET SHATTERS THE TV.

           COP #2 empties his pistols and reaches back for a two-hand 
           refill. Bricks of cocaine are going off around us like fire 
           crackers. It really is snowing in this fucking place.

           Nick glissades the tabletops, escaping one bullet at a time. 
           Debris creating a haze beneath the symphony of hissing ammo.

           A STRAY SHOT TRIGGERS SOME ELECTRICAL WIRES FROM A FUSE BOX - 
           AN ENORMOUS SPARK - FIRE SPREADS ALONG THE WALLS.

           Nick squints as specks of cocaine pelt his face. And he dives 
           behind a wooden column for cover -KA-BLOOM- just as a clump 
           of it projects into a fray of splinters. Now, Nick lowers and 
           turns to fire... double-fisting this time. BANG-BANG-BANG.

           Cop #2 is flung to the ground when a table mushrooms in his 
           face, gun sliding out of grasp. He scatters for the gun, as...

           Nick quickly grabs a sharp instrument (same one the children 
           were using to cut the drugs) and heaves it across the room. 

           THUNK. The cleaver-like tool lodges into the cop’s forehead. 
           Blood torrents down his face like the floodgates just opened.

           Now, Nick stumbles to a semi-conscious Lucky, unties him.

           <BOOOM> Another circuit blows as Nick slaps Lucky awake. Fire 
           roaring across the walls - this place is igniting on high.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        C’mon Doyle -- wake up!
                     (Lucky stirs)
                        Let’s get the hi-fuck outta here. 
                                                                  (cid:13)

           (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)           Nick lifts Lucky onto his shoulder. Together they hobble for 
           the drop-shoot, the ceiling coming down all around us.

           INT. GARAGE - CHOP/SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           LUCKY/NICK FALL FROM THE SHOOT and land in a SNOW PLOW 
           brimming with coke. The two of them are blanketed as they 
           break open every brick upon landing.

           CLOSE ON: Our guys caked in white powder, freckled in drugs & 
           blood. The Chop Shop going up in a blaze of fire above us. 
           So, Lucky scoops up some blow and has a sniff. Re-energizing.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Really? You think this is the 
                        appropriate time for that?

                                 LUCKY
                        <snort> Huh? <snort> What?

           Nick/Lucky climb out of the plow, and run out of the smoking 
           garage. Down the street, Nick conveniently catches THE MORMON 
           helping HOPE into a sleek town car. It begins to pull away.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                     (to Lucky)
                        Come on -- hurry!

           And Nick steps into the street to front a large DELIVERY 
           TRUCK. As it stops, he aims his gun at the DRIVER, forcing 
           him out. 

           SUDDENLY OS -- THE ROAR OF POLICE SIRENS. The 52ND back-up 
           unit is en route and gaining.

           Nick climbs in the truck and pulls the clutch down. Lucky 
           casually stumbles into the passenger seat. AND WE’RE OFF... 
           WITH THE ENTIRE 52ND PRECINCT NOW ON OUR ASS. 

           Nick whips a curve, following the town car up an on-ramp that 
           spits us onto an insane autobahn-like freeway. ROUTE 99 - a 
           road that’s never heard of speed limits.

           MASSES OF TAILING POLICE CRUISERS RIGHT BEHIND US. SIX SQUAD 
           CARS and 4 police MOTORBIKES to be specific.

           BASH! ONE CRUISER RAMS US FROM THE RIGHT!

           Delivery truck swerves violently, then regains forward 
           momentum. Nick steers out of it and rams back, sending the 
           cruiser wide to prove Nick has the bigger pair.

           BOOOOM! Metal twists as the cruiser slams straight into the 
           median. It goes up in two pieces. Glass scattering through 
           the air like someone shook up a snow globe.

           (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)           Now, THE FOUR BIKERS weave to the front of the pursuing 
           caravan. Each unstrapping a TOMMY GUN from their bikes.

           Nick shakes right as BIKER #1 puts a string of pearls in the 
           windshield. He aims his .38 SPECIAL out the driver side and 
           goes for the fences...

           BAM. BAM. BAM. BIKER #1 skips the bullets just as BIKER #2 
           ponies up next to the speeding truck.

           Nick jerks the wheel and tries to put BIKER #2 against the 
           walls. But the rider grabs onto the rear view mirror -- his 
           bike getting crushed as he lifts off.

           Biker #2 punches through the passenger window and takes aim -
           but- Nick dives over and KICKS OPEN THE DOOR. Biker #2 holds 
           on for dear life as the door swings fully open... AND SMASHES 
           AGAINST A NO SPEED LIMIT SIGN.

           ON THE HIGHWAY: A MINIVAN OF DELINQUENT KIDS enters the mix.

           BIKER #1 opens another round from his Tommy -just as- BIKER 
           #3 comes up from behind the truck. Nick gets a sudden rush of 
           true grit in his blood... AND... HE SLAMS THE FUCKING BRAKE!

           Smoke rockets from the wheels as the truck stops cold! AND 
           WHAM - Biker #3 slams into the rear bumper, jacking his body 
           forward and throwing him into the truck past Lucky...

           BIKER #3 SLIDES ACROSS THE FLOOR until his shoulders CRUNCH 
           between the two front seats. Nick instantly puts the .38 to 
           his temple and pulls the trigger.

           ANGLE ON: THE BOTTOM OF THE TRUCK -AS- BAM! A BULLET HOLE 
           EXPLODES THROUGH FROM ABOVE. And a stream of blood follows.

           Nick puts the gear back into 4th and accelerates hard. BIKER 
           #1 still taking shots from the cheap seats two lanes over. 

           So, let’s welcome BIKER #4 to the party. HE’S COMING RIGHT AT 
           US AGAINST TRAFFIC -- TOMMY ON FULL. Nick treads the fire and 
           puts the pedal down. It’s a hard-ass game of chicken.

           WHAAAAM! And it couldn’t be possible, but BIKER #4 just went 
           into the grill with a flesh smoldering slam. Nick smiles.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Judges?

                                 LUCKY
                        I’d call it a tie.

           Now, RAPID GUN FIRE PELTS THE SIDE OF THE TRUCK as Biker #1 
           ponies up to Nick/Lucky - delivery truck getting shredded.

           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)           Nick gets a crazy idea -and- goes right for it. Pedal kissing 
           the ground as the speedometer puts one in the record books.

           SLAM!!! The delivery truck plows into the home! Pieces of low 
           class architecture crack to pieces as the truck charges 
           through and hops the trailer, disappearing in the eye of 
           destruction.    

           Then, out of nowhere, the side door of the home swings open 
           as NICK LEANS FROM IT and FIRES RAPIDLY. He cleans his 
           barrel, putting five shots across lanes.

           Nick dives back inside when the final Biker #1 sprays another 
           round across the home. More spent ammo.

           INT. MOVING HOME - CONTINUOUS

           A cozy little place. Flowered wallpaper. Berber carpet. 
           Matching sofas. A mounted deer head... AND A HUNTING RIFLE 
           ABOVE THE FIREPLACE.

           Nick reaches for it. Checks the barrel.

           INT. MOVING HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Nick opens the bathroom window and steadies the rifle against 
           his shoulder. He takes a deep breath, aims carefully... BAM!

           WE GO SLOW MOTION

           AND FOLLOW THE BULLET AS IT TRAVELS ACROSS LANES - INTO THE 
           MINIVAN - BETWEEN A ROW OF FIGHTING DELINQUENTS - OUT OF THE 
           MINIVAN - AND MAKES A FATAL “CRACK” IN THE VISOR OF BIKER #1. 

           RESUME MOTION

           Great shot! Nick smiles because he knows it. But he soon 
           forgets as THE TRAILER STRAPS BEGIN SNAPPING. Home leans, 
           slowly tipping off the 16 wheeler. Nick braces.

           NOW ON FREEWAY: A FULLY LOADED GARBAGE TRUCK.

           INT. TRANSPORTABLE HOME - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Lucky jumps into the driver’s seat of the delivery truck and 
           punches the clutch. Nick climbs in too -AND WE- REVERSE OUT 
           OF THE TIPPING HOME BACK ONTO THE FREEWAY. Just as...

           The house topples to the asphalt, rolling in direct path of 
           the TOWN CAR. AND BOOOM... the car plows right through the 
           corner of the home, lifting off the ground, and...

           Sparks fly as the town car flips, skiddng across three lanes 
           of traffic. Metal grinding as it barrel rolls with sheer 
           tenacity. Nick grits his teeth, knowing Hope is inside.
                                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)

           BAY BRIDGE.
                 NICK THE SAINT
                                           LUCKY
           HOLY SHIIIIT!
                                  HOOOOLY SHIT!

           Honk. Honk. Honk. Collisions ensue as every car on the road 
           stops on a dime to avoid the wreckage. Fender benders 
           chirping all around us like a catastrophic lullaby.

           Nick stops the delivery truck and signs the cross. Lucky 
           tries as well, fucking up the rotation. But Nick doesn’t 
           notice, because already racing across traffic to the 
           overturned town car. And suddenly...

           CLICK - CLICK - CLICK - CLICK - CLICK - CLICK. An arsenal of 
           weaponry sounds off around Lucky as he almost pisses himself.

                                 O’TOOLE (OFFICER)
                        Hands in the air, shit-stain!

           Lucky removes the small DERRINGER from his pocket and raises 
           his arms. And... BAM... it accidently misfires. Again.

                                 LUCKY
                        Oops.

           The bullet hits the GARBAGE TRUCK TIRE sending the speeding 
           vehicle skidding right into the bridge rail at 65mph. 

           CRASH!! All officers turn as the trucks slams on it’s side, 
           vaulting a night’s waste into the air like a catapult. And...

           Lucky watches as about 23 body-bags lift into the air, 
           hoovering. Then it begins RAINING CORPSES all around us. 
           SPLAT. SPLAT. SPLAT. SPLAT. Literally dropping like flies.

           The cops take cover after a corpse smashes onto a cruiser... 
           giving Lucky just enough response time to suck in his own 
           nerve and fire the derringer.

           SCENE GOES COMPLETELY SILENT:

           All we’ll get to hear is THE BEATING OF HIS HEART.

           BA-BUMP. BA-BUMP. BA-BUMP. BULLETS ZIP ACROSS THE SCREEN FROM 
           ALL ANGLES AS THE GUNFIGHT BEGINS. Everything in sync with 
           the pace of Lucky’s heartbeat. BA-BUMP. BA-BUMP. BA-BUMP.

           He turns his head just as a BULLET GRAZES HIS CHEEK. Hot ammo 
           pings across frame while body-bags fall. All cops going down 
           with elegance, as if this were choreographed by Bob Fosse.

           SOUND RETURNS: As Lucky finds himself standing, miraculously, 
           with about 5 HOLES IN HIS OVERCOAT. Lucky smiles, until...

           BAM. A “STRAY” SHOT TO THE CHEST TAKES HIM DOWN.

           nothing but a DEAD CHAUFFEUR inside.

                                 THE MORMON (O.S.)
                        Watch your back, Nick.

           BAM. Nick takes A SHOT IN THE BACK -and- keels to the ground. 
           He groans and slumps against the bridge rail, pressing a 
           thumb to his shoulder to apply pressure.

           Now, THE MORMON emerges through the smoking debris. Fiasco 
           Bay glistening all around us.

                                 THE MORMON
                        I know, that’s twice. I’m chokin’ 
                        on the bittersweet of it all.
                     (beat)
                        But this is a fitting note to end 
                        on. Can I get an Amen?

           Then, POP! Mormon screams like hell as his knee cap goes off 
           like a firecracker. Smoke surging from below Nick’s face, 
           where he firmly has the .38 “SPECIAL” aimed inside his jacket.

           BAM. Nick puts another shot in his chest, grounding Mormon  
           with gusto. He falls against the opposite rail... THE CASE 
           LYING DIRECTLY BETWEEN THEM BOTH.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Amen.

           Nick smiles. Until a third figure slowly steps into the 
           moonlight. And it’s none other than SISTER HOPE CAUFIELD. She 
           limps through the smoke, passing right between Nick & Mormon.

           AN UNSETTLING FEELING COMES OVER NICK as she reaches down for 
           the case. His expression consumed with heartache.

                                 HOPE
                        Don’t act so surprised, Nick, I’m 
                        no virgin when it comes to bein’ 
                        naughty. You should’a seen that.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I just didn’t know you’d sell out 
                        for 30 specks of silver, sister.

                                 HOPE
                        Try 15 million specks of silver and 
                        we’ll share the same page.

                                 THE MORMON
                     (through utter agony)
                        Nick, I’d like you to meet my wife. 
                        Or, one of them anyway. How’s that 
                        for twists?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        That true?

                        Guilty. 
                     (blowing Mormon a kiss)
                        Doesn’t mean we can’t be friends 
                        though, Nick. Pen pals even.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I don’t like friends.
                     (putting it together)
                        This play was rehearsed and I fell 
                        right between the lines. You stole 
                        the case and stashed it for your 
                        hubby here. Seein’ as how his 
                        release was only days out... 

           INSERT FLASH: Hope stashing the case at the bank. Never once 
           noticing that SWEATS TAKES THE POLAROID PICTURE as she exits.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        But the twins had ya pegged from 
                        go... they must’a tipped ya off to 
                        every interested party in town.

           INSERT FLASHES: Sweats shows the Polaroid to Doughboy. He 
           looks at HOPE’S PICTURE and smiles. Next, Sweats passes the 
           picture to Father Pisarro, who then passes it to Pinstripes. 
           Who then passes it to Lucky. Who gets it to Nick.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Then that drama club pulled a 
                        matinee right under your nose.

           INSERT FLASH: The Vaudevillains robbing the bank. McBanister 
           removes his moustache upon retrieving the case. He smiles.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        All the while, Mormon just played 
                        dummy until his crew got possession 
                        ‘a the ball again. So when The 
                        Catholics agreed to pay big, you 
                        lovebirds started playin’ dirty. 

           INSERT FLASHES: Hope stabs McBanister. Removes the key from 
           his Gideon Bible. She tucks it into her bra, just as Deli’s 
           cab races up -and- Nick storms through the front door. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And covered your tracks.

           INSERT FINAL FLASH: Hope kills Monseigneur at the sanctuary. 
           She then lights a match and tosses it onto a wooden pew. And 
           all the while... Mormon is standing behind her. They kiss.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        When Mormon got the case, you two 
                        cleaned out everyone involved. Even 
                        Doughboy... and your own outfit.

                                 HOPE
                        Plan B - we just sit back and let 
                        you clean them all out for us.

                        You rolled a good game, Nick. I 
                        wouldn’t be here, with this, 
                        without all your help. So bravo... 
                        but ya don’t get the prize this 
                        time around.

           Hope walks over to her dying husband.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I’ve already had the prize, Hope. 
                        You’ve given it up a few times now. 

                                 HOPE
                        Don’t flatter yourself! I was 
                        always in the driver’s seat.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        And I was always in your rear.

           BAM! Mormon fires above Nick’s head. A miss. His final shot.

                                 THE MORMON
                        Hey! You’re talkin’ about my wife!!

           Nick looks at his wound, blood trickling down his sleeve now.  

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        How could you do it, Hope?

                                 HOPE
                        Don’t you understand? There ain’t 
                        no Hope. Never was. I posed like a 
                        school girl until the sisters 
                        showed the goods. Frankly, I 
                        couldn’t wait to get outta there. 
                        It drove me nuts - those bitches 
                        need to get laid. 

                                 THE MORMON (O.S.)
                     (coughs blood)
                        Baby... I may some help here... 

           Hope immediately turns her aim at Mormon.

                                 HOPE
                        Awe shucks honey, this case is only 
                        packed for one.

           BAM! The blow catches Mormon right between the eyes. His head 
           kicks back in a gust of blood, arms flailing to the side. 

           She turns back on Nick...

                                 HOPE
                        Sorry Nick. It was sweet, really 
                        sweet, but I love killing a good  
                        romance.

           She steps closer to him, cocks her gun. Then...
                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)           BAM. ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT. Hope stumbles backwards, blood 
           running down her neck. A look of extreme confusion takes face 
           as she slowly drops to the ground, spitting blood. And...

           ...Lucky Doyle is standing behind her. Derringer surging. And 
           we see the wound on his chest... IT’S COVERED IN WHITE GOO. 
           Then LUCKY REMOVES THE TUBE OF GLUE FROM HIS JACKET POCKET -- 
           IT CAUGHT THE BULLET.

                                 LUCKY
                        To broken hearts.

           Nick nods to Lucky -then- turns his gaze back to Hope.

                                 HOPE
                        Sa-save me, Ni-ck. Pl-ease save m-
                        me. Give me... what’s... in... th-
                        that ca-case... plea...

           Her body begins convulsing. Violently. Saliva spilling down 
           her cheek, fingernails digging into the asphalt.

           Nick watches her for a moment, reaches for THE CASE. Then...

           ...HE OPENS IT.

           And there it is... SALVATION. AN 8” SYRINGE loaded with a 
           dense, crystal clear fluid. It almost has a surreal glow 
           within the streaks of moonlight shining across the bridge.

           Nick stares at the syringe. This drug... this simple fucking 
           drug... is the cause of all this. The one thing he was sent 
           to retrieve is just a needle filled with untested product.

           He reaches into the case, hands trembling. Lifts the needle 
           over Hope. She’s begging him, crying, pleading that maybe it 
           will kill the pain. Somehow.

                                 HOPE
                        Please. Nick.. it... it hurts.

           We can read the conflict on his face. A tear forming, rolling 
           down his cheek. His first sign of emotion. Of weakness. Maybe 
           he did love this woman once. But only once.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I can’t. It’s not for us.

           Her convulsions turn extreme. Blood torrenting from her nose. 
           AND NICK THINKS TWICE. The guilt weighing on him...

           AND SO, HE THRUSTS THE SYRINGE INTO HOPE’S ARM. HE INJECTS 
           HER. And before her eyes roll back into her head, she smiles 
           one last time. Utter peace taking face as she slips away.

           More moonlight spreads across the bridge as Nick places the 
           empty syringe back in the case. Lucky helps him up.
                                                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                 NICK THE SAINT
                     (finishing Lucky’s rant)
                        And dolled up dames who break ‘em.

           In the distance, we see a platoon of squad cars arriving on 
           the scene. All their hoods say 31st... THE GOOD GUYS.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. FIASCO HEIGHTS - NEXT DAY - ESTABLISHING

           The city is bustling. Streets more alive than ever. It isn’t 
           raining today. 

           And we track through the rooftops of Fiasco Heights, slowly 
           coming to FIASCO CENTRAL STATION. A gothic structure that 
           resembles Grand Central if built during the Roman Empire.

           EXT. CENTRAL STATION - CONTINUOUS 

           DELI is loading Nick’s things into the taxi cab. Nick, arm in 
           a fresh sling, takes “salvation case” from Lucky -and- slowly 
           TEARS THE RED CROSS RIGHT OFF THE CASE... yes, very unusual.

                                 LUCKY
                        How ya feelin’, pal?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Like someone shot me in the back. 
                        You?

           Lucky smiles at the sarcasm for the first time. THEN...

                                 FATHER PISARRO (O.S.)
                        I think you got something that 
                        belongs to us, fellas.

           CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. Not again. And Nick/Lucky turn to find a 
           hard boiled crew of choir boys holding semi-automatics. 
           Father Pisarro, on crutches, leads the group.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                     (smiles)
                        In fact, I think we do, father.

           Nick hands over the SALVATION CASE without a fuss..

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                     (to other clergy)
                        See brothers, even the blackest of

                        nights of high tide.

                        You’re absolutely right, Father. 
                        I’m actually just leaving now. This 
                        place ain’t my scene anymore.

                                 FATHER PISARRO
                        Then go with God.

           And the holy mob mumbles amongst themselves, then they turn 
           to slowly fade into a sea of pedestrians.

                                 LUCKY
                        So what’d you give ‘em?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Can’t say, but I’m pretty sure that 
                        this time... it goes boom.

           Lucky chews on that for a second, then cracks a grin.

                                 NICK THE SAINT (CONT’D)
                        Just a little trick I learned in 
                        pre-school. Let’s only hope they 
                        don’t open it ‘til Christmas.

                                 LUCKY
                        What about the nuns?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Well, I’ve gotta tell them the 
                        truth about Hope. But I don’t think 
                        they’ll mind, as long as I have 
                        their recipe... 

           Nick reveals the RED CROSS from the case -to which- the 
           entire back side is blocked with chemical formulas and 
           scribbled numbers. The recipe has always been attached.

                                 LUCKY
                        Shit on me! That’s what they really 
                        wanted back all along... ain’t it?

           Nick winks at Lucky. The kind of wink that says “sequel”.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Maybe there is redemption out 
                        there, friend, just doesn’t always 
                        come in shiny black cases.

                        Almost rush hour, Nick.

           Nick removes a BLACK CARD from his coat and hands it to 
           Lucky.

                        Nevermind the gun for hire... it’s 
                        an old card, but the name still 
                        works.  Searchin’ for a new motto 
                        now... one with a lower body count.  
                     (thinking twice)
                        But then again, ya can’t turn a new 
                        leaf if ya’ve already burned ‘em 
                        all. Right?

                                 LUCKY
                     (faint smile)
                        So where do you go now?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        I head east. Catch up on some 
                        reading. Maybe look into real 
                        estate... I think I could make a 
                        killing.

           Nick cringes as Lucky gives him a bear hug. He begrudgingly, 
           and painfully, returns with a pat or two.

                                 LUCKY
                        Who are you really, Nick?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Me? I’m just a bad guy tryin’ to 
                        make some good of the world. 
                     (considering)
                        At least I hope to someday.

           Nick painfully climbs into the cab.

                                 LUCKY
                        This is the end I take it?

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        For now.
                     (final nod)
                        Best wishes, pal. I pray you’ll 
                        find the right streak to tread on 
                        until we meet again. 

                                 LUCKY
                        I’ll damn well try.

           Nick hesitates. He removes a receipt from his pocket and 
           hands it over to Lucky. It reads: $50,000.

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Here’s your receipt.
                     (off Lucky’s stare)
                        Pain and grievance.

           And with that, Nick shuts the door. 

                                 NICK THE SAINT
                        Let’s roll, Deli.

           races from the city, across the Fiasco Bridge, and disappears 
           into a misty fog that carries it from sight.

           ON LUCKY

           He crumples the receipt -then- tosses Nick’s card to the wind. 

                                 LUCKY
                        I think my streaks are already changin’.

           AND, IN A QUICK CUT:

           INT. CASINO ‘69 - PRESENT NIGHT

           Here we find DOYLE sitting at a ROULETTE TABLE with FIVE 
           other players seated alongside him. 

                                 LUCKY
                        And that, my degenerate fuckin’ 
                        friends, is how I found salvation.

                                 ROULETTE PLAYER #1
                        So, what now Lucky?

           On that note, Lucky pushes a stack of blue bills onto BLACK #5. 

                                 LUCKY
                        Now? Well now... I let it ride.

           AND HE GIVES US THAT LUCKY SMILE ONE LAST TIME.

                                                              the end...
