           OVER BLACK:

           We hear soft MOANING. The RUB of bedsheets. TITLES APPEAR: 

                                  B.F.F.

                                                           FADE UP TO:

           A BED. We’re directly above it. There’s motion beneath the 
           sheets. The thrusting kind. Two bodies, though one appears 
           uninvolved (probably bored).

           The grunt of a male CLIMAX. He THROWS OFF the covers to reveal --

           A 14-YEAR-OLD BOY. Lily white ass. Cute, but skinny. Not a man 
           yet. The “body” beneath him nothing but sheets and pillows. He 
           ROLLS over --

           Straddling his crotch is a TEDDY BEAR. The source of his 
           pleasure. Yes, he was fucking his inanimate childhood friend.

           CLOSE ON the boy. CLOSE ON the bear. He wears a permanent, 
           stitched smile. OFF the sudden, jarring sound of an ALARM 
           blaring --

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

           TITLE OVER BLACK.

                               FRESHMAN YEAR

           INT. AARON’S BASEMENT BEDROOM - MORNING

           The boy, AARON (14), turns off the alarm, grabs a bullet-pointed 
           “To Do” list off the bedside table.

           QUICK SHOTS:

           -- “To Do” list. A pen crosses out “masturbate.”

           -- Aaron scrubs good and hard in the shower. Including behind 
           his ears.

           -- A pen crosses out “shower.”

           -- Aaron applies pimple cream to a tiny zit on his chin. 

           -- Crosses out “Retin-A.”

           -- Musses his hair, grabs freshly labeled schoolbooks, shoves a 
           Pop-Tart into his mouth.

           -- “hair” “books” “breakfast” all X-ed out.
           -- He ties his last shoe. Grabs “To Do” list. We finally see how 
           lengthy it is. This is one anal kid. Only one “to do” left. 

           -- CLOSE ON “pick up new girl.”

           A phone RINGS. Aaron picks up. This is BJ. We’ll meet him soon.

                                 BJ (V.O.)
                        Do you know how cool it is that you 
                        already have a driver’s license?

                                 AARON
                        It’s not cool. It’s necessary. The bus 
                        doesn’t come out to my unincorporated 
                        ‘burb so the DMV gave me a very specific, 
                        very restricted hardship license.

                                 BJ (V.O.)
                        It’s a hardship to make me take the 
                        yellow monster. Come get me.

                                 AARON
                        It’s a limited license. To school. To 
                        home. Not to school, to “BJ’s home.” And 
                        you’re not even remotely on the way.

                                 BJ (V.O.)
                        Oh, but you’re fine driving a complete 
                        stranger.

                                 AARON
                        My mom volunteered me and I can’t exactly 
                        say no. It’s her car.

                                 BJ (V.O.)
                        I hope the new girl is a fat freak.

                                 AARON
                        Bye, Beej.

           Aaron SLAMS his phone shut.

           EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - MORNING

           Suburban development at its finest. The gray skies match the 
           color of the now-faded white picket fences.

           Welcome to Omaha.

           EXT. AARON’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Aaron climbs behind the wheel of a rusting, ‘96 white Ford 
           Taurus. After a few strained WHIRRS, the engine ROARS to life. 
           Black exhaust spills from the tail-pipe.
           INT. AARON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Aaron readjusts his rearview and side mirrors, finally puts the 
           car in gear and -- 

           EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - CONTINUOUS

           -- backs out of the driveway (ever so carefully). He shifts 
           gears, and drives DIRECTLY ACROSS the cul-de-sac to -- 

           EXT. SARA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Aaron lightly taps on the HORN. Waits. Another tap. Still 
           nothing. He finally LAYS on the horn when --

           IN EPIC SLOW-MOTION (cue that porn-rock anthem)

           he watches HER step through the door front door.

           SARA (14) 

           A teenage Jenna Jameson in a miniskirt and tight white top that, 
           defying physics, fits over her disturbingly ample breasts.

           The breasts BOUNCE ever closer to Aaron’s car. Attempting not to 
           stare, Aaron focuses on Sara’s gorgeous face. He smiles. Gives a 
           geeky little wave.

           Sara gets in. SLAMS the door. Aaron extends a nervous hand. 

                                 AARON
                        Hi, I’m --

                                 SARA
                        Aaron. Yah, I know. I’m Sara.

           She ignores his outstretched hand and digs into her bag for her 
           Sidekick. An affronted Aaron puts the car in reverse.

           INT. AARON’S CAR - DRIVING

           Not a mile over 35 mph. 

                                 AARON
                        So, you like -- 

                                 SARA
                        Shht!

           Sara puts up a FINGER. Checks her Sidekick and GIGGLES. Aaron 
           waits for her to finish. Then he makes another attempt.

                                 AARON
                        When did you move from --
           She puts away the Sidekick and dives into her make-up bag.

                                 SARA
                        Where is my... found it!

           She applies her lipstick, but the car LURCHES. 

                                 SARA
                        And if you could not brake just this 
                        second? 

           Aaron eyes the STOP SIGN he’s approaching.

                                 AARON
                        Well I --

           Sara reaches for the visor. Sees that --

                                 SARA
                        You don’t have a mirror? 

           She grabs her own.

                                 SARA
                          (to herself)
                        How do I look?

           Aaron glances at her sideways. With the pound of thick, dark 
           make-up, she looks:

                                 AARON
                          (to himself, low)
                        Like Satan’s whore.

                                 SARA
                        Just so it’s crystal, we carpool 
                        together, that’s it. At school, we 
                        separate or else people might think 
                        you’re my boyfriend. Or worse, my 
                        brother.

                                 AARON
                        Um, sure... Wait, why is brother worse?

                                 SARA
                          (prattling on)
                        Point is, once I’m out of the car, we 
                        don’t speak to, look at, or acknowledge 
                        each other in any way. 

                                 AARON
                        I’m the U.S., you’re the Soviets.
                                 SARA
                        Huh?

                                 AARON
                        Ever hear of the Cold War?

                                 SARA
                        You’re such a nerd.

           A new SONG comes on the radio. It’s yet to be written, but it’s 
           similar to the one that’s cemented in your memory as your 
           ultimate high school song.

                                 AARON
                          (cranks the volume)
                        I love this song.

                                 SARA
                          (turns it down)
                        Of course you do. You live in Omaha. No 
                        offense.

           EXT. OMAHA CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - ESTABLISHING

           Built for the children of Boomers, it’s two stories of 
           functional concrete. A sign proclaims “CENTRAL” is: HOME OF THE 
           KNIGHTS!

           EXT. OMAHA CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           The Taurus pulls into every freshman boy’s nightmare: a parking 
           lot full of beefy, UPPERCLASSMEN GUYS. 

           INT. AARON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Aaron puts it in park. Grabs his bag from the back.

                                 AARON
                        You need help finding --

           SLAM! Sara’s already bolted from the car. Aaron watches her tiny 
           ass brush past the passenger window.

                                 AARON
                        -- homeroom?

           EXT. OMAHA CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Sara marches confidently toward the entrance, past a group of 
           HOT SENIOR GUYS who smile and nod as they check out -- 

           An even SEXIER JUNIOR GIRL behind Sara.

           ON Sara. GULP. A smidge of her confidence dissipates.
           INT. OMAHA CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           The usual clamor of the first day of school. Aaron walks through 
           the hall, head down, when he’s startled by an ARM around his 
           shoulder. The arm belongs to BENJAMIN JAMES, affectionately 
           known as BJ (14). Aaron’s best friend, and Omaha’s horniest.

                                 AARON
                        Hey, Beej. 

                                 BJ
                        Welcome to our glory days, my friend. The 
                        first homeroom of the next four years of 
                        our lives.

                                 AARON
                        That’s the most depressing thing I’ve 
                        ever heard.

                                 BJ
                        By the way, you’re forgiven for not 
                        picking me up. I sat next to Greg White 
                        who has half the Vivid collection on his 
                        iPod. 

                                 AARON
                        Happy for you.

                                 BJ
                        How was the charity case?

           They hear a CRASH. Aaron turns to see its source.

                                 AARON
                        See for yourself.

           BEHIND THEM, Sara bends over in her miniskirt and collects the 
           contents of her bag, which have fallen all over the floor. Her 
           skirt inches up, revealing just a hint of ass cheek.

                                 BJ
                        It’s moments like these that prove God is 
                        a man.

           But he says it a little too loud. Sara turns and catches them.

                                 SARA
                          (to BJ, pissed)
                        What are you looking at, dipshit?

                                 BJ
                        A slut.
           Aaron pulls BJ away we find a lipstick ROLLING down the hall. 
           It’s stopped by a gorgeous high-heeled foot. A well-manicured 
           hand picks it up.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Ohmygod! They only sell this at Barney’s 
                        in New York.

           Sara picks herself up, coming face-to-face with JAYDEN (14), a 
           dark-haired beauty with a fashion obsession.  

                                 SARA
                          (takes the lipstick)
                        What’s your point?

                                 JAYDEN
                          (checks Sara’s feet)
                        Stuart Weitzmans instead of Payless.
                          (takes her in)
                        Black and white from head-to-toe.
                          (jaw drops)
                        You’re from New York City?!

                                 SARA
                        We just call it “the city.”

           Jayden LATCHES onto her.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Ohmygod. Is it as awesome as it looks? Is 
                        it really the center of the known 
                        universe?
                          (opens the lipstick)
                        Can I try this on?

           INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - DAY

           Sara and Jayden share make-up in the kind of dirty bathroom you 
           swear you’ll never revisit after graduation. 

                                 JAYDEN
                        So I told him I’m going to high school 
                        now. It’s time to move on. I didn’t want 
                        to be tied down just because his stupid 
                        ass flunked eighth grade.

                                 SARA
                        I had a boyfriend back home. It was so 
                        stupid. Relationships are completely 
                        overrated, you know? Sex with one guy? We 
                        aren’t living in the ‘90s.

           Jayden stares at her, eyes wide.
                                 JAYDEN 
                        Holy shit. You’ve... done... it?

                                 SARA
                        Who hasn’t?

                                 JAYDEN
                        You have to tell me everything.

           ON Sara, knowing she’s made her first friend.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Sara, Jayden, and group of equally hot freshman FASHIONISTAS 
           pick at salads at a corner table in the overcrowded lunchroom.

           A growing cacophony of WHISPERS takes us to the 

           CAFETERIA ENTRANCE,

           where MAD MAX (14) and his three BUDDIES have just entered. They 
           carry SUPER SOAKERS and pause in formation at the doors like a 
           teenage renegade army. 

                                 JAYDEN
                        Shit.
                          (to the other girls)
                        Mad Max.

           Max gets a purely insane glint in his eye as he leads the --

                                 MAD MAX
                        CHARGE!

                                 JAYDEN
                        Duck!

           But it’s too late. Mad Max and his friends have marked every 
           female in a white t-shirt for 100 feet. They go kamikaze on the 
           crowd, heading straight for:

                                 SARA
                        Ack!

           Max soaks her straight through that tiny white tee. At first, 
           Sara is furious, but when she sees the SENIOR GUYS are into it, 
           she switches into squealy girly mode, getting more attention.

           Jayden notices and pops up over the table, putting herself 
           directly in the line of fire. The other Fashionistas follow.

           Aaron and BJ eye them from across the room.
                                 BJ
                          (mouth agape)
                        I gotta tap one ‘a those this year.

                                 AARON
                        You tapping those would be like Max going 
                        to Harvard. 

           INT. AARON’S CAR - AFTERNOON

           They drive in silence. Aaron’s the first to break it.

                                 AARON
                        Sorry today wasn’t --
                          (pause)
                        -- the greatest --
                          (pause)
                        -- first day of school --
                          (pause)
                        -- ever.

                                 SARA
                        What the fuck is wrong with you?

                                 AARON
                        I was expecting you to interrupt me.
                          (off her silence)
                        Anyway, sucks what Max did.

                                 SARA
                        Are you kidding? That guy’s awesome.

                                 AARON
                        Are you kidding? He’s functionally 
                        retarded!

                                 SARA
                        He’s got high school figured out.

                                 AARON
                        Max never figured out long division. You 
                        think he understands --

                                 SARA
                        Shht!

           She dives for her Sidekick. Aaron’s annoyed.

                                 AARON
                        How many hours are you --

                                 SARA
                        Shht!
                                 AARON
                        If you’re going to ride in my car, you 
                        have to at least be civil towards me.

                                 SARA
                          (keeps Sidekicking)
                        I’m sorry, were you talking?

                                 AARON
                        That’s it.

           He wrenches the wheel and pulls the car over. Reaches across and 
           flings Sara’s door open. 

                                 AARON
                        Enjoy your workout.

                                 SARA
                        My first commandment: thou shalt not 
                        confuse transportation with exercise.

           She pulls her door shut with a SLAM!

                                 SARA
                        Fine. You wanna talk? Let’s talk about 
                        how much it’s gonna blow for you this 
                        year.

                                 AARON
                        It blows for all freshmen.

                                 SARA
                        Wrong. See, freshman girls are freshmeat 
                        girls. And while we go to all the best 
                        parties, you freshman boys will be stuck 
                        playing Grand Theft Auto with your left 
                        while jerking off to late-night Skinemax 
                        with your right.

                                 AARON
                          (drives on)
                        I liked your Sidekick better.

                                 SARA
                          (whips it back out)
                        Thank you.

           A GIANT TELEVISION SET

           BANGER #1 blows off BANGER #2’s head. We’re --
           INT. AARON’S BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT

           Mountain Dew cans litter the floor as Aaron and BJ (loudly) play 
           Grand Theft Auto in this private abode complete with separate 
           entrance. It used to be his dad’s rec room: wood-paneled, shag 
           carpet, foosball table, mini bar. 

           They both wear black pants and their Dairy Queen uniform shirts, 
           complete with name tags. Clearly just off-shift.

                                 AARON
                        Boo-yah!

           He tosses the controller. Done.

                                 BJ
                        I’ll be handling your ass like a tranny 
                        making you my bottom in the next round.

           Aaron does a brief victory dance, but sees it’s 12:00 am.

                                 AARON
                        You gotta go home. I have a bio test --

                                 BJ
                        Dude! It’s Friday night!

                                 AARON
                        Technically it’s Saturday now. And my 
                        test is Monday. I have a schedule to-

                                 BJ
                        You are such a nerd.

           Aaron throws up his arms.

                                 AARON
                        Why does everybody keep saying that?

                                 BJ
                        ‘Cause it’s the truth.

                                 AARON
                        Not all of us are lucky enough to be a 
                        legacy like you at that bastion of 
                        intellectualism known as ITT Tech. 

                                 BJ
                        Says the grand GTA loser.

           Aaron, always easily goaded by BJ, re-starts. BJ grabs a bong 
           sitting beside the couch. Takes a hit and offers to Aaron.
                                 AARON
                          (shakes his head “no”)
                        All the easier to make you my PlayStation 
                        whore.

                                 BJ
                          (exhales his hit)
                        Speaking of whores. How’s Driving Miss 
                        Easy?

                                 AARON
                        You know that cliche scene in slasher 
                        films where the hero jumps into his car 
                        to get away from the bad guy, only to 
                        unknowingly drive away with the killer 
                        lurking in the back seat, ready to slit 
                        our hero’s throat, spilling his blood 
                        across the dashboard?

                                 BJ
                        Yeah.

                                 AARON
                        It’s a lot like that.

                                 BJ
                        Whatta cunt.

                                 AARON
                        I hear they don’t like it when you call 
                        them that.

                                 BJ
                        Pretty, mean and slutty. She’s probably 
                        got the herp, the syph, the clam or all 
                        three.

                                 AARON
                        It’s just an act to get attention. 

                                 BJ
                        I don’t know a lot of things that you 
                        know Aar. I don’t know when the Battle of 
                        Gettysburg was --

                                 AARON
                        July 1863.

                                 BJ
                        Or the speed of sound --

                                 AARON
                        340.29 meters per second.
                                 BJ
                        Or who was president in 1895 --

                                 AARON
                        Harrison. But he was elected in 1893.

                                 BJ
                        But I do know sluts. And Sara Simmons? 
                        She fucks. A lot.

                                 AARON
                        Which you know because you’re the Wilt 
                        Chamberlain of Omaha? 
                          (off his look)
                        You had sex with one girl, Beej. Uno. 
                        After a night shift at the DQ. And it was 
                        so good, she never called you again. 

                                 BJ
                        I never called her again.

                                 AARON
                        After she had her number changed.

           ON THE TV SCREEN. Banger #1 BLOWS off Banger #2’s head. 

                                 AARON
                        Ouch! That hurts. Three in a row, fool. 

           BJ THROWS the controller in frustration. Gets up to go.

                                 BJ
                        Manana night. We’re crashing our first 
                        high school party.

                                 AARON 
                        Pass. I’ve got to keep my --

                                 BJ
                        Ditch the schedule. Trust me. First high 
                        school party = first high school ass.

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           NUBILE YOUNG GIRLS. Dancing on tables, couches, chairs -- 
           anything that’s a makeshift platform. But all this is viewed --

           FROM OUTSIDE THE WINDOW by BJ and Aaron.
                                 AARON
                        Do you have a plan to get us in?

                                 BJ
                        Yes. Operation: “it’s a big school.” 

                                 AARON
                        We’re freshmen.

                                 BJ
                        If confronted, we’re junior transfers.

           AT THE FRONT DOOR

           The guys are eyeballed by the SENIOR DOOR GUARDS, but they 
           cruise on in with a newly arrived group of PARTIERS.

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - SAME - CONTINUOUS

                                 AARON
                        Holy. Hell.

                                 BJ
                        Toto, I don’t think we’re in middle 
                        school anymore.

           ALCOHOL flows like a river, PARTIERS vie to take hits off a 
           giant six-foot BONG, and if you pause the DVD and forward frame-
           by-frame, a case could be made for public sex in the b.g.

           IN THE KITCHEN

           Sara and Jayden accept mixed drinks from two SENIOR GUYS in 
           varsity soccer jackets manning the makeshift bar.

                                 SARA
                        Thanks.

           She takes a sip, grimaces.

                                 SARA
                          (to Jayden)
                        Don’t they have Cosmos in Omaha?

                                 JAYDEN
                        Biatch, be grateful it ain’t Natty light.

           Sara shrugs. Can’t argue with that. Then she spots something.

                                 SARA
                        Fuck. Me.

                                 VARSITY SOCCER GUY
                        Really?
           Sara watches Aaron uncomfortably try to blend in with the crowd. 
           BJ heads his way with two bottles of beer, pausing to look up 
           the skirt of a LEGGY GIRL dancing atop a table. Nods: “not bad.”

           Aaron CHUGS for the first time as he’s met by --

                                 SARA
                        I thought we agreed to something about 
                        Vietnam.

                                 AARON
                        SO-viets. And we only agreed not to talk 
                        at school. 

                                 BJ
                        You’re deluded if you think we’re not 
                        going to show somewhere just because 
                        you’re in attendance.

                                 SARA
                          (ignores him)
                        So why are you here?

                                 AARON
                        Same reason you are.

                                 SARA
                        To hook up with the soccer team?

                                 BJ
                          (to Aaron: “see?”)
                        Uber-slut.

           Suddenly, they hear the approach of high-pitched BEEPING.

                                 PANICKED STONER
                        COPS!

           The chaotic flight begins as everyone runs --

           EXT. HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS

           -- only to find a MASSIVE TRUCK carrying a load of sand backing 
           up onto the lawn. The Varsity Soccer Guy Sara was flirting with 
           tries to stop it.

                                 VARSITY SOCCER GUY
                        Hey! Stop! This is private property.

           But the truck continues backing up.

                                 VARSITY SOCCER GUY
                        You want me to call the cops?!
           The truck passenger leans out, revealing it’s --

                                 MAD MAX
                        Do it. Tell them you’ve gotten 200 teens 
                        drunk. 
                          (beat, then shouts)
                        BEACH PARTY!

           He pulls a lever and DUMPS all the sand on the front lawn. 

                                 VARSITY SOCCER GUY
                          (ready to pummel Max)
                        The hell? Get this thing off my --

           But he freezes as he sees --

           Girls SCREAM with delight.  

           Sara runs to join the party, tearing off her clothing revealing 
           sexy black underwear. Girls’ clothes fly in all direction. The 
           music PUMPS. Half-naked bodies dance. The party rages on.

           Varsity Soccer Guy raises a fist. Max flinches, expecting a hit.

                                 VARSITY SOCCER GUY
                        Not bad. For a freshman.

           Varsity Soccer Guy’s fist is meant for “pounding.” Max does.

                                 MAD MAX
                        I’ve got 1,264 days ‘til I turn 18. Until 
                        then, call me Mr. Monopoly -- I’ve got a 
                        get outta jail free card.

           BACK ON THE PORCH, Aaron just watches, taking in his first high 
           school party. A FAT GUY pukes behind him. 

           He goes to find BJ, who’s dancing (or attempting to) on the lawn 
           with two DRUNK JUNIORS who are way out of his league.

                                 AARON
                          (over the music)
                        Hey. We gotta go. I have a track meet and 
                        another DQ shift --

                                 BJ
                          (pushes him off)
                        Go numb yourself with a beer so it 
                        doesn’t hurt when I pull the stick out of 
                        your ass.

           But Aaron’s not budging. BJ pleads with him:
                                 BJ
                        30 more minutes?

           Aaron looks at his watch, which reads: 11 p.m. 

                                                        CROSS FADE TO:

           Aaron’s watch. Now 1 a.m. He sits on a couch. Alone. His only 
           company the THREE empty beer bottles in front of him.

           AT A BATHROOM DOOR - MINUTES LATER

           Aaron waits, clearly having to pee. He gives a polite knock (his 
           second). Finally, DRUNK GUY emerges and Aaron darts

           INSIDE THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 AARON
                          (surprised)
                        Sorry. Thought it was empty.

           MALE and FEMALE forms (blurred by a curtain) are in the shower 
           together. 

                                 AARON
                        Um, kind of have to pee here.

           They don’t answer. And he doesn’t pee, choosing to voyeurously 
           stand there catching GLIMPSES of what’s going on behind the 
           curtain. An elbow. A leg. Naked skin. Is that a --

                                 DRUNK GUY
                        What the fuck, perv?

           Aaron freaks, only to freak more when he sees the companion is --

                                 SARA
                        Get out of here, Aaron!

           Aaron quickly SPRINTS out of frame to --

           EXT. TRACK MEET - DAY

           -- where Aaron SPRINTS into the continuous frame and crosses 
           over a finish line. He’s alone, so it looks like he won, until --

           -- we notice the other COMPETITORS already catching their 
           collective breath in front of him. Aaron was dead last.

           Aaron looks into the stands, but only a HANDFUL of people are 
           watching and he doesn’t know any of them. He TRIPS and --

           -- pitches forward, ready to collapse --
           INT. DAIRY QUEEN - LATER

           -- Aaron FALLS INTO FRAME, finishing his collapse. His head hits 
           the counter. BJ sleeps standing up in the b.g.

           EXT. SARA’S HOUSE - A MONTH LATER

           Sara heads to Aaron’s car, wearing autumn clothes.

           INT. AARON’S CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Sara SLAMS the door. The following conversation happens with no 
           break, but between cuts their clothes will change, showing the 
           passing seasons.

                                 SARA
                        Go.

                                 AARON
                        “Thanks for driving me to school, Aaron, 
                        I really appreciate all the help you’ve 
                        offered this year.” 
                          (beat)
                        “You’re welcome, Sara. You’re such a 
                        pleasant carpooling companion.”

           INT. AARON’S CAR - DRIVING - WINTER

           They both wear heavy coats as they whiz past bare trees.

                                 SARA
                        Sarcasm won’t get you into this size 
                        zero. 

                                 AARON
                        You look like you’re starving. Did they 
                        have food in New York?

                                 SARA
                        They had everything in New York.

           INT. AARON’S CAR - DRIVING - EARLY SPRING

           They wear raincoats and a March downpour comes down outside.

                                 AARON
                        Do you miss it?

                                 SARA
                        Not really. Schools in Manhattan don’t 
                        even have football teams. I couldn’t be 
                        Homecoming queen there.
                                 AARON
                        Gasp. That would truly have been tragic.

                                 SARA
                        I didn’t figure you’d appreciate this.

                                 AARON
                        Appreciate this what?

                                 SARA
                        This awesomeness known as high school. 
                        You’re too busy studying.

                                 AARON
                        Hey, I party.

                                 SARA
                        You don’t party, Aaron... You’ve been to 
                        a party. One. Months ago.

                                 AARON
                        Look, if I get the grades, I go Ivy. If I 
                        go Ivy, I go on to a life filled with 
                        “awesomeness.” It’s that simple.

                                 SARA
                        Yeah, and you’re gonna waste the next 
                        four years waiting for it.

                                 AARON
                        And you’re gonna waste the next four 
                        years in some drunken, drug-induced haze 
                        focused on nothing but becoming prom 
                        queen.

                                 SARA
                        I’m getting a trio of homecoming, winter 
                        formal and prom queen crowns, thank you 
                        very much.

                                 AARON
                        Great. You’ll peak senior year and spend 
                        the rest of your life expounding on 
                        regrets. Enjoy that.

           EXT. OMAHA CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - MAY

           The Taurus pulls up. Trees are green again. The milling students 
           have that happy look that signals warm weather and the imminent 
           summer break.

           Aaron pops out, in shorts and a t-shirt, and Sara in spring’s-
           here-so-I’m-wearing-almost-nothing. SLAM!
                                 SARA
                        Ass-face.

                                 AARON
                        You’re the one with shit sprayed across 
                        yours.

           Aaron heads off... and when he’s not looking, Sara takes out a 
           compact and WIPES AWAY some of her excess make-up. 

           INT. OMAHA CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Sara catches up to Jayden and the other fashionistas.

                                 JAYDEN
                          (sing-songy)
                        Project!

           Jayden reveals a flyer she took off the wall:

           Prom is May 5th.! “A Knight Under the Sea.“ Tickets On Sale Now!

                                 SARA
                          (determined)
                        Project.

           Aaron and BJ brush past. We FOLLOW them through the halls.

                                 BJ
                        The best time of the year --

           They pass yet another group of giggling FEMALE STUDENTS.

                                 BJ
                          (somewhat bitterly)
                        -- if you’re a girl.

                                 AARON
                        What’s going on?

                                 BJ
                        The most seminal of events in the life of 
                        a young female homo sapiens: the Prom.

                                 AARON
                        That’s all?

                                 BJ
                        “That’s all?” THAT’S ALL?! My friend, if 
                        you don’t understand prom, you’ll never 
                        understand the mind of the teenage 
                        vagina.
           A random SLACKER STUDENT turns around.

                                 SLACKER STUDENT 
                          (laughs, probably stoned)
                        You said “vag.”

                                 BJ
                        I totally did.

           They bump fists and BJ keeps walking with Aaron.

                                 BJ
                        Think of it this way: each year is a new 
                        adventure for a girl on the hunt for a 
                        prom date. 

           He begins to narrate the action in the hallways like a nature 
           channel documentary.  

                                 BJ
                        Freshman: Status symbol if you can get an 
                        invite. What they don’t realize is their 
                        chances of being asked are directly 
                        related to the number of rumors 
                        circulating about how much head they like 
                        to give. Case and point --

           He points to Sara and Jayden, who bend over (far more than 
           necessary) to reveal lower-back HENNA TATOOS to the same varsity 
           soccer guys they’ve been flirting with all year.

           BJ then motions to a group of SOPHOMORE GIRLS who squeal with 
           delight as their JUNIOR BOYFRIENDS shower them with gifts and 
           get on bended knees to ask them to prom.

                                 BJ
                        Sophomores: Their chances of going 
                        increase exponentially. Lots of them have 
                        junior boyfriends, and since all 
                        upperclassmen are invited to prom, it 
                        becomes a competition. Whose boyfriend 
                        will out-do on the “asking” part? A 
                        Tiffany blue box guarantees you’ll get 
                        into her box prom night. 

           BJ pulls Aaron further down the hall.

                                 BJ
                        Juniors: This is where it gets 
                        complicated. It’s social suicide for an 
                        older girl to date a younger guy. Since 
                        their options are dwindling, the single 
                        ones pull out all the stops to make sure 
                        they’re not left date-less.
           He points to THREE JUNIOR BLONDES, each fighting for attention 
           from of a CUTE SLACKER.

                                 BJ
                        Then of course there are the Seniors: 

           BJ spins Aaron toward a group of BRUNETTE SENIOR GIRLS.

                                 BJ
                        Zero hour. Most have already been to prom 
                        and have bad memories of “losing it” to 
                        some guy who’s now pounding beers in 
                        Lincoln. They can’t go with anyone 
                        younger, and worse, they know any senior 
                        guy they go with will be expecting to get 
                        laid: either because he’s a man-whore or 
                        because he must be deflowered on prom 
                        night lest he graduate a complete loser. 
                        That leaves the female senior in an 
                        interesting predicament usually reserved 
                        for the male gender: It is better to 
                        screw a virgin or a slut?

           The Senior Brunettes check out the sweetly PREPPY SENIOR GUYS of 
           the debate team, then promptly take a look at the BEEFY HOTTIES 
           of the football team. They sigh as the Beefy Hotties check out 
           Sara and Jayden swinging by. 

                                 AARON
                        If you put this much thought into your 
                        actual classes, you’d have a 4.0.

           A CATCHY POP-SONG LAUNCHES US INTO A MEGA-PROM MONTAGE:

           -- Another raging high school party. Sara makes out with Varsity 
           Soccer Guy against a wall. He pauses to ask her something. She 
           shrieks “Yes!” and leaps on him.

           -- Aaron gets cornered in the halls by a HEAVYSET GIRL. She asks 
           him something. BJ mimes “no way!”... Aaron looks at the girl, 
           doesn’t want to embarrass her... finally, he smiles “yes.” 
           Heavyset Girl beams. Sara watches from down the hall... who is 
           this guy?

           -- DEPARTMENT STORE. In a dressing room, Jayden helps Sara try 
           on a plethora of prom dresses. They’re strewn all over the 
           place. Not an ounce of floor is visible. Sara TEARS OFF the one 
           she’s wearing in disgust.

           -- The Mall. Jayden and Sara exit the store triumphantly, 
           breezing past a TUXEDO RENTAL SHOP store where --

           -- Aaron is being fitted as he haplessly attempts to tie his own 
           bow tie. BJ prattles on in the b.g.
           -- CLOSE ON a series of hands awkwardly pinning corsages. 
           Pricking themselves, breaking them, dropping them.

           -- Sara sews the finishing touches on her prom dress herself.

           -- Aaron CLIPS on a bow tie. Throws the one he was trying to tie 
           in the trash.

           -- Limo doors SLAM! SLAM! SLAM!

           -- Liquor store. A limo pulls to the side. TUXEDO-ED GUY hops 
           out, hands cash over to a HOMELESS MAN.

           -- Homeless Man hands a BAG OF BOOZE through the open limo 
           window. Keeps a bottle for himself.

           -- CLOSE ON shot glasses held high for a toast, but the hands 
           miss each other in the bumpy limo ride. Liquor spills and we spy 
           Sara, who quickly refills her glass for another shot.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN OMAHA RADISSON - ESTABLISHING

           A flashing SIGN BOARD welcomes the “Omaha Central High School 
           Porm.” (Yes, that’s intentional.)

           Limousines drop off guests, and then there’s the occasional farm 
           F-150 Supercab that pulls up to the valet stand.

           INT. DOWNTOWN OMAHA RADISSON - NIGHT

           Streamers. Lights. Cardboard cut-outs of mermaids and “Knights” 
           riding sea horses. A kitschy prom, Midwestern style. The TEENAGE 
           CROWD is already dancing.

           Sara, in a backless dress and surprisingly tasteful make-up, 
           enters on the arm of tuxedo-ed Varsity Soccer Guy. He holds the 
           door open for her as she stumbles past, clearly drunk.

                                 SARA
                        Such a gentleman.

           Once inside, he covertly takes out a flask.

                                 VARSITY SOCCER GUY
                        Want some more?

           Not so gentlemanly now. Sara readily takes a swig. Then another.

                                 SARA
                          (drunken battle call)
                        LET’S DANCE!

           They get on the dance floor, only for Sara to realize Varsity 
           Soccer Guy left all his moves on the field.  
           ON SARA’s horrified face. 

           ON VARSITY SOCCER GUY’S spastically gyrating body parts.

           Sara searches the room for help. Nobody. Until her eyes fall 
           upon Aaron entering the room with Heavyset Girl.

           Suddenly, Varsity Soccer Guy wraps his arms around Sara and 
           begins to GRIND... like a German Shepard humping a chihuahua.

           If looks could speak, Sara would be saying “kill me now,” but at 
           least she’s not Aaron, who’s pulled onto the floor to dance.

           Yet Aaron looks to be having fun. He’s happily (badly) dancing 
           with his plus-sized date. Sara’s baffled. She steals yet another 
           shot from her date’s flask.

           The song ends. Aaron parts with his date for the moment. 

           Varsity Soccer Guy offers Sara more flask. She takes another 
           swig, but then suddenly goes pale.

                                 VARSITY SOCCER GUY
                        You okay?

           And SPLAT! Goes the sound of the contents of Sara’s stomach... 
           spilling all over Varsity Soccer Guy’s patent-leather shoes.

           OFF his look of horror --

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. POST-PROM PARTY - NIGHT

           Another suburban house. Another mound of gyrating ass. But it’s 
           late, and the CROWD, bow ties and dresses in various state of, 
           well, undress, is starting to thin.

           IN THE KITCHEN, Sara rifles through cabinets until she finds a 
           bottle of PEPTO. She quickly unscrews the cap and chugs. 

           A tired Aaron leans on the counter beside her.

                                 AARON
                        Sooooo. Little too much drinky-drinky 
                        tonight?

                                 SARA
                        I only had like two, maybe three, shots. 
                        I just didn’t eat the last two days so I 
                        could fit into this dress. 
                                 AARON
                        It is quite the slutfit.
                          (beat, almost afraid to say:)
                        I guess you’ll be needing a ride home.

           Aaron points AROUND THE CORNER to the -- 

           LIVING ROOM, 

           where Varsity Soccer Guy is totally getting it on with Aaron’s 
           Heavyset Date.

                                 SARA (PRE-LAP)
                        That shithead!

                                                         REVEAL WE’RE:

           INT. AARON’S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

           Aaron takes home a sick, miserable Sara... She SMACKS the dash.

                                 AARON
                        What’s he supposed to do when his jail 
                        bait, “freshmeat” of a date ended up too 
                        sick to function? He wanted to get laid.

                                 SARA
                        So did I!

                                 AARON
                          (razzing her)
                        Oh, were you in love?

                                 SARA
                        Please. You can’t fall in love in high 
                        school. We haven’t even lived long enough 
                        to know what love is.

                                 AARON
                        Too easily confused with lust.

                                 SARA
                        Hormones will do that to you.

                                 AARON 
                        I mean, what’re the odds that in the 
                        entire planet, you find your so-called 
                        soulmate in a class of 250?

                                 SARA
                        I think high school sweethearts is just a 
                        nicer term for “no other options.”

           Aaron takes a second... do they actually agree on something?
                                 AARON
                        Yep. No such thing as love in high 
                        school.

                                 SARA
                        Definitely not.

                                 AARON
                        I mean, what’re you supposed to do after?

                                 SARA
                        Well if you’re really in love, you do 
                        college long distance --

                                 AARON
                        -- and break up by October --

                                 SARA
                        -- to get back together at Thanksgiving --

                                 AARON
                        -- only to break up for good over 
                        Christmas break?

                                 AARON/SARA
                        Bullshit.

           They share a laugh.

                                 AARON
                        Funny coming from a girl who appears to 
                        be completely guy obsessed.

                                 SARA 
                        I love guys, but they’re good for only 
                        one thing.

           Nope, she’s back.

                                 AARON
                        How patronizing.

                                 SARA
                        Spoken like a true virgin.

                                 AARON
                        How would you know?

                                 SARA
                        Are you?
                                 AARON
                          (defensive)
                        High school’s too important to spend it 
                        fucking around just trying to get fucked.

                                 SARA
                        High school’s too short not to.

                                 AARON
                        I think you’ve probably done enough of 
                        that this year.

                                 SARA
                        And you’ve never done shit. 

           Aaron SNAPS:

                                 AARON
                        How about you just say “thanks for the 
                        ride” like you should have all year and I 
                        won’t throw you out at the next corner?

                                 SARA
                        Please! Throw me out! I don’t care!

           Sara GRABS the wheel --

           EXT. AARON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The car swerves erratically, eventually passing through a STOP 
           SIGN without so much as pausing.

           A COP CAR parked in the shadows pops its CHERRY LIGHTS.

           INT. AARON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Aaron and Sara see the flashers. Aaron freaks.

                                 AARON
                        Shit! Shit! SHIT! 

                                 SARA
                        Just calm down and pull over.

           Aaron obliges, but not without a good deal of panic.

                                 AARON
                        Don’t tell me to calm down! Even the 
                        smallest ticket gets my hardship license 
                        pulled, and then we’re both fucked!

           Sara SLAPS him. It has the desired effect: shock.
                                 AARON
                        What was that --

           SLAP again. And another. It stings. Tears form in his eyes. 

                                 SARA
                        Hold your breath as long as you can.

           A police officer, OFFICER NORTON (40s) taps on the window.

                                 SARA
                          (whispers to Aaron)
                        Trust me.

           It CLICKS for Aaron. He doesn’t wipe the tears running down his 
           face and he cuts his breaths short as Sara leans over to LOWER 
           his window.

           INT./EXT. AARON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

                                 SARA
                        Officer...
                          (reads his badge)
                        ...Norton. We are so sorry.

           Aaron SNIFFS loudly, WIPES tears from his BRIGHT RED cheeks.

                                 OFFICER NORTON
                        License and registration.

           Aaron fumbles as he hands them over. 

                                 SARA
                        Sir, we just got the call about our 
                        grannie. Hospice is at the house. She’s 
                        only got minutes left.

           CLOSE ON Sara’s hand SQUEEZING Aaron’s crotch (but not in the 
           good way). He lets out a pathetic CRY. 

                                 OFFICER NORTON
                        Jesus. Take a deep breath, son, and get 
                        it together. You can’t drive and cry.

           Aaron obeys and finally sucks in a breath.

                                 AARON
                        Yes, sir. I’m so sorry. 

           The officer hands back the license and registration.
                                 OFFICER NORTON
                        I want you to wait here a minute and 
                        collect yourself. Grannie will hold on 
                        for you, I promise. 

                                 SARA
                        Yessir. Thank you. 
                          (to Aaron)
                        Think you can do this, bro’? 

           Aaron solemnly nods. Rolls up the window. 

           IN HIS REARVIEW MIRROR, the cop gets back in his car and drives 
           off. A long beat. Then they scream out “Yeahs!” and “Woo-hoos!”

                                 SARA
                        Uh-huh. You’re a real cowboy, you pussy. 
                        All I had to do was --

                                 AARON
                        Enjoy it. ‘Cause that’s the last time 
                        you’ll ever feel me up, “sis’.”

                                 SARA
                        Please. You loved it.

                                 AARON
                        Still. Thanks.

                                 SARA
                        No problem. Thanks for the ride.

           A kind beat... the first we’ve seen between these two. 

           Aaron puts the Taurus in REVERSE, pulls back into traffic when --

           WHAM! CRASH! They get SLAMMED into by an approaching car. Aaron 
           never even checked his mirrors.

           They’re spun around, but they’re fine. Sadly, the car is not. 

                                 AARON
                          (stunned)
                        Guess I forgot to signal.

           Slowly getting over the shock -- 

                                 SARA
                        There goes your license.

           Surprisingly, Aaron laughs. Sara laughs harder, the laughter 
           builds until they’re both laughing so hard, they’re crying.

                              SOPHOMORE YEAR

           EXT. OMAHA CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           A new Honda Civic pulls up. Sara and Aaron get out, but it’s 
           Sara who pops out the driver’s side. Aaron is her passenger.

           Sara is even prettier than last year, as she’s toned down the 
           make-up a smidge. Still trying, but less so. Aaron is beginning 
           to fill out too, and as always, he’s upset.

                                 AARON
                        You almost hit that old lady on Oakwood!

                                 SARA
                        Are you going to be like this all year?

                                 AARON
                        Not if you kill us first.

           Surprisingly, Aaron and Sara enter the front doors together. 

                                 SARA
                        35 is a suggestion.

                                 AARON
                        No, a “suggestion” is: “You might want to 
                        think about masturbating in lieu of 
                        screwing half the football team.” 35 is 
                        the legal speed limit.

           BJ catches up to them.

                        I was kidding.

                          (to Jayden)
                        You’re just doing that to get our 
                        attention. And it’s totally working.

                                 SARA
                        Like we care about getting your 
                        attention, shit-breath.

           BJ glares and pulls Aaron away, but not before sneaking in a 
           quick “breath test.” STAY WITH Jayden and Sara.

                        She walks around like she’s the subject

           FIRE ALARM sounding off. STUDENTS gleefully cheer and the 
           TEACHERS shush them as they file out.

           Sara and Aaron meet up coming from opposite classrooms.

                                 SARA
                        “Yay!” Fire drill just delayed the 
                        Shakespearean sonnet I forgot to 
                        memorize.

                        “Boo!” We’re stuck behind “Rasta-be 
                        Reggie” in the drill.

           He points to REGGIE ahead of them. That white kid we all knew 
           with greasy, disgusting, ankle-length dreadlocks.

                                 SARA
                        I think he mops the floor after school

           Sara sees the distraction as an opportunity.

                        C’mon! Pit stop.

           She quickly drags Aaron away into a --

           Pulls him to the ground beneath the door window, out of sight.

                                 AARON
                        Sara, I can’t get detent--

           They’re huddled close together. Intimately close. ON Aaron, 
           freaking as the sounds of the footsteps grow nearer. Sara 
           eyeballs him: “chill.”

           ABOVE THEIR HEADS, we see a FIREMAN appear in the window.

                                 FIREMAN
                          (checks the room)
                        Clear!

           The footsteps grow fainter as the firemen head down the hall. 
           Sara whips out two official looking “absence” passes. 

                                 AARON
                        Are those -- ?

           ON Aaron. This so isn’t him, but it so is Sara. And she’s just 
           made it very easy for him.

           EXT. OMAHA CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Sara lets out a yell as the Civic races out of the parking lot. 

                                 AARON (V.O.)
                        It’s time you saw the other side of 
                        Omaha.

                        What’s that? A tour of all the Applebees?

           MUSIC BLASTS FROM THE RADIO OVER:

           EXT. MALCOLM X BIRTH SITE - DAY

           Wearing backwards ball caps, Sara and Aaron stare at the sign 
           marking the birthplace of Malcolm X. Aaron taps his chest, 
           shoots a “black power” fist. 

                                 SARA
                        You’re whiter than milk.

           The pair stand in a kiosk that showcases the former president's 
           younger years. This time Sara taps her chest and shoots a 
           “power” fist. Aaron quickly pulls her arm down.

                                 AARON
                        Show some respect for --

                        Another dead guy. Can we please infuse 
                        some life into this ditch day?

           A greasy Mexican food restaurant in the old-fashioned 
           cobblestone marketplace. Sara holds up a “one more” finger and 
           Aaron motions for her to “bring it.”

           They shove whole jalapenos in their already overstuffed mouths. 
           They chew and chew, faces turning from red to purple to blue.

           She downs water straight from a pitcher of water as Aaron holds 
           up victory arms.

           Sara and Aaron are seven years old again as they play tag with

           INT. JOSLYN CASTLE - NIGHT

           Sara and Aaron evade a SECURITY GUARD in one of the display 
           bedrooms of antique furniture. 

           His flashlight misses them, and he heads off on his rounds.

           Sara comes out from behind a grandfather clock and lies right 
           down on the bed next to a sign: “DO NOT SIT ON FURNITURE.”

           She pats the bed for Aaron to join her and they stare out the 
           window at the peaceful, twinkling lights of Omaha.

                                 SARA
                        “Yay.” What a perfect day.

                                 AARON
                        “Boo.” I had to spend it with you.

           She playfully HITS him. He smiles at her. A beat longer than is 
           comfortable.

                        Enough already, Aar. You spend every free 
                        minute studying for a test that doesn’t 
                        actually test anything other than how 
                        well you can take the test. Don’t worry. 
                        You’re going to nail it.

                                 BJ
                        Just like that girl after hours at the DQ 
                        last month.

                                 SARA
                        Wait. Seriously?!

                          (without looking up)
                        Hardly. It was nothing.

                                 BJ
                        Hey, that’s not nothing.

                                 SARA
                        What’s not?

                                 AARON
                        It was just a 
                          (almost mumbles)
                        Handjob...
                          (normal voice)
                        and I found it pointless. Why should I 
                        let a girl do something for me that I can 
                        do better myself?

                                 SARA
                        What happened to “high school is too 
                        important to fuck around?”

                                 AARON
                        It was one handjob! Why am I getting the 
                        third degree here?

                                 SARA
                        Because getting jerked off in the Dairy 
                        Queen parking lot is a distinctly un-
                        Aaron thing to do. Admit it: I’m so good 
                        for you. It was my influence that got you 
                        those five seconds of pleasure.
                          (back to the game)
                        BOO-YAH! I’m going home. Beat yo’ boy’s 
                        ass for the third game in a row.

                          (throws his controller)
                        I can’t believe you invited that cunt 
                        over here! Argh!

           ON a stunned Aaron and Sara.

                                 BJ
                        What?

           Sara SLAMS her fist into BJ’s arm. He screams!

                                 SARA
                        We do NOT like it when you call us that.

                                 AARON
                          (to BJ)
                        Told ya.’

                                 SARA
                        I have to pee.

           She goes to the bathroom. Aaron turns the VOLUME way up.

                        What’s your problem?

                                 AARON
                          (whispers)
                        I hate it when she does that here. I can 
                        hear her.

                                 BJ
                        Would you rather she golden shower all 
                        over your Xbox?

                                 SARA (O.S.)
                          (from the bathroom)
                        Aar, can you get me some more toilet 
                        paper? I ran out.

           Aaron squirms. Rushes to hand her one from the linen closet.

                                 AARON
                          (to BJ)
                        The other day she asked for her phone. 
                        It’s just too weird.

                                 BJ
                          (realizes)
                        Oh my god. Could you be more obvious?

                                 AARON
                        Huh?
           Sara exits the bathroom. SLAPS Aaron a “secret” high five.

                                 AARON
                        Later, bitch.

                                 SARA
                          (off BJ’s look)
                        Yes, that you can call us.
                          (to Aaron)
                        See you in the morning. 
                          (to BJ)
                        Don’t think about erasing that high 
                        score. Beat by a girl, Beej. By a girl.

           As soon as she’s gone:

                                 BJ
                        You want to fuck her!

                                 AARON
                        I’m nauseous hearing you even suggest 
                        that. 

                                 BJ
                        The only people a straight guy doesn’t 
                        think pees, craps or farts are the girls 
                        he’s fantasizing about. 

                                 AARON
                        I don’t think of her that way. She’s like 
                        my sister.

                                 BJ
                        Sure. The slutty step-sister you 
                        fantasize about. The personality bites, 
                        but the body is --

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. OMAHA CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           ECU ON Sara’s TIGHT ASS walking down the hall in a miniskirt. 

           PULL BACK to reveal she’s accompanied by Jayden and the rest of 
           her sophomore fashionista FRIENDS. 

                                 JAYDEN
                        He lives in the basement? Do they lock 
                        him up at night?

                                 SARA
                        It’s more like his own personal bachelor 
                        pad. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARA (cont'd)
                        It was his dad’s ‘til his mom got all 
                        Midwestern wife-like and told him she 
                        wanted to actually see him in his free 
                        time. The place has Xbox. A pool table. 
                        His own entrance. It’s actually pretty 
                        cool.

           The prettiest of their fashionista friends, EMILY, smiles.

                                 EMILY
                        Sounds like fun.

                                 ANOREXIC FRIEND
                        If you’re twelve.

           They crack up as we --

           ZOOM around the corner to find Aaron and BJ

                                 BJ
                        Dude, you’ve gotta help me. I’m going to 
                        fail AmLit.

                                 AARON
                        I haven’t taken AmLit.

                                 BJ
                        Thousand bucks says you’ve already read 
                        The Great Gatsby.

           Aaron’s silence is the answer.

                                 BJ
                        Knew it! See you later.

           Follow Aaron as he ROUNDS the corner straight into Sara’s pack. 
           They both brighten up.

                                 SARA
                        Hey!

                                 AARON
                        Hi. Howzit?

                                 SARA
                        Fine. Howzit witchoo?

                                 AARON
                        Beej is driving me crazy. He’s coming 
                        over tonight so I can be his personal 
                        Cliffs’ Notes.

                                 SARA
                        Boring.
                                 AARON
                        Wanna come over and be my buffer?

                                 SARA
                        Your fluffer?

           All the GIRLS giggle. Aaron rolls his eyes.

                                 AARON
                        Seriously.

                                 SARA
                        Seriously. I’ll be there at 10.

           Aaron and the other girls head off. STAY with Sara and Jayden.

                                 JAYDEN
                        ‘Cause God forbid Saaron should be apart 
                        on a Friday night.
                          (off her look)
                        Your official celebrity nickname. Don’t 
                        think everyone hasn’t noticed how 
                        “Saaron” hang out together all the time.

                                 SARA
                        Does sound better than “Aara.”

                                 JAYDEN
                        So... do I finally get to see Aaron’s 
                        basement?

           INT. AARON’S BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

           As Jayden kicks BJ’s ass at GTA, Sara quizzes Aaron on his SAT 
           vocabulary flashcards.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Sucka!

                                 BJ
                        Just wait ‘til I get my gat back.

                                 SARA
                        Altruism.

                                 AARON
                        Selfless concern for others.

                                 SARA
                        Narcissism.

                                 AARON
                        A preoccupation with one’s personal 
                        importance. See also: Sara Simmons.
                                 JAYDEN
                        Is this seriously the best way you can 
                        think of spending a Friday night?

                                 BJ
                        I know something that makes everything 
                        more fun. 

           He pulls up a floor board and extracts a pocket bong and a bag 
           of weed.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Nice.

                                 AARON
                          (to BJ, angry)
                        You’ve been storing your shit here?

                                 BJ
                        You expect me to keep it at my place?

                                 SARA
                        Brilliant. Aaron’s parents would never 
                        worry about him doing drugs.

                                 BJ
                        Thanks, Captain Obvious.

                                 SARA
                        Shut up, Sergeant Shithead.

                                 AARON
                        Children, enough.

                                 SARA
                          (kidding)
                        C’mon Aaron, you’re not cool unless you 
                        do it...

           BJ dangles the bag in front of him. 

                                 AARON
                        I learned it from watching you, Beej.

                                 SARA
                        Trust us. It’ll be fun.

                                 BJ
                          (nods to Sara)
                        And it’ll make hanging out with her much 
                        more tolerable.

           Aaron considers as we go -- 
           CLOSE ON BJ lighting the bowl. His lips inside the tiny bong. 
           The smoke weaving its way up to his lungs.

           ON AARON. He reaches for it. They all grin the way people do the 
           first time they get a friend stoned.

           Aaron puts his lips to it. BJ starts to light it for him, but 
           Aaron stops him.

                                 AARON
                        You’ve been smoking in my basement since 
                        middle school and you think I don’t know 
                        how to do this?

           BJ hands over the lighter: “proceed.”

           Aaron does, but on his first inhale, he COUGHS. And keeps 
           coughing and coughing... the kind of cough that makes your face 
           turn red and your eyes tear as you heave big gulps of air.

           Everyone laughs as we --

                                                              FADE TO:

           AN HOUR LATER.

           An extremely smoky basement, and an all-too-sober Aaron. The 
           other three stare into space as Aaron fidgets.

                                 AARON
                          (sighs)
                        I don’t feel anything.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Do you ever really, like, feel anything? 
                        Like my face. I mean, unless I’m touching 
                        it, I’m not, like, feeling it.

                                 BJ
                          (pokes his face)
                        Oh wow. I never realized that before.

                                 SARA
                          (to Aaron)
                        You never get stoned on your first 
                        attempt. Just like girls never orgasm the 
                        first time they have sex.

                                 JAYDEN
                          (stoned alarmed)
                        We don’t?!
                                 SARA
                        One and the same sweetie. When foreign 
                        substances enter your body, you have to 
                        relax before you can truly enjoy them. 
                        And that doesn’t happen on round one.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Is there any food down here?

           Aaron opens the fridge in the mini-kitchen. 

                                 AARON
                        I have a Yoo-Hoo and half a Kit-Kat.

           All three of them SCRAMBLE for the food as Aaron dodges them.

                                 BJ
                          (triumphantly)
                        Got the Yoo-Hoo! 
                          (chugs)
                        Sweet nectar of the gods.

           Jayden and Sara split the remaining Kit-Kat.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Oh wow. This is the best chocolate bar, 
                        ever. EVER.

           Aaron just sits there, watching them.

                                 SARA
                        This is so not fun for you, huh?

                                 AARON
                        Not even a little.

                                 SARA
                        Got any soda cans?

                                                               CUT TO:

           A WALL CLOCK. It’s now 1:00 a.m.

           REVEAL a makeshift bong consisting of a soda can, a hollow Bic 
           pen, some foil and a plastic bag. 

                                 AARON
                        You make a bong like a NASA engineer, but 
                        you’re getting a ‘D’ in physics?

           All watch in amazement as Sara puts on the finishing touches and 
           lights her creation and inhales. Aaron follows and takes TWO 
           huge hits. Coughs.
                                 AARON
                        Nothing.

                                 SARA
                        Wait for it.

                                                               CUT TO:

           THE WALL CLOCK. It’s 1:30 a.m.

           Aaron still leans against the same wall. Stares into space.

           AARON’S POV: All three friends are peering at him. They look 
           distorted, faces melting, very Dali-esque. He hears their words 
           long after their mouths move.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Is he -- ?

                                 BJ
                        I think so.

                                 SARA
                        Yeah, he is.

                                 AARON
                        How long have I been like this?

                                 SARA
                        I’m not saying. It’ll freak you out. 

                                 AARON
                        Am I stoned?

                                 SARA
                        Only one way to tell.

                                 AARON
                        How?

                                 SARA
                        Get up and Moonwalk.

           BACK TO SCENE: Aaron does. Badly. But in his mind, he’s good.

                                 SARA
                        Yah. You’re definitely stoned.

                                 BJ
                        You know, Sara, when I met you, I really 
                        didn’t like you.

                                 SARA
                        Me neither.
                                 BJ
                        You didn’t like you?

                                 SARA
                        I love me. I didn’t like you.

                                 BJ
                        I still don’t like you. But I love that 
                        you just got Aaron high.

           Aaron bursts out laughing. Then Sara laughs. Then Jayden. And 
           BJ. Every time they think they’re done, it keeps going ‘til 
           they’re all laughing so hard they can’t stop. 

           EXT. TRACK MEET - DAY

           RUNNERS cross the finish line. Aaron’s far behind the main pack 
           as he finishes, but there’s a LONE RACER who comes in after him. 

           Sara CHEERS, has a water bottle waiting for him at the sideline.

                                 SARA
                          (joins him)
                        Penultimate. Next to last. From the 
                        Latin. Paena ultima. Almost last.
                          (proud)
                        But not!

           She holds up her hand for a high-five. Aaron smiles, hits it.

           SPIN AWAY from them and keep spinning as in --

           UBER-FAST-TIME-LAPSE, snow falls, then melts, trees blossom and 
           it’s spring again as we find --

           EXT. OMAHA CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Sara’s Civic speeding into the parking lot. The pair storm out.

                                 SARA
                        What’s wrong with the way I drive?

                                 AARON
                        Aside from how you stop, turn, park and 
                        change lanes? Nothing. 

           They run into BJ on their way in.

                                 BJ
                        And how’s Central’s favorite old married 
                        couple this morning?
           INT. OMAHA CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - SAME

                                 AARON/SARA
                        Fine.

           They part ways in a huff. BJ follows Aaron.

                                 BJ
                        I don’t think I tell you enough how great 
                        you look in --

           He pauses to see what Aaron is actually wearing.

                                 BJ
                        -- taupe?

                                 AARON
                        Whaddya need, Beej?

           BJ rips a flyer off the wall: 

             Prom is May 7th -- “Hollywood  Knights”-- Tickets on Sale Now! 

                                 AARON
                        Unless by some freak comic-book accident 
                        you get dunked in a vat of toxic waste, 
                        grow brains and skip a grade, you’re 
                        still a sophomore. Prom doesn’t exist for 
                        you. 

                                 BJ
                        Yet we’re still going.

           Aaron pushes past him. BJ catches up and they walk and talk.

                                 AARON
                        I’m not. Enjoy your Mission: Implausible. 
                        Alone. 

           BJ cuts Aaron off and punches him in the crotch (just hard 
           enough, the way guys “play” in a mos-def not homosexual way).

                                 AARON
                        The fuck?!

                                 BJ
                        Just verifying you have a pair. Don’t you 
                        get it? Prom is an alcohol and drug 
                        fueled orgy. Half of those who go hook-up 
                        with someone other than their date. We 
                        will be the Others. And I already have 
                        our ticket in.
           He steers Aaron around the corner where two ALL-AMERICAN GIRLS 
           are leaning against lockers and talking. 

                                 BJ
                        Ellie and Dannie. Straight-A students, 
                        volunteers at the Sunset Living 
                        retirement home, and, oh yeah, co-
                        captains of the girls’ field hockey team. 

                                 AARON
                        Beej...
                          (tries to phrase it)
                        I don’t think Ellie and Dannie want to go 
                        with us. Rumor is they’re not really 
                        interested in --

                                 BJ
                        Cock? That’s the point. But they’re very 
                        interested in prom.

           Dannie pulls a prom magazine from her backpack to show Ellie.

                                 BJ
                        Unfortunately, this is Omaha. They want 
                        to go to prom together, but since they’re 
                        not exactly “out” that’s gonna be a 
                        problem. They need dates who will make 
                        their parents happy, but won’t try to 
                        sleep with them. 

           He PUSHES Aaron in the direction of the girls.

                                 BJ
                        And that’s where we come in.

           Aaron and Sara whisper in their seats.

                                 SARA
                        I can’t believe you’re going to prom and 
                        I’m not. I’ve been working two seniors 
                        and three juniors, and nothing. Do I have 
                        to put out more or something?

                                 AARON
                        You ever think maybe the amount you put 
                        out could be the problem?

                                 HISTORY TEACHER
                        Open your books to chapter 27, let’s take 
                        a look at the map of secession.
           Students open their books. The TEACHER turns on the OVERHEAD, 
           and a mix of “AWWWS” and LAUGHS quickly fill the room.

           CLOSE ON the overhead. There’s no Civil War map, but a message:

                    HAVE A DATE FOR PROM YET, SARA? -- ROBBY

           Sara lights up as the student in the seat in front of her, ROBBY 
           BENTON, spins around with prom tickets in hand.

                                 ROBBY BENTION
                        What do you say?

           Sara SNATCHES the tickets, more interested in prom than in him.

                                 SARA
                        Hell yes!

           BJ pulls up in his dad’s Cadillic STS. He and Aaron hop out, 
           looking snazzy in tuxedos with nifty tails.

                                 AARON
                        Are you sure your dad’s not gonna find 
                        out that we borrowed his car?

                                 BJ
                        Yes. ‘Sides, there was no way I was 
                        renting a limo for two chicks who won’t 
                        blow me.

                                 AARON
                        I know. I wasn’t even sure about the 
                        corsage. 

                                 BJ
                        Eh. Makes it look real.

           They KNOCK on the front door.

                        I still don’t get why they don’t just 
                        tell their --

           Suddenly, the door is THROWN open by Dannie’s ENORMOUS FATHER, 
           still wearing his orange hunting gear (rifle around his 
           shoulder) from earlier that day. 

           Dannie and Ellie, looking gorgeous and ready to go, stand 
           nervously behind his hulking frame.
                                 BJ

           Another flashing SIGN BOARD welcomes the “Omaha Central High 
           School Prom.”

           A never-ending HUMMER LIMO pulls into the frame.

           INT. HUMMER LIMO - SAME

           Pounding music. Sara, Robby Benton, Jayden and her PARTY GUY 
           date pound shots, though Sara sneakily pours hers out into the 
           ice bucket. Jayden catches her.

                                 SARA
                          (off Jayden’s look)
                        I’m not looking to repeat last year’s 
                        performance.

                        More bang for the buck.

           They each take a shot of vodka, then gin, then rum... vigorously 
           shake their heads, mixing the drink in their mouths. These guys 
           are already bombed, and Sara and Jayden are not happy.

                        I almost forgot, I got you this.

                        You saw the cheapest, most common flower. 
                        And thought of me.

           They all pile out of the limo.

           Robby Benton drunkenly drools all over Sara.

                                 ROBBY BENTON
                        You look fucking hot.
           They go inside. BJ’s Cadillac pulls into frame. The foursome 
           hops out. BJ flips the keys to the valet.

                                 DANNIE
                        Thanks, BJ.

                        We really can’t express how much we 
                        appreciate this.

                                 BJ
                        I can think of one way to express it.

                        We’re not making out in front you.

           BJ’s head falls, but Dannie links her arm around his, then her 
           other around Ellie, who links her free arm around Aaron’s, as 
           they head inside --

           The “Hollywood Knights” Prom. 1920s Hollywood glam theme. The 
           girls wear slinky gowns and flapper outfits. The guys wear 
           tuxedoes, some white, some black, some even with top hats.

           Everyone is having a great time on the dance floor, until we 
           zoom in on Sara and Jayden and their dates, who apparently need 
           an additional buzz to get into it.

           Party Guy pulls two BLUE DIAMOND PILLS from his pocket, hands 
           one off to Robby Benton.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Like your horny asses need pharmaceutical 
                        help.

                        But when you mix them with these --

           He reveals two round WHITE PILLS with clover designs. Two nearby 
           ‘X’-ETTES eye them, hungrily.

           Party Guy and Robby Benton pop their cocktail.

                                 PARTY GUY
                        Mmm. Sextasy...

           He goes in for a lustful kiss, but Jayden doesn’t look into it.

                        Mommy always said if you bring something 
                        to class, bring enough to share with 
                        everyone.
           Party Guy smiles and slips them a couple of pills. He pulls 
           Jayden close and grins up on her from behind.

           ON Jayden feeling something hard in her ass.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Ohmygod, stop. It’s gonna take six hours

           She and ‘X’-ETTE #2 attack Party Guy together. Robby Benton 
           stares on with envy.

                        Please, just go.

           And he jumps into the melee, where the foursome pretty much has 
           sex right on the dance floor. Sara and Jayden sneak off and 
           watch alongside --

                                 BJ
                        I usually have to PayPal to see this!

                        If this is Omaha I can’t even imagine 
                        what you were doing back in New York.

                        Whatever. The language of teenage 
                        rebellion is universal.
                          (pulls Jayden)
                        We’re hitting the bathroom. Time to break 
                        the seal.

           As they head off, Mad Max passes by with arms around the tiny 
           waists of two SENIOR BEAUTIES.

                                 MAD MAX
                        Wassup, boys?

                        No, seriously! It was the biggest one 
                        I’ve seen so far.

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           The sounds of the prom can be heard outside the door. Two GIRLS 
           “powder their noses” in a bathroom stall, and a half dozen re-
           apply their actual make-up in front of a mirror.

                                 JAYDEN
                          (puts on lipstick)
                        How many have you seen?

           Sara tries to count in her head.

                                 SARA
                        I keep losing count.

           They leave and head --

           INT. DOWNTOWN OMAHA SHERATON HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           -- back in the prom. They find Aaron and BJ.

                                 AARON
                        Wanna go? This sucks.

                                 SARA
                        Quick, take some Benadryl.

                                 AARON
                        Why?

                                 SARA
                        Your allergy to fun is breaking out.

                                 BJ
                          (to Sara)
                        You’re hysterical. Really.

                                 JAYDEN
                        I gotta know, Sar. How big was it?

           Sara closes one eye and sets her index fingers apart about a 
           foot, then three-quarters of a foot, then back to a foot.

                                 SARA
                        -ish.

                        You would be jealous of Big Ben-ton.

                                 AARON
                        Every guy’s jealous of the rumor, but 
                        there’s no way Robby Benton passes the 
                        Pringles test.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Uh...

                                 BJ
                        If the tip of your cock touches the 
                        bottom of the can, it’s a foot-long.

                                 SARA
                        And you know this from personal 
                        experience?

                                 BJ
                        I don’t even wish. Guy, girl, no matter 
                        which hole it goes in, cock that big has 
                        gotta hurt.

                                 BJ
                        Exactly six inches. 

                                 SARA
                        How many Pringles is that?

                        And you?

                                 AARON
                        This is getting weird.

                                 BJ
                        He’s six and one-quarter inches.

                                 AARON
                        And now it’s officially weird.

                                 SARA
                        Wow, that’s... not bad.

                                 BJ
                        Not bad?! It’s a half-inch above average.
                                 JAYDEN
                        And you know this because...?

                                 JAYDEN
                        No, I mean, did you two break out rulers 
                        and measure each other’s swords?

                                 BJ
                        Neeaaooooo, but guys all measure and 
                        share, just like you girls share about 
                        your areolas.

                        Kind of puffy. And I’m not ashamed.

                                 AARON
                        Nope. Nothing uncomfortable about this.

                                 BJ
                        Why not? We’re all friends.

                        -- that you choked on.

           Sara’s mouth opens, but she has nothing left to say.

                                 SARA
                          (looks around)
                        You’re right, Aar. This blows.

           But then a new SONG comes on, the same song they heard in 
           Aaron’s car during their first ride to school.

                                 SARA
                        Oh, but I love this song!

                                 AARON
                        You hate this song.

                        finally grew on me.

                                 BJ
                        I think it sucks. 

                                 JAYDEN
                        Seriously. Overplayed and sucks.

                        But does it suck as much as say... 
                        MySpace?

           Jayden’s jaw drops.

                                 BJ
                        Why? Why do all you people love --

           But Sara’s not there. She’s rockin’ out on the dance floor with 
           Aaron, keeping up as best he can with his white-man’s-overbite. 

           INT. DOWNTOWN OMAHA SHERATON - LATER

           Hot and sweaty, Sara and Aaron take a break to get some punch.

                        I wonder where --

           Aaron’s eyes open WIDE. He grabs Sara and points.

                        ... suck? Maybe.

           BACK WITH SARA AND AARON:

                                 SARA
                        Saw that coming. 

                                 AARON

           INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - NIGHT

           Sara and Aaron jump in the back seat. A quiet beat.

                        We keep ending up alone together at these

           A sweltering Indian Summer day. 

           INT. DAIRY QUEEN - DAY

           Aaron mans the drive-thru window, glumly taking orders. His body 
           filled out over the summer and he has a surprisingly full 
           goatee.

                        Which do you think Jayden would like to 
                        lick most? My dick dipped in chocolate, 
                        caramel or strawberry?  

                                 AARON

           He watches BJ test the weight of the prep counter to see just 
           how he could angle his member into the cone dip bins.
                                 AARON (INTO MIC)
                        -- BJ’s freaking me out more than usual.

                                 SARA (OVER HEADSET)
                        Bring me something sweet first. I’m on 
                        the rag and I need sugar.

                                 AARON (INTO MIC)
                        TMI.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. RANDOM HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT 

           The first party of the new school year, but STUDENTS drink as if 
           it were their last. Ever.

           BJ pounds a beer on the porch. 

                                 JAYDEN
                        Would you slow down? If you get whisky 
                        dick --

                                 BJ
                          (pulls her close)
                        -- then I’ll be able to go at least two 
                        hours without a break. 

                                 JAYDEN
                        Bring it.

           They tongue dance. Sara spies the arriving Aaron and -- 

                                 SARA
                          (latches onto him)
                        Thank God you’re here.

                                 BJ
                        Glad to see you finally made it. I’m five 
                        beers in. Time to catch up.

                                 AARON
                        You know it only takes one to get me 
                        drunk, then I’m outtie. 

                                 SARA
                        I’ll grab us some.

           Sara and Jayden head over to the keg. BJ stares down Aaron.

                                 BJ
                        How ‘bout you stuff one mouth with your 
                        schlong and then I’ll let you leave.
                                 AARON
                        You’re never too young for therapy, Beej. 
                        Jayden’s taking care of you. Why do you 
                        care if I get laid?

                                 BJ
                        Because the grass is always greener. I’m 
                        coupled-off with Jayden, and even though 
                        she did the freakiest thing with some 
                        Legos and a jar of olives last night, I 
                        have to live out the remainder of my non-
                        Jayden fantasies through you. 

           Aaron’s eye catches Sara at the keg, heavily flirting with two 
           HIPSTER STUDS. She throws him a wave. 

                                 AARON
                        Fine. Be my wingman.

                                 BJ
                        I’m your grenade jumper.

           A SERIES OF SHOTS SET TO SMOOTH OPERATOR TYPE MUSIC:

           -- BJ distracts the homely FRIEND as Aaron chats up a SEVEN. 
           Aaron and Seven CLINK bottles and CHUG, but Aaron’s bottle suds 
           up and overflows, so he tries to catch it in his mouth. Denied.

           -- BJ points out another, but Aaron’s ready to retreat. BJ slaps 
           another cup of liquid courage into his hand, makes him drink.

           -- Aaron chats up a VARIETY OF GIRLS. With each new girl, a new 
           drink in hand. Sara takes notice of him making the rounds.

           -- A drunk Aaron sits before a SKANKY DRUNK CHICK, who gives him 
           a public lap dance. She quickly uses up the few sexy moves she 
           has in favor of drunken, embarrassing ones.

           -- Sara watches, decides to intervene. She cuts across the room 
           and DRAGS a familiar girl, Emily, away from her conversation.

                                 SARA
                          (pulls Aaron away)
                        Aaron, you’ve met Emily...

                                 AARON
                        Yeah. We had bio together last year.

           Aaron smiles at Emily, who returns it.

                                 SARA
                        You two should get to know each other.
                          (whispers to Emily, leaving)
                        Don’t be gentle with him.
           INT. CHILD’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Pink and frilly kiddie bed, currently occupied by Aaron and 
           Emily, heavily making out. Muffled MUSIC tells us we’re still at 
           the party.

           Aaron FUMBLES with Emily’s bra. Emily, charmed by the effort, 
           reaches around and POPS it open herself, revealing small-but-
           perfect B-cup boobies.

           Emily unbuttons Aaron’s pants, shimmies on top of him. Suddenly, 
           Aaron has a freak-out moment, and slips out from under her.

                                 AARON
                        Whoa. Uh... sorry... I just... wow. This 
                        is embarrassing.

                                 EMILY
                        Are you a virgin?

                                 AARON
                          (beat)
                        Yeah.

                                 EMILY
                        Me too.

           They share a smile.

                                 AARON
                        I really, I mean really want to do this. 
                        And I’m sure you’re going to leave this 
                        room and tell all your friends how not a 
                        man I am, but I was kind of hoping my 
                        first time would be --

                                 EMILY
                        Special?

                                 AARON
                        Yeah... I guess. 
                          (beat)
                        God it just sounds so fucking lame --

                                 EMILY
                        It’s not.

                                 AARON
                        -- to want more than a drunken... thing.

           She brightens. Looks at him lovingly: “maybe he does want more.” 

                                 EMILY
                        Let’s wait.
                                 AARON
                        But in the meantime we could...

           She jumps back on top of him and they make-out.

           INT. OMAHA CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Aaron and BJ walk and talk during passing period.

                                 AARON
                        -- and then we hooked-up.

                                 BJ
                        Awesome! You finally lost it!

                                 AARON
                        What?

                                 BJ
                        You just said you hooked-up.

                                 AARON
                        We did. 

                                 BJ
                        So you fucked her.

                                 AARON
                          (confused)
                        Is that what “hooked-up” means now?

                                 BJ
                        Since like five years ago.

                                 AARON
                        Are bases still the same?

                                 BJ
                        Yes.

                                 AARON
                        In that case, let me try this again. 
                        Pretty sure we got to second, then we 
                        passed out together.

                                 BJ
                        Lame. You gonna hook-up again?

                                 AARON
                        You mean, for the first time?

                                 BJ
                        Whatever.
                                 AARON
                        I dunno --

           Suddenly, Emily appears, playfully takes Aaron’s arm in hers.

                                 EMILY
                        What’s my boyfriend talking about?

           Without catching Emily’s eye, BJ mouths “Boyfriend?” Aaron 
           shrugs: “I dunno.”

                                 AARON
                        Uhhh, nothing.

                                 EMILY
                        You wanna hang out after school?

                                 AARON
                        Sure?

                                 EMILY
                        Great. I’ll meet you out front.

           She gives him a quick KISS before dashing off. BJ SLAPS his boy 
           on the back.

                                 BJ
                        Seriously? And you’re still --

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

                                 SARA
                        -- a virgin? Please. Trey Hartly told me 
                        there was no friction there.

           Sara, Emily, Jayden and the fashionistas apply make-up and dry 
           off in a steamy locker room set built for teen movies. Tiny 
           towels? Check. Underwear? Check. Random naked girls passing back 
           and forth in the b.g. Check.

                                 JAYDEN
                        So?

                                 SARA
                        So if you’re a virgin you’re gonna be 
                        tighter than Aaron’s asshole.
                          (”whoops,” to Emily)
                        No offense.

                                 ANOREXIC FRIEND
                        That’s not true. It didn’t even hurt the 
                        first time Justin and I did it.
                                 SARA
                        That’s because you’re on the equestrian 
                        team. Everyone knows that.

                                 EMILY
                        So it does or doesn’t hurt?

                                 SARA
                        Wait. Tell me you’re not a virgin, too.

                                 EMILY
                        Well...

                                 SARA
                        Exactly how far have you gone?

                                 EMILY
                        In bases?

                                 SARA
                        If that’s as much detail as you can give, 
                        sure.

                                 EMILY
                        Second?

                                 SARA
                        WHAT?!

                                 JAYDEN
                        Sar, play nice.

                                 SARA
                        I am. Emily, why didn’t you come to me 
                        sooner?

                                 EMILY
                        I don’t know. How hard can third base be?

                                 SARA
                        Pay attention. This is your most 
                        important class of the day.

           Sara rifles through her gym bag and finds the perfect tool:

           CLOSE ON a blow pop. She unwraps it.

                                 SARA
                        Okay. Once he’s hard...

           Jayden and Emily giggle. 
                                 SARA
                          (stern)
                        Enough!

           They shut up. Sara places her tongue on the pop.

                                 SARA
                        You’re going to focus on the tip. That’s 
                        where most of his sensation is. You’ll 
                        take your dominant hand... you’re a 
                        lefty, right? I mean, correct?

           Emily, fascinated by this display, nods “yes.”

                                 SARA
                        Okay, so with your left hand, you stroke.  
                        With your tongue, you’re going to flick 
                        the tip, just like this.

           Sara demonstrates. The ENTIRE LOCKER ROOM is beginning to notice 
           and crowds around for the lesson.

                                 SARA
                        Then you’re going to lick around it. Like 
                        this.

           Some of the girls “ooh” and nod agreement.

                                 SARA
                        The deep throat is something you want to 
                        save for last. No teeth, extra saliva. 
                        When he’s good and hot, and you’ll know

                        They like that. If you really feel the 
                        need to spit, do it somewhere privately 
                        and quickly like the bathroom. And 
                        seriously? Try not to get it on anything. 
                        It stains.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           The distinctive CLICK of a slide projector. We’ll never see the 
           slides, only the increasingly disgusted looks on the faces of 
           the STUDENTS.

           Aaron, BJ, Jayden and Sara sit together.

                                 HEALTH TEACHER 
                        This slide is of a man with untreated 
                        genital herpes on the head of his penis.

           ON Sara, filing her nails. This totally doesn’t freak her out. 

                                 HEALTH TEACHER
                        If you hear nothing else, hear this: 
                        Statistically, while they only represent 
                        25% of the ever-sexually active 
                        population, 15-to-24-year olds acquire 
                        nearly one-half of all new STDs. 

           BJ, Aaron and Jayden shoot Sara a look.

                                 SARA
                        I don’t have a disease, assholes.

           CLICK.

                                 HEALTH TEACHER 
                        This is a woman whose syphilis, a curable 
                        STD, is mimicking genital herpes.

           ON Jayden and BJ. Horrified. They hold hands. 

                                 HEALTH TEACHER
                        Another statistic: 3% of teens ages 15 to 
                        19 have HIV. Let me break that down for 
                        you: statistically, one person in this 
                        room has HIV, an incurable STD.
                                 JAYDEN
                          (to herself)
                        Monogamy is totally underrated.

           CLICK.

                                 HEALTH TEACHER 
                        And this is a man with simultaneous 
                        chlamydia, syphilis, herpes and genital 
                        warts.

           The audience GASPS. Some might throw up. 

                                 HEALTH TEACHER
                        Almost looks like a second face growing 
                        there, no?

           Aaron goes ghostly white.

           CLICK. The Health Teacher checks his notes, perplexed. 

                                 HEALTH TEACHER
                        This is... well it’s not in my notes, but 
                        it seems to be what a perfectly healthy 
                        penis should look like.

                                 MAD MAX
                        Perfectly healthy? That sucker’s seven 
                        inches flaccid!

                                 HEALTH TEACHER
                          (flustered)
                        It’s hard to measure from a photo --

           He CLICKS the slide trigger over and over, but apparently the 
           SAME PICTURE keeps replacing itself. The students go hysterical.

                                 MAD MAX
                        The hell it is. I took that picture last 
                        week. You need me to prove it?

           He stands, ready to unzip and drop his drawers.

                                 HEALTH TEACHER
                        NO!... proof is needed Mr. Sladusky.

                                 SARA
                          (re: the photo)
                        Bet that passes the Pringles test.

                                                               CUT TO:
           THE END OF CLASS

           Scared students file out the room. 

                                 HEALTH TEACHER
                        I suggest each of you take some of these.   
                        It’s not just your health, it’s the 
                        health of your partner.

                                 BJ
                        Don’t have to ask me twice.

           He grabs an ARMFUL of CONDOMS from a bowl, and shoves a strip of 
           them into Aaron’s jeans’ pocket.

           INT. AARON’S BASEMENT - LATER THAT DAY 

           Back from school, Aaron flops down on his bed. He pulls the 
           condoms from his pocket; stares at them for several beats. He 
           rips one free, studies the back. 

                                 AARON
                          (reads)
                        1) Use only latex condoms. Lambskin 
                        provides no protection from STDs.
                        2) Use a new condom before foreplay and 
                        before the penis gets near any body 
                        opening.

           Beat. He’s got that “curiosity killed the cat” look in his eyes. 
           CAMERA stays at chest level.

           He looks around, as if someone might be watching. It’s his room, 
           so of course no one is. 

           The ZIP of him undoing his pants. The SHUFFLE of him pulling 
           them down. 

                                 AARON    
                        3) Tear the package carefully. Never bite 
                        or use scissors. 

           He EVER-SO-SLOWLY rips it and GENTLY pulls out the condom, 
           holding it as if it might disintegrate at any moment.

           With the other hand, he pieces the wrapper back together to 
           continue reading.

                                 AARON
                        4) If you are not circumcised, pull back 
                        the foreskin. 5) Put on a condom when the 
                        penis is erect. 
           He checks below, not quite there. He CLOSES his eyes and we see 
           his body ever so slightly shake for several beats, then --

                                 AARON
                        5) Squeeze the tip gently so no air is 
                        trapped inside.
                          (beat)
                        The tip of my - ?... oh. The condom.
                          (reads)
                        Be sure the rolled up ring is on the 
                        outside.

           He complies. Stares at what it looks like. 

                                 AARON
                        6) After ejaculation, hold the condom 
                        close to the base of the penis and 
                        carefully withdraw.
                        7) Immediately throw away used condoms.

           A beat. He closes his eyes, lays back, and starts pumping away.

                                 AARON (PRE-LAP)
                        Crescendo!

                        I did, and she told me she’s never even

                        That doesn’t mean anything.

           Sara starts to gather her books. Can’t find her notes.

                                 SARA

                        Hunt Reynolds hasn’t checked me out once.

           Across the room we spot hunky HUNT REYNOLDS (17) in a varsity 
           jacket shotgunning beers with his TEAMMATES.

           BJ and Jayden follow several STUDENTS down, but many nervous 
           others stand around. Hunt’s in. Sara winks at him as he heads 
           downstairs.

                                 SARA
                        Last call, last call. Any other takers?

                                 EMILY
                          (grabs Aaron’s hand)
                        Come on, it’ll be fun.

                                 AARON
                        I don’t know.

                                 SARA
                          (spots them)
                        You two. Get down there.

                                 AARON
                        Okay, gimme a sec.

           Emily follows Sara downstairs. Aaron snags a BOTTLE OF TEQUILA 
           and brings it into the --

           INT. PARTY BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           A dozen or so daring partiers are seated in a giant circle. Sara 
           grandly steps out into the middle, holds up an empty BOTTLE.
                                 BJ
                          (jeers)
                        Sixth grade!

           Sara lays the bottle on the ground and marches over to BJ. 
           Plucks the ball cap from his head. She opens a closed fist to 
           reveal FIVE COLORED HAIR BANDS.

                                 SARA
                        Yellow is for french kissing. Green is 
                        for over the shirt. Blue is for under the 
                        shirt, hands or mouth, your choice. 
                        Purple is oral, please be willing to give 
                        and receive, and black? All. The. Way. If 
                        you’re not game, I’m giving you five, 
                        four, three, two --

           A couple of LAST MINUTE CHICKENS scramble for the stairs. Aaron 
           SWIGS THREE SHOTS from the bottle of tequila he snagged.

                                 SARA
                        -- one. Let’s begin.

           She spins the bottle. After it stops:

                                 AARON
                        Spin again.

                                 EMILY (O.S.)
                        Why?

           REVEAL the bottle has landed on her. Every pair of male eyes 
           opens WIDE. BJ elbows Aaron -- “shut up.” 

                                 BJ
                        Why oh why didn’t it land on Jayden?

           Emily draws green. She and Sara lean in closer, closer, 
           closer...

           And feel each other up. Emily’s are significantly smaller than 
           Sara’s.

                                 SARA
                        A perfect handful.

           A series of quick cuts... the bottle spinning, hands drawing 
           colored bands, Aaron takes another shot, lips kissing, hands 
           groping. A familiar Ten spins and gets Mad Max...

           Max pulls green, brings her to the middle of the circle and 
           TWEAKS her nipple. Everyone laughs when she TWEAKS his back.
                                 MAD MAX 
                        OW!

           Hunt spins. Lands on Sara. 

                                 SARA
                        I am so popular tonight.

           Sara pulls the purple band. The pair grins devilishly. They head 
           to the closet.

           PUSH IN on Aaron, eyes glued to the closet door as we -- 

                                                        TIME LAPSE TO:

           Aaron, snapping out of it as Sara and Hunt emerge. The crowd 
           cheers for them.

                                 MAD MAX
                        Who did who?

           Sara makes a big show of licking her lips.

           Aaron is nauseous. It could be at what Sara just did, or it 
           could be the tequila hitting. His stomach emits a loud RUMBLE.

                                 SARA
                        My turn.

           The bottle goes round and round until it stops at --

           AARON. He pales. Sara holds out the hat to him as he pulls 
           the... 

           YELLOW BAND. Sara smiles, leans over and

           KISSES AARON. Soft, slow, sweet.

           It takes Aaron a second to collect himself after that. He spins 
           and once again it lands back on Emily. She reaches into the hat 
           and draws...

           BLACK.

                                 VARIOUS
                        Woo-hoo! There we go! Yah-baby!

           ON Aaron: paling. ON Emily: giddy. ON Sara: a slight flinch.

           Emily takes Aaron by the hand. 

                                 BJ
                        Play safe, buddy.
           He hands over a condom and Aaron is pulled into --

           INT. BASEMENT CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           A crowded space. The dim light of a low-watt bulb.

                                 EMILY
                        You ready for this?

           Aaron’s silent.

                                 AARON
                        I... guess so.

                                 EMILY
                        Then come here.

           She pulls him close, hand diving down his pants. And that’s when 
           it HITS him.

           ON Aaron: his face turns three different colors and then --

           INT. PARTY BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A SCREAMING Emily races out the closet, arms across a vomit-
           splattered chest.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Was that -- ?

                                 BJ
                        If it was, that’s the world’s biggest 
                        load ever.

           INT. AARON’S BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT

           BJ and Sara carry the ill Aaron into his room. They drop him on 
           the bed and put a small plastic trash can next to him.

                                 BJ
                        You can go now. I don’t need to be 
                        spending any more time with you than 
                        necessary.

                                 SARA
                        What happened to him in there?

                                 BJ
                        Apparently alcohol and the stress of semi-
                        publicly losing it in a basement closet 
                        don’t mix. 

                                 SARA
                        What? They’ve had sex before.
                                 BJ
                        Maybe with Teddy for practice.

           ANGLE on Teddy (Aaron’s bear) in the corner. He looks worn.

                                 SARA
                        You go. I’ll stay and keep an eye on him. 
                        I kind of owe him. 
                          (off BJ’s look)
                        Freshman prom... forget it.

                                 BJ
                        Fine. The beer shits are comin’ and I 
                        really prefer my own bathroom.

                                 SARA
                        Things I don’t need to imagine. Ever.

           BJ leaves. At that moment, Aaron GRABS the plastic trash can and 
           HURLS into it. Sara sits next to him on the bed patting his 
           back. A good friend. 

           When he stops, he lies down in the fetal position. He’s unaware 
           that Sara is curled up beside him, watching him sleep.

           INT. AARON’S BASEMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

           A pale, hungover Aaron wakes to the SLAM of the back door. 
           Sara’s just returned (in last night’s clothes) with a bag of --

                                 SARA
                        Bacon, egg and cheese. Coffee. Hash 
                        browns. Best McHangover cure ever.

                                 AARON
                        You’re a McAngel.

           He ravenously grabs the bag. She joins him on the bed.

           INT. AARON’S BASEMENT - LATER

           McD’s wrappers are strewn all over. Aaron and Sara are curled up 
           on the bed watching a re-run of When Harry Met Sally. 

                                 SARA
                        I hate watching this on TBS. They always 
                        take out the orgasm scene in the deli.

                                 AARON
                        Plus it takes like four hours to watch a 
                        two-hour movie.

                                 SARA
                        Do you think it’s true?
                                 AARON
                        What?

                                 SARA
                        That guys and girls really can’t be 
                        friends?

                                 AARON
                        ‘Course not. We’re friends. Right?

                                 SARA
                        Yeah.

           She CLICKS off the television and pointedly asks him:

                                 SARA
                        You’re still a virgin, huh? 

           Aaron nearly chokes on a hash brown.

                                 AARON
                        Yeah.

                                 SARA
                        Why’d you let me think you weren’t?

                                 AARON
                        Technically, I didn’t say I wasn’t.

                                 SARA
                        But you didn’t correct me either.

                                 AARON
                        Look, it’s not because you’re... you. 

                                 SARA
                        Are you sure? Sex is my default topic.

                                 AARON
                        Oh, I know. And BJ and Jayden are going 
                        at it like chipmunks on Viagra. 

                                 SARA
                          (beat)
                        Are you gay?

                                 AARON
                        No! 
                          (beat, calmer)
                        I mean, you know I’m not.

                                 SARA
                        Are you, like, asexual? Do you even want 
                        to have sex?
                                 AARON
                        Of course. Eventually. 

                                 SARA
                        Why! Especially when Emily’s dying to 
                        lose it to you.

                                 AARON
                        Given what I did to her last night, 
                        that’s not happening any time soon. It’s 
                        fine. I’ve still got a T1 line, a giant 
                        jar of Vaseline and a krillion pages of 
                        porn waiting to be discovered.

                                 SARA
                        See? There’s the problem.

                                 AARON
                          (blows his top)
                        No! The problem is HIV, STDs, pregnancy. 
                        Do I really need cauliflower growing on 
                        my balls with a baby due on prom night? 
                        Call me crazy, but I’d rather wait and 
                        meet a girl who’s actually worth my time.

                                 SARA
                        Do you mean “love?” ‘Cause that ain’t 
                        gonna happen in high school.

                                 AARON
                        Agreed.

                                 SARA
                        So?

                                 AARON
                        So... maybe I’ll find her in college.

           Sara’s head falls.

                                 SARA
                        Bad idea. Because you will suck the first 
                        time. Everyone does. So get past the 
                        virgin block and practice the sex, ‘cause 
                        when it’s finally time to do it with the 
                        one you think you --
                          (can barely say it)
                        -- “love,” she’s gonna wanna do it with a 
                        pro. If you’re lucky, she’ll be one too, 
                        and that’s how you get fireworks. 

           Aaron rubs his head.
                                 AARON
                        I know I must be hung over when your 
                        theories start to make sense.

           Sara holds his hand. Stares deep into his eyes.

                                 SARA
                        I can help you make it up to Emily...

           Aaron’s still skeptical.

                                 SARA
                        You start by planning the perfect 
                        evening. 

           She slides closer to him and seductively begins to set the tone.

                                 SARA
                        You’ll bring her back here. Light 
                        candles. Put on some music. 

           She turns on the TV to the music channels, finds a good tune.

                                 SARA
                          (pulls Aaron to his feet)
                        You’ll hold her, maybe dance. Playfully. 
                          (she dances with him)
                        Then you’ll kiss her soft mouth, and lay 
                        little kisses down her neck. You’ll 
                        unbutton her blouse and kiss down her 
                        body. You’ll nibble on her right breast. 
                        Then her left. Making her tiny nipples 
                        hard. Slowly make your way to the bed. 
                        Lie her down. She’ll kiss you. Roughly. 
                        You’ll take off your shirt. Your pants. 
                        You’ll help her with hers. She’s good and 
                        wet. And then --

                                 AARON
                          (quickly steps away)
                        I get it. Thank you. My stomach’s not 
                        right all of a sudden. I think you’d 
                        better go.

                                 SARA
                        You sure? I could run out and get you 
                        Pepto. 

                                 AARON
                        Really. I’m fine.

           Sara leans in and pulls him into a good-bye hug.

           CLOSE ON Sara. What is that? Down. There.
           CLOSE ON Aaron. Mortified.

           They break apart. Aaron quickly sits on the bed, covers up.

                                 AARON
                        It’s not because of you. It’s because we 
                        were talking about sex. That’s all. Okay? 
                        Don’t feel weird about it.

                                 SARA
                        I won’t. 
                          (totally weirded out)
                        See ya’ later.

           And she leaves. Aaron collapses back on the bed, complete with 
           PUP TENT he’s pitched in his pants.

           INT. OMAHA CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Aaron finishes breaking up with Emily.

                                 EMILY
                        Wait. You puked on me.

                                 AARON
                        I’m sorry --

                                 EMILY
                        And now you’re breaking up with me right 
                        before prom?

                                 AARON
                        I know the timing’s not great.

           Emily BURSTS INTO TEARS and runs off. Aaron feels like an ass.

           A happy-feet BJ runs up and throws an arm around Aaron.

                                 AARON
                        If you start singing “It’s the Most 
                        Wonderful Time of the Year” I will stab 
                        your left nut.

           BJ points to a flyer behind him. 

                                 BJ
                        Our first prom, buddy! 

                                 AARON
                        I went the last two years.

                                 BJ
                        But those weren’t our proms. We have 
                        ownership over this one. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BJ (cont'd)
                        And now that you’re single again, the 
                        entire female population of Central will 
                        do all sorts of dirty, naughty deeds to 
                        be your plus one. 

                                 AARON
                        I don’t need dirty deeds. Sara and I 
                        still have our “thing.”

                                 BJ
                        Your cliche go-as-friends-if-we’re-both-
                        single thing? I think there’s a cock in 
                        your “thing.”

                                 AARON
                        That’s “kink.”

                                 BJ
                        No. Cock. As in Hunt. He asked her 
                        yesterday.

           Across the hall, Hunt has an arm around Sara, who laughs at what 
           is no doubt a bad joke. 

           ON Aaron. Definitely trying not to look bummed.

           INT. AARON’S BASEMENT - DAY

           BJ and Aaron play video games. BJs phone rings. He picks it up 
           without stopping.

                                 BJ (ON PHONE)
                        Hey baby.

           INT. SARA’S CAR - DRIVING - INTERCUT

                                 JAYDEN (ON PHONE)
                        You want to share a limo with Sara and 
                        Hunt?

                                 BJ
                        No. Do you?

                                 JAYDEN
                        Yes.

                                 BJ
                        I thought we’d go with Aaron.

                                 JAYDEN
                        He’s going stag right?

                                 BJ
                        Yeah.
                                 JAYDEN
                        There’s an extra seat. Just invite him 
                        along.

                                 BJ
                          (to Aaron)
                        You wanna share a limo with Jayd’ and me?

                                 AARON
                        Whatever.

                                 BJ
                          (back into the phone)
                        Sold.

           EXT. AARON’S HOUSE - SUNSET

           Aaron waits in his tux as a GIGANTIC stretch limo pulls up. 

           INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS

           Aaron gets in to find not only Jayden, but Sara and Hunt.

                                 AARON
                        Oh. Hey.

           Sara laughs at something Hunt whispers in her ear.

                                 SARA
                        Hey.

           Sara, Jayden and Hunt gossip amongst themselves.

                                 AARON
                          (whispers to BJ)
                        I thought it was just gonna be you and 
                        Jayden.

                                 BJ
                        I didn’t mention they were coming? 

           Aaron glares at him, but it’s too late now.

                                 BJ
                          (under his breath)
                        I’m not any happier about it than you.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN OMAHA HYATT - NIGHT

           A lit placard welcomes the: “Omaha Central High School Prom”
           INT. DOWNTOWN OMAHA HYATT - NIGHT

           A banner reads: Knights of the Round Table. It’s an Arthurian, 
           medieval theme, complete with armor-clad waiters. 

           FIND Aaron, standing alone. Emily and HER DATE pass by him. She 
           glares. Aaron spins away to see Sara and Hunt dancing on the 
           floor. Sara gives Hunt the one-minute sign and heads to --

                                 SARA
                          (out of breath)
                        Hey!

                                 AARON
                        Hey.

           An awkward silence.

                                 SARA
                        Is our friendlationship in trouble?

                                 AARON
                        I hope not.
                          (beat)
                        It’s probably just me being an idiot. Can 
                        we forget about that... hug? 

                                 SARA
                        What hug?

                                 AARON
                          (”phew”)
                        Thank you.  
                          (beat)
                        Want to dance?

           She takes his hand and they hit the floor. Aaron’s skills have 
           improved and they are having a great time, but Sara watches Hunt 
           dance with another HOTTIE across the room. Narrows her eyes.

           EXT. POST-PROM PARTY - LATER

           Max and his numerous dates do shots on the trampoline out back. 

                                 MAD MAX
                        24 shots for 2400, baby!

           INT. POST-PROM PARTY - CONTINUOUS

           Aaron and Sara watch Max through the window. 

                                 AARON
                        I can’t believe that ass-clown scored 
                        higher on the SAT than me.
                                 SARA
                        By ten points, Aar. Hell year’s over. Try 
                        to enjoy it.

                                 AARON
                        I enjoy knowing I’m almost out of here.

                                 SARA
                          (not really hearing him)
                        Have you seen Hunt?

                                 AARON
                        Nope. Maybe you and I will be sharing the 
                        limo home after all.

                                 HUNT (O.S.)
                        Sara.

           ON Aaron: “Dammit.”

                                 SARA
                        Hey! Where have you been?

                                 HUNT
                        Spare bedroom just opened up.

                                 SARA
                        Finally!

           Sara kisses Aaron on the cheek.

                                 SARA
                        We’ll chat later, cool?

           And she’s off.

           INT. POST-PROM PARTY - MORNING

           A door SLAMS upstairs. Aaron wakes up in the middle of the 
           living room floor, one of many PASSED-OUT partiers. He spies 
           Sara and Hunt coming down the stairs laughing. They leave. 

           EXT. SIDEWALK - LATER

           A bitter Aaron leaves the party house and walks home. Alone. 

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

           TITLE OVER:

                                 SENIOR YEAR

           CUE an angry rock anthem. It plays over --
           A SERIES OF SHOTS:

           -- Aaron pulls his new (used) shitbox car into the school 
           parking lot. Down the row, Hunt parks his brand-new Escalade and 
           Sara hops out of the passenger seat.

           -- Aaron’s locker. BJ does a drum roll on the door.

                                 BJ
                        Let’s make it one to remember. The final 
                        year of the best --

                                 AARON
                          (SLAMS the locker)
                        Shut the fuck up.

           -- The DQ. Jayden and BJ suck face while Aaron is forced to 
           serve up cold treats to Hunt and Sara.

           -- Aaron flips through several A.P. test prep books in his 
           basement. He looks to the door hoping Sara will burst through, 
           but she doesn’t.

           -- A party. A CUTE GIRL is all over Aaron, but he can’t take his 
           eyes off Sara, who’s grinding with Hunt across the way.

           -- The cafeteria. Aaron’s filling out a Yale application. Sara 
           swings by, steals a tater, and then heads over to Hunt at Max’s 
           table.

           -- The track. Aaron’s the anchor on the 4X200 relay and comes 
           from behind to win the race! He looks to the stands where BJ and 
           Jayden cheer for him, but Sara’s nowhere to be found. 

           -- Sara and Aaron leave school together. Say tepid “see ya’ 
           laters.” Aaron gets in his car. Sara runs to Hunt’s open arms.

           -- Winter. Post Office. Aaron flips through his completed 
           college applications. This is everything he’s been working for. 
           He hands them over to the clerk, crosses both sets of fingers.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK:

           Then FOOTSTEPS, a SCRAPING sound, and a sudden FLASH OF LIGHT. A 
           GIANT HAND reaches in towards us and --

           EXT. MAIL BOX - CONTINUOUS

           Aaron pulls out the day’s mail, but every piece falls to the 
           ground save the lone letter his fingers have kept a grip on.

           The return address reads: YALE UNIVERSITY 

           CLOSE ON his eyes as we hear him RIPPING open the letter, then:
           ULTRA WIDE SHOT. Aaron is just a small speck against the entire 
           street and cul-de-sac.

           But it’s impossible to miss his spastic gyrations of excitement.

           EXT. THE BIGGEST HOUSE PARTY YET - NIGHT

           And the most bacchanal party we’ve seen. These STUDENTS are --

                                 DRUNK FUCK
                        College bound, baby!

                                 BJ
                          (under his breath)
                        -- Community.

           DRUNK FUCK does his twelfth keg stand of the night. His FRIENDS 
           cheer him on and everyone looks to be having a grand time.

                                 SARA (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry.

           Aaron instantly lights up even more.

                                 AARON
                        For what?

                                 SARA
                        For being an ass this year. I missed you.

                                 AARON
                        You’re not an ass. We’ve both just 
                        been... busy.

                                 SARA
                        Nebraska’s gonna miss you, but not as 
                        much as I will.

           She pulls a gift bag from behind her back. A surprised Aaron 
           pulls out a sweatshirt emblazoned with: YALE.

                                 SARA
                        I bought it before you even applied. Like 
                        there was ever a question.

                                 AARON
                        Thank you.

           He hugs her. Whatever distance that’s been between them 
           instantly disappears.

                                 AARON
                        And..?
                                 SARA
                        Top choice: Arizona State.

                                 AARON
                        Number one party school. How very Sara 
                        Simmons.

                                 SARA
                        Without you I don’t think I’d have gotten 
                        into any school. The SAT prep, the study 
                        buddy, the whole “cutting class every day 
                        is not a good idea.” You’re a great 
                        friend, Aaron. My best friend.

           Those words -- “best friend” -- slam into Aaron like a truck.

                                 SARA
                        What’s wrong?

                                 AARON
                        My biggest regret in high school is going 
                        to be what happened to us this year.

                                 SARA
                        Mine, too.

                                 AARON
                        It just hit me. 
                          (off her look)
                        We’ll be going from across the street to 
                        across the country.

           And that reality hits Sara, too. But this time, she hugs him, 
           holding him close.

                                 SARA
                        Won’t change a thing.

           It’s sweet, but it confuses the hell out of Aaron -- “What is 
           this?” Sara finally lets go. Grabs two Jello shots from a tray.

                                 SARA
                          (a toast)
                        To you. Never would have graduated 
                        without you.

                                 AARON
                        And to you. Never would have enjoyed it 
                        without you. 

           They tip cups and drink.
                                 AARON
                        So are you and Hunt all geared up to be 
                        grand prom queen and king?

           Before she can answer, Sara’s interrupted by Jayden.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Tell me it’s a lie. That the gossip 
                        whores are playing some cruel joke.

                                 SARA
                        It’s the truth. But I’m okay with it.

                                 AARON
                        Little help here?

                                 SARA
                        That prom queen and king thing isn’t 
                        going to happen. 

                                 AARON
                        You and Hunt broke up?

                                 SARA
                        I ended it today. What were we gonna do? 
                        Try college long distance --

                                 AARON
                          (jumping in)
                        -- and break up by October --

                                 SARA
                        -- to get back together at Thanksgiving --

                                 AARON
                        -- only to break up for good over 
                        Christmas break?

                                 AARON/SARA
                        Bullshit!

           They crack up. Jayden’s very annoyed.

                                 JAYDEN
                        But why before the prom? You were a lock.

                                 SARA
                          (winks)
                        And now you and BJ are.

           ON Jayden, realizing she is!

                                 SARA
                        Just say “thank you.”
                                 JAYDEN
                          (hugs her)
                        You will always be my queen! 

           Jayden takes off to tell BJ the good news.

                                 AARON
                        You want to get out of here?

                                 SARA
                          (smiles)
                        I’ll get my jacket.

           INT. THE BIGGEST HOUSE PARTY YET - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Sara walks down the hall to the coat room. Opens the door. 
           Flicks on the light.

           INT. THE BIGGEST HOUSE PARTY YET - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           On top of a mound of coats, a muscular male ass belonging to --

                                 SARA
                        HUNT?!

           He’s the meat in the middle of an Anorexic Friend and Bulimic 
           Friend sandwich.

           Mortified, Sara YANKS her coat out from under them and BOLTS. 

           INT. THE BIGGEST HOUSE PARTY YET - MOMENTS LATER

           Sara RUNS through the house, fighting back tears. Aaron spots 
           her through the crowd and tries to follow.

           EXT. THE BIGGEST HOUSE PARTY YET - CONTINUOUS

           But when he gets outside, there’s such a big crowd gathered on 
           the lawn, he’s lost her.

           INT./EXT. AARON’S (NEW) SHITBOX CAR - DRIVING

           Various suburban streets. Aaron searches for Sara, but she’s 
           nowhere to be found. He tries her (again) on his cell, but --

                                 SARA’S VOICEMAIL
                        Hey, it’s Sara. You’re a ‘tard if you 
                        don’t know what to do. 

           BEEP.

                                 AARON (ON PHONE)
                        Hi, it’s me. I’ve been looking for you 
                        for two hours. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AARON (ON PHONE) (cont'd)
                        So it’s cool if you don’t want to talk, 
                        but please call me back okay? I’m worried 
                        about you.

           INT. AARON’S BASEMENT - LATER

           A distressed Aaron comes through the back door. He sits on the 
           edge of his bed, but JUMPS when he hears the toilet FLUSH.

                                 AARON
                        Sara?

           A beat, and the door opens. Sara steps out, more composed, but 
           it’s clear the tears have been flowing.

                                 AARON
                        I heard at the party. Hunt’s an asshole.
                          (beat)
                        Is there anything I can do?

           She shakes her head. But the water works start all over again. 
           The pathetic weepy kind where your face turns sweaty and purple 
           and you can’t breathe through the snot.

           ON AARON. He does the one thing really good friends know to do 
           instinctively when all hell has broken loose in your life. He 
           wraps his arms around her and just holds her.

           But these are really good friends of the opposite sex. With a 
           very long history. 

           Sara’s crying calms. Aaron looks at her. The tough, trash-
           talking Sara, so vulnerable at this moment. Their faces move 
           closer. Cheeks brush. Eyes practically screaming: “Do it.”

           So they kiss. First the sixth grade, spin-the-bottle kind. Then, 
           a long, slow, deep, soft, wet Kevin-Costner-in-Bull-Durham kiss.

           THEY ATTACK EACH OTHER...

           ...as if have four years of pubescent orgasm have been building 
           up inside.

           Aaron’s got her shirt off in half a second, then easily unsnaps 
           her bra with a one-handed move.

                                 SARA
                        Where’d that come from?

                                 AARON
                        When you always stop at second, you tend 
                        to --

           Sara lets her bra drop. And there they are. 
                                 AARON
                        Is it wrong to say I’ve been fantasizing 
                        about those since the day I met you?

           Sara likes that. She shakes her head “no.”

           They dive back in. Aaron’s clothes come off, and suddenly they 
           both become clumsy. Inept.

           Aaron’s elbow connects with Sara’s head. THUNK!

                                 SARA
                        Ow!

                                 AARON
                        Sorry!

           They become a tangle of arms and legs shimmying under covers. 

                                 AARON
                        Ready?

           Sara nods. She reaches over and turns out the light.

           We hear the fumbling of a drawer and the RIP of the condom 
           wrapper. There’s movement under the covers and then a soft moan, 
           almost a gasp, from Sara.

                                 AARON
                        Sorry. Does that hurt? I’ve never --

                                 SARA
                        I know. 

           We hear more moving. Then kissing. Moaning. As they keep at it, 
           it seems not so bad for a first time.

           INT. AARON’S BASEMENT - MORNING

           The most awkward morning ever. Naked and in bed with your best 
           friend.

           Aaron and Sara lie side-by-side, staring up at the ceiling.

                                 AARON
                        So... did...

                                 SARA
                        Yeah...

                                 AARON
                        Was I... any good?
                                 SARA
                          (caught off guard)
                        Yeah... Yes. You were great.

           Sara sits up, keeps the sheet over her bare body, uncomfortable 
           even though he’s already seen her naked. Her hand searches the 
           floor for her clothes.

           As she does, the sheets move, and Aaron notices that --

                                 AARON
                        Whoa. Are you okay? You’re bleeding.

                                 SARA
                        Oh, shit. 
                          (blushes)
                        I think I just got my period. That’s so 
                        embarrassing.

                                 AARON
                        That’s. Strange. I thought you had it 
                        last week.

           Sara’s eyebrows go up -- “Why would you...?”

                                 AARON
                        I just... know you. Even when we’re not 
                        speaking.

                                 SARA
                        Am I really that big of a bitch when I’m 
                        on the rag?

                                 AARON
                        I plead the fifth.

           Sara hesitates to say anything else. Stares at the floor. Looks 
           anywhere but at Aaron.

           ON Aaron. Processing exactly what’s happened here. It hits him.

                                 AARON
                        Holy shit. Sara --

           She still won’t meet his gaze.

                                 AARON
                        Are you -- were you -- ?

           Silence.
                                 AARON
                        Look at me.
                          (beat, calm)
                        Were you a virgin?

           She nods. He has no idea what to say, so he just hugs her. She 
           likes it. Hugs him back.

                                 AARON
                          (confused)
                        But you always... I mean... you and Hunt 
                        were together an entire year...

                                 SARA
                        And I thought I would with him, but I 
                        just couldn’t. Kept thinking it was the 
                        night, and then I’d freak out. I guess he 
                        got sick of blow jobs.

                                 AARON
                          (realizes)
                        So he dumped you.

                                 SARA
                        For a threesome with my friends.

                                 AARON
                        Then why... me?

                                 SARA
                        I don’t know. Maybe with you I knew it 
                        would be more than --

                                 AARON
                        -- just a drunken thing.

           He smiles warmly. Sara can see the emotion in his eyes... and it 
           scares her. So she LAUGHS. Too hard. Too loud.

                                 SARA
                        I thought I was the girl here! 

                                 AARON
                        Sara, don’t.

                                 SARA
                        Actually I was going to say with you I 
                        knew it would be easy. No pressure.

                                 AARON
                        Why are you so intent on ruining this? 
                                 SARA
                        How could I ruin something that billions 
                        of humans have done for millions of 
                        years?

                                 AARON
                        For once, drop the fucking act.

           She quickly slips on her clothes.

                                 SARA
                        What are you getting so upset about? You 
                        should be thanking me. You’re over the 
                        virgin thing, and now you can look at sex 
                        as what it really is. Fun. A great 
                        release. A natural expression of 
                        mammalian hormonal surges.  

                                 AARON
                        Just stop. You’re clearly not a sexpert.

                                 SARA
                        I felt bad for you, okay?! I mean it’s 
                        one thing for a girl to go to college a 
                        virgin, but for a guy? Eek. You’re my 
                        best friend. I couldn’t let that happen. 
                          (she takes his hands)
                        But see, now we’re both over the hump. 
                        And it was nice to do it with my best 
                        friend.

           ON Aaron. That. Was. It. He throws her hands off.

                                 AARON
                        Wow, well, it’s nice to know after all 
                        this time that your definition of “best 
                        friend” includes lies and deliberate 
                        deception.

                                 SARA
                        When did I ever lie to you? 

                                 AARON
                        Oh, I dunno. Try the last four fucking 
                        years!

                                 SARA
                        It wasn’t like that.

                                 AARON
                        You’re right, because we were never best 
                        friends.

           This is the one thing Sara can’t handle. And he knows it.
                                 SARA
                        That’s not true.

                                 AARON
                        You played me like everyone else in 
                        school, letting us all believe you were 
                        the grand slut.  

                                 SARA
                        I didn’t think you were everyone. I 
                        thought you were... Oh shit --
                          (she start to cry)
                        What does it matter? It’s good to know 
                        that’s what everyone thought. Including 
                        you.

                                 AARON
                        Never showed me otherwise.

                                 SARA
                        Fuck you.

                                 AARON
                        Been there. Done that.

           She grabs her stuff and BOLTS.

           Prom posters abound:

                        I just think it’s time we explore our 
                        options, while we have the time --

                                 PREPPY GAL
                        I’m accepted to college, so I should 
                        really only see college guys now --

                                 JOCK BOY
                        We got six weeks of school left and 
                        there’s six names on my list, babe. It’s 
                        nothing personal.

           SLAP! Jock Boy’s face gets a sting delivered by his now EX-
           GIRLFRIEND. Aaron watches from across the hall.

                                 JAYDEN (O.S.)
                        It’s happening all over school.
                                 AARON
                        What is?

           Aaron finds Jayden with BJ.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Senior break-ups. The Hunt and Sara split 
                        started a movement. Everyone’s making 
                        “final fuck lists.”

                                 BJ
                        Kind of a premature cummencement.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Grow up.

                                 AARON
                          (a little sad)
                        Guess I completed mine.

           That’s when Sara rounds the corner. She locks eyes with Aaron, 
           does a 180 and marches back off.

           Jayden sees the exchange, instantly knows what’s up. She PUNCHES 
           Aaron in the shoulder. Hard.

                                 AARON
                        Ouch!

                                 JAYDEN
                        What did you do?

                                 BJ
                        Why does it have to be his fault?

                                 JAYDEN
                        Because he’s got a penis!

                                 AARON
                        I didn’t --

           But he’s cut short by the sound of DOZENS OF CELL PHONES going 
           off at the same time. Every student in the hall grabs theirs.

                                 BJ
                        Got a text.

                                 AARON
                        Me, too.

                                 JAYDEN
                        HOLY HELL?!

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:
           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           A huge crowd of STUDENTS and TEACHERS sits in the pew, crying. A 
           COFFIN rests at the front of the room. The MINISTER blathers on 
           about the meaning(lessness) of life. BJ sniffles. Wipes a tear.

                                 BJ
                        It’s okay to cry, you know.

                                 AARON
                        I can’t. I’m still in shock. How this 
                        could happen --

           OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM. Intercut the conversation with Sara.

                                 SARA
                        -- to Mad Max? He was --

                                 AARON
                        -- a colossal idiot, sure, but --

                                 SARA
                        -- everyone loved him.

           Two PUNK STUDENTS in front SHUSH her. They tune into the --

                                 MINISTER
                        -- after he passed out in fifth period 
                        dodgeball. 

           A NERD pipes up:

                                 NERDY KID
                        For academic credit! Which he petitioned 
                        for on our behalf.

           His NERDY FRIENDS murmur agreements. 

                                 MINISTER
                        Fifth period dodgeball for academic 
                        credit. Few knew of Maximillian’s heart 
                        condition, but he knew, and he lived each 
                        day knowing the truth -- that it could be 
                        his last.
                          (somber beat)
                        I’ve been told Maximillian’s last words 
                        were: “I never went to prison.” They were 
                        symbolic of --

                                 AARON
                          (under his breath)
                        Does detention count?
                                 BJ
                        Max loved detention, bro. That place was 
                        like a Buddhist monastery for him. And he 
                        was head monk.

                                 MINISTER
                        -- and now we’d like to open the floor to 
                        Maximillians’s family and friends to 
                        share a few words.

           HALF THE CONGREGATION RISES. Forms a line. We see snippets as 
           each takes the front of the room:

                                 SMART GIRL
                        He stole the book I needed for my thesis 
                        from the public library. That’s a felony 
                        in some states!

                                 BURLY TOUGH GUY
                        He changed my tire when I didn’t know how 
                        to. And it was five below outside.

                                 HIPPIE GAL
                        He was a lover not a fighter. So gentle.

           CUT BACK TO THE PEWS:

                                 JAYDEN
                        This is... so... weird.

                                 SARA
                          (sadly)
                        It’s a seminal high school moment. 
                        Everyone experiences the dead kid. I 
                        mean, I thought he’d have died by doing a 
                        keg stand and base jumping off the First 
                        National building, but the outcome is 
                        still the same. A shitty tragedy.

           PAST HER on the other side of the room we see --

           AARON, staring directly at her. 

                                 BJ
                        Dude. You’re zoning.

           But his gaze never leaves Sara.

                                 AARON
                        High school meant something to Max.

           The way he says it, it’s like a personal breakthrough. As if Max 
           has put the pieces of some cosmic puzzle together for him.
                                 BJ
                        High school meant everything to Max.

           Sensing him, Sara looks over and LOCK EYES with Aaron for a 
           brief second. But there are no looks of anger traded here... 
           just regret. Sara’s the first to turn away.

                                 AARON
                        I don’t want this to have just been the 
                        four years I spent getting into college.

           A LONG beat. 

                                 BJ
                        It wasn’t. It was you and me and Jayden 
                        and, yeah -- 
                          (hard to admit)
                        -- even Sara. It was the DQ and GTA and 
                        thousands of hours lost in your basement. 
                        It was cutting class, mocking wannabes, 
                        smoking pot and dirty spin the bottle. It 
                        was puking ‘til our nuts hurt, then doing 
                        it again the next weekend because we 
                        could. It was skipping curfew. Cruising 
                        around with no destination and then 
                        driving 200 miles at midnight to Kansas 
                        City because we had a hankering for good 
                        BBQ. It was cheating on tests, well, not 
                        you, brown-noser. But it was being dead-
                        fucking tired together, screaming 
                        together, laughing together, 24/7...

           BJ stands and wipes a tear. Gets himself together as PALLBEARERS 
           carry Max’s casket past them. 

                                 BJ
                        Max made the most of this ride. So why 
                        don’t you honor his memory, shut your 
                        fucking yapper, and make the most of 
                        yours.

                                 AARON
                        How’s that?

                                 BJ
                        You’re in love with your best friend, 
                        dude. 
                          (off Aaron’s look)
                        And that’s not me. Go make it right.

           ON Aaron. No ironic comeback this time.

           A SERIES OF SHOTS (all of students we’ve come to recognize):
           -- A row of department store mirrors, each with a GIRL in front 
           modeling a prom dress. Jayden, alone, takes a picture of herself 
           in the mirror with her cellphone. Pix-messages What do u think? to:

           -- Sara looks at the picture on her phone, texts back: I don’t care

           -- Flower shop. THREE GUYS agonize over the abundance of

           INT. SARA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Sara lies on her bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to her 
           iPod stereo. Her phone rings.

                                 SARA (ON PHONE)
                        I told you I’m not going.

           EXT. LIMO - INTERCUT

           Jayden, phone to her ear, pins a corsage on BJ.

                                 JAYDEN (ON PHONE)
                        Put on one of the twenty sexy Sar-ations 
                        hanging in your closet and get your 
                        skinny ass ready. I will not let the last 
                        few weeks ruin my prom like my cheap-ass 
                        date is trying to. 

                                 BJ
                          (jumps - OUCH!)
                        Sonofabitch!

           Jayden’s pricked him with the corsage needle.

                                 JAYDEN
                        That’s what you get, skimping on the 
                        limo. I think my mom took this to her 
                        prom.

           PULL BACK to reveal the FULL LIMOUSINE. A fly ride. In 1975.

                                 BJ
                        I told you it was the last one.
                                 JAYDEN
                          (pricks him again)
                        So you’re a lazy cheap-ass!
                          (into phone)
                        Ten minutes, Sar. Be ready.

                                 SARA 
                        Save your gas. I’m not going.

           BJ snatches the phone.

                                 BJ (ON PHONE)
                        She said ten minutes! I wasted enough of 
                        high school hanging out with you -- don’t 
                        make me wait, woman!

           Jayden grabs the phone back from him.

                                 JAYDEN (ON PHONE)
                        Make it four for four, babe. It’s my 
                        memory, too. You have to be a part of it.

           CLICK. End on Sarah, considering.

           INT./EXT. SARA’S HOUSE - TEN MINUTES LATER

           DING-DONG. Sara (only she could get ready and look this fabulous 
           this fast) opens the door to find --

                                 AARON
                        We promised each other if we didn’t have 
                        dates, we’d go to prom together. 

           He holds out a corsage. A tense beat. Sara thinks. Then:

           SLAM!

           She’s not having any of this. BJ and Jayden hang out the limo 
           sunroof looking dejected, but Aaron marches into --

           INT. SARA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                 AARON
                        Sara!

           A second SLAM! Aaron hears it and goes to the 

           BATHROOM DOOR.

                                 AARON
                        Sara, come out, please?

           Nothing.
                                 AARON
                        You can’t stay in there all night.

           Or maybe she can.

                                 AARON
                        Then I’ll just come in. I’ve handed you 
                        your phone, toilet paper and even tampons 
                        before, so you know I’m not bluffing.

           But the look on his face screams: “I’m bluffing.”

                                 AARON
                        I’ll really do it.

           He gives her one last beat... 

                                 AARON
                        Here we go.

           A deep breath, and he grabs the door knob. TWISTS.

           It’s locked.

                                 AARON
                          (”oh”)
                        Fine. We’ll do it like this. 

           His forehead falls against the door, resigned.

                                 AARON
                        Do you know I change my shirt at least 
                        three times before you pick me up? Do you 
                        know I get a strange rush out of the 
                        idiotic way you change lanes on the 
                        freeway, knowing if you kill us, at least 
                        I’ll die with you? Do you know I memorize 
                        your schedule every semester so I can try 
                        to walk down the same hall you’re walking 
                        through between classes, just so I can 
                        get these stupid butterflies in my 
                        stomach and say ‘”hi?” That I know which 
                        brand of shampoo you use, and what shade 
                        of lipstick you wear? Pantene and Passion 
                        fruit. That I like who I am with you more 
                        than with anybody else? That you force me 
                        to do things that I would never do on my 
                        own. We were both wrong, Sara, because no 
                        matter how long you refuse to speak to 
                        me, I will always and forever be I-can’t-
                        stop-thinking-about-you-all-the-time in 
                        love with you. My best friend. 
           He breathes a sigh of relief. It’s finally been put out there. 
           But his heart jumps when he hears the CLICK of the lock and --

                                 HOUSE KEEPER
                          (too loud)
                        Señor, Aaron? ¿Qué usted está haciendo?

           She puts down her mop and pops off her headphones.

                                 AARON
                          (face falls)
                        Hi, Lupe. I was just leaving.

           FROM THE UPSTAIRS LANDING,

           we see Aaron exit out the front door. SWING OVER TO --

           SARA, sitting against the wall around the corner, knees to her 
           chest. She heard everything. 

           A FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT takes us to:

           The final sign: “Welcome Omaha Central High School Prom!”

           INT. DOWNTOWN OMAHA DOUBLETREE HOTEL - NIGHT

           HAPPY COUPLE poses in front of a faux-lavish backdrop. They 
           plaster on smiles for the camera. FLASH.

           Another couple. FLASH. And another. FLASH. 

           Nothing cynical in these photos, just happy memories being made. 
           BJ and Jayden step in for their photo.

                                 BJ
                        Have I told you how gorgeous you look 
                        tonight?

                                 JAYDEN
                          (beat)
                        And the jackass comment that follows...

                                 BJ
                          (pulls her close)
                        Not tonight.

                                 JAYDEN
                          (smiles)
                        You’re looking pretty handsome yourself.

           The FLASH takes us to --
           THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PROM YET. 

           The one you wanted yours to be.

           A banner hangs over the ballroom: A Knight of Elegance -- 
           dedicated to Mad Max Sladusky, 1989-2007.

           Everyone dances together until the DJ switches it to --

                                 BJ
                        Ugh, four years and this song still --

                                 JAYDEN
                        -- sucks. Let’s take a break.

           They move off the dance floor and join up with a mopey --

                                 AARON
                        This was our song.

           Indeed, it’s the classic high school anthem we’ve heard before.

                                 BJ
                        Then go find a girl that has taste in 
                        music, will ya’?

           WHACK! goes Jayden’s fist into his shoulder.

                                 BJ
                        My boy’s done everything he could and she 
                        broke his heart.

           INT. SARA’S ROOM - SAME

           Sara lies on her bed in her prom dress. Fuming at her own 
           stubbornness. Her iPod randomly switches to the next song -- the 
           same classic high school anthem.

                                 SARA
                        Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine!  

           She JUMPS up and out to --

           EXT. PEACEFUL ROAD - NIGHT

           Crickets chirp. A small RABBIT carefully inches toward the 
           pavement, looking to cross. It FREEZES in terror as a familiar 
           Civic RACES by in a blur.

           INT. DOWNTOWN OMAHA DOUBLETREE - SAME

           A pathetic Aaron sits alone. Eats bad prom cake.
                                 EMILY (O.S.)
                        Hey, Aaron.

                                 AARON
                        Hi. How are you?

           She sits next to him.

                                 EMILY
                        Been better. You here alone?

                                 AARON
                        I am. That stag guy.

                                 EMILY
                        Then I’m that stag gal.
                          (off his look)
                        My date, this college guy, bailed last 
                        minute.

                                 AARON
                        Now he’ll never have a chance to throw-up 
                        on you.

                                 EMILY
                          (laughs)
                        And then break up with me only weeks 
                        before prom.

                                 AARON
                        That was a dick move. I’m sorry.

                                 EMILY
                        You were in love with someone else. I get 
                        it. Guess that didn’t work out, huh?

                                 AARON
                        Nope.

                                 EMILY
                        I could keep a grudge until we graduate, 
                        but that would be, what, like five more 
                        minutes?

                                 AARON
                          (smiles)
                        You want to dance?

           Emily nods, and they hit the floor.

           SARA. Bent over the wheel bawling. A river of tears.

                        And which grandmother died tonight, Sara? 
                        Was it your third or fourth? I’ve lost 
                        count.

                                 SARA
                        You got me, Officer Norton. I’m sorry.
                        But it’s just --

                        Please! Just give me a ticket and let me 
                        go. 

                                 OFFICER NORTON
                        And what’s the rush tonight?

                                 SARA
                        Aaron. I have to find him. I have to get 
                        to prom and find him because... I’m in 
                        love with him and he has no idea and 
                        that’s the rush.

                                 OFFICER NORTON
                        Whoa. That sounds way too hormonal to be 
                        bullshit.
                          (off her look)
                        I have a teenage daughter.

                                 SARA
                        Where’s Aaron?

                                 BJ
                        Nuh-uh, too late. He apologized and you 
                        shot him down, so this time you lose, 
                        sucka.

           Jayden PUNCHES him in the arm again.

                                 BJ
                        Ow! This is her fault.

                                 SARA
                        Too late for what?

                                 JAYDEN
                        He went upstairs with Emily.

                                 SARA
                        Which room?

                                 BJ
                        Nothing you do will make me give him up.
           That’s when Sara GRABS Jayden and sucks face with her, gropes 
           Jayden’s breast. BJ’s jaw drops.

                                 SARA
                        Fantasy fulfilled?

                                 BJ
                        Room 516.

           And she’s off.

           VARIOUS SHOTS - INTERCUT

           -- Sara runs to the elevator and PUNCHES the button.

                                 SARA
                        C’mon, c’mon.

           -- Aaron unbuttons his tuxedo shit.

           -- Sara in the elevator. She gets stuck on Floor 2 when a YOUNG 
           COUPLE gets on and hits “Floor 3.”

                                 SARA
                        ‘Cause it’s that hard to walk up one 
                        flight?!

           -- Aaron’s shoes are kicked off his feet.

           -- The elevator doors open and Sara runs down the hallway to 
           Room 516. BANGS on the door.

                                 SARA
                        Aaron! Aaron open up. I know you’re with 
                        Emily. But I have to talk to you. 
                          (waits, BANGS again)
                        Okay, I deserve this. I’ll do it your 
                        way. 
                          (beat, to the door)
                        I'm sorry. I've been so busy focusing on 
                        the present, that for the first time I’m 
                        looking back, and I’m realizing that I’ve 
                        been in love with you, for pretty much 
                        the last four years. And I know we always 
                        thought that was bullshit, it was the 
                        only thing we ever agreed on. But we were 
                        wrong. I wish I could be like you and see 
                        the future, but I can't. And I don't care 
                        how much you plan, but you never planned 
                        for this: People do fall in love in high 
                        school. We did. So please tell me it's 
                        not too late for us to realize that.
           She waits a long, excruciating beat. Nothing. A single tear, and 
           she turns to leave.

                                 AARON (O.S.)
                        Sara?

           She turns back -- 

           And her face falls. Aaron’s standing there in the open doorway:

           IN A TOWEL.

                                 SARA
                        I’m... sorry...

           She runs away down the hall as the tears start flowing. But 
           Aaron RUSHES after her:

                                 AARON
                        Sara!

           Sara gets to the -- 

           INT. OPEN ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           -- and hits the button. She closes her eyes, heart crushed, as 
           the doors start to close -- But not before Aaron leaps inside.

                                 SARA
                        What are you -- ?

           But she doesn’t get to finish her question, as Aaron presses his 
           lips against her, a 1940s-movie-violins-playing kind of kiss and 
           they melt into each other’s arms. 

                                 SARA
                        What about Emily?

                                 AARON
                        I didn’t.

           Sara motions to his towel.

                                 AARON
                        I was taking a shower. I had some anger 
                        to dance off.

                                 SARA
                        But why not?

                                 AARON
                        Because it wasn’t right with her. It 
                        never was. She wasn’t... you. 
                                 SARA
                        I was scared.

                                 AARON
                        So was I. But not because you made me 
                        think about the future, but because you 
                        made me care about today.
                          (beat)
                        So let’s finally do this. You and me. 
                        Today.

           He pulls her close and kisses her again.

                                 SARA
                          (breathless)
                        And tomorrow?

           He kisses her once more, and they keep going, and going until --

           DING! The doors slide open to --

           INT. LOBBY - SAME

           Jayden and BJ in Prom King and Queen sashes and crowns.

                                 JAYDEN
                        Ohmygod, you are SO B.F.F.

                                 BJ
                          (shaking his head)
                        Best friend fuckers.

           Sara and Aaron break their kiss to find themselves face-to-face 
           with a sea of PROM-GOERS waiting for the elevator...

                                 JAYDEN
                        We’ll wait for the next one.

           She reaches in and hits the “DOORS CLOSE” button.

                                 BJ
                        We’re good people.

                                 JAYDEN
                        We definitely don’t suck.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

           Silence.

           But listening closer, we hear the rising sounds of... heavy 
           breathing?

           Suddenly, a FLASH of blinding light and we’re --
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           The covers have been thrown off our breathless couple.

                                 SARA
                        It really is true. You don’t orgasm the 
                        first time.

           She wipes the sweat from her forehead.

                                 SARA
                        But that was amazing.

                                 AARON
                        I heard it only gets better.

                                 SARA
                        We could test the theory.

           She YANKS him close and they disappear back under the covers. 

                                                              FADE TO:

           INT. AIRPORT - DAY

           Aaron and Sara kiss, bags at each of their sides.

                                 SARA
                        I thought everyone breaks up at 
                        Thanksgiving.

                                 AARON
                        We’re not everyone.

                                 SARA
                        Just seven more semesters to go.

           He kisses her again, frisky.

                                 AARON
                        But only four more weeks ‘til Christmas 
                        break.

                                 SARA
                        Down boy.

           He takes his bags.

                                 AARON
                          (starts to go)
                        Call you soon as I land!

                                 SARA
                        You better!
           He heads off, but then races back INTO FRAME for one last kiss.

           INT. AIRPLANE - MINUTES LATER

           Aaron finds his seat. A beat and a sigh. Then his pants BUZZ. He 
           grabs his Sidekick.

           1 new text   He accepts it.  boo! miss u alrdy 

           He quickly texts back:

           yay! theres alwys fone sex  

           A beat later, his Sidekick buzzes again.

           or... ever heard of sexting?

           ON Aaron: “huh?” Another buzz.

           You have 1 new photo message

           He hits “OK.” Turns the phone sideways. Must be some picture. 
           His eyes BUG OUT with excitement.

           We hear the RUSH of a plane taking off and --

                                                   SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

                                 THE END
