           INT. BANK OFFICE - DAY

           A twenty-something guy, good-looking, charming, smart sits 
           behind a desk in his office in a bank. This is WILLIAM COX 
           (TOPHER GRACE). A SWEET LATE THIRTYSOMETHING COUPLE, DESMOND 
           AND ALI WILLIS sit before him. They hold a model of a 
           prospective restaurant and a plate of pancakes.

                                 DESMOND 
                        “Pancake Beach.” I tried to think of my 
                        two favorite things in the world and 
                        combine them. Pancakes and the beach. 
                        We’re gonna have every different kind of 
                        pancake and topping that you can think of 
                        in a calming beach scene environment.

                                 ALI
                        He makes the best pancakes! Wanna 
                        try them?

                                 WILL
                        That’s okay, I believe you.

                                 ALI
                        You have to try them!

           Will politely takes the plate of syrup covered pancakes and 
           takes a bite. He chews and smiles again politely.

                                 WILL
                        You’re right, they are very good.

           They look at Will, waiting.

                                 WILL
                        Do you guys want a Coke?

           They both nod: um, sure. Will goes to a little fridge he has 
           and gets a few. The fridge is filled with cans of coke.

                                 WILL
                        When I was little my Mom wouldn’t let 
                        me drink them, thought they would 
                        give me juvenile diabetes or ADD or 
                        AD-HD, basically anything with AD 
                        before it. Anyway, now I just have 
                        one whenever I want.

           He gives them both drinks. They all open them, sit there and 
           drink.

                                 WILL
                        That was a really good 
                        presentation. And the pancakes were 
                        really good. Really.
                            (They smile proudly)
                        Can I be honest with you though?
                                 DESMOND
                        Yes, please.

                                 WILL
                        You don’t want this loan.

                                 DESMOND
                        We don’t?

                                 WILL
                        No, you don’t. What do you do now, 
                        Desmond?

                                 DESMOND
                        I am a short order cook at Applebees.

                                 WILL
                        That’s a good place. I go there a lot. 
                        You probably make a decent amount of 
                        money, not too much but it affords you 
                        plenty of time for Ali and the kids. I’m 
                        assuming you guys have kids. You just 
                        both seem like you would be great 
                        parents.

           They smile. They are.

                                 WILL
                        But, if I give you this loan, sure you 
                        will have your dream place: your Pancake 
                        Beach, but at what cost? Let me ask you 
                        both a question. And I don’t want you to 
                        answer this one aloud, just think of the 
                        answer in your heads. 
                            (they wait)
                        About how many times a week do you guys 
                        have the sexual relations with each 
                        other?

           A little embarrassed they look at each other and smile.

                                 WILL
                        It’s a big number I can tell. Now subtract 
                        that number by the exact same number and 
                        that will be how often you have it if I 
                        give you this loan. Because Desmond will 
                        be spending all his time at Pancake Beach. 
                        And when he is not he will be spending all 
                        his time worrying about Pancake Beach. He 
                        certainly won’t be thinking about you, 
                        Ali, or your needs. Or your children’s. 
                        How many kids do you have?

                                 DESMOND
                        Two.
                                 WILL
                        A year after opening this place you are 
                        not even gonna be sure of that number 
                        because you never see them. You start 
                        wondering: “do I even have kids or was 
                        that some sleep deprived induced 
                        hallucination?” And on the rare occasion 
                        when you do see them they stop calling 
                        you Dad, but rather “Des”, in a really 
                        snarky way. They figure why should I call 
                        you Dad when you don’t act like one 
                        anymore. Ali, meanwhile, has taken to 
                        pill popping to make the emptiness go 
                        away. And started to look elsewhere for 
                        the relations, but it isn’t about sex, 
                        it’s the affection she misses. Who among 
                        us doesn’t need a hug every now again?

           Des looks at Ali. Will keeps going at a fever pitch.

                                 WILL
                        And even if you are successful which 90% 
                        of new restaurants aren’t. That new found 
                        money -- Ali’s spent it all trying to 
                        find something to fill the void of your 
                        absence. But, it doesn’t work, Ali 
                        believe you me. I’ve seen it all happen 
                        too many times. You both seem like nice 
                        people which is why I am telling you 
                        this. My advice: Throw away that 
                        application, go home make your pancakes 
                        for your kids, be the world’s best dad  
                        and make sweet sweet love to Ali here. I 
                        think you would all be better off for it. 

           Desmond and Ali just stare at him in a little shock. CUT TO:

           Will showing Des and Ali out. They both hug him.

                                 ALI
                        Thank you so much, Mr. Cox, for 
                        helping us not make the biggest 
                        mistake of our lives.

                                 WILL
                        Your welcome and it’s Will.

           They take each others hands and walk off. Will’s best friend 
           is waiting there for him. He holds a stack of flyers. This is 
           HAMILTON COOPER. Funny, sardonic, highly intelligent, doesn’t 
           give a shit.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Another happy non-customer?

                                 WILL
                        Yup.
                                 HAMILTON
                        No one says no like you, Will. They 
                        always seem to leave feeling all 
                        warm and fuzzy like.
                            (ala Darth Vader)
                        Impressive.

                                 WILL
                        That’s what they pay me the big 
                        bucks for.

           Hamilton hands Will the stack of elaborate flyers for a 
           party. They feature a 3D graphic of Will and Hamilton 
           drinking. 

                                 WILL
                            (also ala Darth Vader)
                        Equally impressive. When did you do 
                        these? And how much did they cost?

                                 HAMILTON
                        William, I have a billion dollars in the 
                        bank and no daily responsibilities. 

                                 WILL
                        I am a big fan of the 3D me.

                                 HAMILTON
                        I knew you would be.

           Will and Hamilton move through the office handing out flyers 
           to each and every person.

                                 WILL
                        Hey, intern, we’re having a party tonight 
                        to welcome all the new guys to the bank. 
                        You should come, bring friends.

           As Will and Hamilton continue passing out flyers a song 
           starts up and the opening CREDITS BEGIN.

           EXT. ROOFTOP PARTY - NIGHT

           As the CREDITS ROLL we see a massive party going on the 
           rooftop of an apartment complex in Los Angeles. Each top 
           floor unit has their own private rooftop patio and all the 
           doors are open with the party spilling out across all of 
           them.

           Raucous TWENTY SOMETHINGS mingle and drink throughout all of 
           it. Each patio has a different game, theme. There is 
           something for everyone. In one there are NAKED FIRE DANCERS 
           dancing for the GUYS. In another BUFF MEN dressed as DOCTORS 
           LISTEN AND CUDDLE with the WOMAN.
           Still in others high stakes games of Monopoly, Stratego are 
           played. HOT WAITRESSES IN CIGARETTE GIRL OUTFITS move 
           throughout passing out shots and drinks.

           In one area we see Will and a LARGE MAN sitting on either 
           side of the boardgame OPERATION. People stand on both sides 
           with money in their hands, taking bets. Will and the Large 
           Man stare at each other intently. It’s like the Tibetan Bar 
           Drinking Scene from Raiders.

           Will does a shot and then grabs the operating tool. Squinting 
           at the tiny plastic kidney he carefully extracts it without 
           touching the side. The crowd CHEERS.

           Hamilton holds court nearby with a bunch of PRETTY WOMEN and 
           a few guys.

                                 PRETTY LADY
                        So you own this whole building?

                                 HAMILTON
                            (nods)
                        When I was in college, one night while 
                        heavily intoxicated I thought it would be 
                        funny if I put a picture of my face 
                        online. So I did. 

           Will’s opponent: The Fat Guy, yeah I’ll say it, he’s fat, 
           goes after the heart. His drunken hand shakes. He steadies, 
           but as he is about to get it, he touches the side. IT BUZZES. 
           Will’s side CHEERS. The Fat Guy takes another shot.

                                 HAMILTON
                        ...Soon other people decided to put their 
                        faces on too. Then a couple million did. 
                        Then Summer Redstone bought the site from 
                        me for 1.2 billion dollars.

                                 HOT GIRL
                        Wait, you started MyFace?

                                 HAMILTON
                            (nods, nonchalant)
                        I have so much money sometimes I 
                        just set it on fire you know just 
                        because I can. I have a room, I 
                        shit you not, where I roll around 
                        in it. It makes me feel nice. 
                        What’s your name?

           Will takes another shot. He now goes after the heart. His 
           eyes flutter like he is going to pass out. It is tense. 
           Everyone gets ready to pay their bets. But, Will was just 
           faking. He smiles and grabs the heart. No buzz.
           The Fat Guy starts to take his shot, but passes out before he 
           can. Will’s side cheers. They take their money. Will gets 
           high fived all around.

                                 GUY
                        Nice, Cox, nice.

                                 WILL
                        Fret not, newbies, with a little 
                        practice, precision and a high Irish 
                        tolerance you too can become a master 
                        at Alcoholic Operation.

           Two more people start to play as Hamilton walks up.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Having fun?

                                 WILL
                            (stops to check)
                        ...Yes. Yes, I am. 

           They grab drinks from a tray and walk surveying their party. 
           They pass by a group playing STRIP CLUE.

                                 HOT GIRL IN A BRA
                            (like it is the most serious thing 
                             in the world)
                        Colonel Mustard with the 
                        Candlestick in the study.

           Hamilton grabs the answer and looks. They all wait. 

                                 HAMILTON
                        ...No, I am sorry to say, it’s not.

           All the Guys get excited as the hot girl takes off her bra. 
           The intern we saw Will invite who is now in just his boxers 
           and his tie drunkenly smiles.

                                 INTERN
                        Fuck yea!!! I work at the coolest 
                        bank ever.
                            (he turns to Will)
                        Mr. Cox, I love you.

                                 WILL
                        I love you too, Intern Bob.

           Will and Hamilton walk on. They take seats in the corner.

                                 HAMILTON
                        So where’s Muffy tonight?

                                 WILL
                        Bridget.
                                 HAMILTON
                        Yeah, her, why isn’t she here?

                                 WILL
                        Oh, yeah. I didn’t invite her.
                            (off Hamilton’s look)
                        This isn’t really her scene. I didn’t 
                        want to have to worry if she was having 
                        fun the whole time or feel like I had to 
                        entertain her. I just wanted to hang with 
                        you guys tonight. So I figured it was 
                        just easier if she didn’t come. We’re 
                        gonna hang out tomorrow.

                                 HAMILTON
                        So to sum up you don’t like her.

                                 WILL
                        No, I do. I just-

                                 HAMILTON
                        If you really liked her you would 
                        have invited her.

                                 WILL
                        I do really like her. She’s great, 
                        beautiful, smart, good family. 
                        What’s not to like? 

                                 HAMILTON
                        I didn’t say she wasn’t great. I just 
                        said you didn’t like her. I think you 
                        think you should like her. I think you 
                        wanna like her, but you don’t. That’s 
                        your problem, Will, you are always 
                        dating girls that you think you should 
                        like. That your parents would like, but 
                        you don’t. You pretend for a while and 
                        then you realize it, break up with them 
                        in a very nice way that makes them feel 
                        good about themselves and then you move 
                        onto the next one.

                                 WILL
                        I don’t always do that. I just 
                        wanna find that one.

                                 HAMILTON
                        And all I am saying is you are not going 
                        to until you stop dating people you think 
                        you should be dating and start dating 
                        ones that you actually want to. Someone 
                        that you wanna spend every second with. 
                        That you would invite with you tonight 
                        without batting an eye and would have 
                        just as much fun as you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HAMILTON (cont'd)
                        Someone that will help you break out of 
                        this safe life you have planned for 
                        yourself, but that isn’t really you.

           Will takes a deep breath. He may not want to admit it, but he 
           knows he is right.

                                 WILL
                        Well, she’s meeting my parents 
                        tomorrow night. So...

                                 HAMILTON
                        Mark my words: they’ll love her.

           INT. CHIC FUSION RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Will, sits with his parents: BARBARA AND WILLIAM SR, and 
           BRIDGET at a hip, new fusion restaurant. One of those ones 
           that all the reviews rave about and no one admits they don’t 
           really like. Bridget is preppy, cute, J Crew and Laura 
           Ashley. Will’s parents are Waspy and in the 18% of the 
           country that still approve of Dick Cheney.

           Bridget and Will’s Mom seem to be hitting it off. Will 
           however, seems distracted, lost in his thoughts and thinking 
           about what Hamilton said.

                                 BRIDGET
                        I am so excited to eat here. I’ve been 
                        telling Will we need to come forever.

                                 BARBARA COX
                        I have been telling Bill that too. Judy 
                        Harrington from Cardio Bar swears by it.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Oh my goodness, I love Cardio bar! 
                        We should go together.

           As they talk, Will Sr, takes a potent drink of his scotch. 
           Will watches them: is this his future? 

           The WAITER brings their food. It is beautiful, if small and 
           unappetizing. Barbara, Bridget, and Will Sr dig in. Will 
           looks at it and makes a face. 

           ACROSS THE WAY we see a beautiful, smart, young woman, late 
           20’s sitting with a GROUP OF MIDDLE AGED BUSINESS MEN from 
           DETROIT. This is SAMANTHA O’CONNOR, Sam for short.

                                 DETROIT CAR GUYS
                        We can’t do it. We appreciate what 
                        you have to say, but we just don’t 
                        have the technology. And let us point 
                        out that our cars do fit the 
                        standards that the law provides.
                                 SAM
                        Can I ask you guys a question? Years from 
                        now when someone asks your grandchildren 
                        what Granddad does, do you all really 
                        wanna be known as the guys the ended the 
                        world? “My Granddad is a fireman.” “My 
                        Grandad is the reason why there is no 
                        longer a Florida.” It doesn’t quite have 
                        the same ring to it. I know you have the 
                        technology in the basement someplace to 
                        make these cars more fuel efficient. 
                        Everyone knows it, so don’t bullshit me 
                        by telling me that you don’t.

           They all look guilty.

                                 SAM
                        And we all know you don’t have to do it. 
                        But, think of how great it will make you 
                        look, make your companies look if you do. 
                        No one, no law forcing you to up your 
                        standards but you do it anyway simply 
                        because it is the right thing to do. 
                        Right now you guys and the oil companies 
                        are right up there in popularity with the 
                        guys who club baby seals. In fact you are 
                        below them, because what is worse: 
                        clubbing a few cute baby seals or 
                        polluting the world, melting the polar 
                        ice caps and ending humanity? Did you see 
                        Day After Tomorrow? That is what it will 
                        be like, except far less silly and with 
                        better effects. 

           The Detroit Carmen are speechless as their WAITER now brings 
           their food. Sam looks down at hers, equally unappetized as Will.

           EXT. FUSION RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Will’s parents hug Bridget goodbye as they get into their 
           car. As Will helps his mother in she mouthes to him: 

                                 BARBARA COX
                        We love her!!! She reminds me of a 
                        younger me.

           Will, if he had eaten any of his food, might throw it up 
           right now. He closes the door. They drive off and Will goes 
           back to Bridget. He is about to open his mouth when a 
           HOMELESS MAN approaches.

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        Evening. Spare some change?

           Will reaches for his wallet.
                                 BRIDGET
                        I’ve got it.

           Bridget reaches into her purse. Will’s a bit surprised at 
           this. He starts to smile when...

           She pulls out some mace and sprays the man right in the face.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Shoo! Shoo!

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        OH FUCK ME!!!!

           Will looks on in shock. The Homeless man holding his eyes in 
           pain starts to run off.

                                 WILL
                        Whoa, wait, come back. I am so sorry. 

           Will waves cash after him, but he is gone.

                                 BRIDGET
                        Don’t waste your money, he’ll just 
                        blow it all on meth.

                                 WILL
                            (to himself)
                        God, she is my mother.
                            (looks back at her)
                        Bridget, would you like some gum?

           She nods. He pulls out a pack and as he starts in on his 
           breakup speech...

                                 WILL
                        Brig, you know those great parking spaces 
                        that are right out front of wherever you 
                        are going, that everyone wants, but never 
                        seem to be available?

           She nods as Sam and the car men come out.

                                 CAR MEN
                        That certainly was a very impressive 
                        presentation, Ms. O’Connor, we will 
                        consider what you said.

                                 SAM
                        Keep in mind if you do what we talked 
                        about, there also might be a plate of 
                        homemade cookies in it for you. And if 
                        you are really good, some cupcakes.

           They laugh and give their ticket to the valet. Will continues 
           with his speech.
                                 WILL
                        ...you are that great parking spot and I 
                        am that guy just sitting in his car 
                        adjusting the radio, looking for gum 
                        under seats hindering others from being 
                        able to enjoy that space. I am just 
                        blocking the way and forcing people to 
                        miss out and park elsewhere. People that 
                        may want to park there for the rest of 
                        their lives, but can’t because I am not 
                        moving. I don’t want to be that looking-
                        for-gum guy, it’s not fair to you or 
                        those perfect guys that are out there 
                        just circling the block just waiting to 
                        get a chance. That great space deserves 
                        better. You deserve better.

           Sam has been listening to this. The Valet comes up. Sam hands 
           him her ticket. Then she looks back at Will and Bridget. 
           Bridget is now giving him a big hug.

                                 BRIDGET
                        I am a great space. Thanks, Will, 
                        that’s the sweetest thing anyone 
                        ever has said to me.

           She kisses him on the cheek, gets in her car and leaves.

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Do all your dates end with someone getting 
                        maced and someone else getting dumped?

           Will turns and sees Sam. She is not dressed for this place. 
           She wears an old t-shirt, jeans, second hand blazer but she 
           looks comfortable and pulls it off. She looks good.

                                 WILL
                        Yes, most do. It makes them 
                        memorable.

                                 SAM
                            (laughs)
                        By the way that might be the best 
                        breakup speech I have ever heard. 
                        Bar none. I was gonna applaud, but 
                        then I thought it might not have 
                        been appropriate.

                                 WILL
                            (laughs)
                        Yeah, it might not have been. 

           The Group of car guys start to drive off in their Hummer 
           limo. They honk and all wave at Sam. She waves back.
                                 WILL
                            (re: the group of guys)
                        Were you on a date too?

                                 SAM
                        Yes, with all of them. It’s a new thing: 
                        Group Dating. I don’t have a lot of time 
                        so I just see a whole bunch of 
                        prospective suitors at once. If I like 
                        one they get a call a week later. It’s 
                        easier that way.
                            (Will laughs)
                        No, it was a business dinner.

                                 WILL
                        That’s too bad some of those guys were 
                        pretty cute. I’d go the gayway for at 
                        least one of them. Maybe two depending on 
                        how much I had to drink. 

           Sam laughs. There is an instant spark there. And they both 
           sense it. It is just the two of them at the valet stand now. 

                                 WILL
                        So, ah pretty hip restaurant?

                                 SAM
                        Yeah, really happening. Enjoy the food?

                                 WILL
                        Sure. You?

                                 SAM
                        Definitely?
                            (beat)
                        You’re still really hungry aren’t you?

                                 WILL
                        I’m fuckin starving.

                                 SAM
                        Me too.

           They laugh. And with that the valet comes up with her car. 
           They look at each other. Will doesn’t want to let her go.

                                 WILL
                        ...I never do anything this spontaneous, 
                        but I have a feeling if I don’t I am 
                        gonna regret it. So here goes: Would you 
                        like to go get some normal food... with 
                        me... right now?

           Sam looks at him. She does, but isn’t sure.
                                 WILL
                        I know, you’re worried that maybe I am 
                        a serial killer. I’m really not. I 
                        won’t be asking anyone to put the 
                        lotion in the basket nor threatening 
                        to give them the hose again if they 
                        don’t. Look at these hands, do these 
                        really look like the hands of a serial 
                        killer? -- Not that I know what the 
                        hands of a serial killer look like. In 
                        fact I am willing to bet that you 
                        could probably take me in a fight. 
                            (she laughs)
                        We could stop by a Kinkos and you could 
                        do an internet search on me if that will 
                        make you feel better.

           Sam laughs. She looks at him for a beat and then...

                                 SAM
                        Get in.

           Will gets in her car. As he does he puts out his hand.

                                 WILL
                        I’m Will by the way. Will Cox.

                                 SAM
                        Samantha O’Connor. But, everyone 
                        calls me Sam. Well, not everyone 
                        but the people I like do. 

                                 WILL
                        I’ll try to be one of those then.

           INT. GREASY SPOON DINER - NIGHT

           Will and Sam sit in a booth. A WAITRESS comes with a plate of 
           big juicy double cheeseburgers and fries. They both take a 
           huge bite and savor the taste.

                                 SAM
                        Oh, much better.

                                 WILL
                        Much. 

                                 SAM
                        I hate places like that. It’s like 
                        Emperor's New Clothes Dining. The food is 
                        overpriced, barely there and tasteless. 

                                 WILL
                        Yes! My parents used to always drag 
                        us to those places. Whatever the 
                        next big thing was we’d be there.
                                 SAM
                        And I bet none of them were nearly 
                        as good or as cheap as this.

                                 WILL
                        Never. Give me an Applebees or Mom and 
                        Pop diner any day. They know what they 
                        are doing. There is a reason there are 
                        thousands of them spread out into all 
                        corners of the country.

                                 SAM
                        I am with you. I am the same way with 
                        clothes. I know it goes against the 
                        unspoken girl code, but I think fashion 
                        is a waste of money. They hire these 
                        little sweat shop kids, jack up the 
                        profits, to give me something I don’t 
                        care about anyway. I’d rather spend my 
                        money on something else or just give it 
                        to charity. So I only buy sale stuff or 
                        from thrift stores. Someone else telling 
                        me what I should wear is overrated.

                                 WILL
                        Well, you look terrible. Really 
                        horrific.
                            (she laughs)
                        No, it works for you.

           Will looks at her, she is so different from anyone else he 
           has ever dated. But, he kinda likes it. 

                                 WILL
                        So, um, what do you do besides group 
                        date fifty year olds and pick up 
                        wayward young men at valet stands?

                                 SAM
                        I work for Al Gore.

                                 WILL
                        May or may not have invented the 
                        internet/should have been President 
                        Al Gore?

                                 SAM
                        That’s the one.

                                 WILL
                        What do you do for him, hunt down 
                        the missing chads?

                                 SAM
                        No, I think he has moved on from 
                        that and now maybe so should you.

                            (Will laughs)
                        I work for his Global Warming 
                        Initiative. So how about you? Tell 
                        me your story, Will Cox?

                                 WILL
                        I work at a bank, I am a-

                                 SAM
                            (smiles)
                        No, no, tell it like a story, like 
                        with a once a upon a time.

                                 WILL
                        Okay, um, once upon a time there was a... 
                        good-looking and intelligent and 
                        kindhearted --let’s be honest, godlike 
                        adonis of a guy-
                            (she laughs)
                        Named Will-

                                 SAM
                        Just a guy, not a King or a Prince?

                                 WILL
                        How bout a Baron -- that way I won’t be 
                        killed in a coup for the throne.

                                 SAM
                        Good call, Alright Baron Will - 
                        keep going.

                                 WILL
                        And he worked in the castle, not the 
                        main one but one of many sub castles 
                        scattered through the southland. There 
                        he decided which fiefs who you know 
                        come from fiefdom...town got to borrow 
                        and who didn’t get to borrow the King’s 
                        gold. Mostly who didn’t get to borrow. 
                        ...Oh and he rode a unicorn, a flying 
                        unicorn that also breathes fire, 
                        because that sounds really cool. He 
                        doesn’t own this flying fire-breathing 
                        unicorn but instead has a 39 month low 
                        interest lease with an option to buy.

                                 SAM
                            (laughs)
                        And how about intrigue, the women, 
                        excitement?
                                 WILL
                        I ask myself that all the time. Lord 
                        Will -- I just promoted myself to Lord 
                        by the way, you know just because, has 
                        dated many a fair maiden, none of which 
                        were half as interesting as the 
                        fetching oddly clothed maiden who is 
                        sitting before him right now. Who he 
                        would very much like to see again.

                                 SAM
                        He will. 
                            (Will smiles)
                        I don’t ever do this either, but I 
                        already put my number in your jacket 
                        pocket. 

           He checks. There it is. He looks at it.

                                 SAM
                        So if you don’t call, I will be seriously 
                        scarred, I am talking years of therapy.

                                 WILL
                        Well, I can’t let that happen.

           BEGIN MONTAGE OF SAM AND WILL HANGING OUT, DATING.

           Will all dressed up picks up Sam who as usual is all dressed 
           down and takes her to..

           IN AND OUT BURGER

           Sam sees it and laughs. They sit at a table outside that has 
           been reserved for them. There is a table cloth, candles and  
           everything. Sam laughs.

                                 SAM
                        Nice.

                                 WILL
                        I know.

           A TEENAGE WORKER who Will paid brings them menus.

           INT. MALIBU CASTLE MINI GOLF COURSE, SHERMAN OAKS - NIGHT

           Will and Sam now play mini golf. Will lines up a shot.

                                 SAM
                        Okay, favorite movie? And I mean real 
                        favorite movie not some stock answer like 
                        Citizen Kane or Casablanca.

           Will hits and then turns to her and answers.
                                 WILL
                        Teen Wolf.

                                 SAM
                        One or two?

                                 WILL
                            (as if there is no other)
                        One. Michael J Fox as a basketball 
                        playing wolf, surfing on top of vans with 
                        80’s music and hairdos, it doesn’t get 
                        much better than that. You?

           Sam now lines up her shot and answers equally as quick.

                                 SAM
                        Dirty Dancing. The first, the only. 
                        Shirtless Johnny Castle, dancing in 
                        the river. So scandalous when I was 
                        in sixth grade. I saw it 17 times. 
                        I used to practice that dance all 
                        the time. But, I could never find 
                        anyone that could do the lift.

           EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

           Will and Sam walk along the beach late at night with their 
           shoes off. Will’s jacket is around her shoulders. The 
           questions continue.

                                 SAM
                        ...Best friend in the whole world?

                                 WILL
                        Hamilton Cooper. Roommate at prep 
                        school. Current landlord and 
                        internet billionaire.

                        Nice. Jodi Jamieson. College 
                        roommate. Not the porn star.

                                 WILL
                        Is there a porn star named Jodi 
                        Jamieson?

                                 SAM
                        I don’t know, there’s gotta be, right? I 
                        am just saying that if there is my Jodi 
                        is not that person.
                            (thinks of another question)

                        Is there a lot of crime underwater that I 
                        am unaware of? And on the rare occurrence 
                        where a crime does occur underwater, 
                        can’t Superman just handle that?

           Sam laughs. She takes his hand and they keep walking.

           INT. PARK - NIGHT

           Sam and Will swing on swings, still talking.

                                 SAM
                        It’s pretty all consuming, it doesn’t 
                        leave you much time for a life, but I 
                        really believe in what we are doing. My 
                        best friend Jodi instilled this idea in 
                        me about doing more for others than 
                        myself. Jodi’s family was always really 
                        poor and yet they still gave away money 
                        and time even when they didn’t have any 
                        themselves.

                                 WILL
                        That’s really nice.

                                 SAM
                        I know. I’ve tried to follow by their 
                        example. I’ve been given so much, I just 
                        feel that it is my duty to give back. 
                        What we do with the initiative is just a 
                        little attempt at doing that.

           Will looks at her. He is so falling for her. He leans in and 
           KISSES her. They part. Will looks around at the park.

                                 WILL
                        You know I think I used to sell 
                        crack in this park.

                                 SAM
                            (smiling)
                        No, you didn’t.

                                 WILL
                        You’re right it wasn’t this park.

           Sam laughs and kisses him again. THE MONTAGE SPEEDS UP.

           -Sam takes Will thrift store shopping, getting him an outfit. 
           She is going through racks handing him clothes. Younger, 
           hipper and more comfortable things than he usually wears. 
           Will nods.

                                 WILL
                        This stuff isn’t bad.
                                 SAM
                        I know. And now you can take all the money 
                        you were going to spend on clothes and 
                        instead spend it on things you want more.

                                 WILL
                        Like hookers and blow?

                                 SAM
                        Yes, exactly. You should spend all 
                        your money on hookers and blow.

           She punches him hard in the arm. Will laughs.

           -Will, Hamilton, Sam and FRIENDS sit on the roof playing 
           Alcoholic Operation. Sam plays Hamilton. She throws back a 
           shot and with a steely eyed focus removes the spleen. She 
           wins.

                                 INTERN BOB
                        Now let’s play some strip Clue.

                                 WILL
                        We’re not playing Strip Clue with 
                        my girlfriend, Intern Bob.

                                 SAM
                        Girlfriend?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, if that’s okay.

                                 SAM
                            (thinks, likes it)
                        ...Yeah, it is.

           They smile at each other.

                                 HAMILTON
                        All right, I wanna hear more of this 
                        skinny dipping in the Amazon story, Sam.

                                 SAM
                        Right, So my best friend Jodi and I were 
                        in South America for Spring Break. Doing 
                        one of those programs where you build 
                        houses in under privileged villages. And 
                        we were doing tequila shots with the 
                        locals as we were want to do. And it was 
                        like a thousand degrees, literally like 
                        we were on the sun. Someone dared us to 
                        jump in the river. And we didn’t have our 
                        suits. So next thing you know we were all 
                        skinny dipping in the Amazon. 
           Will looks at her hanging with his friends. She fits right 
           in. It all feels so right. 

                                 SAM
                        All right enough talk, who’s next?

           Sam grabs a shot. Will steps up to play. END MONTAGE.

           INT. WILL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Will and Hamilton sit in Will’s office eating lunch.

                                 WILL
                        I asked Sam to go out of town this 
                        weekend. 

                                 HAMILTON
                        With you? Or you just wanted her gone.

                                 WILL
                        No, with me.

                                 HAMILTON
                        That’s good. And you haven’t slept 
                        together yet, right? Because I like 
                        to stay up on these things.

                                 WILL
                        No, not yet. We’re taking it slow. But, I 
                        am kinda okay with it. I don’t know, we 
                        have so much fun just talking, hanging 
                        out. It’s nice. 

                                 HAMILTON
                            (genuine)
                        That is nice. I’m happy for you, man. You 
                        are sure though that it’s not because she 
                        really has a dick or something? I am just 
                        saying she seems pretty perfect, there’s 
                        gotta be something wrong there. And I 
                        just hope that something is not that 
                        instead of lady parts down there she has 
                        a man-penis.

                                 WILL
                        She has no man-penis. We’ve at 
                        least gotten that far.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Okay, good, because I like her. If 
                        she did, I would still like her, it 
                        just might be weird for you.

           INT. GLOBAL WARMING INITIATIVE OFFICES, SANTA MONICA - DAY

           Will shows up all dressed up for their weekend away. 
                                 WILL
                        Hi, I’m here to see Samantha O’Connor.

           -A few minutes later. Sam walks out, looking great herself. 
           Will is gone. She looks around.

                                 SAM
                        Hey, have you see my friend? I got 
                        a call he was here.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        He’s in with Al.

           INT. AL GORE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Will sits with AL GORE. Yes, the Al Gore. Although if we 
           can’t get him. We’ll get Alec Baldwin to play an Al Gore 
           type. He is grilling him.

                                 AL GORE
                        Have you ever been charged and/or 
                        convicted of a state or federal crime? 
                        And keep in mind that I can verify this 
                        information rather easily.

                                 WILL
                        No. And no. 

                                 AL GORE
                        And you will be back when?

                                 WILL
                        Sunday night.

                                 AL GORE
                        Are you taking a car or flying?

                                 WILL
                        A car. Any more questions, Al Gore?

                                 AL GORE
                        That’s it...for now.

           Sam walks in. Both Will and Al stand. She kisses Will hello.

                                 SAM
                        Hope he hasn’t been grilling you too bad.

                                 WILL
                        Not too bad.

           They start to leave. Will goes to shake Al’s hand. Al pulls 
           him in.
                                 AL GORE
                        Will, I am gonna say to you what I 
                        have said to all the guys that have 
                        taken out my own daughters: while 
                        you are out this weekend just keep 
                        in mind that Dick Cheney’s not the 
                        only Vice President who knows how 
                        to shoot someone in the face.

                                 WILL
                        Okay.

                                 AL GORE
                        Have fun.

           He shakes Will’s hand. Sam turns to Al.

                                 SAM
                        David has your schedule. He is all 
                        prepped. They have my numbers if you guys 
                        need anything.
                            (then)
                        Are you sure you don’t need me this 
                        weekend? Because I don’t have to go.

                                 AL GORE
                        Yes, you do. Sam, you’re always 
                        doing so much for me and everyone 
                        else. I think the world might be 
                        okay if you do something for 
                        yourself every now and again. I’ve 
                        seen you walking around here trying 
                        to contain your smile the past few 
                        weeks. Take the weekend off. Enjoy 
                        yourself. Just don’t enjoy yourself 
                        too much, if you know what I mean.

           They laugh and leave.

           INT. WILL’S CAR - DAY

           Will and Sam drive up the coast. It’s beautiful.

                                 WILL
                        The hotel is really amazing. And I 
                        got us a reservation at this great 
                        little Italian place that Hamilton 
                        recommended. And he swears the food 
                        is actually good and plentiful. 

           Sam looks off to the side of the road. She sees people going 
           down the river in inner tubes.

                                 SAM
                        Wait, turn here.
           Will does.

                                 WILL
                        What?

                                 SAM
                        There were people going down the river 
                        in inner tubes. Here in California. 
                        Who knew you could do that here. We 
                        used to do that all the time when I 
                        was little in Kentucky.

                                 WILL
                        You wanna do this now?
                            (looks at his watch)
                        We have reservations...

                                 SAM
                        What happened to that spontaneous guy who 
                        asked me out at a valet stand?

                                 WILL
                        I did explain at the time that I 
                        don’t usually do stuff like that.

                                 SAM
                        Every once and while, Will, you 
                        just gotta say fuck it and take a 
                        chance. That’s what I did when I 
                        said yes to you that night.

           Will looks at her. He takes the plunge.

           INT. CAMPSITE - DAY

           They pull into the campsite. 

           -Sam buys them bathing suits from the only store around: the 
           local Mini Mart.

           -Sam and Will come out of the bathroom having changed. Sam is 
           dressed in an Old Lady suit with the little skirts. Will 
           comes out in a Spiderman bathing suit made for a fourteen 
           year old. It’s very tight. He looks really uncomfortable.

                                 SAM
                        If you don’t have fun, you can sue 
                        me. You can literally hire a lawyer 
                        and sue me.

                                 WILL
                        I will hold you to that.

           She takes his hand and they go rent inner tubes.

           -They climb into the river. Will is still skeptical.
                                 WILL
                        I wasn’t really a big outdoors guy 
                        as a kid. We were more of an 
                        indoors family. They don’t have 
                        Malaria in rivers here do they?

           Sam pushes him in. He jumps up, smiling.

                                 WILL
                        That was unnecessary.

           She laughs. He then grabs her and pulls her in. She screams, 
           laughing.

           -They float down the river in the tubes.

                                 WILL
                        This isn’t the river they shot 
                        Deliverance in, is it? These Hills 
                        don’t have eyes do they?

           Sam laughs. She takes his hand. They float down the river. It 
           is really pretty. Will is starting to relax and let go.

           They pass PEOPLE sitting in chairs in the water enjoying 
           drinks, life. COUPLES sit on blankets along the river.

           -Sam has her head back basking in the sun. Will looks over at 
           her. She is beautiful. She catches him looking at her.

                                 SAM
                        What are you thinking?

                                 WILL
                        I was just thinking that you even make 
                        that old granny bathing suit look good. 
                        And was just wondering how someone as 
                        great as you is still single.

                                 SAM
                        I guess, I have a hard time making time 
                        just for myself. But, I am trying to get 
                        better about it. And also I have been 
                        burned a lot in the past. That’s why I 
                        want to take it slow with the sex stuff.

                                 WILL
                        Who said I wanted to have sex with you?

           They both smile.

                                 SAM
                        Everything has been going so well, I just 
                        don’t want to rush things and ruin it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SAM (cont'd)
                        A lot of the guys I have dated have not 
                        ended up being what I first thought they 
                        were. It’s made me a little more gun-shy.

                                 WILL
                        I’m not like that.

                                 SAM
                            (likes it)
                        I know.

           She takes his hand and they keep floating down the river.

           -As the sun sets they walk back to the car with their tubes. 
           They change into their clothes. As they come out near the 
           parking lot they see a DIVE BAR, that seems to be hopping.

                                 WILL
                        We’re going there aren’t we?

           Sam nods and smiles.

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           They walk in. A slow song plays on the jukebox. Will looks at 
           Sam.

                                 WILL
                        Do you wanna dance?

           Will and Sam slow dance out on the floor. They look into each 
           other’s eyes and smile. It’s been a perfect day.

                                 SAM
                        So, how about you, Will Cox? Why 
                        are you still single?

                                 WILL
                        Because maybe I was waiting for you?

           She smiles. Then Will is self-conscious.

                                 WILL
                        Too cheesy?

                                 SAM
                            (touched)
                        No, just the correct amount of cheese.

           She puts her head on his shoulder. They keep dancing.

           -They dance the whole night together. The whole place is 
           jumping thrashing around. And we see them just slow dancing 
           in the midst of it. This is the moment when most romantic 
           comedies might end.... However not this one.
           INT. WILL’S CAR - DAY

           Will and Sam drive home. They had a great weekend. Sam holds 
           Will’s hand as he drives. Sam checks her messages.

                                 SAM
                        Oh, my god. Jodi’s back from 
                        Africa. What are you doing tonight?

                                 WILL
                        Hanging out with you and Jodi?

                                 SAM
                        You bet you are. I can’t wait for 
                        you two to meet. You’re going to 
                        love each other.

           She squeezes his hand and smiles.

           INT. WILL’S APT - NIGHT

           Will is getting ready. Hamilton is playing Halo 2 online on 
           Will’s couch. Will’s phone rings. It is Sam. He smiles.

                                 WILL
                        Oh, hey Sam, I just finished 
                        putting the blow on the tranny 
                        hooker’s ass, do you mind if I call 
                        you back when we’re done? We’re 
                        kinda on the clock here.

                                 SAM
                        That’s fine. Hey, work is kinda crazy. Is 
                        there anyway you can pick Jodi up from my 
                        place and meet me at the bar?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, I think I can do that.

                                 SAM
                        Say hi to the hooker for me. And I 
                        am really excited about tonight.

                                 WILL
                        Me too and will do. Tranny Hooker, 
                        Sam says “hi.”

           Sam laughs and hangs up. Will smiles and does too. Hamilton 
           looks at him.

                                 HAMILTON
                        I wanna date a girl I can joke about 
                        tranny hookers with. If you break up, can 
                        I have her? I have a lot of money you 
                        know, so she’ll be well taken care of.
                                 WILL
                        No, I think I am gonna try to keep 
                        this one.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Good choice. Break a leg, tonight. Win 
                        over the best friend, win over the girl.

           INT. FLOWER SHOP - NIGHT

           Will picks out a beautiful bouquet of flowers for Jodi.

           EXT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Will walks up to the door holding flowers. He rings the bell.

                                 SOFT VOICE (O.S.)
                        Just a second.

                                 WILL
                            (practicing)
                        I’ve heard so much about you. 
                        What’s Africa like? You look really 
                        nice tonight.

           The door opens. The record screeches. Standing there half 
           naked is a MUSCULAR GUY. (SEANN WILLIAM SCOTT) He is dripping 
           wet and wearing nothing but a towel. Will looks confused.

                                 WILL
                        I’m sorry, I am looking for Jodi.

                                 JODI
                            (with a huge grin)
                        I’m Jodi.

           Will just stands there speechless.

                                 JODI
                        And you must be Will.
                            (sees the flowers)
                        Are those for me?
                            (Will nods)
                        Don’t make it weird, man. I love roses.

           Jodi takes the flowers.

                                 JODI
                        They’re beautiful, thank you.

           Jodi then gives Will a big hug.

                                 WILL
                        You’re...welcome.

           Jodi pulls back leaving a huge wet spot on Will’s shirt.
                                 JODI
                        Oh, look, I’m sorry. Here.

           Jodi pulls his towel off and hands it to Will. Will quickly 
           averts his eyes from the completely naked Jodi.

                                 JODI
                        Don’t worry, I’ll get another one. Come 
                        on in. Give me two minutes and two 
                        seconds Chuck Wollery style and then 
                        let’s go have fun with our girl.

           Will comes in. Jodi walks around naked looking for another 
           towel. He doesn’t find one and then seems to give up. Will is 
           still a little in shock and way uncomfortable.

                                 JODI
                        So, you are the famous Will. I have 
                        heard so much about you.

                                 WILL
                        I’ve heard a lot about you too. Not 
                        enough, but a lot.

           Will is trying not to look at naked Jodi. Jodi notices.

                                 JODI
                        I’m sorry am I making you uncomfortable? 

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, no, not at all. 

                                 JODI
                        Good, because I wouldn’t want to 
                        make you uncomfortable.

           Will smiles. Jodi is then naked the whole conversation.

                                 JODI
                            (laughs)
                        Why would you be, right? We’re both guys 
                        here. I don’t have anything you don’t 
                        have, or at least I hope I don’t.

           Jodi laughs and looks down at his buff body. Will laughs too 
           awkwardly.

                                 WILL
                        We are both guys.

           Will and naked Jodi keep sitting there. 

           INT. WILL’S CAR - NIGHT

           Will drives with a now dressed Jodi sitting next to him. Will 
           is trying to get over the initial shock.
                                 WILL
                        So you and Sam were college roommates?

                                 JODI
                        Crazy isn’t it? I guess because of 
                        my name someone in housing assumed 
                        I was a girl and put Sam and I 
                        together.

                                 WILL
                        Huh, wow, who would assume that?

                                 JODI
                        I know. It’s a family name. Happens all 
                        the time. But, we just instantly clicked 
                        and we were young so we just let it be. I 
                        was living with a hot girl, I wasn’t 
                        going to say anything. We were just two 
                        crazy kids who liked to fuck.

           Will almost drives off the road.

                                 WILL
                        Liked to um, fuck other people or 
                        each other?

                                 JODI
                        Each other. Sam didn’t tell you we 
                        used to date?

                                 WILL
                        Ah, no, no she didn’t.

                                 JODI
                        It was so long ago. It was more of a 
                        fling anyway. Two young kids, virgins, 
                        finding themselves, experimenting. 
                        Figuring things out. Like if you take a 
                        horse stud pill can you have sex for 
                        twenty four hours straight? The answer is 
                        yes, yes, you can.

                                 WILL
                        How, um, how long was the “fling?”

                                 JODI
                        Just a year. But that’s ancient history. 
                        It didn’t work out, but she’s been my 
                        best friend ever since.

           Jodi sees that Will is uncomfortable.

                                 JODI
                        I’m sorry, I am doing it again. I am 
                        making you uncomfortable aren’t I?
                                 WILL
                        No, not at all.

                                 JODI
                        Sam always tells me I have no filter. But 
                        I just like to lay it all out there. So 
                        things aren’t weird later. I am just so 
                        happy to meet you.

                                 WILL
                        Me too.

                                 JODI
                        We’re gonna be good friends I can 
                        tell. Future BFFs right here.

                                 WILL
                        Any friend of Sam’s is a friend of mine.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Will and Jodi walk into the bar. Will holds the flowers he 
           got for Sam. Sam sees them and runs over all excited. She 
           goes to Jodi. Giving him a big hug.

                        CLICK CLUNK CLONK CLICK CLICK.

           Will just looks at them not knowing what is going on. They 
           keep going. Clicking like wildfire back and forth.

                                 WILL
                        Is that um, the clicking language?

                                 SAM
                        Yeah. Swahili. 
                            (turns to Will)
                        Hey.

           She now kisses Will hello.

                                 WILL
                        Do they have like tapes of the clicking 
                        language for the car that I don’t know 
                        about? Because I would get them.

                                 SAM
                        At Brown we had a foreign language 
                        requirement. We thought it would be 
                        funny to learn the clicking language 
                        instead of French or Spanish. So we 
                        did a little research and found out 
                        it was Swahili. 
                                 JODI
                        And then I convinced the Dean that it 
                        was racist and Anglocentric elitist 
                        that they only offered Anglo European 
                        white man languages, so they started 
                        a class. It’s still there.

                                 SAM
                        It was awesome. It became our 
                        secret language.

                                 JODI
                        And speaking of our secret language.

           Jodi takes out a NECKLACE and gives it to her.

                            (aside to Will)

                                 SAM
                        Oh, it’s beautiful, thank you.

           Will just smiles. Jodi turns back to Sam. He puts it on her.

                        panther into submission.

                                 SAM
                            (marveling at it)
                        That’s so sweet.

                                 JODI
                        But, look Will got you some flowers 
                        from the flower store. Roses!

           Sam sees the flowers.

                                 SAM
                        They’re gorgeous. Thank you!

           She gives Will a hug too. Then pulls Jodi into it.

                                 SAM
                        My two favorite guys in the same place. I 
                        am soo excited.

           They go to sit down.

           INT. BAR - LATER

           Will, Jodi, with Sam in the middle sit at a booth. A bunch of 
           drinks before them.
                                 SAM
                        I am so glad you are back. How was 
                        your trip?

                                 JODI
                        Amazing.

                                 WILL
                        So, what were you doing in Africa, 
                        Jodi?

                                 JODI
                        A few things. Work, pleasure.

                                 SAM
                        Jodi is an exotic animal trainer.

                                 JODI
                        That is one of the things I do.

                                 SAM
                        He’s just being modest. You know 
                        that scene in Gladiator where the 
                        tiger attacks Russel Crowe?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah.

                                 SAM
                        That was Jodi.

                                 WILL
                        No, way. Wow. Really?

                                 JODI
                        Oh, yeah, Crowe’s Nest, that’s what 
                        I call him, Crowe’s Nest, he loves 
                        it. He was such a puss around that 
                        little kitty cat. Even though he is 
                        probably one of the manliest, 
                        toughest guys I have ever met. Top 
                        3, definitely, he didn’t want 
                        anything to do with Patrick Swayze.

                                 WILL
                            (makes a face)
                        Patrick Swayze?

                                 JODI
                        That’s the name of the tiger: 
                        Patrick Swayze. Because they have 
                        the same haircut and are equally as 
                        cool. Anyway, I said: “Crowe’s 
                        Nest, pull your panties out of your 
                        mangina and go pet Patrick Swayze.” 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JODI (cont'd)
                        I even went over and stuck my head 
                        in Patrick Swayze’s mouth just to 
                        show him it wasn’t bad.

                                 WILL
                        Wow.

                                 JODI
                        Yeah, but he still wanted nothing to 
                        do with that Swayze Cat, so I did the 
                        scene. You see before I worked with 
                        dangerous animals I was a stuntman. 
                        Used to dive out of buildings, off 
                        bridges, roll cars, that sort of 
                        thing. But it started to get boring. 
                        There is so much I want to do in this 
                        life, I don’t want to limit it to 
                        just one thing.

                                 WILL
                        And what was the pleasure part of 
                        your trip?

                                 JODI
                        Building schools with Oprah.

           Will nods. Jodi turns to Sam.

                                 JODI
                        Oh, I started a new foundation. 
                        You’re gonna love it. It’s called 
                        TWO THINGS...
                            (then realizes)
                        But, I am sorry, where are my manners, 
                        talking all about myself. Tell me about 
                        you, Will Cox? What do you do?

           Jodi turns and puts all his focus on Will.

                                 WILL
                        I...ah, I work at a bank.

                                 JODI
                        Oh.

                                 WILL
                        I’m a loan officer.

                                 JODI
                        See? Now that is a great job. I think 
                        what a person does says so much about 
                        them. You help give people money so they 
                        can pursue their dreams. That’s so 
                        wonderful. You’re the dream delivery guy.

           Will is uncomfortable.
                                 WILL
                        Actually, I’m in charge of denying 
                        loans.

                                 JODI
                        Oh, so you’re the dream killer guy?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah. Yeah. I guess I am.

           Sam looks at him and smiles supportively.

                                 JODI
                        You know what, though, people need dream 
                        killers so they can find other dreams. 
                        Not everyone can have their first dreams 
                        come true. That’s why we dream every 
                        night so we can come up with new dreams. 
                        Otherwise the good lord above would just 
                        have us dream once when we are children 
                        and then shut down the whole dream thing. 
                        But, that is not how it works. When one 
                        door closes, another door opens right? 

                                 WILL
                        I guess so.

                                 JODI
                        You’re like the Other Door Opener 
                        Guy? That is an important job, 
                        Will. So who needs more drinks?

           They all nod. Jodi smiles and heads off to the bar. Will now 
           feels like such an asshole.

                                 SAM
                        So what do you think? He’s pretty 
                        great, huh?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, he seems like a really cool 
                        guy. Guy being the key word. How 
                        come you didn’t tell me your best 
                        friend Jodi was a guy?

                                 SAM
                        I thought I did.

                                 WILL
                        Probably would have remembered that.

                                 SAM
                        I’m sorry. I thought I had.

                                 WILL
                        And you guys used to date?
                                 SAM
                        Yeah, for like two seconds.

                                 WILL
                        Or a year.

                                 SAM
                        Yeah. But god you know how long ago 
                        that was? We’ve been friends for so 
                        long since. I forget that we were 
                        ever anything more honestly. 
                            (then)
                        This isn’t gonna be a problem is it?

                                 WILL
                        No. Of course not. It just would 
                        have been nice to know. I was a 
                        little thrown. Him talking about 
                        horse stud pills.

                                 SAM
                        He told you about that?
                            (laughs, embarrassed)
                        He has no filter. I am always saying 
                        that to him.

                                 WILL
                        He mentioned that too.

                                 SAM
                        It such a small thing. Honestly, Will. 
                        It was college. And he was insanely 
                        jealous. I couldn’t even have guy 
                        friends. So I broke it off with him.

                                 WILL
                        Oh.

                                 SAM
                        We stayed friends. And we’re so much 
                        better as just friends. He’s really a 
                        wonderful guy when you get to know him 
                        and means so much to me. And so do you. 
                        It would just mean so much to me if you 
                        guys got along. 

                                 WILL
                        Me too.

                                 SAM
                        You’re not the jealous type are you?

           She starts playfully poking him. Will smiles.
                                 WILL
                        Totally, I will kill other guys who 
                        look at you. I have a crossbow in 
                        my trunk for just that occasion. 
                        They’ve got these poison tipped 
                        arrows. There’s no one looking at 
                        you right now is there?

           Will looks around all threatening like. Sam laughs.

                                 WILL
                        Because I’ll go get it.

           She laughs again and starts to kiss him. When Jodi comes back 
           with drinks. He seems very excited.

                                 JODI
                        Guess what?

                                 SAM
                        What?

                                 JODI
                        Guess what this bar has?

                                 WILL
                        Drinks? Occasional appetizers?

                                 JODI
                        Yes, but also...Karaoke.
                            (then)
                        KARAOKE!!!

           Sam claps excited. She turns to Will.

                                 SAM
                        We love karaoke!!!!

           We can tell from Will’s look, he doesn’t.

                                 JODI
                        They are just about to start. And 
                        just to be polite to the new guy, 
                        Will’s going first. I already 
                        signed you up pal.

                                 WILL
                        No, that’s-

           A FEMALE EMCEE stands on the stage.

                                 EMCEE
                        And our first singer tonight is Big 
                        Willy Cox. Come on up, Will. 
           People start to CLAP. Sam pushes him up. Jodi then stands and 
           drags a hesitant Will up there.

                                 WILL
                        No, really, I have a note from my 
                        doctor. I’m not-

           Jodi pushed him onstage and speaks into the mike.

                                 JODI
                        You’re gonna love this guy. I do. 
                        NOW BLOW THE CEILING OFF THIS 
                        MOTHER, WILL!!!

           The crowd cheers. The music starts. Will looks over at Sam, 
           she smiles at him. He smiles back. Will grabs the mike then 
           looks at the screen. It’s JAY-Z’s 99 Problems. Will looks at 
           the lyrics. Yeah, this isn’t gonna go well. He starts.

                                 WILL
                        If you are having girl problems I feel 
                        bad for...you...son, because I got 99 
                        problems but a bitch aint one.
                            (really awkward)
                        ...Kick it.

           It’s all pretty awkward. Will tries to give the mike back to 
           Jodi. Jodi pushes him back up.

                                 JODI
                        You’re doing great buddy, rock on.

                                 WILL
                            (starts again)
                        Now once upon a time, not too long 
                        ago. A...nigga like myself had to 
                        strong arm a ho...

           Will looks over at an AFRICAN AMERICAN COUPLE in the corner. 
           They just stare death at him. Will is now even more nervous.

                                 WILL
                        That is, um, not a ho in the sense 
                        of having a pussy, but a pussy 
                        havin no god damn sense...

           It’s like horrible spoken word poetry. Sam’s smile is getting 
           more forced. Jodi flashes him a thumbs up. A GROUP of WOMEN 
           look like they want to kill him.

           -TIME CUT to the end of the song. Sweat drips off Will. We 
           can see the sweat patches under his arms. The whole crowd 
           just stares at him in disbelief. It’s like it will never end.
                                 WILL
                        Back through the system with the riff 
                        raff again. Paparatzi's with they cameras 
                        snappin them. D.A. tried to give the 
                        nigga shaft again. 

           The African American couple just looks at him and shakes 
           their heads.

                                 WILL
                        Half-a-mil for bail cause I'm... African. 
                            (sighs)
                        I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't 
                        one. Hit me. 
                            (the music stops but the 
                             lyrics continue)
                        You're crazy for this one, Rick. 
                        It's your boy.

           Smattering of polite applause. The Emcee comes up.

                                 EMCEE
                        Big Willy...

           But she’s got nothing. Will goes to sit down.

                                 WILL
                        I don’t really know that song that well.

           Sam kisses him on the cheek.

                                 SAM
                        You did great.

                                 JODI
                        Jay Z is hard to do, but I think you-

                                 EMCEE
                        Next up we have Jodi.

           Jodi is off. He runs up to the stage. He grabs the mike, 
           opens his mouth and a beautiful singing voice emerges.

                                 JODI
                        It's a little bit funn-ee this feeling 
                        insiiiide. I'm not one of those who can 
                        easily hide. I don't have much money but 
                        boy if I did I'd buy a big house where we 
                        both could live...

           If Will was awkward, Jodi is the opposite. He is totally 
           comfortable up there and he sounds awesome. He looks right at 
           Sam as he sings. It keeps building and building.
                                 JODI
                        If I was a sculptor, but then again, no. 
                        Or a man who makes potions in a 
                        travelling show I know it's not much but 
                        it's the best I can do. My gift is my 
                        song and this one's for you!
                            (now with a mean falcetto)
                        I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND. I HOPE YOU DON'T 
                        MIND THAT I PUT DOWN IN WORDS. HOW 
                        WONDERFUL LIFE IS WHILE YOU'RE IN THE 
                        WORLD.

           Jodi motions to the DJ and he starts to scratch. Jodi now 
           breaks it down. Will looks around: what is going on? Jodi 
           starts to B-box like that guy on American Idol and make the 
           song his own. 

                                 JODI
                        I sat on the roof and kicked off 
                        the moss.
                            (the place CHEERS)
                        Well, a few of the verses well they've 
                        got me quite cross.

           Jodi starts dancing around. The place claps along.

                                 JODI
                        So excuse me forgetting but these things 
                        I do. You see I've forgotten if they're 
                        green or they're blue.

           The music stops, it’s just Jodi accapella. He looks at Sam.

                                 JODI
                        Anyway the thing is, what I really mean, 
                        Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen.

           He holds that last note for a really long time. He seems to 
           have tears in his eyes. The whole place stands and cheers. 
           Will just sits there.

                                 GUY IN THE CROWD
                        AGAIN. DO ANOTHER.

           -By popular demand. Jodi is singing another song. It sounds 
           familiar. Will is trying to place it.

                                 JODI
                        “...Give you everything you need to live 
                        inside a twisted cage. Sleep beside an 
                        empty rage. I had a dream I was your 
                        hero. DAMN, I WISH I WAS YOUR LOVER!

           There it is. Will looks at Sam. She watches Jodi smiling. 
                                 JODI (CONT’D)
                        I'd rock you till the daylight comes. I 
                        am everything. Not like that guy. Out of 
                        all the men in the world you choose him. 
                        I can’t believe you are with that guy,  
                        all boring stories and tiny erectile 
                        disfunction diseased dick, baby crying, 
                        what a prick. He makes me want to kill 
                        myself.”

           Will makes a face.

                                 WILL
                        Are those the words?

           Will tries to look at the screen. No one else seems to 
           notice.

                                 JODI
                        “Tonight I'll be your mother. I will
                        do such things to ease your pain
                        Free your mind and you won't feel 
                        ashamed. Fill you up like I did in 
                        Nantucket. Give you something sweet each 
                        time you come inside my jungle book like 
                        when we skinny dipped in the Amazon.”

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, I really don’t think those 
                        are the lyrics.

           The people next to Will SHUSH him. Jodi then gestures for Sam 
           to join him on stage. She points to herself like they have a 
           routine. He nods and she runs up there as the song goes back 
           to refrain.

                                 JODI AND SAM
                        “Damn, I wish I was your lover. I’ll rock 
                        you til the daylight comes. Make sure you 
                        are smiling and warm. I am everything.”

           They finish. Everyone applauds. Will grabs a book of songs 
           and starts looking through it. It’s on.

           -Now Will is back on stage. He is singing Missy “Misdemeanor” 
           Elliot’s “Work it.” Although we get the feeling this wasn’t 
           the song he meant to sing.

                                 WILL
                        “...Let me know when you are coming 
                        over so I shave my cha-cha.
                            (like he wants to die)
                         Ratatattatattata.”

           Will again goes to sit down. 
                                 WILL
                        That wasn’t the song I picked.

           Sam just pats him on the back.

           -Jodi is back. He is singing an Andrea Bochelli song with his 
           eyes closed in beautiful perfectly pitched Italian. 

                                 JODI
                        “AMAPOLA, LINDISIMA AMAPOLA, SERÁ SIEMPRE 
                        MI ALMA TUYA SOLA. YO TE QUIERO, AMADA 
                        NIÑA MIA, IQUAL QUE AMA LA FLOR LA LUZ 
                        DEL DÍA. AMAPOLA, LINDISIMA AMAPOLA,
                        NO SEAS TAN INGRATE Y ÁMAME.”

           (TRANSLATION: Poppy, pretty little poppy. My soul will always 
           be only yours. I love you, my dear girl, As the flower loves 
           day's light. Poppy, pretty little poppy, Don't be so hard and 
           love me.)

           Everyone but Will seems enraptured. Will looks around even 
           the African American Couple has tears in their eyes.

           Will grabs the book and feverishly looks for a good song to 
           sing to Sam. He looks at Sam. He looks in her beautiful brown 
           eyes. She smiles at him. He gets an idea. He looks it up.

           Will smiles. He writes “Brown Eyed Girl” on the paper and 
           goes up to the DJ. He hands him the paper and five dollars.

                                 WILL
                        Just to make sure it’s the right 
                        song this time.

           The DJ smiles and plugs it in. He hands the emcee the paper. 
           She looks at it, sees Will’s name and makes a face.

                                 EMCEE
                        All right, once again we have... Will.

           Smattering of applause as Will goes back to the stage. He 
           looks straight at Sam.

                                 WILL
                        Sam, this goes out to you. 

           The music starts to play. Will takes a deep breath. He looks 
           up at the screen. The words start to scroll: BALLS IN YOUR 
           MOUTH. BALLS IN YOUR MOUTH. I’M GONNA PUT MY BALLS IN YOUR 
           MOUTH. Will just stares at them. He is pretty sure this isn’t 
           Brown Eyed Girl. (Rather its Kid Rock’s Balls in your Mouth.)

           Everyone including Sam is waiting. Will just stands there 
           speechless not singing. People start to BOO. Will looks over 
           at the DJ. He motions for him to sing.
                                 GUY IN THE CROWD
                        SING!!!!

                                 ANOTHER PERSON
                        Boo!!!

                                 ANOTHER GUY 
                        Pussy!!!

           Will looks at Sam. She motions: go ahead. He takes a deep 
           breath and does.

                                 WILL
                        Cruisin' thru town in my jacked up truck 
                        eyes open cuz I'm scopin' for a big butt 
                        slut. One that I can take back to my 
                        house, drop my drawers, and
                            (wait for it)
                        put my balls in her mouth.

           Sam’s jaw drops. This is the song he was gonna sing to her. 
           Everyone else watches on in shock.

                                 WILL
                        Balls in your mouth, balls in your mouth. 
                        I’m gonna put my balls in your mouth.

           Sam looks at Jodi. He just shrugs and smiles at her. Will 
           keeps going. To call it a trainwreck is to insult 
           trainwrecks.

                                 WILL
                        Then she put a finger right between my 
                        booty crack. So I grabbed her wrist quick 
                        and said: “Hold up slut, um,  ain't 
                        nobody stickin mothin in my butt!"

           Everyone is horrified. Sam looks to Jodi. Will is dying up 
           there. All of a sudden, Jodi jumps up. He runs up on stage 
           and starts singing with Will.

                                 JODI AND WILL
                        BALLS IN YOUR MOUTH. I’M GONNA PUT 
                        MY BALLS IN YOUR MOUTH.

           Jodi takes off singing. Somehow when he does it, it works.

                                 JODI
                        Well, blow me up and then blow me down 
                        cuz I think I just found the biggest 
                        freak in town.
                            (the crowd cheers)
                        I can't wait to get her back to my house, 
                        set her down on her knees and put my 
                        balls in her mouth. Balls in her mouth.
           The audience laughs. Jodi sells it. He throws his arm around 
           Will and starts singing the whole thing with him.

                                 JODI AND WILL
                        BALLS IN YOUR MOUTH, BALLS IN YOUR MOUTH.

           The audience cheers him on. Will looks out in the crowd. Sam 
           mouthes: Thank you to Jodi.

           -WE CUT BACK and Jodi has the whole place now singing.

                                 JODI
                        I SAID, HOLD UP SLUT...

           Jodi points his ear and the mike to the crowd.

                                 CROWD
                        AINT’ NOBODY STICKING NOTHING UP MY BUTT!

                                 JODI
                        Everybody now!!!

                                 JODI AND THE WHOLE PLACE
                        BALLS IN YOUR MOUTH. BALLS IN YOUR MOUTH. 
                        I WANNA PUT MY BALLS IN YOUR MOUTH.

           The Kid Rock songs ends and the whole place APPLAUDS. Will 
           and Jodi walk off stage. People in the crowd bump fists with 
           Jodi. WOMEN give him their number. He is the life of the 
           party. Will tries to bump fists with the African American 
           couple they just shake their heads at him.

                                 SAM
                        That was awesome. Way to save the 
                        day, Jo.

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, ah, thanks Jodi.

                                 JODI
                        That’s what new best friends are 
                        for, Will. I’ll go get the tab.

           He leaves Sam and Will alone.

                                 SAM
                        So that was an interesting song to 
                        dedicate to me.

                                 WILL
                        I didn’t pick that song.

                                 SAM
                        If you didn’t pick it, who did?

           Jodi walks back up. Will looks at him and wonders.
                                 WILL
                        Do you wanna stay over tonight?

                                 SAM
                        I’m kinda tired and it’s Jodi’s 
                        first night in town. I’m gonna take 
                        a raincheck.

           She kisses him goodbye.

                                 SAM
                        Thanks for tonight though.

           Jodi hugs Will as well.

                                 JODI
                        Yeah, thanks for tonight, Will.

           He hugs him a little too tight. Will nods: yeah. He watches 
           them leave together.

           EXT. BUSHWOOD COUNTRY CLUB - THE NEXT NIGHT

           Hamilton and Will drive in Hamilton’s car to play some night 
           golf.

                                 HAMILTON
                        All right so tell me about your 
                        night out with the best friend.

                                 WILL
                        It was... interesting.

                                 HAMILTON
                        That doesn’t sound good.

           They reach the GUARD GATE. A Guard leans in.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Hi, we’re here to play some night golf.

                                 GUARD
                        The course is only open during the day.

                                 HAMILTON
                        I know, but you can’t play night 
                        golf during the day, because you 
                        know it’s not night.

           The Guards just stare at him confused.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Cash or prizes, gentlemen?

           Hamilton pops his trunk. The Guards look inside. Inside there 
           are ipods, Xboxes. DVDs. Will turns to Hamilton, smiling.
                                 WILL
                        It’s fun living your life isn’t it?

                                 HAMILTON
                        Yes, it is, Will.

                                 WILL
                        And thank you for letting me be a 
                        part of it.

                                 HAMILTON
                        You’re welcome.

           The gate opens.

           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jodi sits on the couch. Sam walks in in sweats. She hands 
           Jodi a beer.

                                 JODI
                        Thanks for letting me stay here Sam-bear. 
                        I didn’t think I was coming back this 
                        soon and I wanted to give Paulo time to 
                        find a new sublet.

                                 SAM
                        Please. You are welcome here as long as 
                        you want. It’s nice to have you.

           Jodi smiles at her. They toast.

                                 SAM
                        Soooo, Will... what did you think?

                                 JODI
                        I think he is a drunk and a liar. 
                        And probably has venereal diseases, 
                        plural. I can’t be sure, but I 
                        thought I saw some medieval whore 
                        sores on his mouth.

                                 SAM
                            (laughs)
                        No, really what did you think?

                                 JODI
                        Honestly?
                            (Sam nods, beat)
                        ...I LOVED HIM!

                                 SAM
                        Really? I’m so glad. I kinda like this 
                        one, Jo. I think I really like him. I 
                        haven’t felt this way before.
                                 JODI
                        He just seemed like a really good 
                        guy to me. Comfortable in his own 
                        skin. Good listener, caring, yet 
                        fun. If I was a girl...

                                 SAM
                        I know. I’m just worried maybe he’s 
                        a little too good to be true. I 
                        don’t want him to turn out like 
                        those other guys. I can’t stand to 
                        go through that again.

                                 JODI
                            (reassuring)
                        You won’t. I have a really good 
                        feeling about Will. I don’t think 
                        he’d gonna let you down.

                                 SAM
                        I hope.

                                 JODI
                        I know. 
                            (beat, then...)
                        That song he chose was a little weird.

                                 SAM
                            (makes a face)
                        I know.

           Jodi quickly brushes it off and moves on.

                                 JODI
                        Guess what I rented?

           He hands her a bag. She opens it. It’s the Goonies. She is 
           excited. She points to Jodi all serious like.

                                 SAM
                        Okay, but before we watch it, you 
                        need to do it!
                            (Jodi feigns like he 
                             doesn’t want to)
                        Do it! Do the Truffle Shuffle.

           Jodi stands up on the table, pulls his shirt up and does the 
           truffle shuffle like in the movie. Sam laughs really hard. 
           Jodi gets down and points to her.

                                 JODI
                        Your turn.

           Sam makes a face stands on the table and does it herself. 
           Jodi claps. She bows and they clink beers.
                                 SAM
                        Goonies and beer. Just like college.

                                 JODI
                        Always.

           They put their feet up and watch the movie.

           INT. GUARD SHACK - LATER

           One Guard listens to his new IPOD, another plays his new XBOX 
           on the security TV.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - NIGHT

           Out on the course, Will and Hamilton play night golf with 
           glow in the dark balls. Will hits.

                                 HAMILTON
                        So the best friend is the one who has the 
                        man-penis. Really puts a whole new spin 
                        on all those skinny dipping stories.

                                 WILL
                        I know. But, she says they’re just 
                        friends.

                                 HAMILTON
                        I am sure they are. If she wanted to date 
                        him she would. But, that doesn’t mean 
                        that he doesn’t want to date her. 

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, I wondered about that. I mean he 
                        was really nice. But little things-

                                 HAMILTON
                        Like the nakedness and the singing “Damn, 
                        I Wish I was Your Lover” to her and 
                        Italian love songs in Italian, yeah those 
                        sound pretty little.

                                 WILL
                        She thought it was funny. They have 
                        been friends for a long time.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Sounds to me like he was cockblocking you 
                        pretty hardcore all night.

                                 WILL
                        What?

                                 HAMILTON
                        Cockblocking you, blocking your 
                        cock from reaching her ladyparts. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HAMILTON (cont'd)
                        They’re are these guys that I play 
                        online Halo with. They do this.

                                 WILL
                        This is a thing?

                                 HAMILTON
                        Apparently. You should meet them. 
                        It’s all girls they like or sisters 
                        they wanna keep guys from. They 
                        work very hard to cock block guys 
                        away from these women.

                                 WILL
                        That sounds really weird.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Yeah. But, if you wanna talk to 
                        them let me know.

           Hamilton hits his glow in the dark ball into the trees. He is 
           never seeing that thing again. He drops another one and hits 
           again.

                                 WILL
                        Maybe I was just imagining it. I 
                        trust Sam.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Yeah, but can you trust this guy?

           Will wonders.

           INT. SAM’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Sam is in her office on the phone.

                                 SAM
                        I am glad we agree that we are both 
                        fans of the polar ice caps. And 
                        don’t want Arizona to become beach 
                        front property. 

           Will knocks on the door. Sam smiles and motions for him to 
           come in.

                                 SAM
                        Well, we do but not at the expense of 
                        California. Great. The Vice President 
                        will be very pleased and looks forward 
                        to seeing you at the Earth Day fund-
                        raiser in a few weeks.

           She hangs up. She kisses Will hello.

                                 WILL
                        Ready?
                                 SAM
                        Yes, oh if you don’t mind Jodi 
                        wanted us to stop by and check out 
                        his new foundation first.

                                 WILL
                            (fake smile)
                        No. Great.

                                 SAM
                        He won’t tell me what it is, says he 
                        wants to show us. It will just be real 
                        quick and then we’ll go to dinner.

           INT. WILL’S CAR - NIGHT

           Will and Sam drive.

                                 WILL
                        ...So ah the other night, did you think 
                        it was weird at all that Jodi was singing 
                        you all those love songs?

                                 SAM
                        Will, you sang me a song about 
                        putting your balls in my mouth.

                                 WILL
                        I keep telling you that is not the 
                        song I picked. And they weren’t my 
                        balls. It was a lovely story about 
                        Kid Rock’s balls and all the mouthes 
                        they have...I’m gonna stop talking.

                                 SAM
                        Good plan.

                                 WILL
                        ...I’m just wondering if you think that 
                        maybe Jodi still has feelings for you?

                                 SAM
                        He has a girlfriend, Will.

                                 WILL
                        He does?

                                 SAM
                        Yes, and he’s crazy about her.

           Will is relieved. Then...

                                 WILL
                        ...Have you met the girlfriend?

           Sam shakes her head. They park. Jodi is there to meet them.
                                 SAM
                        Can we talk about this later?

           Jodi comes up and gives Sam a hug. Will offers his hand. Jodi 
           looks askance at it and pulls him in for a hug.

                                 JODI
                        Come on, bring it in for the real thing.

                                 SAM
                        So what is this new secret 
                        foundation, Jo?

                                 JODI
                        Well, you know how I have always 
                        had a passion for sick children?
                            (Sam nods)
                        I started thinking about how there 
                        are a lot of foundations that help 
                        kids with AIDS or that are mentally 
                        retarded.

                                 WILL
                        Don’t you mean mentally challenged?

                                 JODI
                        No, I don’t, Will. They like to be 
                        called what they are. That is 
                        retarded, they are not ashamed of 
                        it. And you shouldn’t be either. It 
                        is just who they are. It’s not 
                        their fault they are that way. You 
                        don’t call blind people seeing 
                        challenged. They’re just blind.   

           Will feels like a dick.

                                 WILL
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JODI
                        It’s okay, you didn’t know. Anyway, 
                        I started thinking about those kids 
                        that are retarded or have AIDS. But 
                        then I thought, what about the kids 
                        that are retarded and have AIDS. 
                        That’s when I came up with the idea 
                        for “Two Things.”

                                 WILL
                        So it’s a foundation for retarded 
                        kids with AIDS?

           Sam looks at Will. There is no way for that sentence to sound 
           good.
                                 JODI
                        That is just an example. But it isn’t 
                        limited to just those two things. I 
                        didn’t want to discriminate. I wanted to 
                        make a place where children that are 
                        afflicted with any two things can come 
                        and feel welcome, loved, fit in.

                                 SAM
                        Wow, that’s amazing.

                                 JODI
                        I like to think so. Come on let’s 
                        go meet the kids. I have been 
                        working on this since before my 
                        trip, but didn’t want to show you 
                        until it was all up and running.

           INT. TWO THINGS - NIGHT

           They enter and we an assortment of CUTE KIDS with assorted 
           ailments. Each of course has two. Jodi goes and hugs a kid 
           with a shaved head and hearing aids.

                                 JODI
                        This is Martin. He has cancer and 
                        is deaf.

           Jodi signs to Martin. Martin signs back. Jodi looks like he 
           is signing a joke. Both laugh and then Jodi hugs Martin.

                                 JODI
                        We do a lot of hugging here. You 
                        can never get too many hugs.

           Jodi hugs Martin again. Jodi smiles. He sees two kids playing 
           checkers.

                                 JODI
                        This is Peter. He has juvenile 
                        herpes and no sense of smell. And 
                        Sarah, she was born with a clubbed 
                        foot and has a rare non-contagious 
                        form of the bubonic plague.

           Jodi hugs them both. Jodi is getting really emotional.

                                 JODI
                        I am sorry. I just get so overcome 
                        sometimes. But, I have to stop. 
                        This is a no crying zone. Only 
                        smiles, sunshine, hugs and fun in 
                        here. That’s our motto.
           On the wall we see a SIGN THAT SAYS JUST THAT ON THE WALL. 
           WORKERS play with the kids who hang out and partake of games. 
           There are candy and snacks and a jukebox playing POP songs.

                                 SAM
                        Jodi this is incredible. Isn’t it 
                        Will?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, it’s, words, can’t really 
                        describe. That’s really great you 
                        are doing this.

           Jodi touched now gives Will a hug.

                                 JODI
                        And this is my special boy, Patrick. 
                        Patrick is deaf, blind, mute and his 
                        parents were killed in 9/11.

                                 WILL
                        Wow, that’s four things.

                                 JODI
                        Two is just the minimum. More is fine. 

           Sam looks at Patrick. She wants to cry. She goes and hugs 
           him. Will does too.

                                 JODI
                        Anyway, Sam, I was inspired by our 
                        secret language to create one with 
                        Patrick. So we could communicate. I 
                        based it on the clicking language. 
                        But with taps instead of clicks.

           Jodi and Patrick get down on the ground. They put their ears 
           to the ground. And start tapping on the floor by each others 
           ears.

                                 JODI
                        His little broken ears can’t hear, 
                        but he can feel the vibrations.

           Jodi taps away like a mad man. Patrick taps back. Will and 
           Sam watch them. Will feels like the biggest asshole in the 
           world. Sam looks at him.

                                 WILL
                        I’m so sorry. I, he’s clearly the 
                        best person I have ever seen.

                                 SAM
                        And he loves you by the way. Says you are 
                        the greatest guy I have ever dated.
           Will sighs. Jodi comes back up.

                                 JODI
                        Patrick says thank you for coming 
                        by. You know we do this for them, 
                        but I just get so much joy from it. 
                        I feel guilty sometimes.

                                 WILL
                        Hey, Jodi, I was thinking maybe the 
                        two of us could hang out together 
                        sometime. You know just us.

           Sam smiles.

                                 JODI
                        A guy’s night?
                            (Will nods)
                        A night of male bonding away from 
                        our Sam and my Mary?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, let us get to know each other 
                        better.

           Jodi hugs Will.

                                 JODI
                        I’d love to.

           EXT. WILL’S APT - NIGHT

           Will stands out on the curb. Waiting for Jodi to pick him up. 
           He is dressed nice casual for a night out. A PACK OF 
           MOTORCYCLES pulls up. Jodi is riding the front one.

                                 JODI
                        Hey, buddy hop on.

                                 WILL
                        Hop on that?

                                 JODI
                        It’s guy’s night, what are you gonna 
                        drive a car? Hogs are the only way to go.

           Jodi hands him a helmet.

                                 JODI
                        I hope you don’t mind I invited some 
                        friends. When they heard we were having a 
                        guys night they wanted in.

           Will looks around: They are a WEIRD COLLECTION of very manly, 
           long haired, bearded intimidating, biker/teamster guys.
                                 JODI
                        This is Condor, Muscles, Dolphin, 
                        Peaches and Max.

           They all nod at Will. Will nods back, puts on the helmet and 
           gets on the bike.

           EXT. STREET, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Will on the back of Jodi’s motorcycle ride with the five 
           other BIKERS down the street.

                                 WILL
                        Where are we going?

                                 JODI
                        It’s a guys night, where do you 
                        think we’re going?

           INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

           Will, Jodi, Condor, Muscles, Peaches, Dolphin and Max sit at 
           the stage. STRIPPERS GRIND and dance on stage in front of 
           them. They all have shots.

                                 JODI
                        To guys night!

                                 ALL
                        GUYS NIGHT!!!

           They all do their shots and bump fists. Will feels a little 
           out of place.

           -It’s now just Jodi and Will at the table. Condor sits down 
           the way with a pile of one dollar bills that he keeps putting 
           in a STRIPPER’S g-string at a rate of about one every ten 
           seconds. The other guys all are getting lap dances nearby.

                                 WILL
                        So how do you know these guys?

                                 JODI
                        Teamsters I worked with on film 
                        sets back in my stuntman days. They 
                        are a sweet bunch of guys.

                                 WILL
                        Seems like it.

                                 JODI
                        So I made you a mix tape?

                                 WILL
                        Wow, ah, really?
                                 JODI
                        No. I was just kidding.
                            (they both laugh)
                        But, I could if you want me too.

                                 WILL
                        That’s fine.

           They both just sit there. On stage the stripper comes and 
           starts shaking her ass in Will’s face. Jodi looks at him and 
           smiles.

                                 JODI
                        Do you like that?

                                 WILL
                            (beat)
                        Yeah, not really, no.

                                 JODI
                            (then)
                        ...Yeah, me neither. When you said 
                        guys night I just thought you meant 
                        strip club. But, to be honest 
                        nothing against these girls, but I 
                        have no desire to see anyone but my 
                        Debbie as god made her.

                                 WILL
                        You mean Mary?

                                 JODI
                        Her name’s Mary Debbie. ...I am sure you 
                        feel the same way about Sam.

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, actually though we haven’t, 
                        um, you know, yet. But,-

                                 JODI
                        Oh, wow.

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, we’re taking it slow.

                                 JODI
                        Hey, well if a healthy sex life was 
                        all it took to create a successful 
                        relationship, Sam and I would still 
                        be together.

           Will smiles awkwardly. Then Jodi laughs.

                                 JODI
                        I am totally messing with you, Will. 
                        Trying to break the ice.
                                 WILL
                            (relaxes)
                        Well, consider it broken.

           They both drink their beers. 

                                 JODI
                        So tell me about yourself. What’s your 
                        biggest fear? What are you afraid of?

           Will looks at him, still hesitant to open up.

                                 JODI
                        Okay, I’ll go first. Remember that kid’s 
                        show “Chester.” The big blue monster guy 
                        who wanted to be your friend?

                                 WILL
                        Of course, “Chester, Chester, we 
                        love Chester. He’ll come into your 
                        room in the middle of the night 
                        when you’re scared. He’ll give you 
                        a hug and make you un-scared.”

                                 JODI
                        Yeah, I was absolutely terrified of him.

                                 WILL
                            (laughs)
                        Really?

                                 JODI
                        Oh, yeah. The only reason I was scared in 
                        the middle of the night is cuz I was 
                        afraid that giant blue monster with a 
                        maniacal smile was gonna come into my 
                        room and hug me. I stayed up so many 
                        nights petrified just waiting for him to 
                        come. I saw a character dressed up like 
                        him at a theme park once and I shat 
                        myself. And I am not saying that as a 
                        metaphor, I literally shat my pants. Have 
                        you ever shat yourself, Will?

                                 WILL
                        No, I can’t say I have. That must 
                        have been terrible.

                                 JODI
                        It was, I still get the willies when I 
                        see him now. Anytime he comes on the TV 
                        I have to turn it off. What about you?

                                 WILL
                        I guess...I am a little afraid of 
                        heights. Okay, a lot afraid.
                                 JODI
                        No way.

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, we used to live in Boston. My dad 
                        worked at the John Hancock which is the 
                        tallest building in Boston. Used to be 
                        the third tallest in the world after 
                        the Sears Tower and the World Trade 
                        Center, now there’s a whole bunch 
                        taller. But at the time it was the 
                        third tallest in the world and he 
                        worked right at the top. I was always 
                        so scared to go up there. Afraid I was 
                        gonna get sucked out the windows.

                                 JODI
                        And now?

                                 WILL
                        Well, we’re in LA so they’re aren’t 
                        many really high places and the ones 
                        that are I don’t usually have to go to. 
                        So I don’t have to deal with it much.

           Will looks at Jodi he nods sympathetically. They are starting 
           to bond.

                                 JODI
                            (genuine)
                        I am really glad we did this, Will.

                                 WILL
                            (also genuine)
                        Yeah, me too.

                                 JODI
                        ...Do wanna get out of here? 

           Will nods. Jodi smiles at him. They get up.

                                 JODI
                        Come on, guys, we’re out.

           Disappointed, the guys get up and follow them out.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Jodi, Will, and the guys roll into another bar. Jodi motions 
           for more drinks. They keep pounding them.

                                 ALL
                        GUYS NIGHT!!!

           They toast. Will is starting to loosen up, have fun. They are 
           bonding.
           -They hit another BAR. More shots.

           -ANOTHER BAR. More beers. Jodi as always is the ringleader, 
           center of attention. The music starts to play. People start 
           to get up and DANCE. Jodi smiles, as do all the guys.

                                 JODI
                        Gentlemen, do you see what I see?

           They all nod: excited.

                                 CONDOR
                        DANCING!!!!

            They start to get up all excited. Will just sits there.

                                 JODI
                        Are you coming?

                                 WILL
                        Where?

                                 JODI
                        We’re gonna go dance.

                                 WILL
                            (makes a face)
                        With...each other?

                                 JODI
                        Yeah. Why not? We all love to dance. 
                        And we all have ladies elsewhere so 
                        we’re not gonna go dance with other 
                        women. We’re secure enough in 
                        ourselves. Do you wanna come?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, I don’t know.

                                 JODI
                        You’re not straightphobic are you, 
                        Will? Afraid of straight men?

                                 WILL
                            (laughs)
                        No.
                                 JODI
                        Then as Kevin Bacon once said in the 
                        eighties cinematic classic Footloose 
                        “this is our time to dance, it is our way 
                        of celebrating life, that’s the way it 
                        was in the beginning, that’s the way it 
                        has always been, that is the way it 
                        should be now.” So why don’t you heed his 
                        word, stop caring what other people 
                        think, and come have fun.

           Will looks at him. He’s been drinking. Why not?

           -Cut to Will, Jodi, and the GUYS DANCING out on the dance 
           floor. They are full on MANDANCING with each other. And with 
           wild abandon.

           Will looks over at Jodi. He is as always really good. And he 
           doesn’t seem to care what other people think. Will smiles and 
           starts to get into it.

           -Will and Jodi start doing the robot. All the guys follow, 
           soon the whole dance floor does too.

           -A drunk Will, Jodi and the guys sit at a table. Drunk Jodi 
           is giving drunk Will advice.

                                 JODI
                        Maybe you have to be more forward with 
                        the sex stuff. Women love guys who are 
                        assertive, know what they want.

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, but I don’t want to push her.

                                 JODI
                        Back me up here guys.

                                 DOLPHIN
                            (really deep voice)
                        It’s my experience that women want 
                        a man who tells them what he wants 
                        and isn’t afraid to show it.

                                 JODI
                        I think you should call her, do 
                        some old fashioned dirty talking.

                                 GUYS
                        CALL HER!!!!

                                 JODI
                        Come on.

           Will drunk, pulls out his phone and drunk dials. He gets her 
           voicemail.
                                 WILL
                        Hey, mama, it’s Will. Will Cox. As 
                        in my cock (beat) sss.

           They all high five. Jodi motions for him to keep going.

                                 PEACHES
                        Tell her what you want do to with it!

                                 WILL
                        My big cock that I want to put in 
                        your big vagina.

           He’s not really good at this. The guys seem less excited by 
           that.

                                 JODI
                        Talk about her breasts.

                                 WILL
                        Oh, yeah, your breasts. I ---LOVE --
                        --THEM!!!
                            (more high fives)
                        I wanna play your boobs like bongo 
                        drums. Like I was a naked Matthew 
                        McConoughey and your breasts were 
                        his...bongos.

           More high fives. Jodi toasts Will. They do more shots.

           -MORE MANDANCING. Will with his hands in the air is in 
           between Peaches and Condor. They are freaking him from the 
           front and the back. 

           Max bends down in front of Will and starts shaking his ass at 
           him. Will starts faux spanking that ass. Dolphin starts 
           shaking his ass at Jodi who starts faux spanking him as well.

           Will and Jodi look at each other. They’re having fun.

           INT. BAR - END OF THE NIGHT

           A very drunk Will starts walking out with his arms around 
           Jodi and Condor. They have a had a great time. Will hugs and 
           bumps fists with the guys. They take off.

           Will and Jodi start to head to the parking lot. As they do a 
           GUY BUMPS into Will and keeps going.

                                 JODI
                        Hey Captain Bumpenstein, where are 
                        your manners? Would it kill you to 
                        say excuse me.

                        What did he say?

                                 WILL
                        Forget about it. He’s a --

                                 JODI
                        Hey, pal, I think you owe an 
                        apology to my friend here. He is a 
                        good man, he deserves your respect.

                                 WILL
                        Jodi, it’s really not a big deal.

                                 BUMPIN GUY
                        Yeah, why don’t you and your 
                        boyfriend go home and sleep it off.

           Jodi starts taking off his jacket.

                                 BUMPIN GUY
                        What are you going to do?

                                 JODI
                        I am gonna make you apologize is 
                        what I am gonna do. See Jujitsu is 
                        my hobby. I’m a ninth degree black 
                        belt. I am one level away from 
                        making myself disappear. I can 
                        deliver eight different death blows 
                        with my index finger. Apologize.

                                 BUMPIN GUY
                        Here’s another finger.

           The guy flips him off and turns around. Jodi looks pissed.

                                 WILL
                        Jodi, really, it’s-

           Too late. Jodi makes a noise and lashes out at the guy with a 
           Jujitsu move.

                                 JODI
                        That’s Cobra-khan.

           Jodi then puts the guy in a headlock.

                                 WILL
                        No. Wait.

                                 JODI
                        This is Shrieking Mongoose Flowers.

           He screams and slams the guy to the ground. 
                                 JODI
                        And this is kicking your ass.

           Jodi starts beating the hell out of the guy.

                                 JODI
                        That will teach you to bump into my 
                        friend without apologizing. NOW 
                        APOLOGIZE.

           Jodi drags him over to a horrified, Will.

                                 BUMPIN GUY
                            (mumbles)
                        Sorry.

                                 JODI
                            (to Will)
                        Want to hit him? Come on! Punch him 
                        right in the grill. This is what 
                        brothers do for each other.

                                 WILL
                        I appreciate it, but I am good.

                                 JODI
                        Come on, do it! He deserves it.

                                 WILL
                        No, you really showed him. Taught 
                        him a lesson.

                                 JODI
                        Fine. I will finish it.

           Jodi raises his index finger to the guy. Will stops him.

                                 WILL
                        OK. OK. I’ll hit him. Then we’re 
                        done right?

           Will takes a slow swing at the guy. Barely making contact 
           with his stomach. Bumping guy goes down just as...

           A COUPLE OF COPS arrive and WRESTLE WILL TO THE GROUND.

           INT. JAIL - MORNING

           The door opens. Jodi and Will have been there all night and 
           are really hung over. Will also has a black eye. 

           Sam waits for them.

                                 SAM
                        So how was guy’s night?
                                 WILL
                        Pretty good.

                                 JODI
                        I am so sorry you had to come all 
                        the way down here, Sam. Mary Debbie 
                        was working.

                                 SAM
                        You’re just lucky that guy didn’t 
                        press charges against you, Will.

                                 WILL
                        Me?

                                 SAM
                        Starting the fight with him just 
                        for bumping into you.

                                 WILL
                        I didn’t.

                                 JODI
                        Will’s right, Sam, he didn’t start it 
                        but boy did he finish it. That guy 
                        totally had it coming. Like that girl 
                        at the Wafflehouse in San Jose. 
                        Remember her? She totally was asking 
                        for it when you took her down.

                                 SAM
                            (can’t help but smile)
                        That was different and you know it.

                                 WILL
                        Sam, seriously, I am the least 
                        violent person ever. I’ve never 
                        even been in a fight before in my 
                        whole life.

                                 JODI
                        Really? Cause the way you took apart the 
                        guy in the cell this morning.

                                 SAM
                        You were in another fight after the bar?

                                 JODI
                        That’s how he got the shiner.
                            (proud)
                        You should see the other guy.

                                 WILL
                        I...the guy was trying to touch 
                        me...in my bathroom place. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILL (cont'd)
                        I just pushed him off. He slipped 
                        and hit his head on the bunk bed.

                                 JODI
                            (as they walk out the door)
                        You totally had him. Sam you should 
                        have seen the blood.

           INT. HAMILTON’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Hamilton is making breakfast. Will comes in, all dirty and 
           beat up from the night before.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Do I need to ask how guy’s night was?

                                 WILL
                        So, I think I am ready to talk to 
                        those guys. The cockblocking ones.

           Hamilton nods and picks up the phone.

                                 HAMILTON
                        You smell like my alcoholic aunt, Donna, 
                        by the way. She’s been dead for a while.

           Will goes to get some ice for his face.

           INT. GLOBAL WARMING INITIATIVE OFFICES, SANTA MONICA, CA

           Sam sits in Al Gore’s office. He makes her tea.

                                 AL GORE 
                        Do you want me have him checked 
                        out. I still have contacts in the 
                        CIA, NSA, FBI, the Mossad.

                                 SAM
                        No, he said he’s never even been in 
                        a fight before.

                                 AL GORE
                        And you believe him?

                                 SAM
                        I do. I think. You can never totally 
                        tell I guess. People are always 
                        putting their best sides forward when 
                        you first start dating. And then 
                        slowly there’s the real side.

                                 AL GORE
                        That is why I believe in diving in 
                        head first. Peeling away those 
                        layers as fast as you can til you 
                        see what is really there. You are 
                        still really liking him though?
                                 SAM
                        I am. I really am. A lot.

                                 AL GORE
                        Then give him the benefit of the 
                        doubt this time. Did you invite him 
                        to the gala next week?

                                 SAM
                        Yeah.

                                 AL GORE
                        Good, I look forward to getting to 
                        know him better. But, if he screws 
                        up again. I will have someone very 
                        discreetly waterboard his ass.

           Sam laughs and they get back to work.

           INT. ARCADE - DAY

           Hamilton and Will enter the arcade. We see a group of NERDY, 
           SWEET LOOKING, YET A TAD CREEPY GUYS sitting at a table. 
           Hamilton goes up to one of them. 

                                 HAMILTON
                        HanShotFirst314?

                                 JIMMY
                        Masterchiefismybitch1026?

           They both nod and bro-hug.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Jimmy, this is my friend, Will, 
                        that I told you about.

                                 JIMMY
                        Nice to meet you, Will. This is 
                        Milo, Owen and Freddericks.

           Will waves. JIMMY is the most normal. MILO wears glasses, is 
           sweet looking and harmless. OWEN is soft spoken and creepy, 
           while Fredericks doesn’t speak at all. They sit down. They 
           all drink sodas.

                                 WILL
                        So Hamilton was saying you guys um-

                                 JIMMY
                        Cockblock for the women in our lives?
                            (Will nods)
                        Yeah. I’ve been blocking for my 
                        sister since high school.
                                 CREEPY OWEN
                        She’s pretty hot.

                                 JIMMY
                        Yeah, so I have been trying to keep 
                        dirty guys away from her. Keep her 
                        pure as the winter snow.

                                 MILO
                        I block for my LOML?
                            (blanks stares)
                        Love of my life. She’s gonna come 
                        around.

                                 CREEPY OWEN
                        I plan on cockblocking guys away 
                        from Katee Sachoff, tv’s Starbuck 
                        from Battlestar Gallactica...that 
                        is if I ever find her.

           Freddericks doesn’t say anything. He just stares at Will.

           -They are telling cockblocking stories.

                                 JIMMY
                        It was my sister’s senior prom and 
                        her date was bragging to everyone 
                        is school how he was gonna bang her 
                        on prom night. So I gave him foot 
                        and mouth disease. It’s amazing 
                        with the internet what you can grow 
                        in a lab at home.

                                 MILO
                            (geeky and proud)
                        I had a guy registered as a sex 
                        offender and another put on a 
                        terrorist watch list so he and my 
                        LOML couldn’t go on a weekend sex 
                        trip to Cabo.

                                 WILL
                        Was he a terrorist?

                                 MILO
                        He could have been. You can never tell.

           They all look to Fredericks to hear his stories. Nothing.

                                 JIMMY
                        He doesn’t like to reveal his secrets. He 
                        didn’t even want us to talk to you today, 
                        but, he was out-voted.

                                 WILL
                        So how do you guys know each other?
                                 JIMMY
                        We met in a chat room.

                                 WILL
                        A cockblocking chat room?

                                 MILO
                        Yeah. It’s pretty cool.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Okay. Will, why don’t you tell 
                        these guys about Jodi.

           -Will finishes telling them about Jodi. They all nod, 
           impressed. They finish sipping their sodas.

                                 JIMMY
                        He’s good. He’s very good.

                                 CREEPY OWEN
                        Do you think he’s a Cylon?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, I don’t know what that means.
                            (back to Jimmy)
                        So you think he has been 
                        cockblocking me?

                                 JIMMY
                        No doubt. We mostly roll in spilt 
                        drinks on guys, sabotaging her 
                        deodorant so guys won’t come near 
                        her, getting her drunk so she can’t 
                        perform, slipping roofies to him. 
                        But, he sounds more sophisticated 
                        than that. He must be really 
                        threatened by you.

                                 HAMILTON
                        So what can he do?

                                 MILO
                        You need to start calling him on 
                        stuff. Like this girlfriend of his, 
                        have you met her?

                                 WILL
                        No. 

                                 JIMMY
                        She probably doesn’t exist.

                                 MILO
                        Yeah, we all have “girlfriends”
                            (they all nod, laughing)
                        Standard MO to deflect suspicion.
                                 JIMMY
                        Make him produce her. Force a meeting. 
                        Don’t take no for an answer.

                                 CREEPY OWEN
                        Do you have any of your girls hair in 
                        a bag?

                                 WILL
                            (disgusted)
                        No. Do you?

                                 CREEPY OWEN 
                        No...
                            (then)
                        why do you wanna borrow it?

                                 WILL
                        I’m good. Any other advice?

                                 JIMMY
                        Take the offence, let him know you 
                        are onto him. I don’t know if it will 
                        do any good, he sounds too good for 
                        that, but maybe it will force him to 
                        screw up and she’ll see it.

           EXT. SAM’S APARTMENT

           Will fired up rings the bell. He holds flowers. Sam answers.

                                 SAM
                        Hey.

           They kiss and she takes the flowers.

                                 SAM
                        Thank you.

           Will looks behind her and Jodi is there as always.

                                 SAM
                        If you don’t mind Jodi is gonna 
                        come to the movie with us.

                                 JODI
                        Mary Debbie had to work again. But 
                        I don’t want to intrude, I am fine 
                        to just hang out here.

                                 SAM
                        And I said it was no intrusion. Let 
                        me finish getting ready.
           Sam goes into the other room leaving Will and Jodi alone. 
           They stare at each other. It’s very intense. Like DeNiro and 
           Pacino in Heat.

                                 WILL
                        Mary Debbie seems to work a lot. 
                        What does she do?

                                 JODI
                        She’s a civil rights attorney.

                                 WILL
                        Noble.

                                 JODI
                        I know.

                                 WILL
                        So no luck getting the sublet to 
                        move out?

                                 JODI
                        Not yet. Sam said I am welcome to 
                        stay here as long as I want.

                                 WILL
                        I am onto you! The karaoke, the 
                        terrible songs that I didn’t pick, the 
                        bar fight, you always being there. 
                        You’re trying to cockblock me away 
                        from Sam. And it’s not gonna work.

           Long pause...

                                 JODI
                        Look, bro, I get it. This whole thing 
                        must be really frustrating for you. It’s 
                        gotta be a little weird knowing that I’ve 
                        actually been inside your girlfriend 
                        before you have. That I have drunk from 
                        her sweet nectar while you have been 
                        carded away. Knowing that I had so much 
                        sex with her one weekend that I actually 
                        ran out of sperm. True story my man juice 
                        reserves were tapped out by that ass. And 
                        having to know that I am gonna be here 
                        for as long as I want. For as long as it 
                        takes. And then on top of everything not 
                        being able to say a fuckin thing about 
                        it. You know how Sam hates jealous men. 
                        And you wouldn’t want to be that. That 
                        must be a really horrible place to be in.

           Will is boiling. So ready to explode.
                                 JODI
                        Look, I am not saying I am. But, if I was 
                        cockblocking you as you say... you 
                        wouldn’t stand a fucking chance.

                                 WILL
                        Really?

                                 JODI
                        Yeah. Really.

           They lock eyes. It’s on. Sam comes out.

                                 SAM
                        What are my two favorite guys 
                        talking about?

                                 WILL
                        I was just telling Jodi how it’s such a 
                        shame that Mary Debbie seems to be 
                        working all the time. But how much we 
                        want to go on a double date with them. I 
                        said we’d move whatever we can on our 
                        side to make it happen.

                                 SAM
                        That would be great. Jo?

           Will and Jodi stare at each other.

                                 JODI
                        I’ll make it happen.

                                 WILL
                        Awesome. Can’t wait.

           INT. WILL’S CAR - DAY

           Will looks out the window. They are in the middle of nowhere.

                                 WILL
                        So where are we meeting them for lunch?

                                 SAM
                        I don’t know, Jodi said it was 
                        someplace cool and a surprise.

           Will is getting worried.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN SIDE- DAY

           Will and Sam pull into a parking area of a National Park. 
           Jodi is standing alone next to his car. 

           They get out of the car.
                                 SAM
                        So where’s this cool place we are 
                        having lunch?

                                 JODI
                        Up there.

           He points to the top of the mountain.

                                 JODI
                        I thought we’d climb up and have a 
                        picnic. It’s got this amazing view.

                                 SAM
                        Rock climbing? Awesome. Good call 
                        Jo. We haven’t done this in years.

                                 JODI
                        Since Panama. I still have the scar.

           Will looks terrified. He stares at Jodi, pissed.

                                 JODI
                        Will, is this cool with you, you’re 
                        not scared of heights or anything?

           Sam looks at him. She seems so excited to do this. Will looks 
           at her and smiles. Then back to Jodi. He doesn’t want to let 
           him win.

                                 WILL
                        No, I’m not. Love heights. Wanna 
                        marry them.

                                 JODI
                        Good, because I wouldn’t want to do 
                        this, if I was scared of heights.

                                 WILL
                        So where’s Mary Debbie, Jo?

                                 JODI
                        There she is right now.

           A car pulls up and MARY DEBBIE gets out. She is three hundred 
           pounds and of some ethnicity. We’ll let the casting people 
           decide.

                                 MARY DEBBIE
                        BAAAAABY!!!!!

           Jodi goes to her. They start to make out, hardcore. Jodi 
           reaches down and grabs a handful of her well endowed 
           buttocks. Will watches on in disbelief. He’s good.
                                 JODI
                        Guys, this is Mary Debbie. Mary 
                        Debbie this is Sam and Will.

                                 MARY DEBBIE
                        I have heard so much about you both. The 
                        lovely, intelligent, and kind Sam. And 
                        Jodi’s new brother Will.

           Sam smiles and awws.

                                 JODI
                        That’s how I feel, man. 

           Will smiles. Jodi hands them climbing outfits.

                                 JODI
                        You can change over there and then 
                        let’s get started.

           EXT. RESTROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Will emerges in his skintight climbing gear. He looks over at 
           Jodi. His muscles looked ripped in his and his package looks 
           HUGE as the harness fits snugly- perfectly around his groin. 
           It looks like he is wearing a giant cod piece. He is 
           adjusting Sam’s wrap around harness.

                                 JODI
                        Looking real good.

           Will looks down at his own package. Not so much. He tries to 
           re-arrange his goods to make them stick out more. He looks up 
           to see Mary Debbie staring at him.

                                 WILL
                        I was just-

                                 MARY DEBBIE
                        Yeah, I know what you were trying to do.

           She laughs a little to herself. Will looks up at the mountain.

           -They stand at the base of the mountain. 

                                 JODI
                        Okay. Remember what I said. If you fall, 
                        let the rope catch you. This stuff is 
                        very strong and very rarely breaks.

           Will is trying to keep it together. Breathing deeply.

                                 JODI
                        But, if you do fall don’t use your 
                        hands or it will burn your fingers 
                        to the stubs? Got it?
           Will nods. As he looks up at the high peak, his breathing is 
           getting more heavy.

                                 WILL
                        And why would we fall? This is supposed 
                        to be totally safe, right? Right?

                                 JODI
                        Yeah, but just in case, I’ll take 
                        Will and-

                                 WILL
                        No. No. No. You know, why don’t we 
                        split up? Boy, girl, boy, girl.

                                 JODI
                        You sure?
                            (Will nods)
                        Fine, I’ll take Sam. You take Mary 
                        Debbie. You’ve been wanting to meet 
                        her so much it will let the two of 
                        you get to know each other.

           Will looks at Mary Debbie’s size and the little ropes.

                                 WILL
                        Are you sure that’s a good idea?

           They all stare at him. Will backpedals.

                                 WILL
                        Because I don’t really know what I 
                        am doing.

                                 JODI
                        You’ll be fine. We’ll be right 
                        above you.

           Will looks up. His breathing is getting really bad. Sam 
           notices.

                                 SAM
                        Are you okay?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, just getting a good whiff of 
                        the fresh mountain air.
                            (he’s also sweating)
                        And it’s hot, really hot.

           Sam and Jodi tether together. And so do Mary Debbie and Will.

           EXT. SIDE OF MOUNTAIN - DAY 

           They start the climb. Jodi is first, climbing fast. Then Sam. 
           Then Mary Debbie. 
           And finally Will, who slowly climbs bit by bit trying not to 
           look down. He clutches against the side of the mountain. Mary 
           Debbie looks down at him.

                                 MARY DEBBIE
                        I hope those muscles are bigger than 
                        they look, cuz it’s like Backdraft, 
                        if I go, you go.

           Will is gonna have a coronary. Mary Debbie keeps making like 
           she is gonna fall.

                                 MARY DEBBIE
                        Oooh, I think I lost my grip. You are 
                        gonna have to catch me. I FALLIN!

           She starts laughing. Will wants her to die.

                                 WILL
                            (to himself)
                        Just don’t look down.

           -They climb further. From up above Will hears.

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        I can totally see your junk.

           Will looks up at Jodi swinging near Sam sticking his giant 
           cod piece in her face.

                                 JODI
                        No way. What this junk?

           Jodi swings it right in her face, taunting.

                                 SAM
                        Yes, and your harness is making it 
                        seem huge.

                                 JODI
                        It is huge. But, you know that.

                                 SAM
                        Stop it. 

                                 JODI
                        I am just stating a fact. You have 
                        seen my junk.
                            (looks down at Will)
                        Hey, Will get up here and you can 
                        stick your junk in Sam’s face too.

           Jodi laughs. Sam hits him.

                                 SAM
                        Stop it. Ignore him, Will. Climb at 
                        your own pace.
           As Jodi keep swinging his crotch in Sam’s face. Will looks up 
           determined. He starts climbing faster determined to get past 
           his height thing and get up with them. He passes Mary Debbie.

                                 MARY DEBBIE
                        I’d slow down, Sir Speedy, I 
                        wouldn’t want to fall.

           She then makes like she is gonna fall again and starts 
           laughing. Will keeps going. 

                                 JODI
                        God, look how high we are.

           Will doesn’t take the bait, he doesn’t look. He just keeps 
           going. Then from down below he hears.

                                 MARY DEBBIE
                        Oh no, I’M GONNA FALL!

           This time it sounds real. Will looks. She was joking again, 
           but it’s like Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo. Will SEES ALL THE WAY 
           DOWN. IT ZOOMS IN AND OUT. His fear of heights takes over and 
           he slips. Jodi and Sam see him. Will instinctively starts to 
           grab with his hands. Jodi and Sam see this.

                                 JODI AND SAM 
                        No hands!

           But Will can’t help it, SCRAAAPE - his fingers slide all the 
           way down. He SLAMS INTO MARY DEBBIE KNOCKING HER OFF AS WELL.

                                 MARY DEBBIE
                        SWEET HOLY JESUS!!!

           Now they both fall. The rope catches Will and snaps him taut. 
           He is hanging. Mary Debbie FALLS PAST him.

           Her rope now pulls taut. But she is dragging on Will. Will 
           looks down at her. They both just dangle in the wind. 

                                 JODI
                        Hold on. We’re coming down. The rope 
                        should hold until we get there. And I 
                        think I found one of your fingernails.

           Will hangs there with Mary Debbie hanging below him for what 
           seems like an eternity. Will just watches the rope. Hoping it 
           won’t break. He is paralyzed in fear. A single tear rolls 
           down his face.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Back on the ground, fin all Sam puts bactine on Will’s 
           scarped, bruised, swollen hands.
                                 JODI
                            (disappointed)
                        I guess we’ll have lunch down here. 
                        It’s got a pretty good view.

                                 SAM
                        Are you okay?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah. I am just glad the rope didn’t 
                        break. Hanging there I wasn’t sure.

                                 MARY DEBBIE
                            (pointed)
                        Why would the rope have broken?

                                 WILL
                        I don’t know, the weight of both of us.

                                 MARY DEBBIE
                        Weight? Do you hate fat people, Will?

                                 WILL
                        No, I-

                                 MARY DEBBIE
                        Because I love who I am! All of me.
                            (starts to cry)
                        But it is just so hard when people 
                        like you judge me. And hate me just 
                        because I am not skinny like a little 
                        stickman. I guess if you had your way 
                        in your world everyone would be a 
                        skinny stick man and all the bigger 
                        people would be rounded up and 
                        shotgunned in the face.

                                 WILL
                        No, no. I love fat people. In fact 
                        I wish Sam had a little more junk 
                        in the old trunk.
                            (hole being dug deeper)
                        More to love?

           They all just stare at him. Mary starts to sob and run off. 
           Jodi heads after her.

                                 JODI
                        Baby come back, he didn’t mean it.

           Sam looks at Will, disappointed.

                                 SAM
                        That wasn’t very nice, Will. Just 
                        because she has a larger “rear 
                        area” doesn’t mean-
                                 WILL
                        No, I love her big rear area. I 
                        have nothing against big people. 
                        Mary Debbie is sweet and her ass is 
                        amazing. ... If I was single, I 
                        would totally wanna tap that. 
                            (beat)
                        Tap it real good. Really.

                                 SAM
                        Just stop.

           Will looks over at Jodi as he consoles Mary D. When no one 
           can see, Jodi smiles at him as if to say: your move.

           INT. WILL’S OFFICE - END OF THE DAY

           Will is on the phone with Sam. It is six o’ clock. We see a 
           tux hung up on the chair.

                                 WILL
                        I am walking out the door right now. 
                        Really excited about a night alone just 
                        the two of us. I think we need it.

                                 SAM
                        Me too. But, you better look good, 
                        otherwise I’ll pretend I don’t know you.

                                 WILL
                        Will do. Speaking of that. I left you a 
                        little something in your closet. To make 
                        up for the other day.

           INTERCUT WITH SAM. She is getting ready, putting makeup on in 
           a slip. She walks to her closet. She opens it up inside is an 
           amazing dress.

                                 SAM
                        Will, it’s amazing.

                                 WILL
                        And don’t worry. I got it for $30. It 
                        was originally 500 marked down 80%, 
                        then an additional fifty percent off 
                        that. And then I opened up a Macy’s 
                        account and got 10% off that. 

                                 SAM
                        That’s...awesome.

                                 WILL
                        You taught me well. I’ll see you soon.
                                 SAM
                            (smiling)
                        Can’t wait.

           Sam hangs up. Will grabs the tux and is out the door when his 
           boss MORRIS NORTHRUP knocks. He is with an OLD MAN.

                                 NORTHRUP
                        Cox, can you squeeze in one more 
                        before you leave.

                                 WILL
                        Ah. I guess, sure.

           The Old Man walks in at the speed of nothing. With him he has 
           a huge proposal. He slowly starts to open it. Will looks at 
           the clock.

           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Sam is all dressed up in Will’s dress. She looks amazing. She 
           looks at the clock. She needs to be there. Jodi just watches TV.

           INT. WILL’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Will sits with the Old Man as he shows Will papers. Very 
           slowly. Will looks at his watch.

           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT

           Sam stands before Jodi all dressed up.

                                 SAM
                        I’d skip it if I could, but Al is trying 
                        to get the Mayor to support our 
                        initiative. We don’t have to stay long.

                                 JODI
                        You know I hate these things.
                            (She looks at him pleading)
                        But, for you, you know I’d do anything. 
                        So I guess I can suck it up and put the 
                        monkey suit on for a night.

                                 SAM
                        You’re a lifesaver.

                                 JODI
                        What happened to Will?

                                 SAM
                        He got stuck with a client.
           INT. WILL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Will has his head down on the desk as the man searches for 
           more papers.

           BACK TO JODI AND SAM.

                                 JODI
                        Some things are more important I guess. 

           We see that Sam is a little disappointed.

                                 JODI
                        But, I guess I will have to try even harder 
                        to make sure you have a great time.

           EXT. LACMA - NIGHT

           It’s a big gala and the upper crust of LOS ANGELES has turned 
           out in their black tie attire to support Mayor Villagorossa. 
           Jodi escorts Sam up the stairs. When from behind, Will 
           charges up out of breath. 

                                 WILL
                        Sam, Sam. I made it.

           Jodi looks pissed. He and Will stare at each other.

                                 SAM
                            (smiles)
                        You made it?

                                 JODI
                        Yeah, what happened?

                                 WILL
                        Turned out the loan deal was a 
                        hoax, some crazy old man wanted to 
                        start a company called Cobra-Kahn, 
                        which sounds more like a jujitsu 
                        move to me. Anyway he went to the 
                        bathroom and then never came back.

                                 JODI
                        Odd.

                                 WILL
                        Yeah. Anyway forget about all that. 
                        I am here and you look amazing. I 
                        got you something else.

           Will reaches into his pocket.
                                 JODI
                        Oh, I am sorry, Will, when it 
                        looked like you couldn’t make it I 
                        already got our lady a corsage-

                                 WILL
                        That’s great. The flowers are cute. 
                        What is that a carnation? Adorable. 
                        But, that’s not what I got.

           Will opens the box it is an amazing diamond necklace.

                                 WILL
                        Harry Winstons is a big client of 
                        the bank. They let me borrow it for 
                        the night.

                                 SAM
                        Will, it’s-

                                 WILL
                        It’s not as pretty as you, but it’s 
                        still pretty nice. I thought it 
                        would look nice with your eyes.

           Jodi rolls his. Sam gives Will a kiss. A really passionate 
           one. Will milks it for Jodi. She pulls away.

                                 SAM
                        Let me go get the tickets.

           Sam walks off, smiling. She looks back at Will totally 
           smitten. Will smiles cockily.

                                 WILL
                        Nothing like Harry Winston to make 
                        someone forget about a little rock-
                        climbing.

                                 JODI
                        If you think that is gonna make up for 
                        all your weird behavior recently.

                                 WILL
                        I’m sorry did you miss that kiss, 
                        that was a pretty good kiss, so it 
                        seemed to work okay to me.

                                 JODI
                        Well, if you are happy with sloppy 
                        seconds.

                                 WILL
                        What was that? Say it again.
                                 JODI
                        Taping this are you?

            Jodi starts to frisk Will. Will tries to push him off.

                                 JODI
                        Wearing a wire, Willyboy?

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        What are you guys doing?

           They quickly turn, suddenly innocent.

                                 WILL
                        I was just telling Jodi about a 
                        back problem I have been having.

                                 JODI
                        And I tried a little adjustment.

                                 WILL
                        And it is feeling better already. 
                        Thanks.

                                 JODI
                        No prob.

                                 SAM
                        So the event is completely sold 
                        out. I only have the two tickets.

           They both look at each other.

                                 WILL
                        Oh, really? Well look. I’m late and 
                        Jodi got all dressed up. I mean I 
                        was really looking forward to this. 
                        But, I am sure Jodi was too, so you 
                        guys go have fun.

                                 JODI
                        Thanks, dude. We’ll call you later.

                                 SAM
                        Actually, Jodi hates these black tie 
                        events. You’re in luck, Will. And you
                            (to Jodi)
                        Are off the hook.

                                 JODI
                        Yeah, lucky me.

           Jodi stares at Will. For the first time ever he has been 
           outplayed. He doesn’t look happy.
                                 WILL
                        Thanks, Jo, we’ll call you later. 
                        But, I wouldn’t wait up.

           Will takes Sam’s hand and they head inside. 

           INT. GALA - NIGHT

           Will and Sam walk in. Everyone is commenting, looking at her 
           necklace. She looks absolutely stunning.

           -Will and Sam having fun, joking around.

           -They stand with Al Gore, Mayor Villagarossa and OTHER BIG 
           WIGS. Will has glasses of beer and shots.

                                 WILL
                        It’s called an Irish Carbomb. Terrible 
                        name. But, great drink. You take a glass 
                        of Guinness and drop in a shot of 
                        Baileys. And you have to drink them both 
                        before the Bailey’s curdles.

           They all nod. They all take their drinks and do. They all 
           finish and laugh.

                                 WILL
                        A couple more of those and you are gonna 
                        sign up for everything this man says.

           He points to Al Gore. Al smiles. They all laugh.

                                 BIGWIG
                        That’s what I am afraid of.

                                 WILL
                            (to Al and Sam)
                        I think what you guys are doing is 
                        great. I am gonna talk to the head of 
                        my bank about what we can do to help. 
                        And see if we can get our business as 
                        green as we can make it.

           Sam smiles. The Other Business are on the spot now.

                                 BIG BUSINESS GUY
                        Yes, we agree. We should sit down as 
                        well.

           Sam mouths to Will: Thank you. He mouthes back: Your welcome. 
           Mayor Villagorossa shakes Will and Sam’s hands.

                                 MAYOR VILLAGOROSSA
                        Will, Samantha, pleasure meeting 
                        you both. Al, let’s talk.
                                 AL GORE
                        And I hope we will see you up in Santa 
                        Barbara for our Big Earth Day event.

                                 MAYOR VILLAGOROSSA
                        You can count on it.

                                 AL GORE
                        Mission accomplished. Thanks, Will, 
                        for your help.

                                 WILL
                        No problem, Sir. 

                                 AL GORE
                            (to Sam)
                        Okay, I approve. No need to borrow 
                        Dick Cheney’s shotgun.

                                 WILL
                            (laughs, turns to Sam)
                        You wanna dance?

                                 SAM
                        I’d loved to.

           They walk out on the dance floor. Will winks at the DJ.

                                 DJ
                            (winks back)
                        This one goes out to Sam. 

           Sam looks at Will: what did you do? The music is (I’ve Had) 
           THE TIME OF MY LIFE from Dirty Dancing, Sam’s favorite movie.

                                 WILL
                        Still remember those moves?

                                 SAM
                        Yeah. How do you know them?

                                 WILL
                        I’ve been practicing. 

           Will and Sam take position and start doing the famous Patrick 
           Swayze/Jennifer Gray climactic dance from Dirty Dancing. The 
           dance floor parts. Sam and Will take center stage as they 
           dance away. They are both smiling, laughing as they go. They 
           are pretty good.

           People cheer them on. It is coming to the end of the dance. 
           Sam looks at him. It is time for the big lift. He nods for 
           her to go ahead. She runs towards him. He leans down and 
           lifts her. The place applauds as the song ends.

           Will lowers her. She looks at him.
                                 SAM
                        I’ve finally found someone who can 
                        do the lift.

                                 WILL
                        You gotta lift with your legs, 
                        that’s the key.

           Sam smiles and kisses him right out on the dance floor.

           We look out the window and standing outside in the rain 
           pressed against the glass is Jodi. He looks pissed. He knows 
           that he needs to step up his game this time.

           EXT. SAM’S APARTMENT

           Will and Sam move towards her apartment still making out. It 
           is getting more and more passionate as they move down the 
           hall toward her door.

           They reach her door. Sam pulls back and looks at Will.

                                 SAM
                        Thanks for the dress and the 
                        necklace and the dance. It couldn’t 
                        have been a more perfect night.

                                 WILL
                        I’m glad.

                                 SAM
                        I think I’m ready, Will.

                                 WILL
                        Really?

           She smiles and nods. She goes to unlock the door, quietly so 
           as not to wake Jodi. They slip in. No sign of him. They keep 
           kissing and start undressing, making out as they head to 
           Sam’s room.

           Sam fumbles opening the door, as she starts to unbuckle 
           Will’s pants. Will’s pants hit his ankles. He starts to pull 
           off his shirt as they move into Sam’s room. Then Sam screams.

           Sitting on the bed, sobbing is Jodi. Will sees him and makes 
           a face.

                                 SAM
                        Jodi, what’s wrong?

                                 JODI
                        It’s Mary Debbie. She broke up with me.

                                 SAM
                        Oh, sweety.
           Sam goes to him. She gives him a hug. As she does Jodi looks 
           at Will and smiles. Almost daring him to say something. Will 
           just pulls up his pants and starts to buckle them.

           EXT. SAM’S APARTMENT - TWO MINUTES LATER

           Sam says goodbye to Will at the door.

                                 SAM
                        I am so sorry. He’s just really upset. 
                        We’ll continue this another time.
                            (Will nods)
                        Thanks for being so understanding. 
                        Best boyfriend ever.

           Will smiles and leaves. In the background Will sees Jodi. 
           Jodi has a look on his face of “I’m gonna destroy you.”

           EXT. EARTH DAY FESTIVAL SET UP - DAY

           Sam and Al Gore walk around the fairgrounds as they set up 
           for their big Earth Day event.

                                 AL GORE
                        Okay, so I approve.

                                 SAM
                        That’s good to know. Because I was gonna 
                        kick him to the curb if you didn’t.

                                 AL GORE
                            (laughs)
                        So there was something I had been 
                        wanting to talk to you about, but 
                        now I am not sure I should.

                                 SAM
                        What?

                                 AL GORE
                        I have been very impressed with what 
                        you have been doing. Everyone has. 
                        You were great on your own at that 
                        dinner with the car guys. And I’m 
                        getting tired of traveling all the 
                        time, going on the road with the 
                        slide show. I am at that age where I 
                        wanna spend more time with my 
                        Grandkids. I am not gonna give it up 
                        all together, just cut back a little. 
                        Anyway I was gonna see if you wanted 
                        to pick up some of the slack for me. 
                        Take it on the road yourself.
                                 SAM
                        Wow, I don’t know what to say. The fact 
                        that you think I could do that.

                                 AL GORE
                        You can. But, he seems like a great 
                        guy. You have been so happy. It 
                        would require you to travel all 
                        over. Be gone from here for a 
                        while. I didn’t want to kill your 
                        relationship before it started.

           Sam thinks.

                                 AL GORE
                        Because of that I wasn’t even gonna 
                        bring it up. But I figured I should 
                        at least offer you the choice. You 
                        don’t have to answer me now.

                                 SAM
                        Thank you.

           A few months ago she would have jumped at the chance, but now 
           she’s not sure.

           INT. SIDEWALK - DAY 

           Will talks on his phone to Hamilton.

                                 HAMILTON
                        This guy’s trouble, Will. She’s 
                        great and all, but maybe you should 
                        just give up and move on.

                                 WILL
                        No, I don’t want to do that this 
                        time. I think I love her. 

                                 HAMILTON
                        Well, he doesn’t seem to be giving up.

                                 WILL
                        And the worst thing is I can’t say 
                        anything. 
                            (sighs)
                        All right I gotta go I am meeting my 
                        mother for lunch after her Cardio Bar 
                        class. As if things weren’t bad enough.

           INT. CARDIO BAR - CONTINUING

           Will walks into Cardio Bar. The lights are dimmed and 
           stripper music is playing. Will makes a face. We see the 
           MIDDLE AGED WOMEN bumping and grinding. In the center is his 
           MOTHER laughing. And behind her grinding up on her is JODI.
           Will watches aghast, feeling so violated.

                                 JODI
                        That’s right, ladies, get your hips 
                        into it. If you wanna burn those 
                        calories you need to grind. The 
                        nastier the better.

           They all laugh. Will just keeps watching aghast. Jodi has 
           hands on his mothers hips. It would be hot if it wasn’t your 
           mother.

                                 JODI
                        Yeah, Barbara show me that sex!

           She does, Shakira style. The song ends. Everyone claps. 
           Will’s Mom gives Jodi a big hug. And then comes over to him.

                                 BARBARA COX
                        Will, look who I met: your 
                        delightful new friend Jodi.

                                 WILL
                        How about that? You seem to be doing a 
                        lot better than you were last night, Jo.

                                 JODI
                        I work out when I grieve. It helps me get 
                        my mind off things. I’m in the Cardio Bar 
                        class right before Barb’s. But I decided 
                        to go for two today.

                                 BARBARA COX
                        And he was teaching us the newest 
                        thing: Strippersize, apparently 
                        everyone is doing it. And then what 
                        a small world you guys are such 
                        good friends.

                                 WILL
                        So small.

                                 BARBARA COX
                        Jodi was telling me you have a new 
                        girlfriend. How come I have to hear 
                        this from someone else but you? I 
                        am calling your father, we’re going 
                        to dinner tonight. And Jodi of 
                        course you are invited too.

           Will and Jodi stare at each other.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Sam, Will and Jodi walk up. Will is the most nervous.
                                 WILL
                        Just to warn you, my parents are a 
                        little...set in their ways. How 
                        should I put this...let’s just say 
                        I probably need a lot of therapy.

                                 JODI
                        I thought your mother was 
                        delightful.

                                 WILL
                        Thanks, Jodi.

                                 SAM
                        I’m sure I’ll love them. Don’t 
                        worry. And parents usually like me.

           Will’s parents stand outside the place. His Mom kisses Will. 
           His Dad gives him a firm handshake.  

                                 WILL
                        Mom, Dad, this is Sam.

                                 BARBARA COX
                            (makes a face)
                        Sam, isn’t that a boy’s name?

           Will sighs, it’s starting.

                                 SAM
                        It’s short for Samantha.

                                 BARBARA COX
                        Of course. I just, in my day women had 
                        women’s names. Like Evelyn, Linda, 
                        Priscilla. That way their was no confusion. 

                                 WILL
                        Mom, I don’t think anyone is 
                        confusing Sam with a man.

                                 BARBARA COX
                        I’m just saying.

           They walk inside. We can see Barbara eyeing Sam’s outfit as 
           they do.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           They all walk in. Will goes to the HOSTESS.

                                 WILL
                        Hi, Cox, table for five.
                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Will?

           Will turns around to see LINDA, a sweet, sensitive girl.

                                 WILL
                        Linda, hi, god we haven’t seen each 
                        other since-

                                 LINDA
                        We broke up.

                                 WILL
                        Right. 

                                 LINDA
                        You remember my parents?

           She points to A ELDERLY MIDWESTERN COUPLE WHO just scowl at 
           Will. Will puts out his hand. They don’t take it.

                                 WILL
                        Yes, good to see you guys again. 
                        This is Sam. Um, and you remember 
                        my parents?

                                 LINDA
                            (staring right at Sam)
                        No, you never introduced me to your 
                        parents.

           Linda just starts to CRY. Her mother consoles her. Her father 
           just stares daggers at Will.

                                 WILL
                        So you guys waiting for a table?
                            (no response)
                        Yeah, us too.

           More awkwardness. As Linda continues to cry. All of them just 
           stand there.

                                 WILL
                        Maybe we can get some drinks while 
                        we wait.

           -They all sit there, waiting for the table. It is very 
           awkward. Will downs his drink. Jodi and Bill toast their 
           scotch.

                                 BILL SR AND JODI
                        BULLY!

                                 BILL SR
                        So you’re a scotchman, Jodi?
                                 JODI
                        Of course.

                                 BILL SR
                        Good for you. Will’s not a scotchman.

                                 WILL
                        No, no I’m not, Dad. I’m a beer- 
                        coke-wine-occasional mixed-girly 
                        drinks-man.

           Sam laughs. His parents just stare at him. As do Linda and 
           her parents. She is trying not to cry. The Hostess comes up.

                                 HOSTESS
                        You’re table is ready.

                                 WILL
                        Oh, thank god.

           They get up. Will nods to Linda and her parents. They just 
           stare death at him. The hostess leads them away and to their 
           seats. Will turns to Sam.

                                 WILL
                        I am so sorry about that.

                                 SAM
                        Well, running into your exes, it 
                        happens.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Your waitress will be with you in a 
                        moment.

           They nod and sit. They open their menus. A WAITRESS 
           APPROACHES. Think Sarah Silverman.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Welcome to Delmonicos, can I get 
                        you guys something to drink- Will?

           Will looks up and sees their waitress...ANOTHER EX. And this 
           one is just angry.

                                 WILL
                        Jess? Hey. Hi-

                                 JESSICA
                        Who the fuck’s this?

                                 WILL
                        Um, this is Sam, she’s my-
                                 JESSICA
                        I thought you said you weren’t ready for 
                        a relationship now? That it wasn’t me, 
                        you just weren’t in that place.

                                 WILL
                        Um, yeah, I did say that.

                                 JESSICA
                        So it was just a fucking lie? Wow, you 
                        must have had a good laugh about that 
                        one. I am so STUPID for believing you. 
                        They’re are no nice guys.

                                 SAM
                        Maybe you’d be more comfortable if 
                        we moved to someone else’s section?

                                 JESSICA
                        Why, I am a professional. Just 
                        because your boyfriend’s a lying 
                        douchebagfuck doesn’t mean I can’t 
                        be mature and rise above it.

           Will’s parents just smile.

                                 JESSICA
                            (back to Will)
                        So what do you and your whore want?

                                 WILL
                        Just some more drinks and keep them 
                        coming.

           -A little while later. Jess drops more drinks on the table. 
           They splash all over. Bill Sr. turns to Sam.

                                 BILL SR
                        So Samantha, what do you do?

                                 SAM
                        I work for Al Gore-

           Bill Sr. and Barbara now just stare at her.

                                 BILL SR
                        I see.

                                 JODI
                        Sam works for his Global Warming 
                        Initiative.

                                 BARBARA COX
                        I saw Michael Crichton on that 
                        Charlie Rose he says Global Warming 
                        is a myth, wrote a book about it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARBARA COX (cont'd)
                        A best seller. I think we’re gonna 
                        read it in book club after we 
                        finish the new Grisham.

                                 SAM
                        That’s a fictional book. And  
                        pretty much every scientist in the 
                        world regardless of their politics  
                        says that it is real and we have to 
                        do something about it.

                                 BILL SR
                        Hmm. Well, I’ll have to learn more about 
                        it. See what Fox News has to say.

           They all sit there in silence. When we hear...

                                 ANOTHER FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Will?

           Will slowly turns to see EMILY a sweet girl and her mild 
           mannered boyfriend THOMAS being led by by the Hostess.

                                 THOMAS
                        Will, the one that got away, Will? 
                        The one you still wish you could be 
                        with, Will?

                                 EMILY
                        Goddamit, Tom can we not do this now?!
                            (to them)
                        It was nice to see you, Will.

           The Hostess leads them on to their table...

           ...Which is right next to them. Will looks like he wants to 
           die. He looks at Jodi, he knows he did this somehow. Linda 
           and her parents are then seated on the other side of them. 
           Linda looks over at Will and just starts to CRY again.

                                 SAM
                        Is there anyone here you haven’t dated?

           Will looks around, points at an ELDERLY WOMAN in the corner.

                                 WILL
                        Her, I haven’t dated her.

                                 ANGRY JESSICA
                            (as she walks by)
                        Yet!

           WE TIME CUT TO A LITTLE LATER. Things haven’t gotten better. 
           They eat mostly in silence. They are surrounded by all the 
           EXES. And Jodi is now proceeding to cock block Sam from 
           Will’s parents. Will’s Dad’s pretty drunk.
                                 JODI
                        So Bill are you a hunting man?

                                 BILL SR
                            (proudly)
                        Sure am. And thanks to the fact 
                        that Sam’s boss didn’t get elected 
                        I am able to keep doing so.

           He drinks more scotch.

                                 WILL
                        I really don’t think Al Gore was 
                        gonna come to the house and take 
                        your guns away, Dad.

                                 BILL SR
                        You don’t know that. Your father a 
                        hunter, Sam?

                                 SAM
                            (tries not laugh)
                        No, no, he’s not.

                                 BILL SR
                            (senses her dislike)
                        Something wrong with hunting?

                                 SAM
                        No. 
                            (then)
                        I mean shooting animals for fun is 
                        not my favorite sport. I prefer 
                        baseball, football, any ball where 
                        nothing gets shot.

                                 BILL SR
                        Do you have a problem with fishing? 

                                 SAM
                        Not if you are going to eat the fish.

                                 BILL SR
                        What about those guys that fish for 
                        fun, put a hole in the fish’s face 
                        and then throw them back? Is that 
                        what you think I should do? Shoot a 
                        hole in a deer’s face and then 
                        throw them back?

                                 SAM
                        No, I just don’t think you should 
                        shoot them at all. 
                            (calms down)
                        But, that’s just my personal 
                        feeling. To each is own.
           Will looks at Sam: I’m sorry. Bill takes another sip of his 
           drink. Jodi tries to change the subject.

                                 JODI
                        Barb, that is a wonderful outfit.

                                 BARBARA COX
                        Thank you, Jodi.

                                 JODI
                        You and Samantha should go shopping 
                        together sometime.

           Will glares at Jodi.

                                 WILL
                        Actually, Mom, Sam doesn’t really 
                        like to shop.

                                 BARBARA COX
                            (glares at Sam)
                        What’s wrong with shopping?

                                 SAM
                        Nothing. I, I just prefer to spend 
                        my money on other things besides 
                        fancy clothes?

                                 JODI
                        I told Sam in college she was so 
                        pretty she didn’t need to spend 
                        money buying those things.

                                 SAM
                        It was very sweet of him.

                                 BARBARA COX
                        So I am not pretty and need to?

                                 SAM
                        No, no, no, I just prefer to spend 
                        MY money on other things.

                                 BILL SR
                            (laughs)
                        Like saving the whales? 
                            (drunk at this point)
                        If those Whales need money so bad 
                        why don’t they get a effin job and 
                        work for it themselves? Because I 
                        work really hard for my money.

                                 WILL
                        No one is saying you don’t, Dad. 
                        And I’m sure if the whales could 
                        get a job they would.
           Will is aware of the ridiculousness of this statement. He 
           sighs. This whole night has been a trainwreck. They all sit 
           there in silence and all around them are Will’s hurt, angry, 
           exes. Will looks at Jodi. He’s knows he did all this. He just 
           sits there looking innocent: as if to say I told you not to 
           fuck with me. Jessica comes by and slams the check down on 
           the table.

                                 JESSICA
                        Here’s the check you motherfucking 
                        cuntlicking shitbag.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Will’s parents drive off. Will, Sam and Jodi walk to Will’s 
           car in silence. Jodi gets in. We can see Sam is really upset.

                                 SAM
                        Will-

                                 WILL
                        Don’t say anything. Please. That was my 
                        parents not you. And you just have to 
                        trust me, I really haven’t dated half the 
                        city even if all evidence is to the 
                        contrary. Look the past couple weeks have 
                        been crazy and sucked. But this is real 
                        for me. What we have is real for me. And 
                        I think we just need some time for us 
                        away from my parents
                            (looks at Jodi)
                        Others, our jobs, ex-girlfriends, 
                        everything. Let’s go away for a few days. 
                        Like our trip before. We can go wherever 
                        you want. Just someplace away, no cell 
                        phones, emails, anything, with just us. 

                                 SAM
                        ...I’d like that. I think we need that.

           Will smiles. Beat. They hear a phone ring. Will turns.

                                 JODI
                        Hello?
                            (reacts)
                        Oh dear god. No. NO!!!!

           Sam looks at Jodi. Will sighs dubious: what now?

           INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

           Will and Sam dressed in black enter. Will is so ready to 
           snap. There are only a smattering of people here.
                                 WILL
                        Who is this person? I’ve never 
                        heard Jodi mention him before?

                                 SAM
                            (taken aback)
                        His friend Marwan.

                                 WILL
                        Have you ever met him?

                                 SAM
                        Will? So he hasn’t mentioned him to 
                        you and I haven’t met him. He can’t 
                        be sad that he died?

                                 WILL
                        ...No. You’re right. We need to be 
                        here. Clearly.

                                 SAM
                        Look, I am sorry we didn’t get to 
                        go away. I’ll make it up to you 
                        when we go to Santa Barbara for the 
                        Earth Day event next week.

                                 WILL
                        Yeah.

           He can only imagine what Jodi will pull then. There are 
           hardly any people there. Mary Debbie is there, in black.

                                 WILL
                        I thought they broke up.

                                 SAM
                        She must have been friends with 
                        Marwan. Excuse me.

           Sam goes to comfort Jodi. Jodi hugs her, sobbing.

                                 SAM
                        It’s okay, Jo, it’s gonna be okay.

           Will looks around really suspicious. It is a closed casket.

                                 WILL
                        Is this a Catholic mass?

           The Person next to him nods. Will makes a face. They sit and 
           he hugs her tight. The PRIEST gets up to give his sermon.
                                 PRIEST
                        We are gathered here today not for 
                        a marriage between a man and a 
                        woman, but a marriage re-uniting a 
                        man and his maker-

           Jodi lets out a cry and sticks his head in Sam’s breasts as 
           he cries. Will finally can’t stand it. Everything that Jodi 
           has done the whole movie that he been building finally comes 
           out, he can’t take it anymore. He snaps and stands up.

                                 WILL
                        You know what, I’m sorry, I gotta 
                        call bullshit.

                                 SAM
                            (horrified)
                        Will-

                                 WILL
                        Sam, please, Jodi is in love with you! 
                        He has been, he still is and he’s been 
                        doing everything in his power to keep 
                        us apart. I can’t take it anymore. 
                        Singing you karaoke love songs while 
                        setting me up with the worst songs 
                        ever, getting me in a bar fight and 
                        arrested, taking us rock climbing when 
                        he knows I have a fear of heights.

                                 JODI
                        Will, if you didn’t want to go rock 
                        climbing you could have just said 
                        something.

                                 WILL
                        Shut up! Last night, taking us to a 
                        place that conveniently all my ex 
                        girlfriends we’re at? 

                                 SAM
                        How do you think he did that?

                                 WILL
                        I don’t know, but I know he did! And he 
                        was cockblocking you to my parents the 
                        whole night. And the whole fashion thing 
                        telling you not to spend money on that 
                        stuff because he doesn’t want you to look 
                        good so guys will stay away from you.

                                 SAM
                        You don’t think I look good?
                                 WILL
                        No, I think you look beautiful and 
                        I love you which is why he is doing 
                        all this.

                                 PRIEST
                        Can we go on with the funeral?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, we could, Father, if you 
                        really are one. We could go on with 
                        the “funeral” if someone actually 
                        died. But, I am willing to bet that 
                        no one did. 

                                 JODI
                        That’s absurd, why are you doing this?

                                 WILL
                        No, you know what’s absurd is a 
                        closed casket at a Catholic 
                        funeral. I went to Sunday school 
                        enough to know that. The only 
                        reason that casket is closed is 
                        because there is no body in there.

           Will in his breakdown kicks over the casket. It falls open 
           and a BODY ROLLS OUT. Silence. Will realizes that this is all 
           real. Everyone stares at him horrified. He turns to them.

                                 WILL
                        I am sorry for your loss.
                            (turns to Sam)
                        Sam, I-

                                 SAM
                            (sooo upset)
                        Just go.

           Will nods and does.

           EXT. SAM’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Will knocks on the door. 

                                 WILL
                        Sam, please, I am so sorry, please 
                        just hear me out.

           Finally the door opens. It’s Jodi.

                                 WILL
                        I want to talk to Sam.
                                 JODI
                        She’s not here and she doesn’t want 
                        to see you. After what you pulled 
                        today, she has seen you for what 
                        you truly are: a monster.

                                 WILL
                        I’m really sorry about today, so 
                        your friend really died. That’s 
                        terrible. But, the other stuff was 
                        real, I know you did it all and 
                        Sam’s gonna see that.

                                 JODI
                        Don’t make this worse. She took the 
                        job, Will. She’s leaving. If all 
                        goes well this weekend, I am gonna 
                        go with her. And you’re gonna leave 
                        her alone or she’ll see these...

           Jodi tosses him pictures.

                                 JODI
                        Violent.

           It is of WILL PUNCHING THAT GUY AT THE BAR.

                                 JODI
                        Gay.

           ...WILL FREAKING THOSE GUYS WHILE MANDANCING.

                                 JODI
                        Child hater.

           ..WILL PEES ON A LITTLE KID.

                                 WILL
                        That never happened.

                                 JODI
                        The others did, so why would she believe 
                        you about that one? Just move on, Will, 
                        face it, you’ve been beat.

           Will stands there, speechless. Jodi closes the door.

           INT. WILL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Will, unshaven, rumpled clothes, looking like he hasn’t 
           bathed in a while sits in his office hearing a proposal. He 
           also looks like he has been drinking. It hits him.

                                 WILL
                        Oh, my god, I am a cockblocker. 
                        That’s my job. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILL (cont'd)
                        I get paid to cockblock people away 
                        from their dreams.

           This revelation upsets him greatly. The COUPLE before him is 
           confused.

                                 SWEET COUPLE
                        So does that mean we can have our loan?

                                 WILL
                        Yes, yes, you can.

           They couple smiles. Will signs their paper.

           WE SEE A SUCCESSION OF LOAN APPLICANTS, MANY WITH DUBIOUS 
           PROPOSALS. Will approves them all.

                                 CRAZY LOOKING GUY
                        It’s called Sweater Island.

                                 WILL
                        Done.

           -ANOTHER.

                                 WILL
                        Approved. Live your dream.

                                 CONFUSED APPLICANT
                        Don’t you even want to see our 
                        application or hear the proposal?

                                 WILL
                        No, no I don’t.

           He signs it.

           -In the Bank Will’s boss who we saw earlier watches the 
           succession of PEOPLE walking happily out of Will’s office. He 
           sees a HOMELESS man walking out smiling. 

                                 MORRIS NORTHRUP
                        Excuse me, did you just get a loan?

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        Yeah, that guys giving them out to 
                        everyone.

           Concerned, he barges into Will’s office.

                                 MORRIS NORTHRUP
                        Will, what is going on?

                                 WILL
                        What’s going on is I am done being 
                        a dream killer!

                                 WILL (cont'd)
                        I am not cockblocking people’s 
                        dreams anymore. Do you want a loan, 
                        I’ll give you one?

                                 MORRIS NORTHRUP
                        Are you drunk?

                                 WILL
                        Drunk is a strong word.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BANK - DAY 

           Will is escorted out by security carrying a box with all his 
           belongings. FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE UP.

           INT. WILL’S APT - A FEW DAYS LATER

           The BUILDING MANAGER lets Hamilton into Will’s place. 

                                 HAMILTON
                        Thanks, Pablo. Will! It’s Ham. 
                        Will? Are you okay?

           He finds Will sitting on the floor with a bottle of scotch. 
           He looks horrible.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Jesus. I haven’t heard from you. I 
                        called work and your boss said you 
                        were fired. What’s going on?

                                 WILL
                        What are you gonna evict me now? 

                                 HAMILTON
                        No, I’m not gonna evict you, I charge you 
                        ten dollars a month for rent.

           He takes the bottle away from him.

                                 HAMILTON
                        I’m making you some coffee and then 
                        you are gonna tell me what 
                        happened. But, first we’re gonna 
                        open some windows and you’re gonna 
                        take a shower, cuz...seriously.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

           Will and Hamilton sit up on the roof. Will drinks coffee.

                                 HAMILTON
                        You really kicked over the casket?
                                 WILL
                        Yeah, it was horrible, I don’t know 
                        what I was thinking.

                                 HAMILTON
                        That guy was making you crazy is 
                        what you were thinking. Have you 
                        talked to Sam?

                                 WILL
                        She won’t talk to me. And Jodi threatened 
                        me if I go near her again.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Well, look I’m here for you 
                        whatever you need.

                                 WILL
                        Thanks. I guess I should start by 
                        apologizing to that poor family 
                        whose funeral I wrecked.

           INT. HAMILTON’S CAR - DAY

           Hamilton and Will drive to a house about an hour outside of 
           LA. 

                                 HAMILTON
                        This is pretty far out there. Why 
                        did they do the funeral in LA?

                                 WILL
                        I don’t know. This is where the 
                        funeral home said flowers and 
                        donations were to be sent.

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           Will and Hamilton walk up to a house. They ring the bell.

                                 HAMILTON
                        What are you going to say?

                                 WILL
                        I don’t know, sorry for wrecking 
                        your son’s funeral.

           The door opens...it’s the dead guy Marwan looking very not 
           dead. Will look at him. He smiles sheepishly.

                                 PATRICK (O.S.)
                        Dad. Who’s there?

           They look inside and in the background we see the deaf, dumb, 
           blind, kid, Patrick who Jodi made up a language with at his 
           Two Things class. He seems to have miraculously recovered.
                                 WILL
                        I thought your parents were killed in 9-
                        11?

           He now shrugs, guiltily.

           -Will and Hamilton sit in the living room with them.

                                 NOT DEAD MARWAN
                        My son and I are actors at the 
                        Temecula Playhouse. He came in and 
                        said he wanted to hire us for a 
                        job. Said it was some experimental 
                        thing. Hey, a job’s a job.

                                 WILL
                        Where’s this playhouse?

           INT. TEMECULA PLAYHOUSE - DAY 

           Not Dead Marwan leads Will and Hamilton into the Playhouse. 
           In the theatre doing warm up exercises onstage we see: PRETTY 
           MUCH EVERYONE WE HAVE SEEN THE WHOLE MOVIE IS THERE -- the DJ 
           from the Karaoke place, the guy Will punched out in the bar, 
           all the Tough Guys from guy’s night, Mary Debbie, all the 
           kids from TWO THINGS, everyone is on stage looking at him. 
           Will’s jaw drops. He can’t believe it.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Whatever you are thinking right 
                        now. I’ll finance it.

           INT. ARCADE - DAY 

           Will and Hamilton walks right up to the table where the 
           COCKBLOCKING GUYS are sitting.

                                 WILL
                        I need your help.

           INT. WILL’S APT - DAY 

           Like the team from Sneakers or Mission Impossible the Cock 
           Blockers go through Will’s place. Milo sits at his computer.

                                 MILO
                        He hacked into your computer. So he  
                        had access to your email, all your 
                        files which is probably where he 
                        found your exes.

           Owen has been examining Will’s cell. He holds up a chip.
                                 OWEN
                        This was in your phone so he heard 
                        everything you said, could download 
                        all your phone numbers.

           Fredericks drops something on the table without saying 
           anything. 

                                 JIMMY
                        That was under your car, so he could 
                        track your movements. And I talked to 
                        those ex-girlfriends, they were all given 
                        gift  certificates to a free dinner if 
                        they came that night between those hours.

           Hamilton and Will listen in disbelief.

                                 JIMMY
                        This guy is the best we’ve ever seen.

                                 WILL
                        How’d you guys like to take him down?

                                 HAMILTON
                        And of course you would be handsomely 
                        compensated for your work.

           They all look at each other.

                                 MILO
                        Cockblocking a cockblocker? I like it.

                                 JIMMY
                        We’re in.

                                 WILL
                        So this is what we’re gonna do.

           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Sam sits in her room by herself. She looks sad. Jodi knocks 
           and then comes in.

                                 JODI
                        Are you okay?

                                 SAM
                        No, I’m not. I don’t know why this 
                        keeps happening to me. He seemed 
                        different. I really thought he was 
                        the one. But, what he did at your 
                        friend’s funeral. I am so sorry 
                        again. And I got the Earth Day 
                        event this weekend. I don’t have 
                        time to be upset about this. Will 
                        and I were supposed to go together.
                                 JODI
                        Why don’t I go with you? You 
                        shouldn’t be alone right now.

                                 SAM
                        You don’t have to do that. I’ve put 
                        you through enough.

                                 JODI
                        That’s what we do for each other. 
                        I’ll get a nice hotel room, we can 
                        watch old eighties movies, make 
                        smores. It will be just the thing 
                        to get your mind off this.

                                 SAM
                        Thanks, Jo.

           Out the window across the way we see Owen with a high density 
           listening device.

           INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Will, Hamilton, Jimmy, Milo and Fredericks listen.

                                 WILL
                        That’s where it’s gonna go down. 
                        But, we’re gonna pick the hotel.

           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - THE NIGHT BEFORE THE EVENT

           Jodi and Sam pack for the trip.

                                 JODI
                        Do you want to drive or do you want 
                        me to?

                                 SAM
                        You can, I am exhausted.

           Again across the way we see Owen watching/listening. He 
           speaks into his comms.

           INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Milo turns to Fredericks and hands him a device.

                                 MILO
                        The blocker’s car. Go.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Fredericks breaks into Jodi’s car and starts taking apart his 
           on board computer. We get the sense he has done this before.
           EXT. STREET ACROSS THE WAY 

           Owen watches. Jodi and Sam, bags packed, leave the apt.

                                 OWEN
                        They’re heading down, get out of there.

           INT. JODI’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Fredericks works like crazy to reassemble the on-board 
           computer and put it back. A drop of sweat rolls down his 
           cheek.

                                 OWEN (O.S.)
                        Thirty seconds.

           Fredericks is screwing it back on. 

                                 OWEN
                        Five seconds. GET OUT OF THERE.

           Fredericks puts in the last screw. Opens the door and dives 
           into the bushes right as Jodi and Sam walk out of her 
           building.

           He then realizes he forgot to lock it. He pushes his faux 
           lock thing right as Jodi hits his to unlock. He breathes a 
           sigh of relief as Sam and Jodi get in. Jodi starts plugging 
           an address into the GPS.

                                 SAM
                        So where are we staying?

                                 JODI
                        Someplace really classy, special. 
                        Worthy of my girl.

           Sam smiles. Jodi finishes plugging in the address.

           INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

           On his computer we see Milo has Jodi’s GPS system online. He 
           then plugs in a different address. Those directions pop up 
           posing as the ones Jodi asked for.

                                 MILO
                            (into his headset)
                        They’re heading to you. 

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        Good. 

                                 MILO
                        We’re on our way. And don’t worry 
                        we’ll beat them there. I sent them 
                        the scenic route.
           INT. JODI’S CAR - NIGHT

           Jodi and an exhausted Sam drive in the middle of nowhere. 

                                 SAM
                        How far is this place?

           Jodi looks at the GPS.

                                 JODI
                        Not too much farther.

                                 SAM
                        Good, because I am beyond exhausted. 
                        Planning this event, all the stuff with 
                        Will, I think it’s finally gotten to me.

                                 JODI
                        Don’t worry this place is really worth 
                        it, it’s very relaxing, you’ll love it.

           EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

           Jodi and Sam pull in. It’s a shady Sex Hotel with lot’s of 
           Neon and Velvet. Sam stares at it is disbelief.

                                 SAM
                        This is the special place you 
                        wanted to take me?

                                 JODI
                        No, ah, No.

                                 SAM
                        Isn’t this the address you put in?

                                 JODI
                            (looks)
                        Yes, but. We can go find the place 
                        I was gonna take you.

                                 SAM
                        No, I’m exhausted. This is fine.

           They get out. Jodi looks around suspicious. We see the Van 
           parked there. Owen watches from inside. He speaks into his 
           comms.

                                 OWEN
                        They’re here.

           INT. SHADY SEX HOTEL - CONTINUING

           Jodi and Sam walk in. SCANTILY CLAD MEN AND WOMEN of all ilks 
           hang in the lobby. A GUY IN A GIMP SUIT holds a bottle of 
           cologne.
                                 GUY IN GIMP SUIT
                        Some sexy man cologne?

                                 JODI
                        No, I don’t want any-

           Too late he already sprays Jodi in the face. Jodi coughs and 
           they go to get the room. After they are gone, the Gimp Guy 
           pulls off his mask. We see that it is Jimmy. He speaks into 
           his comms.

                                 JIMMY
                        Got him.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        Copy that.

           INT. SHADY SEX HOTEL, RESERVATION DESK - CONTINUING

           Jodi feels a little weird. They step up to the reception 
           desk. A DOMINATRIX WOMAN is the receptionist.

                                 JODI
                        Hi, can we get a room?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Name?

                                 JODI
                        Jodi Jamieson.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Yes, Mr. Jamieson we have your 
                        reservation. You’re room is ready for you 
                        just like you specified. All the oils, 
                        toys and assorted extras you asked for 
                        are already in the room.

           Sam looks at him. He doesn’t know what to say.

                                 JODI
                        I didn’t make a reservation here.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        That’s what they all say.
                            (winks at them)
                        You’re in the computer.

           Jodi moves the Reservation screen. He sees his name on it.

                                 JODI
                        Sam, I-

                                 SAM
                            (to the Woman)
                        Does it have a bed?
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Yes, mam, all our rooms have beds. 
                        Unless a customer doesn’t want one.

           She winks at Sam again. Sam just takes the key.

                                 SAM
                        This is fine.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Sam and Jodi are lead into the room by a BALDING BELLHOP WITH 
           A BALLGAG in his MOUTH. He opens the door for them. There is 
           only one heart shaped bed. Sam looks at him.

                                 JODI
                        I swear I asked for two queens.

                                 SAM
                        So you did make the reservation?

                                 JODI
                        Yes- just not here.

           The Bell hop leaves. Jodi is starting to sweat, whatever they 
           sprayed him with is starting to have an effect. Sam heads to 
           the bathroom to unpack her stuff.

                                 JODI
                        So look this isn’t perfect, but 
                        lets make the best of it. It’s 
                        pretty funny if you think about it. 
                        A new story to add to our 
                        collection. They still have a DVD 
                        player, we can still make smores 
                        and watch eighties films.

           Sam comes out, her face all washed.

                                 SAM
                        Jo, I am really tired-

                                 JODI
                        Come on, I am not letting you off 
                        that easy. I said I was gonna cheer 
                        you up and that is what I am gonna 
                        do. I got Ferris Bueller.

           Sam smiles. Looks at her watch.

                                 SAM
                        Okay, but just for like twenty minutes.

                                 JODI
                        And I also brought champagne to 
                        celebrate your big day tomorrow.
           Jodi starts to open up the box of graham crackers for the 
           smores. When out of the box he sees fly A COLORFUL BUTTERFLY.

                                 JODI
                        What the-

           It starts flying around him, Jodi starts swatting it. Then 
           IT’S HEAD GETS REALLY BIG, IT OPENS IT’S MOUTH FULL OF FANGS 
           AND FLIES AT JODY’S HEAD. He SHRIEKS.

                                 JODI
                        AWWWWWW, JESUS, FUCK!!!!

           He drops the graham crackers and cowers. Nothing. He opens 
           his eyes to see Sam just staring at him.

                                 SAM
                        What just happened?

           Jodi looks around. No killer butterfly.

                                 JODI
                        I thought I saw a bug in the 
                        crackers. But, no bug.

                                 SAM
                            (looking at him funny)
                        Okay.

           He knows something is wrong. He needs to get out of there.

                                 JODI
                        You know what, Sam, tomorrow is 
                        your big day. You should get your 
                        rest. I don’t want to keep you up. 
                        I’m just gonna get my own room and 
                        let you have your beauty sleep.

           Jodi grabs his stuff and is gone in a flash. Sam watches 
           after him, not knowing why he is being weird.

           INT. ROOM - NIGHT

           Will, Owen, Hamilton, Milo, Jimmy and Fredericks monitor the 
           camera in the hallway from another room. Will bumps fists 
           with the guys.

           INT. HALLWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           The Bellman with the ballgag now leads Jodi to another room. 
           Jodi is sweating profusely and walking funny. The wallpaper 
           is seeming to come alive.
           INT. ROOM - CONTINUING

           On the monitor they watch Jodi walking down the hall flailing 
           around swatting things that don’t exist. Will turns to Milo.

                                 WILL
                        So what’s in that stuff you gave him?

                                 MILO
                        It’s part Nyquil to make him drowsy, part 
                        pot to make him paranoid and a whole lot 
                        of acid to make him hallucinate. You know 
                        that fear drug from Batman Begins?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah.

                                 MILO
                        It’s kinda like that.

           INT. JODI’S NEW ROOM - CONTINUING

           The Ball Bag Guy opens the door to Jodi’s room. Jodi looks at 
           him he appears to have a Donkey head. Jodi scared just backs 
           into the room. We see a big mirror along one of the walls. We 
           move through the mirror and see all of our guys are watching 
           on the other side. 

           INT. SECRET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 WILL
                        Ready to do this?

           They all nod.

                                 WILL
                        Cue the gas.

           INT. JODI’S NEW ROOM

           Jodi unpacks in the room we see a hose come under the door 
           and a GAS start to emit. Jodi looks.

                                 JODI
                        What the fu-

           And he quickly passes out.

           INT. JODI’S NEW ROOM - LATER

           Jodi, dazed, opens his eyes. He is being chained to his bed. 
           He now has a ball gag in his mouth. It is dark. He looks up 
           and sees four GUYS DRESSED IN JESTER OUTFITS standing over 
           him. One has just placed something behind his ear. He starts 
           to struggle with the chains. 
           There is a black strobe light so everything looks really 
           freaky. One of the Jesters motions ssh. And then they leave.

           INT. SECRET ROOM - CONTINUING

           The guys walk in. We can see that they actually are dressed 
           as Jesters, Jodi wasn’t hallucinating that part. They nod at 
           Will. We see he is dressed as something but we don’t know 
           what yet. He starts to put on a headpiece.

           INT. JODI’S NEW ROOM - CONTINUING

           Jodi is chained to the bed and scared. He struggles with the 
           chains. The strobe lights go out. Suddenly, the TV COMES ON. 
           On it we see the bright happy and cheery opening credits to 
           the kid’s show CHESTER. 

                                 KIDS SINGING
                        CHESTER, CHESTER, WE LOVE CHESTER. 
                        HE’LL COME INTO YOUR ROOM IN THE 
                        MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN YOU’RE 
                        SCARED. HE’LL GIVE YOU A HUG AND 
                        MAKE YOU UN-SCARED.

           On screen we see scared kids in their beds and then A GIANT 
           BLUE FUZZY MONSTER with a big smile permanently frozen onto 
           his face climb through the window and hug the kids. They now 
           look un-scared. 

           Jodi however watches this absolutely terrified.

           The TV goes off. Darkness. Silence. Then the door creaks 
           open. A shaft of light. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. Loud like the 
           footsteps of the T-rex from Jurassic Park. And in walks 
           CHESTER. (It’s Will in the suit BTW.)

           Jodi sees him and his eyes go wide with terror.

                                 JODI
                            (muffled)
                        No. No.

           Chester stands before Jodi. Freaky frozen smile and all. He 
           puts one of those freaky deep voice changer things up to his 
           mouth and speaks.

                                 CHESTER
                        JODI...

           Jodi waits, frozen in fear.

                                 CHESTER
                        I’M GONNA FUCK YOU!

           Jodi under the ball gag SCREAMS. Terror in his eyes. Chester 
           starts to head towards Jodi. When the gas starts again.
           INT. JODI’S NEW ROOM - MORNING

           BANGING on the door. Jodi jolts awake. No chains, no Chester. 
           He just has a huge headache and is exhausted. More banging.

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Jo, Jo, open up.

           Jodi gets up and goes to the door. He slowly opens it. It’s 
           Sam. She sees him just out of bed. She’s annoyed.

                                 SAM
                        You’re not ready? We got to get going.

                                 JODI
                        Okay, just let me change.

                                 SAM
                        Okay, hurry up.

           Jodi closes the door. He wonders if that was real. As he goes 
           to change behind his ear we see a tiny tiny chip.

           EXT. PARK, SANTA BARBARA - DAY

           We see a big sign that says EARTH DAY 2008. It is a big 
           festival, carnival. There are carnival games, food. KID’S 
           CHARACTERS, FAMILIES walking around.

           Sam greets people. Jodi stands beside her. He is exhausted, 
           paranoid, he feels like he has had the worst hangover ever. 
           All of sudden, he hears...

                                 CHESTER (O.S.)
                            (booming voice)
                        JOOOODI!!!!!

           Jodi flinches and turns.

                                 JODI
                        What?!

                                 SAM
                            (makes a face)
                        I didn’t say anything.

                                 CHESTER (O.S.)
                        JOOOODI!.
                            (he flinches again)
                        You’ve been a bad boy!!!

           Jodi looks around all paranoid. Across the way we see Will 
           wearing a hat and sunglasses talking into a mini microphone. 
           Jodi doesn’t see him however. Will turns to Milo.
                                 WILL
                        These things work pretty well.

           Milo nods. Will goes back to the mike.

                                 CHESTER (V.O.)
                        I KNOW WHAT YOU’VE DONE, JODI.

                                 JODI
                        How do you know what I have done?

                                 SAM
                        Are you okay, Jo!

           The people Sam was talking to walk away. Jodi looks around 
           for Chester, the source of the voice. He doesn’t see him, but 
           he does see... MARY DEBBIE angrily heading their way.

                                 JODI
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MARY DEBBIE
                        Your abortion check bounced!

           Sam spittakes a slushie all over the ground. 

                                 JODI
                        Sam, she’s not pregnant.

                                 MARY DEBBIE
                        Not anymore after you made me get rid of 
                        it. Said you didn’t want no fat baby. 
                        But, at least you could pay for it.

                                 JODI
                        Sam, really.

                                 CHESTER (O.S.)
                        JOOOODI!!!

                                 JODI
                            (flinches)
                        Am I the only one that hears that?!

           Both Sam and Mary Debbie look at him like he is crazy.

                                 CHESTER (O.S.)
                        JOOOOODIIIIIIII!!!!

           Jodi looks around and then across the way he sees Chester 
           hugging kids. Jodi pissed runs towards him. He DIVE TACKLES 
           CHESTER and starts beating the shit out of him.

                                 JODI
                        YOU’RE NOT GONNA FUCK ME!
           All the kids starts to scream. Jodi looks up to see a gaggle 
           of children starring, terrified. They start to cry.

                                 SAM
                        What is wrong with you?!

                                 JODI
                        Last night, Chester came to me in 
                        the middle of the night and said he 
                        was gonna fuck me.

           The guy in the Chester suit takes off his mask.

                                 GUY IN SUIT
                        I have never seen you before, dude, 
                        but now I am gonna sue you.

           Jodi paranoid looks all around. He sees all the people he 
           hired throughout the film. All the people Jodi hired that we 
           saw at the theatre. Hamilton has now hired them and they are 
           here and heading towards him. Sam sees the not dead Marwan.

                                 SAM
                        Jo, isn’t that your friend that died?

           And then the TWO THINGS KIDS all looking healthy.

                                 SAM
                        And aren’t those the kids from your 
                        foundation?

                                 DOESN’T HAVE CANCER KID
                        He made me shave my head, gave me 
                        an extra fifty for it.

                                 SAM
                        What is going on?!!!

            Then Will is there innocently sipping a soda. Jodi sees him.

                                 JODI
                        You, you did this!

                                 WILL
                        Did what, Jo? I’m just enjoying 
                        Earth Day. Hi, Sam.

                                 JODI
                        This! Sam, he is trying to 
                        cockblock me away from you. He 
                        doesn’t understand our love?

                                 SAM
                        Our what? 

           Jodi doesn’t have a response. He slipped.
                                 SAM
                        What I’m trying to understand is 
                        why your dead friend is standing 
                        right over there, why those sick 
                        kids seem to be fine and why you 
                        just beat up a childhood icon and 
                        accused him of wanting to “f” you.

                                 JODI
                        Those are good questions.

                                 SAM
                        Everything Will said was true wasn’t it?

           Jodi is silent. Sam looks deeply sad.

                                 SAM
                        You did all that stuff? You have 
                        been “cockblocking” him.

                                 JODI
                        That’s because he’s not good enough 
                        for you, Sammers, none of them are.

           Sam just looks at him. She turns to go, then turns back and 
           punches him right in the face. Sam holds her hand hurt. 

                                 SAM
                        You broke my heart, Jo.

                                 JODI
                        Broke your heart, so you did love me?

           Sam turns to Will. Will pours out his drink and gives her the 
           ice for her hand. She looks at him. 

                                 SAM
                        You did all this?

           He nods. Now he is starting to feel bad.

                                 SAM
                            (disappointed)
                        Then you are no different than he was. 
                        The two guys who meant the most to me-

           She just turns and walks away. Will realizes he went too far.

                                 WILL
                        Sam.

           Will chases after her. Al Gore steps up on stage to speak.

                                 AL GORE
                        Everyone welcome to our Earth Day 2008 
                        event. We hope you are all having fun.
           Will tries to catch up to Sam through the crowd.

                                 AL GORE
                        But, what is important here is the 
                        message of coming together to solve 
                        one of the biggest problems we have 
                        ever faced.

           Will sees Sam getting away. He hops onto the stage. Al sees 
           him.

                                 WILL
                        Sir, do you mind?

           Al Gore sees Sam walking away. He nods. Will takes the mike.

                                 WILL
                        Sam.

           It booms throughout the place. Sam stops and looks.

                                 WILL
                        Sam, I am so sorry. You deserve so much 
                        better than what he did and what I did. 
                        And I am sorry for being up here on stage 
                        talking about this in front of everyone. 
                        Although I guess not really that sorry 
                        because I am currently doing it. ...I 
                        just didn’t want you to think all those 
                        bad things about me. Whether you ever 
                        talk to me again or not. 

           Sam stares up at him and listens.

                                 WILL
                        Before I met you my best friend astutely 
                        pointed out to me that my problem was 
                        that I was always dating girls that I 
                        thought I should date rather than who I 
                        really wanted to. That I was living the 
                        life that I thought I wanted rather than 
                        the one I really did. And then I met 
                        you. And he was right. I love that you 
                        don’t care about what people think about 
                        the way you dress and I love that my 
                        parents don’t like you -- believe me 
                        that is a major plus. And I love that 
                        you care about all of this more than 
                        anything else.

           Al Gore smiles. Out in the crowd, so does Sam.

                                 WILL
                        And most of all, Sam, I love you. And I 
                        promise you if you gave me another chance 
                        I would prove that to you every day. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILL (cont'd)
                        I guess that is all I have to say. 
                            (then looks at the crowd)
                        Global warming, it’s bad, give him 
                        money. Buy hybrids, recycle-

                                 AL GORE
                        You can go now, Will.

           Will nods. Then Al Gore leans in. 

                                 AL GORE
                        Go get her, son.

           Will smiles. He hops off the stage and goes to Sam. They look 
           at each other. 

                                 WILL
                        You’re not gonna punch me in the 
                        face are you?

                                 SAM
                        I was thinking the kidneys, but-
                            (Will laughs)
                        Might settle for a kiss. If it’s a 
                        good one.

                                 WILL
                        That’s a good tradeoff. For me at least-

           She cuts him off and kisses him. The Crowd smiles, applauds.

                                 AL GORE
                        All right, so back to the planet...

           Al Gore keeps talking. Will and Sam part. 

                                 SAM
                        I took the job.

                                 WILL
                        I heard. And coincidentally I’m out of 
                        a job, so maybe I could come with you 
                        and keep you company while I figure 
                        out what I want to do. Ham said he’d 
                        float me for a little bit.

                                 SAM
                        I’d like that.

           They smile at each other. Will puts his arm around Sam and 
           they start to walk off together right as Jodi comes back up.

                                 JODI
                        Hey, guys. Wow, Will, great speech. You 
                        showed me. Good stuff. See Sam I was just 
                        working on getting you two kids together 
                        the whole time. See how bonded you are now. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JODI (cont'd)
                        Not to brag, but I did that. No thanks 
                        necessary. I’ll just say you’re welcome and 
                        we can call it a day. Hey wanna go get a 
                        drink? I’m buying.

           They look at him in disbelief and start to walk off together.

           MUSIC STARTS TO PLAY AND THE CREDITS START TO ROLL.

           EXT. DESERT SET - DAY 

           We see a film crew with chairs that say GLADIATOR 2: NOT 
           REALLY DEAD. RUSSELL CROWE prepares for a scene where he 
           fights a tiger. A GRIP turns to the guy next to him.

                                 CREW GUY
                        Didn’t he die at the end of the first one?

                                 ANOTHER CREW GUY
                        Yeah, but apparently he wasn’t really 
                        dead. That guy’s so badass you can’t kill 
                        him. At the start of this one he claws 
                        his way out of the grave bent on revenge. 
                        And then spends the whole film killing 
                        everybody in Rome.

           He nods: makes sense. We see Jodi with the tiger Patrick 
           Swayze prepping for the scene. Crowe sits in his chair.

                                 JODI
                        Jesus H Christ, Crowe’s Nest, 
                        Patrick Swayze is just a pussycat. 
                        He’s not gonna harm you.

                                 RUSSELL CROWE
                        Mate, that’s a man eating tiger. 
                        That’s why god invented CGI.

           Jodi scoffs and goes and sticks his head right next to the 
           tiger’s to prove a point. He looks over at Russell Crowe.

                                 JODI
                        Balls up my friend. Nothing’s gonna-

           ALL OF A SUDDEN PATRICK SWAYZE BITES JODI’S HEAD. Russell 
           Crowe turns to a crew member.

                                 RUSSELL CROWE
                        I kept telling that jackass not to 
                        go near that tiger.

           As the tiger mauls Jodi we go OUT.
