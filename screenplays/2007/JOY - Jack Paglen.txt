           EXT. RAINFOREST WATERFALL - DAY

           TRIBAL MUSIC and VOICES in a foreign language beckon to CHAD 
           FLYNN (22, kinda handsome, kinda smart, in tribal make-up, 
           looking like a native of the Amazon). As the voices grow more 
           encouraging, Chad's ecstatic face turns inquisitive, then 
           alarmed, then downright terrified.

           CUE CANDY-LAND MUSIC: Music reminiscent of happy moments in 
           childhood. Probably xylophone.

           INT. HOSPITAL CRITICAL CARE WARD - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           A NURSE ushers a nervous YOUNG CHAD (8) and YOUNG JOY (6) in 
           to see DOUG (their father - 30's) and MARGARET (mother - 
           30's) lying in beds next to each other.

           Young Chad carries a small suitcase, wears too-big 
           sunglasses, and a hooded sweatshirt for a cape. Young Joy 
           wears mesh fairy wings, a fireman's helmet worn with the bill 
           forward, and carries a stuffed T-rex. Young Chad gapes at the 
           condition of his parents.

           Doug smiles despite the bandages, traction, and gunshot 
           wound. Margaret's head and shoulders are covered with 
           bandages.

           Margaret and Doug, chipper, try to out-chipper each other.

                                 MARGARET AND DOUG (IN UNISON)
                        Hi, kids!

           The children stand paralyzed at the door.

                                 DOUG
                        Ha. Wow. Come and give your father 
                        a hug.

                                 MARGARET
                        First give me a kiss.

           Young Chad looks at his sister, they decide to stay put.

                                 DOUG
                        Sorry about tonight, kiddo's.

                                 MARGARET
                        Yeah. We realize that Mommy and 
                        Daddy should find a better way to 
                        resolve our little arguments.

                                 DOUG
                        But we have a solution-

                                 MARGARET
                        That I'm sure the two of you will 
                        love-

                                 DOUG
                        We're getting a divorce!

           Chad's eyes widen with alarm.

                                 MARGARET
                        Isn't that great?

                                 DOUG
                        No more fights and no more 
                        problems, and we'll be much 
                        happier!

                                 MARGARET
                        What do you kiddo's think?

           Chad purses his lips, trying to keep strong for Joy.

                                 DOUG
                        We want you both to know... For 
                        sure for sure... That this has 
                        nothing to do with anything that 
                        you two did. Okay?

                                 MARGARET
                        Absolutely not. It's just that 
                        sometimes when you marry a complete 
                        bastard-

                                 DOUG
                        Or a raving bitch-

                                 MARGARET
                        Things don't work out no matter how 
                        hard you try.

                                 DOUG
                        Exactly.

           Joy's lip quivers.

                                 MARGARET
                        But even though we hate each other-

                        We both still love you. We both 
                        love you equal. That's why one of 
                        you is going to live with me-

                                 MARGARET
                        And the other with me-

           Chad grabs Joy's hand.

                                 DOUG
                        But don't worry. Please don't worry-

                                 MARGARET
                        Because whoever comes with me-

                                 DOUG
                        Will spend weekends and holidays

                        Will spend weekends and holidays 
                        with me.

           The kids look at each other, scared. Chad steps forward.

                        Can't Joy and I live together?

                        - But that wouldn't be fair to

                        half of it until whoever comes with

                        Fine. I get Joy, a new house, and 
                        three more years of child support.

           It's settled. Chad turns from his parents to his sister. She 
           grabs her fairy wings and starts flapping them. They don't 
           take her anywhere.

           TITLE CARD: JOY.

           INT. RE-ASSIMILATION OFFICE - DAY

           MS. FAKAD (40's, world-weary) sits at a cluttered desk, 
           smiling the smile of a bad airline steward. A map of the 
           world with colored thumbtacks hangs behind her.

                                 MS. FAKAD
                        Welcome home. Chad Flinn. You've 
                        done the world a great service, 
                        staying with the people of-
                           (she can't pronounce it)
                        -a foreign land and teaching them a 
                        better way of life and modern house 
                        construction.

           CHAD, dressed in khakis and a button-down, looks civilized 
           but for the bone necklace jingling on his neck.

           Over his shoulder hangs a leather tribal satchel, a small 
           suitcase rests in his hand.

                        They will remember your kindness 
                        and knowledge for generations...

           Ms. Fakad looks at a puppy calendar on the wall.

                                 MS. FAKAD (CONT'D)
                        You're home a month early.

                                 CHAD
                        It was time for me to leave.

           She couldn't care less, and keeps up her bored reading.

                                 MS. FAKAD
                        I'd like to address a few aspects 
                        of re-assimilation to look out for.
                           (flips the page)
                        Depression. Confusion. Heartburn. 
                        Insecurity. Fear of personal 
                        safety. Too many people. Too much 
                        trash. Unnatural odors. Deep 
                        irreconcilable loss. These feelings 
                        are typical, and we urge you to pay 
                        them no mind, as you must  re-
                        calibrate to life here. Home.
                           (the bad smile)
                        We try to make your re-adjustment 
                        as easy as possible...

           She slides an envelope across the desk. Chad opens it to find 
           a small stash of twenty dollar bills.

                                 CHAD
                        This could feed the entire village.

           Ms. Fakad removes a thumbtack from South America on the map. 
           Chad drops the money in his satchel. 

                                 MS. FAKAD
                        Here, it'll buy you lunch. Isn't 
                        that remarkable? 

           She ushers him to a door labeled "WELCOME ROOM."

                        On behalf of the American 
                        Missionaries of Modern Society I 
                        thank you, Chad Flinn.

           With that, she pushes open the door to reveal-

           INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           An empty room.

                                 MS. FAKAD
                        You don't have anyone to pick you 
                        up?

           He smiles at Ms. Fakad. Her fake smile meets his.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

           Chad steps through a door into the city-

           IT IS VERY LOUD. Taxicabs and SUV's hoard the streets. 
           PEDESTRIANS hurry along on their commute. There are too many 
           people. There is too much trash.

           Chad stands in the center of it all - in total shock. The 
           city sounds get LOUDER and LOUDER.

           Chad, unable to take it, steps back into the door.

           INT. RE-ASSIMILATION OFFICE BATHROOM - DAY

           On the sink rests a white powder wrapped in a leaf. Putting a 
           drop of water on his finger, Chad mixes the moisture into the 
           powder, and applies the resulting paint onto his face, adding 
           a third stripe to each cheek.

                                 CHAD

                        yamanemka.

           Nodding approval to himself in the mirror, he wraps up his 
           belongings, and faces the door.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        Too many people. Too much trash. 
                        Too much noise. All these feelings 
                        are typical.

           Chad steps forward.

NEW YORK CITY STREET - EVENING

           Chad walks down the street, in tribal make-up. He's a bit 
           hesitant, but the more he walks, the more confident his step. 
           Nobody pays him any attention.

           EXT. JOY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Chad BUZZES the buzzer again. Nothing.

                                 CHAD
                        Goddamnit, Joy.

           He buzzes. A HUGE BIKER GUY arrives behind him with a load of 
           2x4's.

                                 HUGE BIKER GUY
                        Move. Please.

                                 CHAD
                        Hey, um. My sister lives here, and 
                        I'm waiting for her to come home. 
                        Could you let me into the building?

           The Huge Biker Guy sizes him up, noting the make-up on his 
           face.

                                 HUGE BIKER GUY
                        Okay, but any funny business and 
                        I'll dislocate your head.

           Chad believes him.

                                 CHAD
                        Deal.

           INT. JOY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - LATER

           Sitting on the suitcase, Chad looks around - impatient.

           INT. JOY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - LATER

           Chad steps up to Joy's door and KNOCKS. Nothing. Across the 
           hall, stairs lead to the roof.

           EXT. JOY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - ROOF - LATER

           Tons of wood and nails and rope lay around. A colossal, 
           unidentifiable, half-constructed WOODEN STRUCTURE occupies 
           most of the roof.

           From up here, the city is beautiful. Chad stares for a 
           moment, then pokes his head out over the edge and spies-

           An open window into the apartment. Next to the fire escape. 

                                 CHAD 
                        Goddamnit, Joy.

           He creeps to the ladder, leaving his suitcase.

           Humming to himself for fear, Chad shimmies his way down.

           Reaching out his foot he opens a crack in the window. 
           Precarious. Chad hums LOUDER.

           INT. JOY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Chad wriggles the rest of the way in and slides to the floor. 
           He gives a small "Ha" of triumph.

           From the decor, Chad notes that his sister likes rock-
           climbing, Corey Haim circa 1986. On one wall is a map of the 
           world.

           Stepping to the map, Chad finds a stick figure labeled "Chad" 
           waving "hello" drawn in the jungles of Brazil. Chad smiles. 
           Tracing his finger up to Manhattan, he finds dozens and 
           dozens of dorsal fins drawn around the island. A stick figure 
           labeled "Joy" stands in the center of New York City. The 
           figure's arm is ripped off by a shark that's jumping out of 
           the water. Blood spews everywhere.

           Chad's rolls his eyes.

           Turning to the bed, Chad finds the stuffed T-rex.

                                 CHAD 
                        It's always a soap opera with her, 
                        isn't it, Prince Rex?

           Next to the toy an envelope is addressed: "To Whom It May 
           Concern."

           Grabbing it, Chad makes his way into the HALLWAY. From behind 
           a door a SHOWER RUNS and "MATERIAL GIRL" plays off cheap 
           speakers. Chad stops and listens for his sister.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        Joy? It's Chad. I've been ringing 
                        the doorbell for an hour!

           No response. He looks at the letter.

                        I'm gonna eat your food!

           IN THE LIVING ROOM: Chad scopes the place: lots of dumpster-
           dived furniture.

           A big white curtain, splitting the living room in half, hangs 
           partially open. On the other side is-

           A workshop. Tubes and wires. Lots of sawdust and carpentry 
           tools. A blowtorch. A cot. A Harley Davidson motorcycle. Yep. 
           In the living room.

                        Nice motorcycle.

           AT THE BATHROOM DOOR: The music stops. The shower stops.

           IN THE KITCHENETTE: Chad grabs a carton of milk, and reads 
           the letter:

                                 JOY (V.O.)
                        To Whom it May Concern. I really 
                        tried very hard to live. But, well-

           SOUNDS OF WET FEET PADDING-

           He turns around and sees THE HUGE BIKER rushing him in a wet 
           towel. Chad drops the letter and pastes himself to the wall-

                                 CHAD 
                        What the hell!?!

           The Biker whacks Chad's head with a motorcycle boot, milk 
           flies everywhere-

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        Ow!

           Chad scrambles out of the kitchenette, and slips down the 
           hall, Naked Crazy Biker Guy close behind him.

           The biker follows with a cinder block fist. No contest. 
           Lights out for Chad.

           CUE CANDY-LAND MUSIC:

           INT. CHAD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           MUTED SOUNDS OF A DOMESTIC SPAT.

           Young Chad's hands pack a small suitcase full of necessities: 
           underwear, T-shirts, a toothbrush. 

           Determined to take everything, Young Chad pauses at the 
           SCREAMING outside.

           Cracking open his door, he watches his parents fight-

           MARGARET SCREAMS in the living room holding a plate of 
           spaghetti and sausages, and throwing them at her husband-

           DOUG SCREAMS back at her, picking up salad off the floor and 
           throwing it at Margaret-

           Margaret throws the serving bowl, hits Doug. Doug throws the 
           wooden salad fork, hits Margaret.

           Chad shuts the door and stomps back to the bed.

           Chad contemplates a worn book: "The World on Your Allowance: 
           How to Live On Your Own Terms, And Your Own Budget!" Chad 
           adds it to the luggage.

                                 YOUNG JOY (O.S.)
                        Want tea?

           Young Joy wears her fairy wings and beat-up fireman's helmet. 
           She closes the door behind her.

                                 CHAD
                        No thanks, Joy.

                        fire-woman. Who're you?

           The fight outside escalates - CRASHING of plates.

           Chad locks the buckles on his case, his anger receding in the 
           presence of his sister.

                                 CHAD 
                        I'm the Incredible Hulk Han Solo 
                        from the Alemolo.

                                 JOY
                        Good to see you, Solo from the 
                        Alemolo. Want tea before your long 
                        journey?

           Chad cracks a smile.

           INT. JOY'S APARTMENT - DAY (PRESENT)

           Chad's eyes snap open. Attempting to sit up, he finds his 
           hands bound to the bed with motor tubing.

           Chad scopes the room - no sign of NakedCrazyBikerGuy. Pulling 
           against the tubes, Chad attempts a Houdini. No good.

           The BIKER (STEVIE, 40's, 6'8" of unhealthy living), now in 
           roadie clothes, steps into the hallway.

           Chad drops his head and plays dead. Not hearing anything, he 
           squints a peek-

           Stevie stands right over him, coffee mug in hand.

                                 STEVIE 
                        You think I'm a liar?

           Chad, frozen with fright, can't even blink.

                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        Do you think I'm a liar?

                                 CHAD
                        No?

                                 STEVIE 
                        Last night, when I let you in the 
                        building, I said - and I quote: 
                        "Any funny business and I dislocate 
                        your head." And, considering the 
                        evidence, it certainly looks like 
                        the appropriate course of action.

           Chad tries to dodge Stevie's grasp.

                                 STEVIE
                        Stevie. Nice to meet you.

           Stevie's arms constrict around Chad's neck.

                                 CHAD
                        I thought this was Joy Flinn's 
                        apartment.

           Stevie hesitates.

                                 STEVIE
                        What's it to you?

                                 CHAD
                        I'm her brother.

                                 STEVIE
                        Joy doesn't have a brother.

           Stevie constricts.

                                 CHAD
                        You may be misinformed. I'm me. 
                        Chad Flinn. I'm her older brother.

           Chad's about to get his head dislocated.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        We didn't hang out much! I've been 
                        in the Amazon for two years!

                                 STEVIE
                        Is that why all the make-up?

                                 CHAD
                        Uh, yeah. But, it's not make-up. 
                        It's Yamenemaka. It's supposed to 
                        help you perform courageous acts.

                        It's in my medicine bag...

           Chad nods his head towards the satchel on the floor. Stevie 
           moves to sort through it.

                        You knocked me out and you didn't 
                        look through my bag to find out who 
                        I was?

                                 STEVIE
                        Just because you're a trespasser 
                        doesn't mean I have to be one.

           Stevie finds the passport and compares Chad to his goofy 
           picture.

                                 CHAD 
                        Look. Stevie. There's been some big 
                        misunderstanding, and I'm sure it's 
                        Joy's fault. Look - I was gonna 
                        stay here. Until I get on my feet.

                                 STEVIE
                        She never mentioned it.

                                 CHAD
                        Well. I never talked to her about 
                        it.

                                 STEVIE
                        Then how do you know it's cool with 
                        her?

                                 CHAD
                        She's my sister.

                                 STEVIE
                        I'm her roommate. What about my 
                        feelings?

           Stevie leaves the room.

                                 CHAD
                        Um... How do you feel about me 
                        staying here, Stevie?

           Stevie comes back with coffee and the letter from last night.

                                 STEVIE 
                        Okay. I'm really sorry for knocking 
                        you out. That is not my best 
                        behavior. But, you scared the shit 
                        out of me.

                        If we're going to be roommates, we 
                        have to establish some rules, and 
                        rule number one is going to be that 
                        if you don't scare me, I won't hit 
                        you. Okay?

                        Okay.

           Stevie pulls the tubes. SNAP. SNAP. Chad touches his head.

                        I already said I was sorry.

                        You dropped this.

           Chad takes the offered letter.

                        It was in this room. This isn't my

                        She never tells me where she's

           Stevie shrugs.

           Letter in hand, Chad reads-

                        To Whom it May Concern. I really 
                        tried very hard to live. But, well, 
                        I can't anymore. People say that 
                        suicide is an act of violence.

                        I hope that you don't take it 
                        personally. I don't want to hurt 
                        anybody. Things are just too dumb. 
                        Well, here goes nothing: 

           Chad, still reading, pushes through the door onto the-

           EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Where it's raining. Hard.

                                 JOY (V.O.)
                        By the time you read this letter, I

                        concern. Yours in absence, Joy 
                        Flinn.

           Chad reads again as the rain drips onto the note-

           Chad looks up from the letter. His suitcase is soaked. 

                                 CHAD
                        Goddamnit, Joy. Why do you pull 
                        shit like this?

           The rain runs the paint off Chad's face.

           INT. JOY'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Unlocking the luggage, Chad finds it filled with water. 
           Stevie looks on.

                                 STEVIE 
                        Going somewhere?

           Chad throws his soaked clothes on the floor - SPLAT. SPLAT.

                        I spent all night trying to get 
                        into her house and her scary 
                        roommate knocks me out and ties me 
                        up and she leaves a note that 
                        starts up all the same shit all 
                        over again? I'm gonna find her and  
                        I'm gonna kick her ass!

           The telephone RINGS. The men share a glance. RING.

                        You remind me of your sister.

                        I appreciate the thought, because I 
                        assume you get along with her, but 
                        please never say anything like that 
                        again.

                        I'm not really that scary, am I?

           Chad sizes up Stevie. Yes. He's very scary.

           EXT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY

           Chad steps through the revolving doors. Stevie's biker 
           clothes are way too big... But somehow Chad pulls it off -

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           He moves past a hallway full of WOUNDED PEOPLE -

           INT. HOSPITAL - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Pressing DOWN on the elevator. He smiles weakly to an OLD 
           LADY ON OXYGEN.

                                 OLD LADY ON OXYGEN
                        You don't look too good.

           INT. MORGUE - LATER

           Chad steps in to find a whole bunch of drawers for dead 
           bodies lining the wall. Two tables with dead people on them - 
           one UNCOVERED FAT MAN, half-way dissected. Messy. And one 
           very small, COVERED BODY.

           Doug (50's, walks with a limp and a cane, wearing blood-
           covered scrubs) proceeds with the autopsy.

                                 CHAD
                        Dad?

           Doug jumps about three feet-

                                 DOUG
                        Ha. Wow. I thought you were one of 
                        the patients! You shouldn't do 
                        that. Chad?

           They stand, a little awkward. Then Doug crosses to Chad, 
           offering his hand. He notices the bloody latex glove, takes 
           it off, and offers it again. Chad accepts.

                                 DOUG (CONT'D)
                        Good to see you, Chad.

                        Good to see you, Dad.

                                 DOUG
                        How was your vacation?

                                 CHAD
                        It wasn't a vacation.

           Doug keeps shaking Chad's hand.

                                 DOUG
                        Were you making money?

           Chad sees where this is going and holds his ground.

                                 CHAD
                        It wasn't about the money. It was 
                        about helping people.

                        No. It's a... Pay no attention.

           Chad tries to pull away from the handshake, but Doug gives no 
           indication of easing up.

                                 DOUG

                        ill.

           Chad looks to the dead bodies. Doug notices.

                                 CHAD 
                        There are very unnerving and 
                        possibly unnatural odors in here.

                                 DOUG
                        What, they don't have dead people 
                        in the Amazon? Ha. Wow. Want to 
                        help your old man finish this one 
                        up?

           Doug finally lets go of the handshake. Doug moves to the 
           CADAVER. Starts poking. Chad turns a pastier shade of green.

                                 CHAD 
                        No. Thanks.

           Doug shrugs, and finds something of interest near the 
           cadaver's liver.

           ILL DINERS glance over at the blood-splattered Doug, and lose 
           interest in their tapioca. Doug and Chad sit together with 
           their coffees and tapiocas.

                        What do you think? Has she been 
                        pulling this crap the whole time I 
                        was gone?

           INT. DOUG'S HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           The place is 100% crazy Christmas. Doug, a SMILING CO-ED next 
           to him (both wearing snow-white clothes) hands Young Joy 
           (probably 8, in Goth-black) another present. Next to Joy 
           stands a pile - higher than she is - of Barbies, skis, golf 
           clubs, socks. It's ridiculous. Joy, depressed, slowly rips 
           the wrapping paper.

                                 DOUG
                        Isn't this the best Christmas ever? 
                        How much do you wanna bet that the 
                        Christmas at Mom's house is nothing 
                        like this. Did you like the bike?

                                 YOUNG JOY
                        Yeah.

                                 DOUG
                        And the SCUBA gear?

                                 YOUNG JOY
                        Yeah.

                                 DOUG
                        Do you think your Mom will take you

           Joy finishes opening the gift. It's a framed photograph of

                        Maybe, if you want to, don't feel 
                        like you have to, but, maybe you 
                        should talk to your mother about 
                        this? I'll call the other morgues 
                        in the city and see if anyone found 
                        a Jane Doe.

                                 CHAD
                        C'mon. Seriously, this is Joy. 
                        There's no reason to-

                                 DOUG
                        Chadsworth.

           Chad, guilty, nods acceptance of the plan, and gets up to 
           leave.

                                 DOUG (CONT'D)
                        Son?

           Chad turns. Doug offers his handshake hand. Sighing, Chad 
           takes it.

           INT. MARGARET'S HALLWAY - DAY

           The elevator BING'S open. Chad stands, looking at the door to 
           his mother's apartment. Chad reaches to knock, then 
           hesitates.

                                 CHAD
                        C'mon. You missed your Mom, at the 
                        very least, your Mom.

           KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK.

                                 MARGARET (O.S.)
                           (singsongy)
                        Helloooo? Who is it???

           Before Chad can answer, MARGARET opens the door. (Now in her 
           50's, she's halfway through the crisis which is her life.

           The left half of her face, where she was once burned, is 
           badly scarred.) She's wearing lingerie. Obviously expecting 
           someone else.

                                 CHAD
                        Mom?

                                 MARGARET
                        Chad?!?

           She SHRIEKS and slams the door in his face. 

                                 MARGARET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Goddess Gracious! When did you get 
                        back?!? Why didn't you call?!? Oh, 
                        you don't need to call, you're 
                        welcome here anytime! Just a 
                        second, let me get some clothes 
                        on...

           Her voice trails off... Chad's response finally hits in the 
           form of a deep shudder.

                                 CHAD
                        In the jungle, the kids see their 
                        parents naked all the time, so why 
                        the acid reflux? 

                                 MARGARET (O.S.) 
                        Hello, Chad! Hellooooo!

           The door opens again. Margaret, now robed, greets her first-
           born.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        I'm so sorry! I thought you were my 
                        spiritual advisor!

                                 CHAD
                        Um. Okay.

           Margaret hugs him. And takes a deep SMELL of him. Chad feels 
           even weirder.

                                 MARGARET
                        Ahhh. You smell like the forest!

                                 CHAD 
                        Thanks.

                        Yeah?

           Margaret continues to hug Chad, and doesn't look like she's 
           letting go.

                                 MARGARET
                        Did you find yourself?

                                 CHAD
                        What'dya mean?

                                 MARGARET
                        Did you become a pupil of the 
                        tribe's elders?

                                 CHAD
                        We were friends.

                                 MARGARET
                        That's very good. Did you 
                        participate in their ceremonies?

                                 CHAD
                        Some.

                                 MARGARET
                        Now, you can answer truthfully...

           Margaret hugs tighter.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Did you take peyote? As a part of 
                        their rituals? In their vision-
                        quests?

                                 CHAD
                        Mom? Peyote's a cactus. The Amazon 
                        is a jungle, not a desert.

           Margaret hugs her son in pride.

                                 MARGARET
                        Of course of course! So wise!

                                 CHAD
                        I built houses, Mom. I didn't do 
                        drugs.

                                 MARGARET

                        Mom? Could you let me go now?

           Chad steps back.

                                 MARGARET 
                        What, a mother can't be excited to 
                        see her boy? After... some years?

                                 CHAD
                        Mom, have you heard from Joy?

           Margaret tries to remember.

           INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - LATER

           The place contains the bounty of the most obvious 
           representations of global mysticism. Didgeridoo's and Tibetan 
           singing bowls. Incense and rose petals. The Buddha, Krishna, 
           and Jesus. Margaret, in an enormous wicker throne, reads 
           Joy's suicide note.

           Chad looks around the place. On the mantle are photographs of 
           Margaret: In Tibet. In a drum circle. Meditating with some 
           white guy dressed as a Zen monk.

           Margaret makes some kind of CHORTLE. Tears in her eyes, she 
           puts down the letter, closes her eyes, and takes a deep 
           breath-

                                 MARGARET 
                        She takes it too far! She takes it 
                        too far!

                                 CHAD
                        It's not legitimate.

           Margaret pays no attention.

                                 MARGARET
                        If you want to, don't feel like you 
                        have to, but maybe you should call 
                        your father about this.

                                 CHAD
                        I just came from his morgue.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh, you SAW him? First?

                                 CHAD
                        Mom, don't start that.

           Deep pain fills her and it comes out as a SCREAM, but the 
           pain changes, and she closes her eyes, and by the end of the 
           breath, it's a HUM, like a meditation. Horrible and tranquil 
           at the same time. Chad stares at her with confusion. When he 
           feels it's safe, he interrupts her meditation-

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        When was the last time you saw Joy, 
                        Mom?

           Margaret, mostly calm, has a spasm of pain.

                                 MARGARET 
                        A few months ago. It was her 
                        birthday, and I was giving her the 
                        family heirloom... 

           INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Margaret holds a chestnut box in her hands, stroking it 
           lovingly in front of Joy.

                                 MARGARET
                        ... Just like my mother gave to me 
                        when I turned twenty-one. 

           Joy (late teens) looks bad. Disregard makes her look homeless 
           - deep circles under her eyes and face shiny with sweat. Joy 
           SPRAYS Chloraseptic in her mouth. Once. Twice. Three times.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        It was something that I always 
                        loved, and she would even let me 
                        play with it when I was a child. 
                        Times were different then.

           Placing the box on the coffee table, she opens the top, and 
           reveals the Antique Civil War Service Revolver.

           Margaret smiles at this bonding moment. Joy eyes the gun. She 
           uses more Chloraseptic - 4 squirts. 5. 6.

           Margaret's smile wavers. Joy sprays her face. 7. 8.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        What is that, Joy?

           Joy sprays her arms. 9. 10. 11.

                                 JOY
                        It's Chloraseptic. A topical 
                        anesthetic.

                        (cid:13)           CONTINUED:

                                 MARGARET
                        Anesthetic? Are you in pain?

           Joy sprays her chest. 12. 13. 14.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        You know. They say that pain is 
                        only in your mind.

                                 JOY
                        Funny. I'm thinking of you.

           Margaret blinks at her. Laughs it off.

                                 MARGARET
                        Goddess Gracious, Joy. Don't be 
                        silly. This is a bonding 
                        experience. This weapon was given 
                        to your great-great-great-
                        grandmother by her husband's 
                        commanding officer.
                           (stroking the phallic 
                            weapon)
                        She loved it, much like she loved 
                        her husband before he was killed.
                        It's a symbol of unity and love in 
                        the family.

           Joy grabs the gun - tests its weight. She loads a bullet, 
           locks the magazine, and cocks the hammer, aiming it at 
           Margaret's head. Margaret's smile wavers.

                                 JOY
                        The action's great.

           Joy starts laughing. Margaret, hesitant, laughs. Joy sprays 
           more Chloraseptic. Her laughing stops abruptly. Margaret's 
           smile fades.

           INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - DAY (PRESENT)

           Chad, still by the window, can't believe what he's hearing-

                                 CHAD
                        You gave her Nana's gun?

                                 MARGARET
                        Of course I did. She was lonely. 
                        Desperate. She was in pain. 
                        Suicidal, even.

                        Wow. So I called around to the 
                        different hospitals. There's a Jane 
                        Doe. It might be Joy.

                        the river. It might be Joy. You 
                        need to meet me.

           Guilt sets in on Chad.

                                 MARGARET
                        Tell him not to call here.

                                 CHAD 
                        I'll be there in fifteen.

           He hangs up.

                                 MARGARET
                        Why didn't you tell him he was a 
                        bad father?

                                 CHAD
                        He thinks they found Joy's body.

           Margaret lets out the SCREAM of fear that turns into the HUM. 
           She disappears into a meditation. Chad shakes his head and 
           finds his way out.

           INT. MORGUE IN LESSER HOSPITAL - DAY

           An ORDERLY looks over his shoulder as he pushes a table with 
           a CADAVER.

           Doug, limping on his cane, and Chad stop in front of the 
           doors leading to the holding room. Scary. Chad looks at the 
           double doors, then to the elevator.

                                 CHAD
                        This isn't like when she pretended 
                        to have bone-marrow cancer, is it?

                                 DOUG
                        No. I don't think so, Chad.

           Chad nods, and follows his father through the DOUBLE DOORS-

                        I'm Dr. Douglas Flinn. This is my 
                        son, Chad. We're here to see the-

           She pulls off her face mask, revealing a big smile, charming. 
           Especially charming to Doug.

                                 DR. STACY
                        It's such a pleasure to meet you 
                        Dr. Flinn, I'm Dr. Stacy Waters - a 
                        great admirer of your work. Last 
                        September? The No Known Cause that 
                        I sent you? You found out it was an 
                        H2O overdose?

                                 DOUG
                        That was you? I'm impressed. I 
                        couldn't have done it without you - 
                        really great notes. Really great. 
                        And your penmanship-

                                 DR. STACY
                        Oh, thank you. Well. It's not 
                        information unless you can read it - 
                        that's what I always say.

           Chad sees the sparks starting to fly-

                                 CHAD
                        Is that my sister?

           He points to the covered body. Dr. Stacy's eyes widen at 
           Doug, who nods solemnly.

           The doctors ease into business mode. She compares information 
           between clipboard and toe-tag.

                                 DR. STACY 
                        Please remember, gentlemen, that 
                        she was found in the East River two 
                        days ago and-

                                 DOUG
                        -Although she's been on ice, she's 
                        probably still going to have some 
                        bloating and decomposition...

           Chad stands away from the body. Nods. Doug lifts the sheet 
           and immediately drops it again.

                                 DOUG (CONT'D)
                        My god. She gained so much weight.

           Chad tries to catch up-

                                 CHAD
                        Wait, what? It's... her?

           Chad watches Doug cover his eyes with stoic grief. Dr. Stacy 
           lends a supporting hand.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        Oh, no. Oh no. Oh-no-oh-no.

           Chad inches to the body. He looks pale. Then green. Doug 
           looks up to him, and lifts the sheet for him.

                                 DR. STACY
                        Is this your sister?

           Chad's fear turns to confusion. Pulling back the sheet, he 
           checks the body's genitalia.

                                 CHAD 
                        What are you doing? That's not my 
                        sister. It's not even female!

           The two doctors follow his gaze "down there."

                                 DR. STACY
                        I am so sorry.

                                 DOUG
                        Considering the evidence, I 
                        understand the confusion. Ha. Wow.

                                 CHAD
                        What the fuck kind of operation do 
                        you run here!?!

           Dr. Stacy scours her clipboard-

                                 DR. STACY
                        This client was brought in as a 
                        female- pulled out of the river- I 
                        don't understand-

           Chad steps away and takes a deep breath. Doug, for some 
           reason, starts LAUGHING. Big great guffaws.

                                 DOUG
                        And I thought the orderlies at my 
                        hospital were jokers!

                        If she's leaving suicide notes 
                        maybe she deserves some attention.

                                 CHAD
                        What are you implying? I've been in 
                        the Amazon!

                                 OFFICER WHITE
                        Okay. I'm just saying that if she's 
                        passed-

                                 CHAD 
                        Look. Can you find her?

                                 OFFICER WHITE 
                        Okay. Listen. We don't like to post 
                        suicides. If it goes public, it 
                        encourages others to consider it a 
                        viable option.

           From under the desk someone SNEEZES. Officer White 
           immediately grabs a tissue and passes it under her desk.

           Chad angles his head down to see, under the desk, TIESHA 
           WHITE (8) blowing her nose, miserable and bored, huddling in 
           a blanket.

                                 OFFICER WHITE (CONT'D)
                        She's sick. No baby-sitter. Please 
                        don't mention it.

           Chad grabs a coffee stirrer and a tissue.

                                 OFFICER WHITE (CONT'D)
                        We'll file a missing persons report 
                        for you. Our local squad will 
                        investigate it for five days. 
                        They're swamped and under-paid. So  
                        be patient.

                                 CHAD
                        For five days?

                                 OFFICER WHITE
                        Then it'll go downtown. If you want 
                        to, you can help us by reading her

                        Call all the people she knows. 
                        Check bank records, credit cards.
                        They might tell you she's 
                        vacationing in Florida. That 
                        happens. You're gonna want to read 
                        her diary-

                                 CHAD
                        Read her diary?

                                 OFFICER WHITE
                        Don't stress it. Do you keep a 
                        diary?

                                 CHAD
                        No.

                                 OFFICER WHITE
                        Then you wouldn't know that 
                        everyone who keeps a diary secretly 
                        wants it to be found, and hopes it 
                        will become a best-seller. That's 
                        the reason people write diaries. So 
                        it's not really an invasion of 
                        privacy.

           Tiesha SNEEZES again. Officer White passes Tiesha a tissue -

           INT. JOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           (NOTE: THE FOLLOWING V.O. OF JOY HAPPENS OVER THE ACTION OF 
           THE SCENE, AND SYNCS WITH THE JOURNAL AT THE END.)

                                 JOY (V.O.)
                        Dear Diary, boy that was a stupid 
                        opening. Should I write in pencil 
                        to erase? No. That's for woosies. 
                        Goddamnit I just wrote woosies in 
                        this book that I spent like forty 
                        dollars on.

           The mail, opened and read, lays scattered all around. Chad 
           rummages through the rest of the room - leaving a mess.

           Sorting through snapshots of PRINCE T-REX, Chad finds one of 
           Joy with another YOUNG WOMAN (INGRID) - from High School. 
           Chad drops the photograph in his satchel.

           In the closet, Chad finds the chestnut box. Opening it, he 
           finds the revolver.

                                 JOY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Okay. Starting over: This journal 
                        is to keep a super secret permanent 
                        record of my secret thoughts and 
                        dreams. For posterity. So that one 
                        day, when this mortal coil fails, 
                        or I shake it off or whatever, my 
                        thoughts will have been 
                        immortalized.

           Scanning the messy room, his eyes settle on the bedside 
           drawer. He eases it open.

           Lots of medications.

           Puzzled, Chad reads some of the labels: VITAMIN C, 
           CHLORASEPTIC, NICOTINE GUM: the contents of a drug-store 
           stuffed into the drawer.

                        And then my granddaughters may one 
                        day find it, and cry with missing 
                        me, and publish it, and maybe it 
                        will become a best seller - a piece 
                        of widely-read literature to usher 
                        in a new epoch in these chronicles 
                        of the human species. That'd be 
                        cool... 

           Rummaging deeper, Chad finds a book. It's expensive. The 
           cover reads: "JOY'S SECRET DIARY." He opens it to the first 
           page.

                                 JOY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Dear Great Granddaughters: Feel 
                        free to edit as you see fit. Strike 
                        out all the "Dear Diary" and 
                        "woosies" stuff. Keep "new epoch." 
                        You get the idea. Wow. I've filled 
                        this whole page already. That's 
                        enough for today.

           Chad flips to the next page. Blank. And every page after that 
           is blank.

           In the back cover a scribbled note reads "OTCDAA - 142 W. 
           10th. 7 PM"

           Chad sinks onto the bed, exhausted. He picks up T-Rex, 
           cradles it, and closes his eyes.

                                 CHAD
                        Think about the forest. Think about 
                        the forest. Think about the forest.

           He thinks about the forest. Cringes.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        Fine. Don't think about the forest. 
                        Think about the great explorers. 
                        Think about architecture. Think 
                        about...

           Chad cracks his bedroom door open.

           THE LIVING ROOM is a mess. Dinner splattered everywhere, 
           broken glasses and plates. The parents continue to FIGHT AND 
           SCREAM.

           Margaret runs through the dining room-

                                 MARGARET
                        QUIT FOLLOWING ME!

           Doug chases after her-

                                 DOUG
                        DON'T GO WHERE I'M GOING!

           The parents disappear into the bedroom. Chad turns to Joy 
           with a strategy.

                                 YOUNG CHAD
                        We need to make it to the basement 
                        door ASAP!

                        Rollo, pollo Commander Solo.

           They drop to their bellies and slither out of the room. Joy 
           goes first. Chad pulls his suitcase.

           MARGARET backs out of the bedroom, aiming the antique civil 
           war service REVOLVER.

                                 MARGARET
                        I've got my Grandmother's gun! I

                        HA! Missed! Two can play at that 
                        game!

           Joy stops. Chad stops. They watch their mother run into the 
           living room.

           A FLICKERING LIGHT erupts in the bedroom. Chad turns to see-

           antique WWII flame thrower, its pilot light, a foot high, 
           flicks hysterically.

           Chad moves forward, bumping into Joy, who lays frozen on her 
           belly - fascinated by her parents' mania.

           She doesn't. He tries to pull her, but she's mesmerized by 
           the fire.

           Margaret respond with a BLAM!

           Doug dodges. He, in turn, pulls the trigger. WHOOSH! A stream 
           of burning oil sprays into the living room.

           Chad manages to stand up and drag Joy by her arms to the 
           basement door. He squeezes her in, the door closing behind 
           them.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Chad's eyes dart around the dining area. Taking a seat, 
           opening Joy's Diary, he finds the photo of JOY and the GIRL 
           in high school. He flips to the back page: OTCDAA 7 PM.

           Chad turns to find INGRID GROUSWITH (The girl from the photo. 
           20's, dramatic) smiling. Behind her hover GARY and ROB (20's, 
           filmmakers) Gary has a video-camera and Rob has a microphone, 
           they film everything that Ingrid does.

                                 CHAD
                        Hi. Ingrid?

                        Yeah! So good to see you! God it's 
                        been so long! Since I was in high 
                        school? How did you find me?

                                 CHAD
                        I called your mom.

           She gives him a hug. Gary moves in for a close-up of Chad.

           Chad turns to Rob, who shakes his head violently and waves 
           for him to continue with Ingrid.

                                 INGRID
                        Pay no attention to them. They get 
                        pissed.
                           (stage whisper)
                        They're making a documentary of my 
                        life.

                                 INGRID
                        Well, I'm an actress. And they're 
                        following me for a year to see how 
                        I do.

                                 CHAD
                        How long has this been going on?

                        Eleven months.

           He looks to Gary, focused into the viewfinder. Rob stares 
           intensely at him, adjusting the microphone.

                                 CHAD 
                        Have you been in anything so far?

                        No. But I feel like something big

                        Sorry. I signed a contract. They

                        sorry! It's all my fault!

                                 CHAD
                        What?

           Ingrid cries into her hands. Pulling herself together, she 
           looks up-

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           The way Ingrid remembers it: Like a high school play. The set 
           is dark and dreary. More medieval dungeon than urban school. 
           Ingrid (too pretty) and Joy (too ugly) walk down the hall 
           (across the stage) to their next class.

                                 INGRID (V.O.)
                        In high school, I protected her.

           One BOY tries to cut Joy with a knife. Ingrid kung-fu's him.

                        Joy was a bit of an outcast.

           A spotlight lands on Joy in the center, hundreds of hands 
           point at her and there's UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. Ingrid steps 
           into the light and stands in front of Joy. Joy cowers behind 
           her.

                                 JOY
                        Thank you so much for being my 
                        friend, Ingrid. I would just KILL 
                        MYSELF if I didn't have you to 
                        confide in, study with, and plan 
                        how to survive the cold, cruel 
                        world of adulthood that we face 
                        when we finish here at Brankley 
                        High.

           The two sit down and open their math books. Light comes up to 
           reveal an American Model Home set. Ingrid looks out at the 
           audience.

                        But. Alas. These were my formative 
                        years, and I had my own plan on 
                        surviving life after Brankley. I 
                        saw I needed to form into someone 
                        who was popular. Who was 
                        passionate. Who was rich. And then 
                        it came...

           Ingrid leaves the study session, and despite Joy grabbing her 
           hand and trying to pull her back, Ingrid can't help but mug 
           before the audience.

                        And it changed everything about me. 
                        My whole life...

           TEENAGERS dressed as the LOMAN FAMILY file onto the stage for 
           curtain call. Ingrid joins them in a robe.

                        have to say - it was a tour de

           The high school cast pushes Ingrid almost into the wings, but 
           she's still rapt at the thrill of it. Ingrid stays on-stage 
           bowing, even as all the other kids file back into the wings.

           Joy, still upstage, still studying, looks up and stares at 
           Ingrid.

                                 INGRID (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Joy never really understood me 
                        after I found my passion.

                                 JOY
                        I don't really understand you now 
                        that you've found your passion.

                                 INGRID
                           (to Joy)
                        I have to focus on my career. As I 
                        become more and more successful, 
                        I'm going to have to leave people 
                        behind, because they'll no longer 
                        want me as friends, but want my 
                        money and my fame and tell 
                        embarrassing stories about me to 
                        the tabloids. So: Joy. For the sake 
                        of my future fame, we can't be 
                        friends anymore.

           Joy sighs, puts on a winter coat, as stage snow falls on her. 
           Then the sound of THUNDER...

                                 INGRID (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And so Joy fell into obscurity, 
                        having no real friends... She was 
                        lost, depressed, alone and 
                        forgotten.

           The lights fade on Joy into black. Ingrid is left alone on 
           the stage.

                                 INGRID (CONT'D)
                        That's probably why she killed 
                        herself... And that's how I know 
                        it's my fault. I was her only 
                        friend.

           Chad, about to speak, thinks better. Ingrid looks dramatic.

           The HUM of the copier as it spits out page after page. Chad 
           examines a sample.

           THE PHOTO OF JOY (Ingrid's image ripped off) is followed by:

           Chad checks the address against Joy's journal, then tapes one 
           of the Missing posters to the doorway.

           The place is deserted. Chad puts up another Missing poster. 
           Hearing people MUMBLING downstairs, he follows-

                        Hi. Hollis. I'm... Um... Chad.

           KATIE (40's, the encouraging leader) takes control of the 
           group.

                                 KATIE
                        Everyone please sit down, we're all 
                        set to begin. Good to see a new 
                        face.

           The dozen of them glance at Chad and sit down. Chad smiles 
           politely and waves.

                                 HOLLIS
                        Bis is Chad. He'b a briend of Bill 
                        Boubleyewb.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Hello Chad.

           Suddenly, Chad realizes who "Bill W" is.

                                 CHAD
                        This is a twelve-step program?

                                 KATIE
                        Yes. You're in the right place. 
                        Would you like to start today, 
                        Chad?

                                 CHAD
                        No thank you. I'm um... I can't 
                        believe this is happening...

           Everyone CHUCKLES.

                                 KATIE
                        We know exactly how you feel.

           Chad shrinks into his chair.

CHURCH BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Hollis discusses his hard time as snot drips down his face. A 
           concerned man, TIM (30's), nods his head in mutual 
           experience.

                                 HOLLIS 
                        - So ben I'd but on some muscle 
                        soothers, and that would bake be 
                        debressed and so I would take a 
                        dozen No Doze, but that bould make 
                        me jumby, anb so I would take more 
                        Byquil... And on and on and on.

           A big bubble of snot. Tim hands Hollis a tissue, which Hollis 
           uses to dab the tears from his eyes, ignoring the snot. 
           Chad's stomach turns.

                                 HOLLIS (CONT'D)
                        And now... Being here bith you

                        taught bat to be. Bank you. Bank 
                        you.

           Everyone claps. Chad looks to the EXIT sign. He's about to go 
           when-

                                 KATIE
                        Hollis. You, right now, are most 
                        certainly providing a role model 
                        for some of the newer folks here at 
                        Over-the-Counter Drug Addicts 
                        Anonymous.

           Everyone turns to smile at Chad. Chad sinks lower into his 
           chair.

           TUNA (a short bald man, 40's, with a hairy neck) comes in 
           holding one of the MISSING signs.

           Tuna passes the sign among the circle. They confer quietly. 
           Chad sits up.

                                 TUNA (CONT'D)
                        It isn't just us that's been 
                        missing her. Something might have 
                        happened to Joy! I swear to my 
                        higher power if I ever meet the 
                        people who did this to her!

           Chad decides to stay silent.

                                 TUNA (CONT'D)
                        I feel responsible. Being her 
                        sponsor and everything. Because 
                        really, in many ways... She 
                        became... My sponsor.

                                 TIM
                        Do you think she went back? Hit the 
                        drugstore?

           The question blankets the group in silence. Chad is riveted.

                                 TUNA
                        Even the strongest of us can 
                        fumble. Like the last time. She was 
                        really bad-

           Chad leans in.

           INT. PHARMACY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Joy (in bad withdraw) sits on the floor of aisle 3 - 
           surrounded by choice after choice of cold-relief and aspirin. 
           She's crying, stuffing package after package into her 
           shopping basket, when one fills, she fills another.

                                 TUNA (V.O.)
                        She called me from a pay phone, 
                        warning me where she was going.

           She wipes the whole row of ibuprofen off the shelf. Most 
           spills onto the floor. As her desperation turns to rage, she 
           wipes off more and more shelves.

           SAM, a bean-stalk employee (17), discovers her. 

                                 SAM
                        Lady, what are you doing? I just

                        You don't know!

           Joy falls to the floor amid the aspirin and B-12 supplements.

                                 SAM 
                        Lady. Sometimes. When it's really 
                        bad, I like to do push-ups... Would 
                        you like to do push-ups?

           Sam demonstrates push-ups. Joy, crying and snotty, starts 
           doing push-ups. She gives up.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Sometimes girls don't have the 
                        upper body strength, and they need 
                        to assist themselves by putting 
                        their knees down. Like this.

           Sam demonstrates the girl push-up. Joy tries a few. Below her 
           head gleams a bottle of chewable vitamin C.

           Giving in, she unwraps the plastic foil, pops open the top, 
           removes the goddamn cotton ball, and pours the entire 
           contents into her hand. As she moves to stuff them in her 
           mouth-

                                 TUNA (O.S.)
                        JOY!!! WAIT!!! THINK ABOUT WHAT 
                        YOU'RE DOING!!!

           Joy looks up to find Tuna, standing next to Sam, pleading to 
           her reason.

                                 JOY
                        Tuna. I'm sorry. I. Just. Can't...

                        Thera-Flu, next month you'll find 
                        yourself surrounded by 60 empty 
                        bottles of Chloraseptic - feeling 
                        nothing.

                        I don't care, Tuna. I don't care. 
                        Life's just too hard to go on 
                        without the promise of the help of 
                        over the counter drugs...

                                 TUNA
                        Joy. The easier life isn't the 
                        better life. Find the presence of 
                        God. Or whatever you believe to be 
                        your higher power. And give it up 
                        to him, her, or it. You cannot bear 
                        this burden alone. That's the step 
                        I had trouble with... That's the 
                        step... You taught me.

           Joy finally nods, and slowly puts the tablets down.

           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY (PRESENT)

           The group is rapt at the story...

                                 TUNA
                        And I think she really heard me. 
                        Like from over a canyon. Cause she 
                        dropped that vitamin C and let me 
                        walk her home.

                                 TIM
                        I love that story.

                                 CHAD
                        When was that?

           The group looks at Chad.

                                 TUNA
                        What?

                                 CHAD
                        When did that happen?

           He's aware that it's a weird question.

                                 TUNA
                        Like three months ago? She got back 
                        on track. Came to all our meetings. 
                        Until a few weeks ago.

                                 CHAD
                        What would set someone off like 
                        that?

           People raise eyebrows. Chad, afraid of revealing too much, 
           backpedals-

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        It's just that. If she was your 
                        mascot and all, I mean, I'm worried 
                        about her.

                                 TUNA
                        Yeah. We're all worried about her. 
                        Maybe we can pray to our higher 
                        powers for her safety and 
                        supplement free health.

           Everyone nods in agreement. Chad sinks back into his seat.

           EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

           The meeting adjourned, the group files out and Chad awkwardly 
           shakes hands and gives hugs goodbye.

                                 KATIE
                        Some of us are gonna try to catch 
                        the three dollar Margarita special 
                        down at El Mucho's. What'dya say? 
                        We could probably slam five or six 
                        before it goes full price in a half 
                        hour...

                                 CHAD
                        Are we allowed to drink?

                                 KATIE
                        Sure. I mean, we're not alcoholics.

           INT. EL MUCHO'S - NIGHT

           Dozens of empty Margarita glasses clutter the table. Katie, 
           passed out, looks content. Tuna sits against the wall, 
           probably in a blackout. Tim slurps the last of his glass. 
           Chad, drunk, can't keep from babbling-

                        And then the village invited me to 
                        join the tribe. I was so touched. 
                        But when I was on the cliff, the 
                        last step of the ritual, wearing 
                        the traditional Yamenemaka paint. I 
                        choked. They wanted me in their 
                        TRIBE, man! Next thing I know 
                        I'm... back here.

           Tim tries to focus on Chad.

                        You need therapy.

           They both laugh. Tim gets drunkenly serious.

                        I don't think so.

                        What, you don't believe me? She's 
                        great! Joy referred me.

           Chad sobers instantly.

                                 CHAD
                        Joy was in therapy?

                                 TIM
                        Yeah. She went on and on about how 
                        great it was... So I tried it.

                                 CHAD
                        Yeah. Maybe... I mean, I don't know 
                        what I'm saying.

                                 TIM
                        That's why you should get therapy.

                        Therapy really helps... Look at me!

           Tim proposes a toast to himself, but Chad's already gone.

           refrigerator) to where she has a tea party set up with all 
           her STUFFED ANIMALS.

           Above them, they hear their parents: BLAM! BLAM! CLICK!

                                 DOUG (O.S.)
                        Ha! No more ammo! What're you gonna 
                        do? What're you gonna do!?!

           WHOOSH!

           Joy and Chad play as the sounds continue.

                                 YOUNG JOY
                        Please, honor guest of excellency, 
                        take a seat here...

           Chad drops his suitcase as Joy sits him on a towel.

                                 YOUNG JOY (CONT'D)
                        My minions tell me that you just 
                        crawled out of the desert, and are 
                        thirsty.

           From the ceiling they hear-

           FOOTSTEPS running. The children listen. Chad commits to play.

                        Yes. Your minions are right. I've 
                        crawled through the great deserts 
                        of Titicaca, and it took me seven 
                        years, and I'm a little parched.

           Joy instructs T-Rex-

                                 YOUNG JOY
                        Prince Rex, please show our guest 
                        the fine selection of tasty 
                        beverages.

           T-Rex sits there-

                                 YOUNG JOY (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry for my son's rude 
                        behavior. He's mad because I make 
                        him learn Portuguese.

           Moving to the refrigerator, she grabs the handle. They're 
           interrupted by sounds from upstairs-

                                 DOUG (O.S.) 
                        Ha! Wow!

           BLAM! BLAM! Suddenly, the basement door EXPLODES with a 
           bullet hole.

                                 DOUG (O.S.)
                        Ow! You shot me! You shot me in the

           Chad turns back to Joy, who's still looking up at the door.

                                 YOUNG CHAD
                        How are the Portuguese lessons 
                        going?...

           Joy loses the fantasy.

                                 YOUNG JOY
                        I don't wanna play any more.

                                 YOUNG CHAD 
                        Joy? How's the Portuguese?

                                 YOUNG JOY
                        This is dumb. This basement is 
                        dumb. T-Rex is dumb!

                                 YOUNG CHAD
                        Prince T-Rex can't speak Portuguese 
                        because he's a dumb retard?

           Joy gives in a bit.

                                 YOUNG JOY
                        Yeah. He's retarded. Like 
                        asparagus.
                           (full play)

           She opens the fridge and holds up a can of tonic water. Chad 
           shakes his head. She selects a can of tomato juice, Chad 
           shakes his head.

                                 YOUNG JOY (CONT'D)

                        Titicaca, you sure are picky.

           She holds up a Coke. Chad shakes his head.

           Joy looks at what's left in the fridge, and her eyes widen as 
           she grabs the only thing left - a Miller Genuine Draft.

           Chad smiles gleefully, Joy does the "We're gonna get so 
           busted and I love it" dance.

           The CRACK of the can opening. Tiny hands pour the beer into 
           tiny teacups.

           The children toast each other.

                        Kids! Your Mother and I need to go 
                        to the hospital real quick okay? 
                        Chad? You're in charge!

           The kids stare up at the door. They hear the parents LEAVING.

           Chad and Joy drink the beer. Neither like it very much.

           Chad glances at the basement door. Smoke creeps in from under 
           the crack. Through the bullet hole Chad can see the ORANGE of 
           FLAMES. Chad, realizing the danger, thinks fast-

                                 YOUNG CHAD
                        Princess Shoeless Joel. Would you 
                        and your minions kindly escort me 
                        outside into the refreshing night?

           Joy smiles at him quizzically. Chad looks to the door - more 
           smoke.

                                 YOUNG JOY
                        Why yes certainly kind Sir. Prince 
                        T-Rex will show you his empire.

           She stands, grabs Godzilla, and moves for the stairs.

                                 YOUNG CHAD 
                        Perhaps Rex will show us through 
                        the window?

                                 YOUNG JOY
                        You have studied our customs well, 
                        Incredible Hulk Han Solo.

           Climbing on the washing machine, Chad cracks open the window. 
           He pulls Joy up and stuffs her through. He jumps down to the 
           floor, grabs his suitcase, and looks back at the basement 
           door. 

           Flames now consume everything in sight. Chad's wiggles out 
           the window.

                                                   CUT TO BLACK:

           SOUND: A huge THUMP.

           A huge THUMP from the roof. Plaster dust falls from the 
           ceiling.

                        Jeez!

           EXT. JOY'S APARTMENT BUILDING/ROOF - DAY

           The COLOSSAL WOODEN STRUCTURE is even more impressive in the 
           morning light. Ropes and pulleys. Chad stands wondering at 
           what looks like a huge wooden bowl.

           Gorilla-like GRUNTS come from the other side of the base. 
           Chad makes his way around, concerned for his personal safety.

                                 CHAD
                        Hello?

           Stevie whips to his feet and swings the 2x4 in his hand, 
           knocking Chad to the ground.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        OW!!!

           Stevie's ready to bash him again-

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        Wait! Wait! Wait!

           Stevie blinks back the instinct to keep bashing.

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh. Hey. Goddamnit, we have 
                        established some rules!

                                 CHAD
                        Hello is standard parlance. Is 
                        there something special you'd like 
                        me to say?

                                 STEVIE 
                        Sorry.  I've been spending the 
                        whole day dealing with water 
                        damage... I gotta get a tarp or 
                        something.

                                 CHAD
                        What are you building?

                                 STEVIE
                        Can't tell you. Don't want to jinx 
                        it.

           Stevie, close to the edge, looks out.

                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        Hey, come here. I wanna show you 
                        something.

           Chad follows Stevie. On the roof of a NEIGHBORING BUILDING is 
           a POOL. A NAKED WOMAN sunbathes.

                                 CHAD 
                        Wow.

                                 STEVIE
                        Drives me crazy.

           Stevie goes back to work, Chad sits, stares off. City sounds. 
           Honks, helicopters.

                                 CHAD 
                        Stevie? I think that maybe, I'm not 
                        sure, but I'm starting to suspect 
                        that Joy killed herself.

           Stevie stops.

                                 STEVIE
                        Don't say that. She wouldn't do 
                        that.

                                 CHAD
                        I didn't think so either, but, I'm 
                        starting to think-

                                 STEVIE 
                        Chad. She had her shit together 
                        like nobody's business. She 
                        wouldn't have done that. She was 
                        inspiring-

           INT. JOY'S APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Stevie seals two garbage bags together with ducked tape. He 
           stands up and looks around. His portion of the room is 
           covered in garbage bags, sealed together - effectively 
           serving as one big zip lock bag.

                                 STEVIE (V.O.)
                        I was in a dark, dark place, 
                        brother. It was black.

           Stevie turns to the only other object in the bubble - his 
           motorcycle. Stevie gets on the bike.

                        I hated myself. I hated what I had 
                        become.

           Stevie steps on the pedal and ROARS up the engine. And then 
           he just sits there.

                                 STEVIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I sat there and I thought about all 
                        the horrible things I'd done in my 
                        life.

           The exhaust pipe spews. The bubble starts to EXPAND as the 
           fumes fill it up. Stevie starts to fall asleep.

                                 STEVIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I was a rabid dog. And someone 
                        needed to put me down. And I'm a 
                        big guy, so nobody would try. So it 
                        was up to me.

           Stevie slumps down a little bit. Sound of a KEY IN THE DOOR.

           AT THE FRONT DOOR- Joy (Dressed in styled professional 
           clothes) sees the bubble.

                                 JOY
                        Stevie? I told you not to ride the 
                        motorbike in the apartment! Nice 
                        tent, though. Stevie? STEVIE?!?

           Joy rips through the plastic, grabs Stevie, and drags him out 
           of the bubble. She throws open the windows. She grabs 
           Stevie's collapsed body and slaps him in the face.

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        Stevie! Wake up! Wake up!

           Stevie, groggy, opens his eyes a bit-

                                 JOY (CONT'D)
                        I need you to tell me how to turn 
                        off the motorcycle!

                                 STEVIE
                        It's... A ... Harley...

                                 JOY
                        Shut up and tell me how to turn it 
                        off!

           Stevie smiles weakly at Joy.

           Chad is skeptical.

                        She made me tea. She gave me soup. 
                        We talked about... Everything. She

                        killed herself.

           Stevie discovers Chad getting emotional and stops fiddling 
           with the wood.

                                 CHAD 
                        It's been two weeks since you've 
                        seen her?

                                 STEVIE
                        Yeah. About that long.

                                 CHAD
                        She was in a twelve step program.

                                 STEVIE
                        Serious?

                                 CHAD
                        And she was in therapy. And she 
                        stopped talking to my parents. And 
                        she hasn't used her credit card or 
                        withdrawn any money from the bank 
                        in two weeks and... Pretty much 
                        everyone who's alive uses money. I 
                        mean... She's my, she was my, she's 
                        my goddamn sister.

           Tears. They just come out. Simple. 

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Hey. It's all right to squeeze a 
                        couple.

                                 CHAD 
                        Being here. Smacked in the face 
                        again and again-

                        I'm sorry! I'm an edgy guy!

                                 CHAD
                        No. The whole thing. You know? No 
                        Joy. Just the freak show that was 
                        her life...

                                 STEVIE 
                        Seriously. When you're away, and 
                        you come back, and nobody can 
                        relate. And nothing makes sense. 
                        Good or bad. I hate this town.

                        In the forest nobody had much more 
                        of an agenda than eating breakfast 
                        and going to the swimming hole. The 
                        water. Everything in your body just 
                        melting in the sun and the sapphire 
                        crystal blue water.

                        Brother, sounds like paradise.

                        Where were you before here?

                                 STEVIE
                        Prison. Almost six months out.

           Chad sobers.

                        For... For what?

                                 STEVIE
                        Manslaughter. Which means, brother, 
                        that it was an accident. And, 
                        anyway, I'm changed. I got out on 
                        good behavior.

                                 CHAD
                        That's, um, awesome.

           Stevie pats Chad on the back. Awkward, but kind.

                                 STEVIE
                        Sapphire crystal blue. I'd like to 
                        see that.

           They sit on the roof, small among all the wood and rope.

POLICE STATION - DAY

           Officer White goes over the bank statements. Chad makes a 
           doll for Tiesha.

                                 OFFICER WHITE
                        Do you know why she would?

                                 CHAD
                        I don't know. I don't think I know 
                        who she is... I mean... Was... I 
                        don't know. There's all this stuff 
                        I didn't know about her.

           Under the table Tiesha SNEEZES.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        She's still feeling bad?

                                 OFFICER WHITE
                        Yep. Fever of a hundred n' one.

           Chad rummages through his satchel, pulling out some of Joy's 
           over the counter drugs.

                                 CHAD
                        Joy had all this medicine. I 
                        thought maybe you could use some. 
                        If you want...

                                 OFFICER WHITE
                        You brought this for Tiesha?

                                 CHAD
                        I. Um. I lived in this village 
                        where everyone kind of looked out 
                        for kids. They were everyone's 
                        "little brother" or "little 
                        sister." I mean, they were savages 
                        and everything, but that part was 
                        cool I guess... If we were there, 
                        I'd get Tiesha some Pathaqua Root, 
                        but it only grows in the Krubulublu 
                        Valley. So I brought the Dimetapp.

                                 OFFICER WHITE
                        You don't look so good.

                                 CHAD
                        I'm hung-over, I can't find my 
                        sister, I need therapy. So. You 
                        know.

           Chad stands up. Tiesha looks after him - holding a new tissue-
           paper doll.

                                 TIESHA
                        Mister! I'll be your little sister!

           Chad and Officer White share a touched look. She covers-

                                 OFFICER WHITE
                        Shh! You're gonna get Momma busted. 
                        Here. Take some medicine.

           Officer White grabs the bottle of Dimetapp, and finds Chad 
           gone.

           INT. BETH KLING'S PSYCHOANALYSIS/WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Chad, poised on a chair, scopes the place. The SECRETARY 
           smiles at him. He smiles.

           His eyes land on a rack filled with PAMPHLETS displaying 
           cartoon figures in various phases of distress. Reading the 
           titles, Chad sees - FEELING LONELY?

           Chad sighs and grabs the pamphlet. Next to it is another - 
           FEELING DEPRESSED? He grabs that one. FEELING LOST? He grabs 
           it. LIKE A SOCIAL ANOMALY? Yes.

           FEELING SUICIDAL?

           Chad stares for a long time at the SUICIDAL pamphlet. He 
           grabs it. Tentatively, he opens it up.

                                 DR. BETH (O.S.)
                        Chad?

           Chad looks up to find DR. BETH (50's. God-complex) smiling at 
           her new subject.

                                 DR. BETH (CONT'D)
                        We're ready for you.
                           (to the Secretary)
                        Where should we put him?

                                 SUSAN
                        Well, Mr. Peterson's in number

           The room has an easy chair, a small desk, and a couch. Along 
           the wall are various filing cabinets.

           Chad sits on the couch. Beth fudges with a small boom-box and 
           SOOTHING MUSIC ensues.

           Beth gets up and leaves the room while Chad has his arm and

           CUE CANDY-LAND MUSIC:

           INT. NEW YORK SWISS ALPS RESTAURANT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           A WAITER (20's, Broadway bound, dressed in a SWISS FLAG 
           costume) drops a large plate of cabbage in front of Margaret 
           and a plate of sausages in front of a slightly younger Chad. 
           The Waiter turns to leave when-

                                 MARGARET
                        Excuse me? Could you please take 
                        that animal away until after I 
                        finish my meal?

           The Waiter blinks at her. She turns to Chad, who unwraps a 
           small gift.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Your father should be here soon, so 
                        I'll let you eat the disgustingness 
                        with him if you don't mind.

                                 CHAD
                        It's my last civilized meal for two 
                        years, Mom.

                                 MARGARET
                        There's nothing civilized about 
                        your mother throwing up from the 
                        smell. Trust me. I'm briefly 
                        postponing your bad karma.

           Chad, weary, nods to the waiter, who takes the plate away. 
           Chad finishes with the gift. Its a portrait of Margaret 
           meditating among ducks.

           Joy stands in the doorway to the restaurant, yelling at Chad 
           and Margaret. Chad, ashamed, turns to Margaret.

                                 CHAD

           Margaret munches on cabbage. Joy, trembling, steps to the 
           table. Chad does his best to play it off.

                        not sit with you!
                           (near tears)
                        I had all my stuff with me. I tried 
                        to get into the apartment. Our 
                        apartment. There was this big hairy 
                        greek guy moving in. Chad, your 
                        landlord told me. Your landlord.

           Joy, deeply hurt, stares at Chad. Chad, evasive, stares at 
           the table. Margaret looks past Joy and sees Doug outside with 
           a WOMAN and her THREE SONS. Margaret stands and hugs Chad.

                                 MARGARET

                           (to Joy)
                        Are you coming with me or are you 
                        staying to see your Father?

           Joy, blinking back tears, can't take her eyes off Chad. 
           Margaret shrugs and leaves.

                                 CHAD
                        Joy. Listen. You're going to be 
                        fine. You're going to find your own 
                        place. Get a job. It'll work out.

           Doug strolls in with his new girlfriend (Samantha, (40's) 
           Vietnamese, and her three sons: Edgar - 15, angry, Martin - 
           12, angry, and Ritchie - 6, angry.)

                                 DOUG
                        Ha. Wow. A little reunion, huh? 
                        Kids, I want you to meet my new 
                        love Samantha.

           Samantha, overwhelmed, smiles and shakes Chad and Joy's 
           hands. Chad awkwardly fakes niceness. Joy can't take her 
           betrayed eyes off of Chad.

                                 DOUG (CONT'D)
                        And this is Edgar. This is Martin. 
                        And this is Little Ritchie.

           Chad is too concerned with ignoring Joy to be polite.

                                 RITCHIE
                        Don't call me little Ritchie. 
                        You're not my fucking Dad, Doug!

                                 EDGAR
                        You're not his fucking Dad, Doug!

           Samantha hits each of them, hard, on the back of their heads.

                        Ha. Wow.

           Everyone sits down at the table. Chad sneaks a glance at Joy, 
           who continues to stand in disbelief. Chad finds something 
           interesting about his fork.

                                 DOUG (CONT'D)
                        Everyone, this is my son Chad, and

                        It's a very real happiness to meet 
                        you. I want to be with your father 
                        forever.

           Martin throws the basket of bread onto the floor. Samantha 
           slaps him, hard, on the back of his head. Joy pays no 
           attention to any of it.

                                 JOY
                           (to Chad)
                        We had a plan, Chad. Since we were 
                        kids. We had a plan.

           Chad looks from Joy to the violent occupants of the table, 
           back to Joy.

                                 CHAD
                        I can't stay here anymore, Joy.

           This is not going how Doug had hoped.

                                 DOUG
                        Samantha, boys: Chad's going away 
                        tomorrow. He's going to be in the 
                        Amazon for the next two years. It's 
                        very dangerous. Sometimes the 
                        volunteers never come back.

                                 JOY
                           (to Chad)
                        You weren't even going to tell me.

           Chad sits. Guilty. The waiter drops the sausages in front of 
           him.

                        Enjoy.

           INT. BETH KLING'S OFFICE - DAY (PRESENT)

           Chad's eyes crack open.

           He looks at the clock: 11:33 am.

           LATER: 11:47 am.

           Tired, he drops his arm and leg. Looking around the room - 
           The filing cabinets tempt him. Especially the one labeled 
           "F".

           LATER: 11:53 am.

           Chad slides off the couch and opens the cabinet. Flipping 
           through he sees: FLINN, JOY. He grabs it.

           He hears: FOOTSTEPS. He looks to the door-

           Beth tiptoes in and finds Chad on the couch, arm and leg up 
           in the air. She sits.

                                 BETH 
                        You can now let your leg and arm 
                        float down to the couch.

           Chad does.

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                        I am now talking to Chad's 
                        subconscious mind. How have you 
                        been feeling lately?

                                 CHAD
                        Bad. I want to find... Something.

                                 BETH
                        What are you looking for?

                        The subconscious mind knows

                        Well, time's up. I'm going to snap 
                        my finger and wake you. And when 
                        you wake up, even though you're not 
                        going to remember any of this... 
                        you're going to feel the best 
                        you've ever felt, like you had a 
                        very meaningful experience, and you 
                        will want to set up appointments to 
                        see me at least twice a week.

                        I think that was very productive,

           Beth smiles. Chad tries to do the same.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           As Chad rushes down the street, he pulls Joy's file out of 
           his pants and opens it up.

           The first page of the file is a title page: JOY - AN 
           AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

           As he grows increasingly absorbed, people make way for him.

                                 JOY (V.O.)
                        March 16th. This is my first entry 
                        into the autobiography I'm writing 
                        for my shrink... Where to begin...

           CUE CANDY-LAND MUSIC:

           INT. E.R. - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Young Chad (glasses, sweater and suitcase) and Young Joy 
           (helmet, wings and Godzilla) walk out of their parents' 
           hospital room-

                                 MARGARET
                        Fine. I get Joy, a new house, and 
                        three more years of child support.

           Chad turns from his parents to his sister. Joy grabs her 
           fairy wings and starts flapping them. They don't carry her 
           anywhere.

                                 JOY
                        The Ogres are trying to give us 
                        warts! Look out! Fly away! Come, 
                        prince Godzilla and kind Sir!

                                 CHAD
                        Joy, it's not a game.

           Joy stops flapping, takes his hand and pulls him down the 
           hall.

                        Let's ask one of the doctor's if 
                        they can sew our hands together! 
                        Then we'll stick! I don't want to 
                        never see you again!

           Joy pulls him along - looking for a doctor. Chad stops.

                                 CHAD
                        Joy.

           Joy stops.

                                 JOY
                        Let's run away!

                                 CHAD
                        No.

                                 JOY
                        We'll go together to the mountains. 
                        On the other side of the world! The 
                        bears will take us in!

                                 CHAD
                        No.

           Joy sits down and covers her eyes. Chad, helpless, looks 
           around, and sees a coffee station.

           Joy, crying, wipes her eyes and finds in front of her two 
           TISSUE PAPER DOLLS. She smiles a bit. Looking around the 
           hallway she finds Chad gone.

           Peeking into the room, she finds her parents trying to swat 
           each other over the aisle. Chad takes their arms, and 
           separates them. He turns to Joy, and beckons her back into 
           the room.

           Joy shakes her head "No."

           Doug and Margaret try swatting each other again. Chad stops 
           them.

           Joy looks down at Chad's suitcase. She looks at her family. 
           She grabs the suitcase and runs.

           RANGERS walking with flashlights come upon JOY sleeping 
           peacefully, they recognize her from a missing poster.

                        They'd bring me back, but I'd be

           Young Joy stretches at the campfire, cooking bacon and eggs. 
           PARK RANGERS drive up, recognizing her from a milk carton.

           Young Chad hands a MISSING poster to a MILK MAN. The Milk Man 
           gives a carton of milk to Chad, on it is Joy's photo and the 
           caption: "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?"

           Young Chad shakes the Milk Man's hand.

           eyes to find Joy (10) passed out among bottles of Tylenol, 
           Flintstone’s Vitamins, and Nyquil. Margaret rings the bowl, 
           closes her eyes and continues her meditation.

                                 JOY (V.O.) 
                        It got really bad.

           INT. DRUGSTORE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           An Older Joy pushes a shopping cart stuffed with over-the-
           counter drugs. She sees JONATHAN (30) testing out Trapper-
           Keeper's in the school-supplies aisle. She falls in love.

           They walk out hand in hand, leaving the shopping cart.

                                 JOY (V.O.) 
                        When you fall in love, you just 
                        want to stay with that person.

           INT. JOY'S APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           JONATHAN moves in. Joy helps.

                        For the first few months it was 
                        more than I had ever dreamed.

           INT. JOY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           JONATHAN and JOY make love under billowing curtains in the 
           moonlight.

                                 JOY (V.O.)

                        I fell off the wagon. I guess I was 
                        depressed. Mom gave me a gun.

           INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           A familiar scene. Joy with the Chloraseptic, Margaret handing

                        Jonathan. Poor guy. He taught third 
                        graders – he had no idea what he 
                        was getting into.

           INT. JOY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Joy SCREAMS and throws plates of pasta at Jonathan. Joy runs 
           into the bedroom as Jonathan SHOUTS after her. Joy flies back 
           in with the revolver. Fires twice – BLAM! BLAM! The wall next 
           to Jonathan EXPLODES with the impact.

           Jonathan, shocked, looks from the wall to Joy. Joy, shocked, 
           looks from Jonathan to the gun.

           Jonathan picks up his coat and walks out the door.

                                 JOY (V.O.) 
                        He took a job in Atlanta. I got a 
                        roommate, kept up with the 
                        meetings, lied. I started trying to 
                        kill myself. In three weeks I will 
                        succeed.

           Chad, terrified, flips a page.

           INT. BETH KLING'S OFFICE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Joy tries to resist the hypnotism. She stares at Dr. Beth out 
           of the corner of her eye.

                                 JOY (V.O.) 
                        Last week I turned in a chapter to 
                        you, Dr. Beth, that said that I was 
                        going to kill myself in three 
                        weeks, and you didn't even read it. 
                        Okay. This is a test. In two weeks 
                        I'm going kill myself, destroying 
                        my body so my father will never be 
                        able to do the autopsy.

           EXT. STREET - DAY (PRESENT)

           Chad flips the page. Nothing more. He searches the rest of 
           the file. Nothing.

                                 CHAD
                        Oh, God, no.

           He runs.

           EXT. ZOO - DAY

           Chad runs through the Rainforest Exhibit, looking for any 
           sign of Joy's passing. None.

           He looks around. A ZOOKEEPER walks by.

                                 CHAD
                        Which way is Southwest?

                                 ZOOKEEPER
                        That way.

           Chad follows the Zookeeper's finger and finds a small pool of 
           dark water. Next to it a sign reads: "DON'T PET THE PIRANHA!"

           Moving closer, he finds graffiti scratched into the paint 
           under the sign. The scratches read:

           "JOY'S LAST WORDS: FUCK YOU. TOO LATE."

           Chad reads it again. Again.

                                 CHAD
                        Joy!

           He jumps into the pool. The water bubbles as the piranha 
           frenzy.

                                 ZOOKEEPER (O.S.)
                        Are you insane!?!

           The Zookeeper grabs his collar and pulls him out of the 
           water. Chad, panting, looks at his borrowed motorcycle boots. 
           They're shredded.

                        Drain the pool! We got a jumper!

           EXT. PIRANHA POOL - DAY

           Water drains from the pool. Stranded fish gasp for oxygen.

           Chad, the Zookeeper, the BOSS, and other EMPLOYEES stand in 
           the now roped-off section.

           As the water recedes, a skull emerges. Another. Another. 
           Apparently, Joy's choice of suicide wasn't so uncommon. Chad 
           stares, wild-eyed, helpless.

                                 ZOOKEEPER
                        Nibbled to death. That's gotta 
                        hurt.

                                 THE BOSS
                        Can you tell which one is your 
                        sister?

           The water continues to drain, revealing bottle after bottle 
           of Chloraseptic. At the sight of the Chloraseptic, all life 
           drains from Chad's body. His eyes dull. He sinks to the 
           ground.

           The Zookeeper picks up a bottle.

                                 ZOOKEEPER
                        Topical anesthetic. To numb the 
                        nibbling.

           Chad takes the bottle from the Zookeeper's hand. It's half 
           full. Defeated, Chad unzips his jacket, exposes his chest, 
           and squirts Chloraseptic onto it. Once. Twice. Three times.

           Four. Five. Six. The bottle, now empty, squirts nothing. 
           Chad, heart numb, keeps pumping the nozzle.

STREET - DAY

           Chad, wandering, passes too many people. Too many cars. 
           Overfilled trash cans. Too much neon. Deafening noise. Chad 
           is numb to it all.

           INT. COPY SHOP - DAY

           The copier spits out page after page. Chad somberly sorts 
           them together.

           INT. MARGARET'S HALLWAY - DAY

           Margaret opens her door.

                                 CHAD
                        Mom?

                        Come in, come in. I want you to 
                        meet Master Shu.

           INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Chad, robot-like, follows Margaret into the living room-

           IN THE LIVING ROOM - waits MASTER SHU (Zen Monk, 50's, white, 
           shaved head, sideburns: a plumber in robes)

                                 MARGARET 
                        Master Shu, this is my son, Chad. 
                        Chad, Master Shu is the only Zen 
                        Master from Detroit, and my 
                        spiritual advisor.

           Master Shu bows deeply. Chad kinda nods.

           In the center of the room stands an enormous chest. It's 
           contents - rich fabrics and curious treasures - spill all

                        Master Shu and I were just looking 
                        for clues.

                                 CHAD
                        Clues?

                                 MARGARET
                        Trying to find out what happened to 
                        your sister.

                        You probably wouldn't have assumed 
                        so - seeing as you think I'm a 
                        horrible mother. A monster! 
                        Destroyer of childhood innocence!

                                 CHAD
                        What is all of this?

                                 MARGARET
                        Mementos from yours and Joy's 
                        childhood. I bet you didn't even 
                        know I kept all this old stuff! A 
                        mother's love is never seen. Sit 
                        down. Relax. Your crappy mom made 
                        tea.

           Chad sits, bewildered. Master Shu eyes him coldly.

                                 CHAD
                        Mom, I-

                                 MARGARET 
                        Chad, why don't you ask Master Shu 
                        about Nirvana?

           Margaret goes back to her clue-hunting.

                                 CHAD
                        So. Nirvana.

           As if to answer, Master Shu benevolently picks up the teapot 
           and pours tea into a cup. He keeps pouring. It overflows. 
           Chad, kinda freaked out, doesn't say anything.

           Master Shu keeps pouring.

                                 MASTER SHU
                        You may want to ask me why I'm 
                        pouring this tea so it overflows?

           Margaret sits up for the lesson. Chad remains unimpressed.

                                 CHAD
                        Because it's an ancient Detroit 
                        custom?

           Master Shu gives him an icy glare.

                                 MASTER SHU
                        And I would ask you: How do you 
                        know it's overflowing?

           The tea drips all over the coffee table and onto the carpet.

                                 MASTER SHU (CONT'D)
                        That is nirvana.

           Margaret looks as if everything suddenly became clear. Chad 
           looks like he's losing his hearing.

           Master Shu closes his eyes and starts a meditation. Chad 
           squeezes his cranium with both hands and tries to breathe.

           Margaret finds a Fireman's Helmet (clean and polished) and 
           gives a YELP of nostalgia.

                                 MARGARET 
                        You remember this?

           Chad picks it up.

                                 CHAD
                        Yeah. Was this Joy's helmet? It 
                        looks brand new.

           Margaret, rummaging, lets out another YELP. She hands him a 
           small pillow.

                                 MARGARET
                        Do you remember that?

           Chad examines it. It's embroidered with "NUMBER 1 SON!"

                                 CHAD
                        No. I don't remember that. Not at 
                        all.

                                 MARGARET
                        It was your pillow! When you were 
                        little! It was your pillow!

           Margaret moves on. Chad is losing his numbed patience.

                                 CHAD
                        Mom, I need to tell you-

           Margaret lets out a GASP of discovery. Moved, tearing, she 
           reaches for something in the chest.

                                 MARGARET 
                        Oh, Chadsworth. Your favorite thing 
                        ever! Do you remember this?

           She pulls out a stuffed doll of SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. She 
           lovingly passes it to Chad. Chad examines the doll - and 
           finds a price tag.

                                 CHAD
                        No I didn't. Spongebob didn't exist 
                        when I was a kid... You just bought 
                        all this stuff, didn't you?

                        childhood treasures!

           Margaret gets frenzied. Chad gets more calm.

                                 CHAD
                        Mom. My childhood treasures burned 
                        down with my childhood home.

           Margaret looks frantic.

                                 MARGARET
                        It's the thought that counts! It's 
                        the thought that counts, 
                        Chadsworth!

           She fights the tears.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        What was I supposed to do?!? What 
                        am I supposed to do!?! What do I do 
                        now!?!

           Chad drops Sponge-bob and picks up his satchel-

                                 CHAD
                        Mom? I want to invite you to a

                        It's something I learned in the

                        Can't we wait to have a ceremony 
                        for her until we find out what 
                        happened? Until we find out what 
                        happened to my baby girl?

                                 CHAD
                        Joy is dead, Mom. She's dead.

                                 MARGARET
                        How can you say that? How can you-

           Margaret breaks down. She has, after all, lost her child. 
           Chad stares at her. Moved, he opens his arms to her, and 
           moves to hold her.

           Master Shu stands up and holds out his arms. Margaret pushes 
           Chad back and moves into Master Shu's embrace.

           Chad, standing alone, watches his mother share her grief with 
           Master Shu.

           INT. DOUG'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Doug leads Chad into his apartment - a nice place, with 
           cardboard boxes everywhere. Doug is in the middle of moving.

                                 DOUG
                        Dr. Stacy! Dr. Stacy! Look who 
                        stopped in to help!

           Dr. Stacy comes in with a box, adding to the pile in the 
           living room, and gives Chad a hug.

                                 DR. STACY

           Doug puts his arm around Dr. Stacy.

                        Your Dad is moving in with me. If

                        Ha. Wow. Kids only want the best 
                        for their parents.

           Doug and Dr. Stacy smile, and kiss. With tongue. Chad puts 
           his head in his hands. Dr. Stacy goes back into the bedroom 
           to keep packing.

                        are you holding up? You're acting a 
                        little weird.

                           (from the bedroom)
                        Can I get a hand with this?

                        Dad. I came to-

           Doug jerks his head in the direction of the bedroom.

                                 DOUG
                        Help her for me. My bum leg. It 
                        would mean a lot.

           Chad drops his satchel and goes to help. Doug looks down at 
           the satchel and sees the head of the INVITATION. He grabs it 
           and pulls. The PAMPHLETS from Dr. Beth's office spill out. 
           Doug reads the titles.

           Dr. Stacy and Chad squeeze into the room - each carrying 
           either end of a SEA KAYAK. Doug stuffs the papers back into 
           Chad's satchel.

                                 DR. STACY
                        This, for example. Do you need 
                        this?

                                 DOUG
                        That's my sea kayak. I need it.

           Dr. Stacy looks at it. She hates it, but loves him.

                                 DR. STACY
                        I guess we could fit it behind the 
                        couch.

                        Ha. Wow. I've been thinking. You 
                        might be having a rough time. Being 
                        back after... years, finding your 
                        sister missing. It's probably got 
                        you a little down. A little 
                        confused. Maybe like a social 
                        anomaly? Maybe suicidal? 

           Doug reaches into one of the boxes.

                                 CHAD
                        Did you go through my bag?

                        I think now is an appropriate time

                        strapped to his back during the 
                        War. And when they asked him to 
                        give it back, he found that he 
                        couldn't. He couldn't leave it 
                        behind. He gave it to me, and I 
                        loved and cherished it. In many 
                        ways, this flamethrower defines the 
                        men in our family. Now that you're

                        Just because a father gives

                        a problem that you can't resolve - 
                        you can always burn it beyond 
                        recognition.

           Doug lays the weapon in Chad's lap. Dr. Stacy has been 
           hovering in the doorway-

                                 DR. STACY
                        That was so beautiful, Doug.

           Chad has had enough.

                                 CHAD
                        You and Mom, man. The two of you. I 
                        swear to God. You're a pair. You're 
                        soul-mates.

                                 DOUG
                           (comforting)
                        Chadsworth. I know that you took it 
                        very hard when your Mom and I split 
                        up... But, and listen to me now, 
                        you really need to let go of any 
                        hope of her and I ever getting back 
                        together. I mean, come on now, it's 
                        been 10 years.

           Chad, trying to get himself together, tosses the flamethrower 
           over his shoulder, picks up his bags, and moves to the door-

                                 CHAD
                        I came here to tell you that your 
                        daughter's dead. Joy is dead. I'm 
                        putting together a kind of service.

           Dropping an invitation, he leaves.

           Chad opens the door, and struggles to fit through with his 
           flamethrower.

           A boot spins through the air and strikes him in the face. 
           Chad is un-phased.

           Stevie comes out of the kitchen with a cup of tea.

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh, hey Chad.

           Chad unloads the flamethrower.

                                 CHAD 
                        I've invited people over for a get 
                        together tomorrow. I'd like it if 
                        you could be there.

                                 STEVIE
                        What's the occasion?

                                 CHAD
                        It's a service. For Joy's passing.

           Chad hands him an invitation. Stevie looks at it, then nods 
           solemnly. Stevie notices the weapon.

                                 STEVIE
                        Cool flamethrower

                                 CHAD
                        It burns people to death. Stupid 
                        family stuff.

                                 STEVIE
                        My father gave me the Harley.

                                 CHAD
                        I'd much rather have a motorcycle.

                                 STEVIE
                        It's not a motorcycle. It's a 
                        Harley. Brother, you don't 
                        understand. I hate that machine. 
                        It's the source, the reason, for 
                        some of the worst shit I ever did.

           Chad looks around and realizes-

                        Your Harley's gone.

                                 STEVIE
                        Tomorrow's my six month anniversary 
                        of being holed up in this 
                        apartment. You know that thing on 
                        the roof?

                                 CHAD
                        Yeah.

                                 STEVIE
                        It's done. I'm dedicating it to 
                        your sister. My friend. Joy.

           INT. STAIRWELL TO THE ROOF - NIGHT

           Stevie leads Chad up the stairs.

                                 STEVIE
                        When I came here, I wanted to talk. 
                        Say something. But I didn't have 
                        the words.

           EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

           They step onto the roof, still dominated by the tarp-covered 
           CONSTRUCTION.

                                 STEVIE
                        So Joy told me to make something. I 
                        can't draw. I can't paint. Plus. I 
                        think it's stupid when people own 
                        crap that's really expensive that 
                        has no practical purpose. So, what 
                        I did was... And you're the first 
                        person to see it, Chad... What I 
                        built was-

           Stevie pulls down the tarp. Chad's eyes widen.

                                 STEVIE 
                        It's functional art.

           Cradled in the enormous bowl of the war-machine sits Stevie's 
           Harley.

                        I call it: "My Potential to Chuck 
                        my Harley, which I've Sunk Twenty 
                        Five Years of Life Into, and Which 
                        I No Longer Need as a Crutch for my 
                        Personality."

           Stevie, a changed man, stands at his full height. Chad stares 
           in awe at the absurd magnificence of it.

                        Thanks, Brother. They say if you

                        I think she would be honored.

                        Cool. Well, we should probably 
                        cover it up again. It's art, but, 
                        you know, it might be breaking my 
                        parole.

           Chad tries to sleep-

                                 CHAD
                        Think about naked women. Think 
                        about terra-forming Mars. Think 
                        about... Think about...

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Young Chad strolls next to Margaret, who drops more tofu into 
           her cart. Chad's eyes track the sugar cereal.

                                 CHAD
                        Mom? Can I have coco-pebbles for 
                        dinner?

           Margaret stops.

                                 MARGARET
                        Goddess gracious, Chadsworth Flinn. 
                        Your body is your temple.

           Head down, Chad heels his mother down the isle. Margaret 
           moves quickly. At the end of the isle, Margaret's cart 
           CRASHES into another cart. The WOMAN (40's, barren, well-
           adjusted) laughs it off.

                                 WOMAN
                        Excuse me.

                                 MARGARET
                        Why don't you watch where you're

           Chad pokes his head out from behind Margaret. Peeking from 
           behind the Woman is his sister, Joy.

                                 CHAD
                        Joy?

                        JOY!?!

           The Woman looks terribly confused.

                                 WOMAN
                        This is my daughter. You know her?

                                 MARGARET
                        Of course I know her! She's my 
                        daughter! This is Christmas 
                        Vacation! She's supposed to be with 
                        her father!

                                 WOMAN
                        You're mistaken. This poor girl 
                        doesn't have a family! I adopted 
                        her two weeks ago!

                                 MARGARET
                        You WHAT!?! Give her back!

                                 WOMAN
                        Over my dead body!

                        If you wanna take it there!!!

           Margaret tackles the woman to the ground. Chad and Joy watch 
           and, sharing a look, sigh.

                        There go my snacks.

           other treats.

                        You should really think about 
                        adoption as an option. Maybe we can 
                        get put with the same family.

                        could all join me in a circle?

           The crowd, uncertain, does.

                        When I got back from the Amazon 
                        last week, I started looking for my 
                        sister, Joy Flinn.

           The OTCDAA people sober.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        Some of you know that I've spent 
                        the last few years living with a 
                        native tribe in the Amazon. I 
                        taught the People of the Forest 
                        modern house construction. And 
                        they, in return, taught me things. 
                        One of which, I would like to teach 
                        to you. The Kamahanakamahana 
                        ritual.

           Nobody has any idea what he's talking about.

                        When a member of the tribe leaves, 
                        they are missed, but the forest 
                        people love them, and want them to 
                        fly free. And they believe that the 
                        spirit gets weighed down by 
                        feelings of guilt and shame.

           People look uncomfortable.

                        Basically what we do is: we express 
                        our bad feelings concerning Joy, as 
                        honestly as possible. Clearing the 
                        air so that Joy's spirit may fly 
                        free. Who wants to start?

           Nobody moves. They check each other out. Master Shu steps 
           forward.

                        Things are what they are. Then 
                        things are not what they are. Then 
                        things are what they are again.

           Some in the circle nod at the Master's wisdom.

                                 CHAD
                        Okay. Um. That's not really what 
                        I'm talking about. Anybody else?

           Ingrid steps forward, Gary and Rob move with her.

                                 INGRID
                        Joy? Now that you're a ghost and 
                        everything? Maybe you could use 
                        your powers for the forces of good 
                        and help me land an awesome role? 
                        In a movie? With Bendicio Del Toro? 
                        Or some other hot actor. Thank you.

                                 CHAD
                        Ingrid. Why don't you talk about 
                        what you told me? That you felt 
                        guilty? That you know that 
                        withholding your friendship helped 
                        alienate Joy?

                                 INGRID
                        I don't know what you're talking 
                        about.

           Ingrid slips back into the circle. Hollis steps forward-

           Chad, falling apart, looks to Stevie, who stands, tortured.

                                 DOUG
                        Joy. I know that I was a good 
                        father to you and set a good 
                        example. But I could only do so 
                        much. I only raised you half the 
                        time. And it is a huge burden of 
                        guilt that I have carried... I am 
                        so sorry that I didn't demand full 
                        custody of you. I blame myself for 
                        what happened. But mostly I know 
                        it's your mother's fault.

           Dr. Stacy supports him in this difficult time.

                                 MARGARET
                        Joy! I know you're here in the 
                        ether! My mortal eyes are blind to 
                        you but my immortal soul feels your 
                        presence and I'm sure Master Shu's 
                        does as well!

           Master Shu nods solemnly. Chad's brow furrows deeper.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        And since I know that you and I are 
                        connected, I know that you believed 
                        me to be a great mother, and I have 
                        nothing to air... But, in respect 
                        for the customs of the Amazonians, 
                        I must say one thing I regret that 
                        had a direct consequence on your 
                        life and how you were raised... And 
                        I blame myself for it, and continue 
                        to blame myself every day... I 
                        should have killed your father!

           Margaret rushes at Doug and Doug rushes back, wrestling each 
           other to the ground. Other guests try to pull them off of 
           each other, but the ferocity of the fight pulls them down.

           WHOOOSH! Suddenly, everyone's illuminated orange. They turn 
           to see-

           Chad, shooting flames from the flamethrower into the sky, 
           eyes ablaze.

                                 CHAD

           He shoots more flames. WHOOSH! Horrified, the people scatter. 
           Gary and Rob record it all.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        This is what I'm talking about! 
                        This is why I ran from the forest! 
                        This is why I didn't join the 
                        tribe! To join the tribe is to join 
                        this!

           He turns to the sky.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        Joy! I'm sorry for being a bad 
                        brother! I'm sorry for thinking you 
                        were a brat! I love you and I've 
                        miss you so, so, so, so, so much! 
                        But go! Be free!!!!

           He shoots flames that spew high into the night sky. He points 
           the weapon at Doug and Margaret.

                                 STEVIE
                        Chad. You don't want to do that.

           Chad looks to Stevie, who is really cool. Relaxing.

                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        You don't want to spend your life 
                        building catapults.

           Chad, frustrated, shoots one more WHOOSH into the air.

                                 CHAD
                        AAARRRRRUUUUUAAHHHHH!!!!

           Chad, panting, finds the flamethrower in his hands. It 
           sickens him. Dropping it to the ground, he sinks down next to 
           it.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        I can't believe you people. I can't 
                        believe you.

           The onlookers stare at him. Stevie helps him up. Chad meets 
           the eyes of the horrified mourners.

           POLICE SIRENS wail in the distance.

                        Sorry. Sorry if I scared you. It's 
                        just that... Fire. Fire is a big 
                        part of the ritual!

           The group doesn't believe him.

                                 STEVIE 
                        Chad!

           Chad looks up and sees where Stevie's pointing. The tarp 
           covering the catapult is ablaze.

           Running to help Stevie, they pull most of the tarp down, 
           revealing the catapult. The onlookers can't believe what 
           they're seeing.

           Chad and Stevie stamp out most of the flames. Stevie gives a 
           final pull on the tarp, but it snags on something. Chad looks 
           to where it's caught and sees it - pulling on the trigger!

           Stevie heaves.

                                 CHAD
                        No! Wait!!!

           Stevie pulls harder. The tarp pulls the trigger lever.

           The catapult throws the Harley into the air with incredible 
           force. Launching it towards the apartment building across the 
           street. The machine SLAMS into the wall - blowing open a huge 
           hole. Dust and debris fly everywhere.

           Chad and the others stare in shock.

           From the hole in the wall of the building, a BALD GUY in 
           boxer shorts and tube socks steps into what was his kitchen.

                                 BALD GUY
                        That was my kitchen you asshole!

           POLICE SIRENS wail from the street below.

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh, man. This is not good behavior.

           The street floods with POLICE.

                        THIS IS NOT GOOD BEHAVIOR!!!

           The SWAT team spews out of the van and into Joy's building.

           Master Shu starts a meditation. Hollis snorts nose-spray, and 
           passes it to Tuna, who snorts it.

           Stevie cranks the catapult and the arm of the machine 
           descends into loaded position.

                                 CHAD
                        Stevie, what are you doing? You're 
                        not going to catapult the cops!

                                 STEVIE
                        I'm not gonna let them get me.

           Stevie, incredibly, pushes the huge catapult to a new angle. 
           He climbs up the structure, and plops himself in the bowl. 
           Stevie realizes something that brings an easy smile.

                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        Hey. Chad. I got rid of the Harley.

           With that, he throws his boot, hits the trigger lever, and 
           goes sailing high into the air-

                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        CANNON-

           And starts coming down-

                        BAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!

           Right into the NAKED WOMAN'S POOL. SPLASH!

           Chad stares after him. The SWAT team pour onto the roof and 
           tackle Chad. Their black uniforms pile onto him. One of them 
           raises his billy-club, about to slam it into Chad's face when-

                                 SWAT LEADER
                        Camera! Camera!

           The SWAT GUY with the club looks up and sees Gary and Rob 
           recording the event. The whole team suddenly turn from 
           aggressive to helpful-

                        Okay, men! Let's give him some 
                        breathing room. Let me help you up 
                        there, Sir. Are you all right?

                                 CHAD

                        We jumped on you as a precautionary 
                        measure. Some maniac's burning

                        attacking the city with siege

                        Where is he?

           Chad doesn't move, but some of the others point in the

           The team flies back down the stairs.

           Chad sinks to the ground. Looking up, he watches as Ingrid, 
           Gary and Rob slink down the stairs. The OTCDAA members step 
           up to Chad.

                        my chest. Wow. Maybe you could help 
                        me finish moving tomorrow? Squeeze 
                        that kayak behind the couch?

           Margaret and Master Shu move to the door. Margaret rummages 
           through her large purse and finds the #1 Son pillow and puts 
           it on his lap.

                        That's what you are. You're number 
                        one. Number one and only.

           She has one of her emotional hiccups and ends the feeling 
           with a meditative hum that carries her out the door.

           The small suitcase lays on the bed, filled with necessities: 
           underwear, T-shirts, a toothbrush.

           Chad, in khakis and a button down shirt, contemplates a worn 
           book: "The World on Your Allowance: How to Live On Your Own 
           Terms, And Your Own Budget!" Chad adds the book to the 
           luggage. He buckles the buckles.

           Suitcase in hand, Chad shuffles to the front door where there 
           is a KNOCK.

                                 CHAD
                        Who is it?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Detective Terry. I'm here regarding 
                        the Joy Flinn case?

                                 CHAD
                        She's dead.

                                 DETECTIVE TERRY (O.S.)
                        ... Would you come to the precinct 
                        for questions?

                                 CHAD 
                        ... She's dead.

                                 DETECTIVE TERRY (O.S.)
                        It would be helpful if you came 
                        downtown.

           Chad stares at the door, and grips his suitcase.

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           DETECTIVE TERRY (50's. Not well liked) shuffles through his 
           desk. Chad, across from him, realizes he's two desks away 
           from Officer White. White gives a re-assuring nod to Chad. 
           Tiesha's little face peeks out at him.

                                 DETECTIVE TERRY
                        When was the last time you saw your 
                        sister?

                                 CHAD
                        Two years ago.

           A COP with a report interrupts by handing the paper to Terry.

                                 COP
                        Here's that 197 you wanted.

           Terry looks over the report.

                                 DETECTIVE TERRY
                        Excuse me for a second... Will you?

           Terry moves over to Officer White's desk and picks up her 
           phone. Dials. He looks back at Chad and holds up the "just a 
           second" gesture. Officer White listens to everything Terry 
           says and can't help but frown at Chad. Terry hangs up and 
           comes back to his desk, leaving the paper.

                                 DETECTIVE TERRY (CONT'D)
                        You can go home now. The case is 
                        closed.

                                 CHAD
                        I know. She's dead.

                                 DETECTIVE TERRY
                        Um... Actually, we found her. She's 
                        alive.

           Chad doesn't believe it.

                                 CHAD
                        What?

           Terry nods.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        Where is she?

                                 DETECTIVE TERRY
                        ... I can't tell you.

                                 CHAD
                        What?

                                 DETECTIVE TERRY
                        Look. I'm sorry... This is very 
                        awkward. I cannot disclose your 
                        sister's location without her 
                        consent.

                                 CHAD
                        And she didn't give you her 
                        consent?

                                 DETECTIVE TERRY
                        I'm sorry, Mr. Flinn. I cannot 
                        answer that question.

           Chad nods and looks around. Too many people. Too much trash. 
           Too much fluorescent light. He stands up and stumbles to 
           Officer White's desk.

                                 CHAD 
                        Her address. It's written on that 
                        paper? The 197?

           Officer White removes the report from her desk. She shakes 
           her head.

                                 OFFICER WHITE
                        I'm sorry, Chad. If I gave you 
                        this, I would lose my job. I have a 
                        sick kid.

                        Shh, baby.

           Chad nods at White and angles down to see Tiesha, who looks 
           much better, holding the report. She slides it to him.

                                 TIESHA
                        Thanks for the medicine, big 
                        brother.

           Chad looks up to White, who jerks her head at the door. Chad, 
           at a loss for words, smiles at his friend.

           EXT. ATLANTA SUBURB - DAY

           Chad, suitcase in one hand, T-Rex in the other, stops on the 
           sidewalk and looks at a suburban house. It's average looking. 
           Kept up, but not too kept up. He walks to the door. KNOCKS.

           Joy opens the door. She catches her breath. Chad takes in his 
           sister.

                                 CHAD

                        This is my brother, Chad.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Your brother? You never said you 
                        had a brother.

           An awkward moment as the three stand.

                        Hi. Congratulations.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Joy? Should we invite him in?

                        I dunno. Chad, you wanna tasty 
                        beverage or something?

                                 CHAD
                        A tasty beverage sounds pretty 
                        okay.

                        planning on pulling a Lazarus. But 
                        I just didn't know how to-

                                 CHAD
                        No. Please. You never ever, ever, 
                        ever have to explain anything.

           Joy has no words.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)
                        I wanted to tell you that I'm 
                        sorry. For not telling you. That I 
                        was leaving. That was really shitty 
                        of me and I'm sorry.

           She nods.

                                 JOY 
                        When you read that letter, you 
                        must've been so pissed.

                                 CHAD
                        Yeah. I was pretty pissed.

           Joy picks up a towel and starts drying the dishes. He washes, 
           she dries.

                                 JOY 
                        Thanks for finding me.

                                 CHAD
                        Thanks for being here to find.

           They continue.

           EXT. JOY AND JONATHAN'S FRONT PORCH - DAY

           Chad, suitcase in hand, steps into the morning. Joy sees him 
           off.

                                 JOY 
                        Listen. Maybe-

                                 CHAD
                        Yeah?

                        That's gonna be so fucking awesome.

           Chad walks away. She stares after him.

           EXT. THE FOREST WATER HOLE - DAY

           Chad, in white ceremonial paint, leaves the silence of the 
           forest and approaches the edge of the waterfall.

           SOUNDS: Kids playing in water. A SPLASH. SCREAMS of delight.

           Looking down over the crystal blue pool, Chad sees the KIDS 
           playing, calling to someone in the forest beyond to pool.

           From in the forest he hears-

                                 A BIG BEAR OF A VOICE (O.S.)
                        CANNON-

           And an enormous THWAP as the neck of a catapult shoots up 
           over the trees, throwing a BIG BEAR OF A MAN high into the 
           air towards the water-

           The man gets to the same altitude as Chad, on top of the 
           cliff. The BIG BEAR OF A MAN looks at Chad, recognizes him, 
           and waves to him mid-air -

           It's Stevie -

           SPLASH! The kids all scream with delight. Stevie's head pops 
           out of the water-

                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        Chadsworth! Brother! Chadsworth!

           The kids spot who Stevie's yelling at, wave and jump with 
           glee, beckoning him into the pool. KID #1 runs into the 
           forest.

                                 KID #2
                           (in the native tongue)

           Chad, smiling, takes the perfect dive position.

           SPLASH as Chad plunges deep into the water.

           His head bobs to the surface. Stepping out of the pool, he 
           stands before the Elder. The Elder looks into his eyes.
