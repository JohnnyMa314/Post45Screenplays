                   “She suddenly announced what sounded to me like an  
                           ultimatum, a threat to go crazy.”

           in response CLIPPED, HARSH WORDS between a MAN & a WOMAN. The 
           persistent CLACKING of the machine continues OVER:

                        You are a third rate writer and a third

                        You have told me that before.

           CLOSE ON A MOUTH: lips are delicate, well articulated against 
           the skin.  Almost incongruously, the words that flow from 
           them are accompanied by the Man's Voice.

                                 MAN

           INT. A SMALL ROOM - PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC - DAY

           Pale green walls, and a table.  Seated at the table are the 
           Woman and Man -- ZELDA & SCOTT FITZGERALD -- along with a 
           gentleman in a white coat, DR. THOMAS RENNIE, 40.

           SUPER: BALTIMORE, MD - PHIPPS PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC - FEB. 1932

           In the corner, a STENOGRAPHER works at her machine.
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                                 (cutting in))
                        It seems to me you are making a rather 
                        violent attack on a third rate talent --

                                 SCOTT
                                 (over her, emphatic)
                        Now the difference between the 
                        professional and the amateur is 
                        something that is awfully intangible.
                                 (to Dr. Rennie)
                        She has written some nice, little 
                        sketches. She has a satiric point of 
                        view. And some experiences to report.  
                        But she has nothing essentially to say.

                                 ZELDA
                        Why in hell you are so jealous, I don’t 
                        know. If I thought that about anybody, 
                        I wouldn’t care what they wrote -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        Because you are broaching at all times 
                        on my material -- 

                                 ZELDA 
                        For someone with so much material -- 
                        you've taken an awfully long time --

                                 SCOTT
                                 (cutting her off)
                        If I haven't published -- in what -- 
                        six or seven years --

                                 ZELDA
                        Eight --

                                 SCOTT
                                 (to Dr. Rennie)
                        Three of those years were directly 
                        because of a sickness of hers --

                                 ZELDA 
                        You mean you were drinking constantly.

           Scott bridles at the remark.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Lucky for you we didn't divorce.  Who 
                        would you have to blame then?

           Dr. Rennie's expression suggests he doesn't disagree with 
           that observation.
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 SCOTT
                                 (as if in pain)
                        I am being destroyed here. It is all 
                        unfair. The whole equipment of my life 
                        is to be a novelist --

                                 ZELDA
                                 (quipping)
                        I am part of the "equipment" --

                                 SCOTT
                                 (quiet, despairing)
                        But that is all you ever wanted... Look 
                        me at me... Look.  At.  Me...

           Zelda turns to him.

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        I dare you now -- to deny it. Say it 
                        out loud.

           Zelda's eyes brim wet, she bites down hard on her bottom lip, 
           already raw...

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        You've never loved me as much as you 
                        loved what I would make out of you.

           She breaks skin.  Her lip bleeds... Then she looks away. 
           Scott glances at Dr. Rennie, as if to say: "You see."

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                                 (calm now)
                          I am supporting you.  It is all my 
                        material.  None of it is yours.

                                 ZELDA
                                 (to Dr. Rennie, 
                                 steady)
                        I tell you:  my life has been so 
                        miserable that I would rather be in an 
                        asylum.
                                 (to Scott)
                        Does that mean anything to you?

                                 SCOTT
                        It does not mean a blessed thing.

           CLOSE ON ZELDA’S YOUTHFUL FACE

           It rises and breaks the surface of the clear blue water.
           CONTINUED:

           As shattered and spent as that face will be in 15 years, it 
           is now excessively buoyant and spirited.  She is physical 
           splendor incarnate. Yet that is not what strikes you first.  
           It is her eyes, lit from within by an uncanny blend of 
           wisdom, mischief, and passionate detachment.

           SUPER: MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA   JULY, 1917

           INT. HUNTINGTON COLLEGE SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           Zelda, 17, is the only girl among a crew of YOUNG MEN, all 
           enamored of her.  She stands at the end of a diving board, 
           that is the highest of three, at 20 feet.

                                 ZELDA
                        John!  D'you dare me?!

           Her deep, raspy voice conspires with a southern cadence to 
           make her speech altogether enchanting -- Siren-like. Up on 
           the high dive, she is a sight: skin tanned and flaw-less, 
           high cheekbones, golden hair, those gray-green eyes.

           Behind her, the wall is plastered with U.S. ARMY RECRUITMENT 
           POSTERS... YOUNG MEN alternately HECKLE and GOAD her to take 
           the plunge, among them JOHN SELLERS, JR., athletic, 
           confident, a bit older than the others:

                                 JOHN
                        For dinner and a movie!

           Zelda pulls a face: "You've got to be kidding."

                                 ZELDA
                        For that -- I'd jump off a curb!

           And she begins to head back toward the ladder.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay!  Okay. How 'bout an invitation to 
                        the Country Club dance?

           Zelda stops, turns on the board and walks back to the edge.

                                 ZELDA
                        The dance is next week -- ?

                                 JOHN
                        That's right. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Well -- I'm not 18 til the 24th -- They 
                        won't let me in --
           CONTINUED:

                                 JOHN
                        You take that belly-flop, and let me 
                        worry 'bout the technicalities.

           The other YOUNG MEN give WHISTLES and HOOTS to spur them on.

                                 ZELDA
                        John-Sellers-Junior -- since when have 
                        you seen me take a leap I couldn't 
                        manage?

           With that she flies off the board -- a winged creature, all 
           grace and control -- arcing toward the water, and slicing 
           into it with a noiseless finish.

           EXT. SAYRE HOME - PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON

           BEGIN MAIN TITLES

           The porch is a teeming social scene, the axis of which is 
           Zelda herself.  She is seated on the swing with a girlfriend, 
           SARA HAARDT, YOUNG MILITARY OFFICERS drape themselves around 
           her, sipping on glasses of lemonade.

           INT. SEWING ROOM - SAYRE HOME - MONTGOMERY - EARLY EVENING

           Zelda stands on a small platform, in front of a three 
           panelled mirror.  She's wearing an ivory silk chiffon dress 
           and scrutinizing the fit.

           The dress falls to just above her ankles, the neckline is 
           extremely high; the sleeves are three-quarter. Zelda bends, 
           to pick up the hem.  She raises it from her ankle, to just 
           below the knee.  Then higher still...

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Zelda Sayre...?

           She turns to see her Mother, MINNIE SAYRE, 57, in the 
           doorway, round, and matronly as Zelda is lithe. 

                                 ZELDA
                        I'm just bringing this old thing up to 
                        date...

           Minnie looks at her, skeptical.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        I need something special for next 
                        weekend and with a little work...
                                 (beat)
                        I'll do it all myself...
           CONTINUED:

                                 MINNIE
                        Is that supposed to be reassuring?

           But she says it with half a smile.

           ZELDA'S MULTIPLE REFLECTIONS - MORNING

           In the mirror, as she models the finished work for herself.

           The once-matronly dress has been transformed:  the three-
           quarter sleeves are shorn, in favor of a sleeveless look; the 
           buttoned up collar now has a loose, draping neckline; and the 
           hem has been raised to just above the calf, with a small slit 
           on one side that stops above the knee... The piece has an air 
           of being before its time.

           Zelda gives herself the once over and then launches into a 
           spontaneous twirl of delight with her own handiwork.

           ON THE BLURRED IMAGE OF ZELDA: spinning like a top in a tutu.

           INT. MONTGOMERY COUNTRY CLUB AUDITORIUM - EVENING

           Zelda is on stage, performing a ballet before a standing-room 
           only crowd -- a mix of locals and YOUNG MEN in uniform.

           While Zelda's technique is not exacting, there is again, 
           something magnetic about her presence that has a HALF DOZEN 
           of her now familiar admirers in attendance spellbound.

           In the row beyond, there is one unfamiliar face, as rapt as 
           the others, but more striking and polished: a YOUNG OFFICER, 
           20, with blond hair, keen blue eyes, and a fine, aristocratic 
           profile. As Zelda brings the performance to a close, the 
           AUDIENCE rises to their feet to APPLAUD.

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB BALL ROOM - SAME

           A sea of YOUNG WOMEN in pastel Organza, and YOUNG MEN in 
           Black Tie or Officers' Uniforms. A BAND plays Eubie Blake’s 
           CHARLESTON RAG.

           But even in this crowd, Zelda distinguishes herself, as she 
           dances a fast fox-trot with Sellers.  Her grace is 
           unfaltering, her smile radiant, her hands are bare (other 
           girls wear gloves), and her dress -- a Zelda Sayre Original -- 
           is the only one like it in the room (more freedom of 
           movement). Together, the effect is dazzling.
           CONTINUED:

                                 JOHN
                        So how many times do I have to ask?

                                 ZELDA
                        If I tell you that -- it'll take all 
                        the fun out of it --

                                 JOHN 
                        Wish I could say you were wrong --

                                 ZELDA
                        Which is exactly why I don't want to 
                        marry in the first place --

           As she says this, her eyes fix on something across the room:

           The SAME YOUNG OFFICER we saw in the audience is staring 
           right at her, a glass of champagne in his hand, which he 
           lifts now, to her.

           Zelda, unflinching, she stares straight back at him, and 
           cocks her head slightly, with a smile.

           Then John turns, so that her gaze is swept to the other side 
           of the room. But she is the better dancer, so when she moves 
           to turn again, John doesn't resist her.

           The room moves past her in a blur of noise and color, then 
           stops:  the Young Officer comes into sharp focus.  He smiles -
           - and the room is brighter for it -- aware that her maneuver 
           had less to do with the dance than with him.

           John gazes down at Zelda, smitten. But the spell is broken 
           when someone taps gently on John's shoulder.  John steps 
           away, and in his place steps the Young Officer.

           ON ZELDA & THE YOUNG OFFICER

           We see them now for the first time, face to face. They are 
           incandescent: fair haired, with faces like twin ivory cameos, 
           eyes fixed on the other and enchanted by what they see -- an 
           infinite reflection of themselves...

           The dynamic between them has shifted: he leads now, NOT her.  
           Far from straining to keep up with her, his sense of movement 
           and grace are equal to hers.

                                 YOUNG OFFICER
                        Are you going to tell me your name, or 
                        do I have to guess?

           His speech is Northern, clipped and polished...
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ZELDA
                        I just knew you weren't bred on 
                        biscuits --

           He smiles... She notices the college ring on his finger.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        A Princeton boy... You stationed here 
                        at Sheridan?

                                 YOUNG OFFICER
                        Transferred from Camp Gordon about four 
                        weeks ago.

                                 ZELDA 
                                 (doing the math)
                        So you've been here a month...

           He nods.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Well. Then you know exactly who I am -- 
                        And if you don't, you should go right 
                        back to Princeton and demand a refund!

           The Young Officer LAUGHS out loud, until he's interrupted by 
           a tap on the shoulder: John is cutting in:

           ON ZELDA & JOHN: Zelda's body might be moving along with his, 
           but her eyes are on the Young Officer...

           ON THE YOUNG OFFICER: he cuts in on John, much to Zelda's 
           delight.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        I mean if you were famous all over the 
                        world, I'd know a little something 
                        about you too --

                                 YOUNG OFFICER
                        Give me some time: I may be yet... 

           Zelda raises her eyebrows in teasing skepticism. And ANOTHER 
           FAMILIAR BEAU -- LINCOLN WEAVER, 20 -- cuts in.

           ON ZELDA & LINCOLN: as he all but steps on her feet in an 
           attempt to dance... She glances around the room; her eyes 
           lite on the Young Officer:  "Save me!"

           ON ZELDA & THE YOUNG OFFICER: he cuts in on Lincoln, and 
           gives her a most graceful turn.

                                 ZELDA
                        And what will you be famous for...?
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 YOUNG OFFICER
                        My novels...

           He's apparently serious -- almost earnest -- and it catches 
           her off guard... She gives him a curious look.

                                 YOUNG OFFICER (CONT'D)
                        I just finished one. My first. It's 
                        sitting on an editor's desk at 
                        Scribner's even as we speak...

                                 ZELDA 
                        Alright then. Does it have a title?

                                 YOUNG OFFICER
                        "The Romantic Egoist."

           She lets out a lush, deep throated LAUGH.

           The Young Officer is about to add something when a THIRD 
           FAMILIAR BEAU, PETE BONNER, 19, steps in to take his place.

           ON ZELDA & PETE: they spin away from the Young Officer, who 
           calls out after them:

                                 YOUNG OFFICER (CONT'D)
                        My name is Scott!  Francis Scott Key 
                        Fitzgerald!

           Zelda, dancing with Pete, calls back over his shoulder:

                                 ZELDA
                        I hardly need a name! You've just told 
                        me everything I'll ever really need to 
                        know about you...!

           Bold, frank, and utterly spontaneous: her lines are cast.  
           And Scott is hooked by every last one.

           EXT. SODA FOUNTAIN/DINER - DOWNTOWN MONTGOMERY - NIGHT

           Zelda and Lincoln exit the diner, as a group of OFFICERS 
           comes up the street:  Scott is among them.

           Seeing Scott, Zelda takes a step into the light of the corner 
           street lamp, pulling Lincoln with her.

           Then, much to Lincoln's surprise, he finds his lips locked on 
           Zelda's, as Zelda's eyes lock on Scott down the street...

           Scott, and FOUR other OFFICERS, walk up the street with a 
           tipsy jaunt, BANTERING and LAUGHING as they go.
           CONTINUED:

           In a moment of distraction, Scott looks up ahead, and catches 
           sight of Zelda and Weaver, locked in a kiss.  He stops.  The 
           other Officers pause with him, uncertain.

                                 SCOTT
                                 (in the distance)
                        I think I'm done for the night --

           Then they see what he sees and let out a communal MOAN of 
           dismay...

           Zelda, certain now that Scott has seen her, steps from the 
           embrace only a little faster than she stepped into it. 

           INT. SAYRE HOME - SEWING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Zelda stands on the platform in front of the mirror, in 
           another dress, more elaborate and sophisticated than the 
           first.  Minnie is making adjustments.

                                 MINNIE
                        "No Lady ever sits with her limbs 
                        crossed... No Lady ever uses the word 
                        "legs," which is vulgar, and uses 
                        "limbs," which is proper -- "

           CLOTHILDE (TILDE), 20, and Zelda's older sister, enters the 
           room, chiming in with her mother: 

                                 TILDE
                        "No lady ever lets her back touch the 
                        back of her chair, or ever lets her 
                        bare feet touch the floor “

                                 ZELDA
                        All these rules!  When you're little 
                        everyone tells you: "Follow the rules," 
                        because you're just a child.  Which had 
                        me thinking all this time that grown 
                        ups get to make their own rules.  Now 
                        I'm turning 18, and you're telling me 
                        there's some other rules made for 
                        adults? I swear! Why bother growing up 
                        at all!

           INT. SAYRE HOME - SITTING ROOM - EVENING

           Zelda, Tilde, and Minnie are there, awaiting their escorts.

                                 MINNIE
                        Francis Scott Fitzgerald...?
           CONTINUED:

           Minnie gestures to Zelda, who is leaning back in her chair, 
           to sit up straight.

                                 ZELDA
                                 (sitting up)
                        -- Scott Key Fitzgerald -- Related 
                        somehow to the Mr. Key who wrote the 
                        "Star Spangled Banner..."

                                 MINNIE 
                        A Unionist...

                                 TILDE
                        Mama, the song was written in 1814.

                                 MINNIE 
                        Anyway -- "Fitzgerald" -- that's 
                        Irish... He's Catholic --

           Zelda, reflexively, shifts in her seat and crosses her legs.

                                 ZELDA
                        I haven't any idea what he is, and 
                        neither do you --

           Minnie gestures for Zelda to un-cross her legs...

                                 MINNIE 
                        And the Irish Catholic have Whiskey for 
                        breakfast, lunch, and --

                                 ZELDA
                        Mama -- You haven't even met the man!

                                 MINNIE
                        Some things don't need a meeting for --

                                 ZELDA
                        He’s known me a week and he’s gone to  
                        all sorts of trouble to throw me a 
                        party.  And John Sellars, Jr. ?  The 
                        boy didn’t even recall my birthday --

                                 MINNIE
                        I’m just saying, if you're at all 
                        serious about the boy --

                                 ZELDA 
                        Mama honestly: have you ever known me 
                        to be serious about anything? Serious 
                        is soooo un-fun --
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 JUDGE SAYRE (O.S.)
                        And last I checked, "un-fun" is not a 
                        recognizable word in the English 
                        language --

           Zelda rises to greet her father, JUDGE SAYRE, 60ish, elegant, 
           well dressed, and humorless.

           Zelda gives him a flirtatious kiss on the cheek to which he 
           hardly knows how to respond:

                                 ZELDA 
                        But what if that is exactly what I 
                        mean?

           A KNOCK on the door cuts short the conversation. Minnie moves 
           to answer it, and there stands Scott in all his blond and 
           lissom glory, a bountiful bouquet in hand.

           Minnie’s immediate expression suggests even she cannot deny 
           his nearly Dionysian glow. Zelda flashes her mother a look: 
           "I told you so..."

           CLOSE ON A BIRTHDAY CAKE

           A thing frothy and ornate, bedecked with 18 candles. In the 
           b.g. an enthusiastic rendition of HAPPY BIRTHDAY

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB BALL ROOM

           A dozen 6-top tables, swathed in linen and flowers, and the 
           remains of a feast, surround the dance floor. A LIVE BAND 
           plays in the b.g..

           Eighteen birthday candles are the only light in the room.

           Zelda is at the center table in front of the cake, her hands 
           gloveless. She chews girlishly on her bottom lip. The SONG 
           winds down, giving way to the CHANT: "WISH, WISH, WISH."

           She looks around, laying eyes on the dozen or more MALE 
           ADMIRERS in the room (MOST familiar, SOME not).

           A SERIES OF SHOTS on EACH of the YOUNG MEN. A face ripe with 
           hope; another with expectation; still another with fear; a 
           fourth --  LINCOLN WEAVER -- brims with longing...

           Lastly, on SCOTT, his face a refined and complex grid:  love, 
           pride, anxiety, ambition, and a trace of something like 
           agony.  He is the only one NOT CHANTING...
           CONTINUED:

           Zelda closes her eyes, and the room goes still.  Zelda leans 
           into the candlelight, and takes a deep breath. On the SOUND 
           of ZELDA'S EXHALE:

           AT A TABLE - LATER 

           Zelda spins off the dance floor, and drops into a seat next 
           to Sara, KATHERINE ELLSBERRY, and another YOUNG MAN. She 
           takes a cigarette from the pack on the table, lights up, 
           leans back against the chair, crosses her legs, and takes a 
           long drag on the cigarette while watching Scott dance The 
           Charleston with another YOUNG WOMAN -- a fact which doesn't 
           seem to faze Zelda at all. On the contrary.

                                 ZELDA 
                        Just look at him... It's like there's 
                        some heavenly support beneath those 
                        shoulder blades...
                                 (beat)
                        And that smile like a secret: you know -
                        - that all he'd have to do is lift his 
                        feet and he'd be flying, but he chooses 
                        to walk as a concession to the rest of 
                        us...

           Katherine rolls her eyes and smiles. Then as if propelled 
           from her chair, Zelda is back on the dance floor.

           THE DANCE FLOOR - ON ZELDA: she dances with ANOTHER ONE of 
           her familiar Suitors, while keeping an eye on Scott on the 
           other side of the floor.

           Scott turns his PARTNER so that he can likewise keep an eye 
           on Zelda.

           Zelda, flashing a smile, spins away, daring him to come after 
           her.  The energy of the mis-en-scene here is percussive & 
           erotic: that they are dancing with third parties seems only 
           to add to their mutual seduction...

           Zelda spins once again, away from her partner; before she can 
           spin back, Scott is there to intercept her.  They fall into 
           immediate step with one another...

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Slow as honey on a cold day.

                                 SCOTT
                        Things that move slow live long. Like 
                        the tortoise.
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ZELDA 
                        That might make us incompatible.  I'm 
                        most definitely a hare.  And they don't 
                        live long at all.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Surely longer in captivity --

                                 ZELDA 
                        I wouldn't call that a life at all.
                                 (beat)
                        Anyway -- I don't think I'd want you to 
                        see me grow old and ugly -- you'll be a 
                        beautiful old man -- all romantic and 
                        dreamy -- and I'll be wrinkled and dull 
                        like your tortoise...
                                 (beat)
                        I guess we'll just have to die at 
                        thirty!

           It is not the statement alone which is unsettling, but the 
           exuberance with which she says it -- the way a child wants to 
           go for a picnic...

           And it is precisely that troubling chasm between her thoughts 
           and emotions to which Scott is drawn -- the way a scientist 
           might be drawn to a problem he can’t solve: with a compulsive 
           need that can be so easily mistaken for love.  Scott gazes at 
           her, his expression flummoxed.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 SCOTT
                        It's just -- Well the women I write... 
                        They're just like you. Or you're like 
                        them...

           This appeals to Zelda.

                                 ZELDA 
                        And what am I like exactly...?

                                 SCOTT
                        Smart.  Smarter than any man who wants 
                        you.  More courageous too.  And just a 
                        little audacious. 

           To Zelda, the words are beyond validating: they’re curative.

                                 ZELDA 
                        And these women? Are they happy?
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 SCOTT
                        They start out that way. Most of them 
                        anyway. But then things happen.

                                 ZELDA
                        "Things?"  You mean they get married --

                                 SCOTT
                        Well -- yes -- but that's not what 
                        makes them unhappy --

                                 ZELDA
                        What makes you so sure?

                                 SCOTT
                        The point is that things happen to make 
                        them unhappy because a story needs to 
                        go somewhere... It needs drama.

                                 ZELDA 
                        That's funny.  So do I...

           EXT. PINE GROVE - AFTERNOON

           Zelda and Scott weave between the fingers of light that play 
           through the tree tops... She is barefoot, walking along 
           fallen trunks.  Scott keeps his shod feet to the ground.

                                 SCOTT
                                 (from memory) )
                        "She is one of those girls who need never 
                        make the slightest effort to have men 
                        fall in love with them.  Two types seldom 
                        do:  dull men are usually afraid of her 
                        cleverness -- intellectual men are 
                        usually afraid of her beauty.  All other 
                        men are hers by natural prerogative."

                                 ZELDA 
                                 (taking the piss)
                        Well you are an educational feature; an 
                        overture to romance that no young lady 
                        should be without.
                                 (beat)
                        Alright -- Which one of your fancy 
                        Ivory Tower authors wrote that?

           Scott smiles like the cat who ate the canary... And then:

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                                 (impressed)
                          You...?
           CONTINUED:

           Scott nods.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        So when do I get to read this book?

                                 SCOTT
                        The only copy I have is no doubt 
                        sitting in the nether world of all 
                        forgotten manuscripts at Scribner’s. So 
                        you'll have to wait.

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB LAWN - LATE AFTERNOON

           Zelda hangs upside down from the branch of a giant Sycamore. 
           Scott is stretched out on the grass just beneath her, reading 
           from what appears to be a journal... 

           He rolls over now on his back and looks up at her.  

                                 SCOTT 
                        You don’t like women very much, do you?

           Zelda, still upsidedown, shrugs: “I don’t know...”

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        In this journal you've mentioned only 
                        two...

                                 ZELDA
                        Now that I think about it, I suppose 
                        I've always been inclined toward 
                        masculinity... It's such a cheery 
                        atmosphere boys radiate... 

           She pulls herself up so that she is now seated on the branch.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Though men think I'm purely decorative, 
                        and they're just fools for not knowing 
                        better, and I love being rather 
                        unfathomable... Still -- here I am with 
                        the brains to do everything -- well 
                        maybe not everything -- And yet the 
                        only thing that people really want from 
                        me -- what they expect -- is a good 
                        marriage...

                                 SCOTT 
                        So what do you want?

                                 ZELDA
                        I know what I don't want --
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                                 (as if reading her 
                                 mind)
                        "To be one of those women who crawl on 
                        their bellies through colorless 
                        marriages... What grub worms they are!  
                        No... Mine -- if I marry -- is going to 
                        be outstanding... "

           She swings, and releases herself from the branch, such that 
           she's straddling Scott when she lands on her feet.

                                 ZELDA
                                 (prompting)
                        “It can't be the setting...”

                                 SCOTT 
                                 (quoting)
                        "It's going to be the performance. The 
                        live, lovely, glamorous performance.”

                                 ZELDA
                        You’ve read the whole thing?

                                 SCOTT
                        Over and over... You write just the way 
                        you speak. And I could listen to you 
                        speak for the rest of my life and not 
                        be bored...

           Her eyes shine in the high beam of his praise.

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Even gave me an idea for a short story.

                                 ZELDA
                        Well then keep it.  If it'll help you 
                        even just a little bit. Take it with 
                        you when you ship out. I can sort of 
                        keep you company on the boat ride over. 
                                 (beat)
                        Tell me you'll keep it...

           Scott nods, and reaches up to pull her down toward him, but 
           is interrupted by the SOUND of MALE VOICES in the b.g. Zelda 
           looks up and waves.

           John, Pete, and a couple of other YOUNG MEN, are tooling 
           about in a golf cart...

                                 JOHN
                        Want to join us? 
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ZELDA 
                        Not today!  How ‘bout next week!?

           The cart-full of Young Men is passing beside them now, as 
           they head toward the green.

           They head off, and Zelda looks back down at Scott, ready to 
           pick up where they left off. But he is not.  He's sitting up 
           now, his face suddenly tight with annoyance.

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t believe it... 

           Zelda is thrown by the shift in his manner... Scott rises, 
           and begins to walk down the slope toward the road. 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (following)
                        You're not going all jealous on me.
                                 (beat)
                        Oh good God -- I've known these boys 
                        all my life!

           Scott walks on... Zelda yells after him:

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Francis Scott Fitzgerald! I've kissed 
                        thousands of boys, and I intend to kiss 
                        thousands more.  But what makes you 
                        think I'd stop loving you? 

           There it is: she’s dared to say it first... And yet -- she is 
           also unafraid of -- even stirred by -- the harsh and naked 
           truth. And he's drawn to that despite himself. He stops now, 
           and stares up at her uncomprehending... After a beat:

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        If I were clever, I’d lie about it. But 
                        I’d rather be stupid than craven. I 
                        know very well I’m self-regarding, and 
                        a child-woman of the worst kind -- but 
                        I just refuse to be a coward.

           Zelda watches as Scott takes this in. He is falling in love 
           despite himself. Then he turns to head down the rest of the 
           hill alone.

           INT. MONTGOMERY COUNTRY CLUB - COCKTAIL HOUR

           SUPER:  NOVEMBER, 1918 - ONE MONTH LATER

           The American Flags, and the wilted Victory banners tell us 
           that the town has been celebrating since Armistice Day.
           CONTINUED:

           Zelda is on the crowded dance floor with one of her many 
           Beaux. He twirls her about, and as he does so, something 
           catches her eye across the room.

           Amid the CROWD at the bar, is an OFFICER, medium height and 
           build, with a head of sleek blond hair. His face is turned 
           away.

           Zelda continues to dance, but is now distracted, searching 
           the sea of people...

           The BLOND OFFICER, his drink in hand, steps away from the 
           bar, and is now obscured from view. Zelda stops dancing, 
           cranes her neck to catch sight of that BLOND HAIR...

                                 PARTNER
                        Zelda?

           She is wading into the thicket of dancers to cross the room. 

           Zelda replies over her shoulder:

                                 ZELDA
                        I'll only be a minute...

           And she disappears into human tide.

           ANOTHER ANGLE - ON ZELDA: with mounting urgency, she makes 
           her way across the room.

           Then a glimpse: that shock of Blond hair...

           She darts to catch up with it, zig-zagging her way through 
           the crush of People. As she steps clear of the Crowd:

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Scott!

           The Blond Officer turns in her direction; her face falls. 

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                                 (blushing, flustered)
                        Sorry... I thought... A different Scott 
                        is all... My Scott...

           She turns away embarrassed, and disappointed. She takes one 
           step and all but collides with her Scott...

           And, in an unusual display of vulnerability, she lets out a 
           spontaneous YELP of DELIGHT, throws herself around him, 
           buries her face in his neck.

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT

           Zelda and Scott walk hand in hand across the lawn.

                                 SCOTT
                        Never even got my orders...  The only 
                        wound I've got to show for my trouble 
                        is the one to my ego...

           Zelda's unclear:

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        They rejected the novel... The said:
                        "The story does not culminate in 
                        anything as it must to justify the 
                        readers' interest."

           He removes a small flask from the pocket on the inside of his 
           jacket.  He offers it to Zelda.

                                 ZELDA
                        They're scared...

           She says this without a trace of irony; and Scott adores her 
           for it... She takes a swig from the flask, and hands it back.  
           He takes a longer draught...

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        People are scared of things they can’t 
                        understand.

           Scott is less buoyant than we've seen him.  There's a trace 
           of fear and vulnerability that's showing itself here.

                                 SCOTT
                        I'm thinking about writing for a 
                        newspaper -- I could do that --

                                 ZELDA
                        Oh no -- you can't! I mean I'm sure you 
                        can, but -- You can't give up!

           The urgency in her voice is laced with self-interest:  he has 
           to succeed to fulfill her dreams...

                                 SCOTT
                        Or maybe advertising --
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA 
                        What happened to the man who was going 
                        to write the Great American Novel -- ?

                                 SCOTT
                                 (sheepish)
                        Chastened a bit. Maybe even humbled.

                                 ZELDA
                        Say that again, and keep a straight 
                        face.

           Scott laughs despite himself.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        You're not a coward Scott... You just 
                        can't be a coward...

           After a beat, he nods...

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Alright then... Now come with me...

           EXT. MADAM HELEN ST. CLAIR'S - NIGHT

           Zelda climbs the iron ladder on the back wall of the building 
           like she was born to it.  She beckons Scott to follow.

                                 SCOTT
                        What are we -- !?

           Zelda HUSHES him, gestures to the ladder.  He obliges, but is 
           less agile than she...

           EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME

           Zelda lies down flat, and peers over the edge. Scott joins 
           her.  Below, MEN enter and exit the establishment.

                                 SCOTT
                                 (musing)
                        We're on the roof of a whore house --
                                 (to Zelda)
                        Do you care to tell me what we're doing 
                        on the roof of a whore house?

                                 ZELDA
                        "Beckoning the Muse..."

           He marvels at her as she retrieves a flashlight from what is 
           clearly a cache of items from previous outings. Then she  
           turns the "high beam" on the in- and out-going CLIENTELE...
           CONTINUED:

           Immediately the MEN scatter in a panic, YELLING EXPLETIVES in 
           the general direction of the roof...

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Lizzy Calhoun's daddy. He's a lawyer... 
                        Mrs. Calhoun runs the Country Club 
                        Charity Drive... Oh --  And there's her 
                        little brother!

                                 SCOTT
                        Marry me Zelda...

                                 ZELDA 
                        You don't mean that -- There's my high 
                        school civics teacher!

                                 SCOTT
                        Then call my bluff --

           Zelda looks at him now...

                                 MADAM ST. HELEN (O.S.)
                        Ten seconds, or I'll send up my boys to 
                        throw you down!

           Zelda and Scott look down to see MADAM ST. HELEN, 55, and a 
           faded, porcine beauty caked in make up.

           Zelda cuts the flash light, and tosses it into the corner, 
           then scrambles down the back of the building, with Scott just 
           behind her.

           ON THE GROUND

           They take off at a run...

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB GOLF COURSE - A BIT LATER

           The lawn shimmers, undulant and steely blue beneath the full 
           moon.  The air is thick with the scent of Magnolias, and the 
           last of summer. And they are alone.

           They catch their breath, slowing from a jog to a walk... 
           Scott is more winded than Zelda...

                                 ZELDA
                        I could say "Yes" -- but it's more 
                        complicated than that --

                                 SCOTT
                        Very simple: one syllable -- 
           CONTINUED:

           Scott leans against the trunk of a lone Magnolia tree, the 
           moonlight bouncing off its large waxy leaves.

                                 ZELDA
                        How will you earn a living -- ?

                                 SCOTT
                        So you don't believe in my work --

                                 ZELDA
                        The question is do you -- ?

                                 SCOTT
                        I can make money if that's what you 
                        want --

                                 ZELDA
                        It's not what I want -- All the 
                        material things are nothing.  I'd just 
                        hate to live a sordid existence because 
                        you'd soon love me less and less --

           Scott makes no denial.

                                 SCOTT 
                        I'll go to New York.  I'll get a job as 
                        a journalist.  And --

                                 ZELDA
                                 (a finger on his lips)
                        You'll stop talking... And then you'll 
                        kiss me...

           Zelda faces him, just a foot away.

                                 SCOTT
                        You are one shameless Thoroughbred.

                                 ZELDA
                        And Goofo -- you wouldn't like me if I 
                        were anything less.

                                 SCOTT
                        "Goofo -- ?"

                                 ZELDA
                        Well you are, just a bit, of a goof I 
                        mean.  Beneath all that Italian 
                        Herringbone and those cap-toed Oxfords.  
                        Which is not to say you don't take a 
                        certain pleasure in making trouble.  I 
                        know an exhibitionist when I see one --
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 SCOTT
                        It takes one --

                                 ZELDA
                        Which is exactly why I know just how 
                        different we are: you put on a show 
                        because you want to be admired --

                                 SCOTT
                        And you -- ?

                                 ZELDA
                        -- Because I don't give a damn what 
                        people think.

           He gives her a long look, then nods just enough to let her 
           know that he knows she's right. Then he kisses her... And she 
           returns it in kind.

           There is an awkward hunger in the way these two come 
           together: if he's more experienced than she, it’s not by 
           much. He pauses now, pulls back:

                                 SCOTT
                        Right now?  Here -- on the grass?

           There's trepidation in his voice, as if he might be put off 
           by the idea of having sex on the ground...

                                 ZELDA 
                        It beats some downtown motel with a 
                        concierge who won't think twice about 
                        taking a tip from the local gossip 
                        columnist. Think of how much nicer 
                        it'll be to remember the grass and the 
                        moonlight tripping over your sweet 
                        face.

                                 SCOTT
                        And yours...

           And she kisses him again, drawing him in.  His hands fumble 
           with the buttons of her linen jacket.  Her hands work along 
           with his at the buttons of the back of her skirt.

           Her jacket and skirt fall to the ground revealing the silken 
           half-slip and garter-held stockings beneath...

           Now she poses her leg, dancer like, around his; his hands 
           work up the inside of her slip. Then he crouches to lift her, 
           and cradling her, he lays her gently down on the grass.
           CONTINUED: (3)

           There is an authenticity to the way they grope and grab at 
           one another, and in that late summer grass, try to disappear 
           into one another...

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB GOLF COURSE - LATER

           Zelda and Scott, happily spent, lie head to head, staring up 
           at the sky.

                                 ZELDA
                        I feel like you had me ordered -- and I 
                        was delivered to you -- to be worn. I 
                        want you to wear me like a watch charm, 
                        or a button hole bouquet -- to the 
                        world.  And then, when we're alone, I 
                        want to help -- to know that you can't 
                        do anything without me.

                                 SCOTT
                        As soon as I get to New York, I'll 
                        start looking for a place...

                                 ZELDA 
                        I wish New York were a little tiny 
                        town, so I could imagine how it'll be. 
                        I haven't the remotest idea...

                                 SCOTT
                        It's a little like you: unfathomable.

                                 ZELDA
                        Well then we might just get along. And 
                        I'll find something to do. I can dance.  
                        I always feel so self-reliant when I'm 
                        dancing.  

           She rolls over on her stomach now, looking down at Scott.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Or even better: you’ll create the 
                        version of me that is everything I 
                        couldn't possibly be... That's what 
                        I'll do with myself: I'll be your 
                        fictional girl...

           And as if she's just said the magic words, Scott reaches into 
           his pocket, and produces a small box.

                                 SCOTT
                        Maybe you'd be my real girl too?
           CONTINUED:

           He offers her the box. Zelda opens it to reveal a beautiful, 
           "antique" engagement ring.  And the sight of it unravels all 
           that bravado; her mask falls, her eyes brim wet.

           Scott takes some small satisfaction in seeing this. He 
           removes the ring from the box.

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        May I?

           And Zelda extends the ring finger of her left hand, and tucks 
           her bottom lip beneath her teeth, and bites down hard.

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MORNING - ESTABLISHING

           The soft, undulant shapes and colors of the South give way to 
           straight lines, shades of gray, and bustling streets. 

           In the biting cold, Scott huddles into his coat as he walks 
           down the street. His face is ashen, his eyes bleary from lack 
           of sleep. He comes to a high rise: CONSOLIDATED STREET 
           RAILWAY ADVERTISING CO.; he jerks open the door, and heads 
           inside.

           INT. PRINCETON/YALE CLUB - BAR/LOUNGE - EARLY EVENING

           Leather club chairs, dark wood, crystal glasses, no women... 
           This is Scott’s world.  

           He is there with EIGHT YOUNG MEN whose faces we will come to 
           know well: LUDLOW FOWLER, LAWTON CAMPBELL, JOHN PEALE BISHOP 
           ("BISHOP" - future editor of Vanity Fair) EDMOND ("BUNNY") 
           WILSON future literary critic),  ALEX MCKAIG, JOHN BIGGS 
           ("BIGGS" - future attorney), STEPHEN (PEEVIE) PARROT, and 
           PORTER GILLESPIE.  

           They are well past merry and on their way to seeing double. 
           Nonetheless, between slurs, Scott manages to read to them 
           from what we now recognize as Zelda's journal...

                                 SCOTT
                        "I think I like breathing twilit 
                        gardens and moths more than beautiful 
                        pictures or good books -- "

           He looks up at his friends, drunk and in love... 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Is that not the most -- the most 
                        lyrical voice you've ever heard?

           His friends look back at him, baffled at best. 
           CONTINUED:

                                 PEEVIE
                                 (venturing)
                        Well. It's a very human document. But --
                        I don't altogether understand it.

           Scott looks to the others to come to his defense: SILENCE.

                                 SCOTT 
                        The lot of you -- So educated you 
                        wouldn't know an authentic feeling if 
                        it sat on your face --

                                 BIGGS
                        Here's to testing that theory!

                                 SCOTT 
                        You fatuous illiterate --

           The words come out: "ya-fachoo-iss-il-liderit..."

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                                 (emphatic)
                        Well I think she's a genius... And 
                        Aristotle would support me here!
                                 (less certain)
                        Well I think it was Aristotle.
                        He said "It is the mark of genius, for 
                        to make good metaphors implies an eye 
                        for resemblances."

                                 BISHOP
                        I believe it was also Aristotle who 
                        said "No great genius has ever existed 
                        without a tincture of madness."

                                 SCOTT 
                        Well then, with any luck, I've got a 
                        trace more than she...

           CLOSE ON A REJECTION LETTER

           "Dear, Mr. Fitzgerald, we regret to inform you that we cannot 
           publish your submission at this time..."

           The CAMERA MOVES ALONG to reveal another letter of rejection, 
           and yet another.

           INT. SCOTT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Small, but well appointed.  Scott takes a swig from his 
           flask, then posts one more rejection letter on a wall 
           plastered with them. 
           CONTINUED:

                                 LAWTON (V.O.)
                        I hear congratulations are in order.

                                 ZELDA (V.O.)
                        I guess it depends on the day.  I wore 
                        the ring at first, but...  

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB - LOUNGE (MONTGOMERY) - EVENING

           Zelda is at the bar, talking with the now familiar Lawton 
           Campbell (Scott's friend from Princeton).  She is NOT wearing 
           her engagement ring, and she's chewing on her bottom lip 
           almost compulsively...

                                 ZELDA 
                        It's rather trying -- this sort of 
                        affair. He doesn't write from one week 
                        to the next, but gets all sulky when I 
                        don't write every day.
                                 (beat)
                        It just seems like such a gamble.

           Zelda involuntarily rubs her ringless finger with her thumb.

                                 LAWTON
                        If it's money you're worried about --

                                 ZELDA
                        Am I the only one who sees that money 
                        means more to Scott than almost 
                        anything else? On the one hand he 
                        resents it -- and people who have it -- 
                        on the other he craves it. And if he 
                        doesn't manage to make enough of it, 
                        he'll be mean and angry and drunk til 
                        he dies from it.

           Lawton doesn't attempt to dispute her.  A GROUP of YOUNG MEN 
           enters the lounge, apparently looking for Zelda.

                                 LAWTON
                        I honestly think he'll be able to earn 
                        his living with his writing. There was 
                        a young editor at Scribner’s who's very 
                        keen on him. 

           Zelda brightens at this...

                                 ZELDA
                        Well if he sells the book, I'll marry 
                        him...
           CONTINUED:

           And then one Young Man from the group -- PERRY ADAIR, 21, 
           wearing a sweater that bears the emblem of the Georgia Tech 
           Golf team -- approaches the table.

                                 PERRY
                        Hey Darlin' -- we’re heading out --

           And after a look at Lawton, Zelda allows herself to be 
           ushered out and swept along the path of least resistance.

           INT. SAYRE HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Zelda shuffles in, a little worse for wear.  Her Father is 
           just leaving to go to work.  He tosses the local paper across 
           the table in her direction without a word.  Zelda glances at 
           the headline:

           "PRETTY MONTGOMERY GIRL CREATES STIR AMONG ATLANTA YOUTHS"

           Zelda MOANS with annoyance...

                                 MINNIE
                        Don't look here for sympathy. Coming 
                        home last night wearing Perry Adair's 
                        pin --

                                 ZELDA
                        I assure you, Mamma, I did not 
                        appreciate that fact until I woke up 
                        this morning -- 

                                 MINNIE
                        Who knows -- you might be better off 
                        with Perry than with Scott...

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott is sweet.

           Judge Sayre peers in as he puts on his coat to leave.

                                 JUDGE SAYRE
                        He's never sober.

                                 MINNIE
                        If your sisters had it their way --

                                 ZELDA
                        I know very well what way they'd have 
                        it -- but it's not their life to have 
                        -- is it?

           Zelda slips a piece of stationary from her robe pocket. 
           CONTINUED:

                        Anyway, I’ve already written Perry a 
                        note telling him I can’t accept the 
                        pin.  But I’m out of envelopes... If 
                        you have one to spare, I’ll put it in 
                        the post this afternoon. 

           INT. PRINCETON/YALE CLUB - LOUNGE

           Scott is on the window ledge, swigging from a flask in one 
           hand, and reading from a letter in the other. Biggs, Peevie, 
           Ludlow, and Porter are there, but unmoved.

                                 SCOTT
                        "Dearest Perry -- "
                                 (spitting the word)
                        Perry.  Very fairy. Dingle-berry.
                                 (reading on)
                        "The dance was most everything you 
                          promised it would be and then some, and 
                          not one square inch of myself regrets 
                          it -- "

                                 PEEVIE
                        Does one dance with every square inch 
                        of one's self?

                                 SCOTT
                        "That said, I am sober enough this 
                          morning to realize that I on the other 
                          hand cannot make good on the promise of 
                          your pin... So I return it to you -- 
                          maybe with a certain reluctance -- "  A 
                        certain reluctance?  What am I supposed 
                        to make of that!?

                                 LUDLOW
                        Nothing!  The letter wasn't meant for 
                        you --  So stop feeling sorry for 
                        yourself, come down off that sill, burn 
                        that pablum, and come with us to the 
                        party at the Plaza.

           EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAWN

           Scott, in the suit he was wearing the night before, shirt 
           untucked, his tie long gone, rolls empty champagne bottles 
           down the empty avenue with Ludlow.

                                 LUDLOW
                        So what now?
           CONTINUED:

           Scott shrugs, glances at his pocket watch.

                                 SCOTT
                                 (a sheepish grin)
                        The train to Montgomery leaves in an 
                        hour.

           Ludlow nods, well aware that there would be no other way. 
           Still, he’s concerned for his friend. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Oh Luddie -- I know what people say 
                        about her.  And I don’t care. Any girl 
                        who gets stewed in public, smokes 
                        constantly, and says she’s 'kissed a 
                        thousand men and intends to kiss a 
                        thousand more,' cannot be considered 
                        above reproach even if above it. But 
                        I’m in love with her courage, her 
                        sincerity, and her flaming self 
                        respect, and it's these things I'd 
                        believe in even if the whole world 
                        indulged in wild suspicions that she 
                        wasn't all that she should be. I love 
                        her and that's the beginning and end 
                        of everything. I guess there was a 
                        moment there at some point when I was 
                        still a Catholic -- and there was 
                        meaning in that. But now?  Zelda's the 
                        only God I have left.
                                 (beat)
                        Without her I'll never write a thing 
                        worth the paper it's printed on.

           Ludlow is sympathetic, but skeptical.

                                 LUDLOW
                        She’s a whirlwind, Scott. And 
                        whirlwinds can become hurricanes... 

                                 SCOTT
                        So maybe she’ll wreck me. Is it 
                        possible to be more wrecked than I am 
                        now?  I'm a failure: mediocre at 
                        advertising, unable to get started as a 
                        writer, and losing my girl all at once.

           EXT. SAYRE HOME - MONTGOMERY - AFTERNOON

           Scott walks up the steps to the porch. 
           CONTINUED:

           He’s dressed as he was when we last saw him -- though more 
           rumpled and sweat stained for the journey. His eyes are red 
           from lack of sleep, his face unshaven.

           He approaches the front door, makes a few half-hearted 
           gestures at tidying himself up -- then gives up.  Every 
           gesture is ripe with desperation...

           He KNOCKS. Zelda answers: the short GASP suggests just how 
           unsettled she is by the sight of him in such a state.

                                 ZELDA
                        Oh Goofo...

           INT. SAYRE HOME - PARLOR - SAME

           Zelda and Scott are in the thick of it. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I was losing my mind! I couldn't think, 
                        couldn't write -- !

                                 ZELDA
                        It was a mistake -- I put the letter in 
                        the wrong envelope!

                                 SCOTT 
                        Zelda please -- Let's get married.  
                        Tomorrow.

                                 ZELDA
                        We can't...

                                 SCOTT
                        Next week then...

           Zelda shakes her head: "No..."

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Are you in love with him?

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott don't be silly!  You're the only 
                        man I've ever loved -- I'll always love 
                        you --

                                 SCOTT
                        Why does that feel so much like "I'll 
                        never love you enough..."

                                 ZELDA
                        We just can't get married...
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT 
                        Why not?

                                 ZELDA
                        So we can live in some squalid little 
                        one room apartment and be miserable 
                        together -- ?

           The detachment is giving way to sadness... Her eyes tear up, 
           but these are tears of loss, not desperation.

                                 SCOTT
                        We'll make a start of it... 

                                 ZELDA
                        I couldn't bear it... Watching our 
                        dreams fade away in some washed out 
                        version of a life...

                                 SCOTT 
                        Two years -- three at most --

                                 ZELDA
                        I can't, Scott. I can't be shut away 
                        from the trees and the flowers, and the 
                        water -- cooped up in a little flat, 
                        waiting for you to come home from a job 
                        you can't stand.  You'd hate me in a 
                        narrow atmosphere.  I'd make you hate 
                        me.

                                 SCOTT
                        You love me Zelda...

                                 ZELDA
                        Which is why I can't marry you and turn 
                        us both into hateful creatures. 

           She removes the engagement ring from her finger, and offers 
           it up to Scott.

           Scott's tear-stained face goes slack, as if her gesture has 
           just snapped the string that was keeping him together...  He 
           begins to shiver -- but not from cold... From anguish.  
           Expressionless, and quaking, at last he takes the ring.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        You should go now...

           By contrast her tears have a serenity to them -- the calm of 
           acceptance... Saying nothing more, Scott backs out the door, 
           and then he's gone.
           EXT. CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS PUBLISHING HOUSE - DAY

           A new day. Scott is showered, shaved, in suit, tie & hat -- 
           but still cloaked in despair.  He enters the building.

           INT. SCRIBNER'S - RECEPTION DESK - SAME

           Scott approaches the RECEPTIONIST’S desk:

                                 PERKINS (O.S.)
                        Mr. Fitzgerald?

           Scott turns to see an elegant, handsome man, in his mid 30's, 
           extends his hand to Scott.

                                 PERKINS (CONT'D)
                        Max Perkins...

           INT. PERKINS' OFFICE - SAME

           Scott is seated, Perkins stands behind his desk, looking over 
           Scott's manuscript.

                                 PERKINS
                        I'm dealing with a very traditional 
                        group of gentlemen -- This isn't the 
                        first time -- or last -- that we 
                        haven't seen eye to eye.  This is 
                        however the first time I'm going to 
                        push back.

           For just a flash, Scott's face brightens.

                                 PERKINS (CONT'D)
                        It was there, in your very first draft -
                        - more originality and voice than I've 
                        ever seen.  And this draft is stronger 
                        still. But I had a thought: do you 
                        think you could re-write the whole 
                        piece in the third person?

           Scott considers this a moment, then slowly, nods:

                                 SCOTT
                        I suppose. I don't see why not.

                                 PERKINS
                        Somehow I think it will make the 
                        material more accessible to them 
                        without compromising your literary 
                        intentions...
           CONTINUED:

           Scott nods more emphatically now, as he thinks it through.

                                 SCOTT
                        Yes... I see that.  And I have some new 
                        material now which might flesh out the 
                        relationships between the characters -- 

           Perkins’ face lights up with a generous smile.

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        I'll do it...

                                 PERKINS
                        I am honestly grateful to you --

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh please --

                                 PERKINS
                        It's true: for not giving up on them -
                        - us -- conservative as we are.

                                 SCOTT
                        The gratitude befits me more -- 

           Scott rises from his chair, suddenly hopeful again. 

           INT. SCOTT’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Scott is at work in front of the wall where the rejection 
           letters used to be.  Now, the wall is papered with a frenzy 
           of chapter headings, outlines, and narrative "graphs.  On his 
           desk: a carafe of water and a half-eaten sandwich. Nothing 
           more. 

           A SERIES OF CUTS as Scott alternately pastes, removes, and 
           rearranges bits of paper on the wall.

           The CUTS are fast, so as to the give the impression of a man 
           in a manic state, engaged in the process of writing as if it 
           were a contact sport.

           CLOSE ON TYPED LETTERS

                "T-H-E-R-E  W-A-S  N-O  G-O-D  I-N  H-I-S  H-E-A-R-T  H-E

                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                          -- His ideas were still in riot.

           Scott paces, as he reads the his words back to himself:
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                          There was ever the pain of memory, the 
                          regret for his lost youth -- yet the 
                          waters of disillusion had left a de-
                          posit on his soul, responsibility and.
                                 (beat)
                        And...

           He slips the pen from behind his ear, goes to the desk, and 
           jots something down on the paper in his hand.

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                                 (creating it as he 
                                 goes)
                          Responsibility and a love of life, the 
                          vague stirring --  No.
                                 (pauses; then starts)
                          The faint stirring of old ambitions and 
                          -- and unrealized dreams.  But -- oh, 
                          Rosalind! -- Rosalind!...

           He looks it over, then barely audible, involuntary:

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Zelda...

           EXT. SCOTT’S APARTMENT BLDG - NEW YORK - MORNING

           Scott, on his way out, holds the door open for the POSTMAN, 
           who hands him his mail. The Postman heads in, and Scott 
           rifles through his mail as he steps out to the sidewalk. Then 
           he stops walking: it’s an envelope from Scribner’s...

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Scott sprints up the street, stopping random DRIVERS:

           His joy is so contagious, that even New York DRIVERS smile on 
           his behalf, AD LIBBING CONGRATULATIONS as he darts by.

           INT. NY POST OFFICE - LONG DISTANCE PHONE ROOM - NIGHT

           Scott is in one of the booths, yelling into the phone:

                                 SCOTT
                        I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner, 
                        Sir... But if Zelda's there... I'd 
                        rather speak to her now if she's... 
                        Tell her it's important... Please... 

           But the line has gone dead. Scott heads for the exit. 
           EXT. SAYRE HOME - MONTGOMERY - DAY

           Scott is standing at the door as Minnie answers.  

                                 MINNIE
                        Scott...

                                 SCOTT
                        Mrs. Sayre... I have to see Zelda --

                                 MINNIE
                        Well -- I don’t -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        With all due respect: I’m not asking.

           After a beat, Minnie steps aside to let him in.  

           ANOTHER ANGLE - ON SCOTT

           He makes his way up the stairs, and down the hall to the door 
           of her room.

           He pauses a moment, gets his bearings: he's a long way from 
           the broken creature he was the last time he made an 
           appearance, and he knows it.

           He KNOCKS lightly, and the door gives way.  He peers in.

           Zelda is on the bed, half-way through his manuscript, tears 
           in her eyes.  He enters; she looks up as if out of a revery:

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott...!

                                 SCOTT
                        I'll come back later -- so you can 
                        finish --

                                 ZELDA 
                        This is my fourth time through...! The 
                        book is just so fine... And I am 
                        miserably, and... And completely and -- 
                        a little unexpectedly -- I am yours...

           Scott is beside himself... Unable to find his tongue until he 
           manages the only thing that comes to mind.

                                 SCOTT
                        So you liked it?
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA 
                        I'm a good long way past "like" -- I 
                        mean -- Rosalind: she's altogether me!

                                 SCOTT
                        You don't mind -- ?

                                 ZELDA
                        Mind  ?

                                 SCOTT
                        I used your diary -- and a few of your 
                        letters too --

                                 ZELDA
                        Goofo, I'm so proud of you... You 
                        really can do things -- anything -- And 
                        I love to feel that maybe I can help 
                        just a little...

           He pulls a box from inside his jacket pocket and sets it on 
           the bed. Zelda looks at it, curious.

                                 SCOTT 
                        Just a token...

           Zelda picks up the box, undoes the ribbon and opens it:  a 
           delicate platinum, diamond studded watch, on a black silk 
           cord. The back of the watch is engraved:

                                 ZELDA
                                 (under her breath)
                        “From Scott to Zelda -- “
                                 (beat)
                        My God Scott -- We can't keep this  -- 
                        we'll need the money --

                                 SCOTT
                        I sold a story to the Saturday Evening 
                        Post -- and the movie rights went to 
                        the Metro Company.

           With a GASP she launches into a girlish twirl of celebration. 
           She comes to a stop and turns to him:

                                 ZELDA
                        Darlin' -- Can we make sure we get a 
                        place with a bathtub -- a big one -- 
                        since I'll need to swim around in 
                        something or I just won't be happy...
           EXT. ST. PATRICK'S CATHEDRAL - DAY

           SUPER: APRIL 2, 1921

           The wedding party is just exiting the church: Zelda, Scott, 
           Ludlow Fowler as Best Man, Marjorie & her husband, MINOR 
           BRINSON, ROSALIND SAYRE, 30, Zelda's Middle Sister & her 
           husband, NEWMAN SMITH, and an officiating PRIEST, 60.  

           Tilde and her husband, JOHN PALMER are arguing with Zelda. 

                                 TILDE 
                        It’s bad enough Mama and Daddy aren’t 
                        here -- but he couldn't wait ten 
                        minutes so at least I could see my 
                        little sister get married... ?

                                 ZELDA
                        He gets impatient -- 

           There is something forced in Zelda's attempt at levity here. 
           Something almost sad.

                                 ROSALIND
                        Tilde honey, you didn't miss much --

           Zelda flashes a look at Rosalind.

                                 ROSALIND (CONT'D)
                        What I mean is that it was nearly a 
                        civil ceremony -- nothing elaborate.  
                        I'm sure the luncheon --

           Zelda's face wrinkles at the mention of a luncheon... She 
           looks to Scott.  Rosalind eyes the exchange...

                                 ROSALIND (CONT'D)
                                 (to Scott)
                        There is a luncheon -- ?

                                 SCOTT
                        No -- not exactly... I got rooms for 
                        everyone at the Biltmore --

                                 TILDE
                                 (more indignant)
                        There's a party of some kind -- !

           Scott's silence is enough to provoke expressions of disdain 
           in Tilde, Marjorie, and Rosalind alike...
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUDLOW
                                 (saving the day)
                        At my place! This evening. 

           INT. ROOM 2109 - BILTMORE HOTEL - AFTERNOON

           Zelda is enchanted with the room, which has an unobstructed 
           view of Central Park...

           In the b.g., a BELLBOY hauls Zelda's numerous trunks and 
           suitcases in from the hallway.

           The elegant geometry and muted tones of the room are new to 
           Zelda... Even here, we sense that the understated formality 
           is at odds with Zelda's ebullience...

           She takes it all in, chewing reflexively on her bottom lip, 
           as if fighting off a wave of melancholy...

                                 ZELDA
                        Just think how different things will 
                        be!  No parents telling me what to do -- 
                        not that I ever listened.  Still... I 
                        can put out the light when I'm good and 
                        ready.  No power on earth can make me 
                        do anything any more, except myself.

           As light and airy as those words may be, her voice is laced 
           with something like fear... And maybe loss.

           She places their very first -- and only -- wedding gifts on 
           the dressing table: a chocolate set with a Tiffany urn, and a 
           fading Easter Lily...

           After a beat, she moves them to the other side of the 
           dresser... Still dissatisfied, she's about to move them 
           again, when Scott appears behind her, embracing her -- warm 
           and protective...

                                 SCOTT
                        There'll never be just the two of us 
                        again -- from now on we'll be three: 
                        you, me, and us...

                                 ZELDA
                        Why does that sound so sad when in fact 
                        we're safer and closer than ever?

           A SERIES OF SHOTS AROUND MANHATTAN

           As Scott shows Zelda the city from top to bottom, their body 
           language alone -- i.e. 
           CONTINUED:

           he leads, she follows -- more than hints at the shift in the 
           dynamic between them: they are in HIS world now... For now, 
           the novelty of it all is exhilarating to them both.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - HANSOM CABS

           Zelda and Scott, ensconced in the bubble of their romance, 
           her hand in his.  He glances down at the watch he gave, 
           glinting on her wrist, then frowns slightly:

                                 SCOTT
                        How can you tell the time -- ?

           Zelda looks at him, uncertain: 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        The watch is face down... 

           She glances down, and we see that indeed the watch face is 
           twisted, clock-side down, and the inscription is up side. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Oh -- I must’ve turned it over four 
                        hundred times just to read “From Scott 
                        to Zelda...” 

           She takes such comfort in those words... 

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        I figure it’s easier just to leave it 
                        that way... 

           EXT. LORD & TAYLOR - FIFTH AVENUE

           Zelda and Scott walk along the stretch of display windows.

           Their reflections bounce off the glass, offering a glimpse of 
           the difference between Zelda's pedestrian clothes, and what 
           she is seeing in the store...

                                 ZELDA
                        I’m not afraid of anything... Besides, 
                        I know you can take much better care of 
                        me than I can...

           Zelda's outfit looks terribly provincial by comparison.

                                 SCOTT
                        What makes you so sure?
           EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK

           They stroll through the park. The banter is playful, uniquely 
           theirs. It is in this endless verbal game playing that they 
           are so completely bound to each other.

                                 ZELDA
                        I just know I'm going to be happy with 
                        you -- always --

           Then they come upon the fountain at the center of the park:

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Well there's the first public pool I've 
                        seen so far!

           Scott laughs...

           EXT. GOTHAM BOOK MART - LATE AFTERNOON

           Zelda and Scott stand at the window of the book store, where 
           THIS SIDE OF PARADISE is prominently displayed, along with a 
           handwritten sign:

                     “YOUNGEST WRITER EVER PUBLISHED BY SCRIBNER'S."

                                 ZELDA
                        Let's go in and buy one...

                                 SCOTT
                        We can get as many as we want for free.

                                 ZELDA 
                        It'll be fun... We'll pretend we're 
                        just regular people...

           She's just about convinced him, when a CLERK appears in the 
           window, and places a second sign next to the first:

                                      "SOLD OUT."

           Zelda's disappointment is by far outweighed by her sense of 
           pride in Scott -- and in being Mrs. F. Scott Fitzgerald.

           And it is Zelda who is first to realize that CUSTOMERS 
           leaving the store pause to stare at Scott: he's being 
           recognized... He's suddenly famous...

           THREE YOUNG WOMEN, who look like they might have stepped out 
           of one of those windows at Lord & Taylor, exit the shop, with 
           their fresh copies of PARADISE.
           CONTINUED:

           Zelda watches as they head up the street, glance at the photo 
           on the back of the book; after a beat, they begin to return.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                                 (quietly)
                        Look at that...

           Scott's unclear...

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Those women -- they're coming to get 
                        your autograph --

                                 SCOTT
                        Don't be ridiculous --

           No sooner does he finish the word when one YOUNG WOMAN steps 
           up behind him.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN #1
                        Excuse me... Mr. Fitzgerald...

           He pivots about, his expression caught between delight and 
           disbelief: all three Young Women standing there with their 
           books open to the front page, pens in hand...

                                 YOUNG WOMAN #2
                        You are Mr. Fitzgerald -- ?

           Scott nods, beaming...

                                 YOUNG WOMAN #1
                        If it's not too much trouble --

           Scott and Zelda exchange a knowing look as he reaches for the 
           pen.

                                 SCOTT
                        Not at all.

           As he signs each of the books, the three Young Woman take the 
           moment to eye Zelda, looking her up and down as if she'd just 
           belched.

           Zelda for the first time in her life, is suddenly self-
           conscious -- and uncomfortable in her skin...

           Signing the last of the three books, Scott glances from the 
           Women to Zelda.  As the Young Women take their leave, Zelda 
           sees the look on Scott's face: he's embarrassed. By her...

           He turns to hail a cab as Zelda digests the fact that she 
           isn't measuring up to the image of his newfound celebrity.
           INT. CAB - SAME

           As the sun goes down, and the cab drives down the street 
           where the buildings soar on either side, Scott looks out the 
           window, and tears spill down his cheeks...

                                 ZELDA
                        Goofo -- You can't possibly be unhappy -- ?

           Scott turns to her, smiling through his tears:

                                 SCOTT
                        No. Of course not... It's just -- well 
                        I'm fairly certain I'll never be this 
                        happy again...

           INT. ELEVATOR - A BIT LATER

           Zelda, Scott, Marjorie & Minor, Tilde & John, are in the 
           elevator as the doors open and give out onto the foyer of 

           Ludlow Fowler's very upscale apartment, where the party has 
           already begun... Zelda steps out first. Then steps back in.

                                 ZELDA 
                        You can get in and out of the elevator 
                        directly from your own apartment?

           It is apparently something she's never seen before.  Again 
           she steps out and then back into the elevator...

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        New York is just full of surprises!

           The GUESTS in the foyer observe her with an air, both curious 
           and patronizing: it is not only her commentary which attracts 
           attention -- but her Southern accent, which, against this 
           background, sounds more pronounced than it did in Montgomery.

           Behind her, Scott jots something down in a pocket size 
           notebook... Then, painfully aware of the impression Zelda is 
           making,  he CLEARS HIS THROAT, and gives her a little push.

           INT. LUDLOW'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM AREA - LATER

           A buffet style presentation, lush with food and liquor...

           Other Guests have since arrived, filling out the party with 
           the familiar faces of Scott's crowd:  Biggs, Bishop, Bunny 
           Wilson, Alex, Peevie, and Lawton, along with a few WOMEN.
           CONTINUED:

           Scott, with a glass in one hand, and Zelda on the other lets 
           Ludlow top off his drink...

                                 SCOTT
                        There might be an 18th Amendment, but 
                        you'd never know it up here...

                                 LUDLOW
                        I've got a guy... He brings the stuff 
                        in from Canada... I get ulcers from the 
                        home brewed stuff --

           As the men talk, Zelda takes in the room. In particular, she 
           studies the WOMEN, whose clothing, manners, and speech are so 
           very different from her own.  

                                 SCOTT 
                        If it's brewed at all. I heard a story -
                        - a buyer sent a liquor sample to a lab 
                        to have it analyzed. The chemist called 
                        him up with the results:  "Your horse 
                        has diabetes."

           This gets LAUGHS from the Group around them. Marjorie 
           approaches Zelda, and WHISPERS in her ear... 

           IN THE FOYER

           Marjorie and Tilde are uneasy in this crowd. They are putting 
           on their coats.  Zelda, with a drink in hand that is clearly 
           not her first, pleads with them:

                                 ZELDA 
                        Oh, please don't go...

                                 MARJORIE
                        Baby, we're just spent...

           Tilde gives Zelda a kiss good bye.

                                 MARJORIE (CONT'D)
                        You know we want you to be happy.

                                 ZELDA
                        It's the happiest I've ever been.

           There's something forced in her tone that belies statement.  
           But she ends it there, giving Zelda a peck on the cheek.

           They head out, leaving Zelda alone with her drink.  Beyond 
           her, in the next room, is a roomful of urbane and polished 
           strangers. Mostly, for her, they are strangers, plain and 
           simple.
           CONTINUED: (2)

           But steeling herself, again, she turns her attention to the 
           Women, then glances at herself in the foyer mirror:  she 
           lifts her hair to her jaw, as if to see what it would be like 
           to cut it...

           MONTAGE:  TO JELLY ROLL MORTON'S "BOOGIE WOOGIE BLUES"

           NOTE: the scenes/shots portray Zelda's very deliberate self-
           transformation into the ultimate Flapper: the dresses get 
           shorter, straighter, and sexier.  The make up becomes more 
           "stage-like."

           * ZELDA bobs her hair.

           * ZELDA shopping with SCOTT, as she actively transforms 
           herself from Southern Belle to New York sophisticate. Scott 
           picks items that are stylish, but staid; Zelda puts these 
           back on the rack, and picks pieces that have more flair. 

           * IN THE BILTMORE, late night, with friends, drinking 
           cocktails, and making merry.

           * ZELDA & SCOTT make love in the early morning.

           * ZELDA dances on the tables of the Waldorf kitchen in a 
           dress that will earn her the title of America's First 
           Flapper. Scott swipes a Chef's hat from the staff, tosses it 
           to Zelda, who dons it...

           * ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT delivers food and drink, while Zelda 
           prances around in Scott's BVD's (the first boxer style 
           underwear for men) and Scott takes a bath.

           * ZELDA & SCOTT walk on their hands down the halls of the 
           Biltmore, drunk, and attracting stares, as OTHER GUESTS open 
           their doors to peer out at the commotion...

           * THE BILTMORE CONCIERGE escorts Zelda and Scott out of the 
           hotel, happy to see them go...

           * ZELDA & SCOTT, trailed by their baggage and host of 
           JOURNALISTS & PHOTOGRAPHERS, enter THE COMMODORE HOTEL and on 
           the FLASH of a camera bulb: 

           * The IMAGE FREEZES on Zelda and Scott, in all their luster 
           and glory, leaving the hotel, for a night on the town. 

           INT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AUDITORIUM - EVENING

           Scott is on a podium, in front of an adoring audience of 
           mostly YOUNG PEOPLE, the majority of which is FEMININE.
           CONTINUED:

                                 YOUNG WOMAN #1
                        How does it feel, Mr. Fitzgerald, to be 
                        the spokesperson for our generation?

           Zelda watches him from the back of the room. She is, by far, 
           the most striking woman in the room.  

                                 SCOTT
                        All I do is write in a style that to my 
                        mind, is commensurate with the subject 
                        matter. And my subject is what I know -- 
                        what I've lived.  And if somehow that's 
                        made me the voice of a generation -- 
                        well then it's simply a happy accident.

           Scott looks around to call on another member of the audience, 
           and points to an elegant, well heeled YOUNG WOMAN.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN #1
                                 (rising)
                        Thank you Mr. Fitzgerald.  I wanted to 
                        know how you feel about having a 
                        flapper for a wife?

           EXT. THE ROYALTON - A BIT LATER

           A gaggle of REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS are milling about.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN #1 (V.O.)
                        Do you think, for instance, that she 
                        should have her own career?

           Then all at once, the group reacts, FLASHES go off.

                                 SCOTT (V.O.)
                        Well -- I think just being in love -- 
                        doing it well, you know -- is work 
                        enough for a woman...

           Scott's Car is approaching: Scott is riding on the roof, and 
           Zelda is on the hood...

                                 SCOTT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        If she keeps her house the way it 
                        should be kept -- And loves him and 
                        helps him with his work and encourages 
                        him --

           INT. GEORGE NATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           It's a fine swath of the New York Society Set:  DOROTHY 
           PARKER, H.L. 
           CONTINUED:

           MENCKEN, GEORGE NATHAN, MAX PERKINS, Bunny Wilson, Alex 
           McKaig, John Bishop, Actresses ANITA LOOS, 30,  RUTH FINDLAY 
           (familiar from "SALAMANDER"), TALLULAH & GENE BANKHEAD,mid 
           20's, HELEN HAYES, 20, RING LARDNER, the theater producer, 
           JOHN D. WILLIAMS, CARL VAN VECHTEN etc...

                                 SCOTT (V.O.) 
                        -- Oh, I think that's the sort of work 
                        that will save her...

           By contrast with the gathering at Ludlow's, which felt almost 
           collegiate, there's a real whiff of decadence here, in which 
           Zelda is notably more at ease... Not only has she found a way 
           to capitalize on her exoticism, but the flirtatiousness of 
           the environment in general is second-nature to her... So, far 
           from being the awkward, Southern bumpkin, she is now the 
           source of much masculine fascination and interest...

           Scott introduces Zelda to a near receiving line of Men, and 
           she goes out of her way to kiss each one of them.

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        The host, George Nathan, H.L. Mencken, 
                        Ring Lardner, John Williams, Carl Van 
                        Vechten --

           Scott appears utterly tolerant of Zelda's manner:

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Yes -- they really all have kisses 
                        coming to them, because they weren't at 
                        the wedding, and everybody at a wedding 
                        always gets a kiss --

           As he says this, Alex McKaig and Bunny Wilson, sneak up to 
           get in line, and Zelda's moves right along to kiss them too:

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Alex, Bunny: I believe you are already 
                        well enough acquainted --

                                 ALEX & BUNNY
                                 (all in good fun)
                        But we weren't at the wedding!

           They get kisses too.  But she returns to Scott, and beaming, 
           meets his lips with hers with a lingering gift of a kiss. 

           IN THE LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The room is more crowded, more noisy, and less sober...

           A group, including Alex, George, Zelda, Anita Loos, Dorothy 
           Parker, and a few others is engaged in heated debate:
           CONTINUED:

                                 ALEX
                        It boggles the mind the way foolish 
                        women run circles around intelligent 
                        ones when it comes to men --

                                 GEORGE
                        That's because the intelligent ones 
                        pretend they want to be more than a 
                        pretty and desirable toy --

                                 ZELDA
                        It has never occurred either one of 
                        you, that half those foolish women are 
                        just the clever ones in disguise?

                                 ANITA
                        She has a point -- when my father found 
                        out I was writing for a living, his 
                        advice to me was to dress like a whore 
                        if I ever wanted to find a husband --

                                 ZELDA 
                        What I really want is a bath. George -- 
                        would you care to come and help me 
                        think about what I should do for a 
                        living while I take a bath?

           ANOTHER ANGLE

           Scott is on the other side of the room, pen and notebook in 
           hand; he watches Zelda drag George by the hand through the 
           room, and down the hall.

           Alex approaches with a bottle of gin, as Scott slips his 
           notebook back into his jacket pocket. 

                                 ALEX
                        It doesn't bother you?

                                 SCOTT
                        What -- Zelda?  I can’t say I enjoy it. 
                        But I suppose seeing her in action like 
                        that inspires me. 

           He knocks back his glass.

           EXT. BALCONY - LATER

           Scott and Max Perkins lean against the rail and look out at 
           the city:
           CONTINUED:

                                 PERKINS
                        We're looking forward to getting the 
                        new manuscript...

                                 SCOTT
                                 (a chortle)
                        Me too...

                                 PERKINS
                        It's not going well --

                                 SCOTT
                        It's not that so much... I'm just 
                        distracted -- 

           Scott watches Zelda through glass door: she's holding court 
           with a group of Men...

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        And I worry about Zelda... She gets 
                        bored hanging around the apartment. So 
                        I encourage her to go out -- entertain 
                        herself.  Then when she's gone, I'm 
                        vexed to distraction: where is she? 
                        What's she doing? Who's she with?

           INT./ EXT. MARMON - TRAVELING

           On the open road, flanked by dense wood of Flowering Dogwoods 
           and Red Maples, in a sports coupe that’s on it’s last legs...  
           Scott is at the wheel, and Zelda has the wind in her hair, as 
           the car lurches along...

                                 PERKINS (V.O.)
                        Maybe get out of town for a while... 
                        Change the scenery -- something quiet.

           EXT. COMPO ROAD - WESTPORT - LATE AFTERNOON - LONG

           The Marmon heads down a two lane road, acres of farmland 
           unfurling in every direction. On the horizon, the last of the 
           sun bounces off the water of the Long Island Sound.

           At the end of the road stands a small, pale gray, Colonial-
           style house:  Wakeman Cottage.

           EXT. WAKEMAN COTTAGE - DUSK

           Zelda and Scott are with a REAL ESTATE AGENT, a Man in his 
           mid 40's...
           CONTINUED:

                                 AGENT
                        The beach is out the back door, 
                        Westport is a two minute drive, and at 
                        50 miles, Manhattan is still an easy 
                        week-end commute.

                                 ZELDA
                        It's sort of the best of all worlds... 
                        And I can't remember the last time it 
                        was quiet enough to hear the swallows.

           Zelda is eager like a child for a pony ride...

                                 SCOTT
                        And I suppose we could always invite 
                        people up for the weekend --

                                 ZELDA
                        I'm not "people" enough --

           Even as she teases, there's a bass note of tension in her 
           voice.

                                 SCOTT
                        Just for a change of pace...
                                 (beat)
                        It is serene -- I'll give you that...

           His tone suggests a certain trepidation: that much isolation 
           makes him nervous.  But then with a definitive nod to the 
           Agent, they agree to take it.

           INT. WAKEMAN COTTAGE - DAY

           Scott is at his desk, writing -- or attempting to.  Zelda 
           hovers about like an insistent child, chomping on an apple.

           It is so quiet, that every CRUNCH of the fruit seems 
           disproportionately loud... In the b.g. TANA, their Japanese 
           Houseman, pads silently through the halls, collecting 
           laundry.  She pauses in front of the desk.  He ignores her.

                                 ZELDA
                        It's two o'clock...

                                 SCOTT
                                 (not looking up)
                        And?

                                 ZELDA 
                        You said you'd be done by lunchtime.

           There's a beat as he finishes a thought. Now he looks up.
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                        It may be stating the obvious -- but 
                        I'm not done...

           Zelda rifles through the scattered notes and pieces of paper 
           on the desk top.

                                 ZELDA
                        Goofo -- you promised: we were going to 
                        get into the city early enough to have 
                        a drink with Lawton before meeting my 
                        parents at the hotel.  

           Scott puts his hand on hers to stop the RUSTLING of paper...

                                 SCOTT
                        Zelda, please...

           She yanks her hand away, taking the paper with it...

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                                 (bursting)
                        Zelda!

           She looks at him, admonishing...

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                                 (reeling himself in)
                        It may not seem like it to you -- but 
                        those papers are in a very particular 
                        order. Please leave them that way...

           But Zelda is already reading from the notes on the page:

                                 ZELDA
                                 (reading)
                        "There was for example her stomach.  
                          She was used to certain dishes, and she 
                          had a strong conviction that she could 
                          not possibly eat anything else.  There 
                          must be a lemonade and a tomato 
                          sandwich late in the morning -- "
                                 (a look at Scott)
                        Goofo -- My food habits?  I can't wait 
                        to see what you'll do with the way I 
                        roll my toilet tissue...

           Her tone is blasé rather than angry, as she sets the paper 
           back down on the desk... Scott smiles despite himself.

                                 SCOTT
                        Well I'm not ever going to do anything 
                        with it if you don't let me work...!
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Zelda purses her lips, reflexively she flips her watch face 
           to glance at the engraving on the back, and then, with a 
           playful look, she relents.

           INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - LOBBY - EVENING

           A place is a beehive of night time activity: GUESTS dressed 
           for an evening out, others just arriving... Scott is there 
           with Zelda’s family: Minnie, the Judge, Rosalind, and Newman.

                                 MINNIE
                        I'm so sorry Scott -- She's running as 
                        late as ever -- 

           Scott, lighting a cigarette.

                                 SCOTT
                                 (smiling)
                        Mrs. Sayre -- I assure you, she has 
                        always been more than worth the wait... 
                        In fact, I bet you don't know half what 
                        you should about Zelda...

                                 MINNIE
                        Why Scott -- what a thing to say! I 
                        know all there is to know about Zelda. 
                        I'm her mother...

                                 SCOTT
                        Well, you couldn't possibly know how 
                        beautiful she is, could you?  You just 
                        watch that elevator, because Zelda will 
                        be down in a minute, and then watch all 
                        the men in the lobby... 

           A moment later, Zelda appears from between the elevator 
           doors, and Scott's face blooms with pride: she is a splendor, 
           and as she moves across the lobby to greet him, there's not a 
           MAN in the room who fails to notice...

           EXT. WAKEMAN COTTAGE - AFTERNOON

           Scott and Zelda walk up the path to the house with Minnie and 
           the Judge in tow. Biggs and another MAN, are there passed 
           out: one in the hammock, the other on the lawn.

           Zelda shoots Scott a look... He shrugs... They keep walking 
           til they get inside...  Minnie and the Judge follow, but not 
           without a glance of disapproval...
           INT. WAKEMAN COTTAGE - SAME

           The house is in disarray, even as Tana, the houseman goes 
           about picking up dirty glasses and empty bottles.

           Zelda blanches with shame at the reflection of her own 
           lifestyle in the eyes of her disapproving parents.

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott -- will you show them upstairs to 
                        their room. I'll be just a minute.

           INT. WAKEMAN COTTAGE - ZELDA & SCOTT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Zelda wakes to the sound of POUNDING on the front door.

                                 ZELDA 
                                 (nudges Scott awake)
                        Your friends are back --

                                 SCOTT
                        Why my friends -- ?

           Scott rises, gropes about for his robe, and puts it on.

                                 ZELDA 
                        'Cause if I have to go down there 
                        myself, they won't survive long enough 
                        to be anyone's friends --

                                 SCOTT
                        Alright...

                                 ZELDA
                        Just tell them to go away -- Papa can't 
                        bear the goings on...

                                 SCOTT
                        Which is why you didn't marry your 
                        father.  We live our life the way we 
                        want --

                                 ZELDA
                        Yes, yes. But just for tonight.  
                        Please.

           He heads out of the room.
           INT. WAKEMAN COTTAGE - DOWNSTAIRS

           Zelda is at the foot of the stairs, glaring in the direction 
           of THE KITCHEN: the LAUGHTER and COMMOTION coming from behind 
           the door is enough to wake the neighborhood...

           INT. WAKEMAN COTTAGE - KITCHEN - SAME

           Scott, Biggs, and his Friend are caught off guard as Zelda 
           blows through the door, in a full blown rage, sweeping 
           bottles of liquor and tomato juice from the counter...

                                 ZELDA 
                        What are you doing with yourself!

                                 SCOTT
                        Zelda!

                                 ZELDA 
                        It's 4 in the morning!

           She hurls a glass across the Kitchen; it SHATTERS against the 
           wall...

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Is this the Irishman's cocktail hour!

           Scott lurches in her direction, and grabs hold of her, 
           pinning her arms to her sides.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Let go!

           She thrashes about, but drunk as he is, he's still stronger 
           than she, and he pushes her out through the swinging door...

           No sooner does he release her, than she pushes back through.

           But Scott is there to block it, so that the door SNAPS back 
           and SLAMS into her face...

           She lets out a CRY like something PRIMAL. Scott's face 
           crumples in anguish.

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh God...!

           He jerks the door open to see Zelda holding her a face in her 
           hands, blood spilling over her fingers from her nose...

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Oh no, no, no, no... Forgive me...
           CONTINUED:

           He’s trying to think clearly, struggling against his liquored 
           fog, holding Zelda tight to him...

           Together, they slips down against the wall, his tears mixing 
           freely with her blood...

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Okay... It's going to be okay... 
                        Shhhh... I'm so sorry... Shhhh.

           INT. WAKEMAN COTTAGE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

           Zelda, her face still bruised from the night before, makes a  
           nervous, inept attempt at cleaning up, when the Judge appears 
           at the door, hat in hand, ready to depart.

                                 ZELDA
                        Mornin' Daddy!  I was just getting 
                        ready to make brunch --

           She doesn't turn to greet him...

                                 JUDGE SAYRE
                        We'll be on our way in just a few 
                        minutes --

           Zelda shuts off the faucet, and turns to face him, revealing 
           now her black eye, and swollen nose... Her bottom lip too, is 
           raw from her compulsive chewing.

           The disdain on her Father's face leaves no room for sympathy. 
           And with that, he takes his leave.  

           EXT. WAKEMAN COTTAGE - PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Zelda watches her parents get into a waiting cab, and 
           something inside her breaks: tears make their tracks down her 
           bruised and purple face.

           Scott steps up behind her and wraps himself around her, 
           protective, almost paternal...

           EXT. WAKEMAN COTTAGE - THE SHORE - NIGHT - LONG

           It's an unqualified orgy:  more CROWDED, more bawdy, more 
           noisy, and more liquor.

           Zelda splashes about in the ocean, the only woman among a 
           THRONG of MEN, most of whom are by now familiar: Alex, 
           Lawton, Ludlow, Peevie, and OTHERS.
           CONTINUED:

           ANOTHER ANGLE - ON THE BEACH

           Zelda dries herself off as a GUEST hands her a gin and tonic.

           INT. WAKEMAN COTTAGE - A BIT LATER

           Sylph-like in a kimono style silk smoking jacket (and nothing 
           else), Zelda wanders through the house, passing CLUSTERS of 
           GUESTS: some engaged in heated conversation, others gathered 
           around a Mahjong game.

           Zelda meanders through to Scott's office to find George 
           Nathan, parked on the couch, so absorbed in reading 
           something, he doesn't register Zelda's presence.

           She observes him for a moment, then deliberately TINKLES the 
           ice in her glass...  George looks up, delighting in the sight 
           of her.

                                 GEORGE
                        These are yours...

           He indicates the book in his hand: her journal... Zelda is 
           about to respond, when Scott appears at the door behind her.

                                 SCOTT
                        Wonderful -- aren't they...

                                 GEORGE
                        Magnificent... We could publish --

           Zelda lights up at the thought...

                                 SCOTT
                        That's out of the question...

           Zelda turns to look at him, visibly disappointed..

                                 GEORGE
                        I'm serious Scott --

                                 SCOTT
                        And so am I --

           George glances from Scott to Zelda, and back again.

                                 ZELDA
                        George you're awfully kind --

                                 GEORGE
                        Zelda dear, since when have I ever been 
                        kind -- ?  These are breathtaking --
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA 
                        Only 'cause you're sweet on the 
                        author... They could hardly be of 
                        interest to anyone else -- except of 
                        course Scott -- who's made use --

                                 SCOTT
                                 (flashing her a look)
                        It's simply out of the question, 
                        George.

           CLOSE ON LIPS

           As they are painted with bright red lipstick.

           EXT. WAKEMAN COTTAGE - PORCH - NIGHT

           We see now that those LIPS were MASCULINE. 

           And that Zelda, well beyond tipsy at this point, is wielding 
           the lipstick.

           She is at the center of a mostly MALE GROUP, going from Man 
           to Man, applying the make up to their lips.  Working now on 
           George, she gives his lips particular attention...

                                 ZELDA
                                 (finishing up)
                        Alright...  Now...
                                 (beat - thinking)
                        I want each and every one of you to 
                        kiss me!

           A QUICK SUCCESSION OF SHOTS

           We see half a dozen pairs of lips press up against Zelda's 
           cheeks...

           Zelda glances at her own reflection in the window: every kiss 
           has left a perfect, bright red "mark" on her face, by which 
           she is thoroughly tickled...

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Where's Scott!  I must show Scott!

           She turns to look for him, and then goes still:

           Scott is on the beach, cradling Gene Bankhead in his arms, as 
           he spins them both around...

           Zelda moves down the stairs, and toward the beach...
           EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Zelda stomps past Scott and Gene, heading down the beach, 
           away from the party...  This gets Scott's attention...

                                 SCOTT
                        Where are you going?
                                 (getting no response)
                        Don't you take another step!

           She traipses on...

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        And you wonder why I can't get any work 
                        done!  Worried all the time about where 
                        you're off to --

           And there, before an audience of the entire party, they enter 
           into a full blown fight:

                                 ZELDA
                        If I had my own work, you wouldn't have 
                        to wonder how I spent my time!

                                 SCOTT
                        Work!?  You want to work!?  You can't 
                        even manage the fucking laundry!

                                 ZELDA
                                 (over him)
                        What am I supposed to do?!  I’m home: you 
                        can’t work! I leave: you still can’t 
                        work! It's enough to put a person out! 

                                 SCOTT
                        If anyone’s “putting out” it’s you -- 
                        what with the way you flirt with 
                        everything in sight!

                                 ZELDA
                        You won't let me do anything else! As 
                        it is, flirting is the one thing for 
                        which I still have an aptitude! But if 
                        I tried to make a living from it, 
                        they'd call me a whore! You make a 
                        living from it, and they call it 
                        literature!

           She practically spits the word.  And then she's moving down 
           the beach at a run...

           Scott moves to run after her, but is so drunk, he stumbles 
           face first into the sand.
           EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - PRE-DAWN

           Zelda cuts an incongruous figure as she walks down the middle 
           of the tracks, her feet bare, still wrapped in her silk 
           kimono.

           Her eyes are swollen and red from crying. She chews so 
           compulsively on her lip, that she does not even realize that 
           it's bleeding...  The TRAIN WHISTLES in the distance.  She’s 
           oblivious.

           The light from the train appears from around the hillside.  
           Zelda continues to walk straight into it -- unaware of 
           anything but herself.  And then:

                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                        Zelda!

           As if she were deaf to all but his voice, she looks up.

           He is bounding toward her; before she can react, he sweeps 
           her from the path of the train. The two tumble and roll in 
           the dirt beside the tracks, until he’s wrapped around her, 
           protectively... 

                                 ZELDA
                        Goofo -- you've got to try to feel how 
                        much I love you -- how much of nothing 
                        I am when you're gone --

           He adorns the back of her neck with a tender flurry of 
           kisses.

           INT. PALM COURT - PLAZA HOTEL - MID DAY

           Zelda and Scott are seated at a table with Max Perkins, and 
           HAROLD OBER, 40's, and Scott's literary agent.

                                 HAROLD
                        I got a call from Metro yesterday. They 
                        want to know whether the two of you 
                        would be interested in playing the 
                        leads in This Side of Paradise ?

                                 ZELDA 
                                 (child like)
                        In the movie!

           Harold nods. DINERS at another table are staring at Scott. He 
           nods to them with a smile.
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Oh Scott!

           Scott is less sanguine. He turns to Perkins.

                                 SCOTT
                        What do you think?  Is it a good idea?

           Zelda is about to speak, but Scott silences her with a look.

                                 PERKINS
                        I don't know.  I can understand the 
                        appeal... But it could confuse your 
                        readership... "What is he?  A writer or 
                        an actor?" It could make you like 
                        you're just dabbling in both...

                                 SCOTT 
                        It's amateurish --

           A YOUNG WOMAN approaches to ask for Scott's autograph...

                                 ZELDA
                        Well maybe Scott shouldn't play the 
                        role, but I could. I AM that role.

           Scott returns the book to the Young Woman.

                                 SCOTT
                                 (distracted)
                        We'll talk about it...

           Zelda is again about to protest:

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Later...

           EXT. UNION SQUARE - A BIT LATER

           Zelda, Scott, Alex, Bishop, John Williams and George walk 
           together.

                                 ZELDA
                        I think we should do it Scott! Or I 
                        should anyway --

                                 SCOTT
                                 (to the Group)
                        Zelda wants to star in the movies --
                                 (to Zelda)
                        Dear -- What makes you think you can 
                        act?
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                        I wouldn't have to -- I'd be playing my 
                        own self!
                                 (to John Williams)
                        John -- Tell him you think I can do it -- 

                                 JOHN WILLIAMS
                        I wouldn't be lying, if I said  she's 
                        got a better sense of the dramatic than 
                        most of the actors I work with --

           And no sooner does he say this, than Zelda is stripping off 
           her clothes and running down the street toward the Union 
           Square Fountain.

           Scott and the other Men tear down the street after, arriving 
           just in time to see her take a flying leap into the water.

           Before she comes up for air, the whole Group finds themselves 
           surrounded by a half-dozen POLICEMEN, ready to arrest Zelda 
           for indecency...

                                 SCOTT
                        Gentlemen!  Gentlemen there's no need --

                                 OFFICER #1
                                 (thick Irish accent)
                        Hey wait a minute...

           He turns to one of his partners.  All Six of the Policemen 
           speak with Irish Brogues to a greater or lesser degree.

                                 OFFICER #1 (CONT'D)
                        Don't you recognize him!?

           Scott puffs up slightly with pride...

                                 OFFICER #2
                        Yeah... He's the comic --

           Scott's face falls for a flash, but George manages to stage 
           whisper:

                                 GEORGE
                        Play along...

                                 OFFICER #3
                        The Paddy --

                                 OFFICER #4
                        That's right...

           And the Officers are now almost embarrassed.
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 OFFICER #1
                        Sorry to have disturbed you -- have a 
                        lovely rest of your evening...

           At last, Zelda pokes her head out of the water:

                                 ZELDA
                        My God -- it's been ages since I've had 
                        a swim in anything but my own gin and 
                        tonic!

           Scott cannot help but burst out laughing...

           INT. JUNGLE CLUB - LATE NIGHT

           Zelda and Scott, and the Group are there with others:  
           Tellulah, Ludlow, Lillian Gish, Ruth Findlay, Dorothy Parker.

                                 RUTH
                        I hear they've finished the script for 
                        This Side of Paradise...

                        We're still thinking it over --

                        Just like that?

                                 SCOTT
                        You heard what Max said --

           Zelda's not as angry as she is demoralized. Her voice is 
           calm.

                                 ZELDA 
                        Tell me something: what would be so 
                        terrible about my having a little 
                        success of my own --

                        success than you do as the heroines of 
                        my work -- ?

           He is serious... Zelda looks at him in disbelief: the echo of 
           her own words...

           ON the WAIL of an INFANT:

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           SUPER: OCTOBER 1921  A YEAR LATER   ST. PAUL, MINNESTOA

           Zelda has just given birth, and is coming out of the stupor 
           of her efforts.  The baby girl is swaddled in her arms; Scott 
           gazes at them with terror and joy in equal measure.

                                 ZELDA
                        Oh God, Goofo -- I'm drunk... 
                                 (the baby hiccups)
                        Isn't she smart -- she has the hiccups.  
                        I hope it's beautiful and a fool -- a 
                        beautiful little fool.

           Scott reaches for the pen on Zelda's medical chart, tears a 
           piece of paper from it, and jots down her words...

           CLOSE ON ZELDA’S HAND

           With an ink pen, she sketches the image of a nude woman 
           kneeling in a champagne goblet.

           Above the drawing are the words:   THE BEAUTIFUL AND DAMNED

           HOTEL ROOM - THE COMMODORE - ST. PAUL

           Zelda cradles the phone between shoulder and ear while she 
           sketches; Scott looking at a series of drawings.  A NANNY 
           tends to the infant Scottie in the b.g. 

                                 ZELDA 
                                 (into the phone)
                        We're both mad to get back to New York.  
                        This damn place is 18 below...

           She pauses, then to Scott:

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Luddy wants to know when the book is

                        He thinks the man on the cover is sort 
                        of a "debauched edition" of himself...

                        again in person.

                                 ZELDA
                                 (into the phone)
                        Scottie?  She's awfully cute and I am 
                        very devoted to her -- 

           In the b.g. the Nanny calms the infant, who has begun to CRY.

           EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - NEW YORK CITY - MARCH 3RD 1922

           Zelda and Scott emerge from a cab, as the BELLHOP unloads the 
           luggage. Scottie is NOT with them.

           INT. PRINCETON/YALE CLUB - LOUNGE - EARLY EVENING

           Scott reads from THE BEAUTIFUL AND DAMNED to a standing-room 
           only CROWD of SOCIETY MEN and their WIVES. Zelda stands in 
           the far corner of the room, unaccompanied... 

                                 SCOTT
                          "What grubworms women are to crawl on 
                          their bellies through colorless 
                          marriages.  Marriage was created not to 
                          be a background, but to need one."

           These are shocking words for the time, and the effect on some 
           MEMBERS of the audience is unsettling. 

           The effect on Zelda is equally disturbing, if for entirely 
           different reasons:  these are her words, nearly to the 
           letter, yet the world will know them henceforth as the work 
           of F. Scott Fitzgerald... 
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                          "Mine is going to be outstanding.  It 
                          can't, shan't be the setting -- it's 
                          going to be the performance, the live, 
                          lovely, glamorous performance and the 
                          world shall be the scenery.  I refuse 
                          to dedicate my life to posterity."

           Members of the audience exchange disconcerted looks.

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                          "Surely one owes as much to the current 
                          generation as to one's unwanted 
                          children.  What a fate -- to grow 
                          rotund and unseemly, to lose my self-
                          love..."

           Scott closes the book. The audience is SILENT.  Then, a beat 
           later, one PERSON dares to CLAP, joined quickly by another, 
           then more, until the whole room stands and applauds...

           And Zelda is suddenly struck by the full weight of her 
           realization: far from enjoying the spotlight as Scott’s Muse, 
           she is about to be eclipsed by the shadow of his fame -- fame 
           that is built at least in part on her gift with words... 

           INT. ALGONQUIN HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

           Zelda and Scott wade through a tied of anonymous FANS and 
           JOURNALISTS.  Scott pauses to sign a book, before stepping 
           into the elevator with Zelda... 

           ALGONQUIN HOTEL - H.L. MENCKEN'S SUITE - NIGHT

           It's the private party to celebrate the release of the book -- 
           a bigger, more elaborate affair than the party at George 
           Nathan's place.  The GUESTS, all part of the Fitzgerald 
           Circle, are a virtual Who's Who of the Social Register.  
           There are the familiar faces, but also an additional 
           smattering of CELEBRITIES, giving the party a whole new 
           sheen. They

           Scott, well lubricated, and in heated, if slurred, discussion 
           with Bunny Wilson, pulls Perkins into the debate:

                                 SCOTT
                        Max! You have to talk to him.  He 
                        believes I've got three major 
                        influences on my life and writing --

                        The Midwest -- specifically the society 
                        of St. Paul and country clubs. His 
                        Irishness.  And liquor --

                                 SCOTT 
                        -- And he wants to print that in the 
                          Bookman!  Not only is he wrong -- but 
                        he's altogether failed to recognize the 
                        most enormous influence on me in the 
                        four and half years since I met her --

           He glances across the room at Zelda with a look of attachment 
           beyond love -- a distortion of love in its neediness.

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        -- The complete, fine, and full-hearted 
                        selfishness and chillmindedness of 
                        Zelda!

           His face is infused with gin and adoration...

                                 (suddenly distracted)
                        In fact she’s reviewing the book in the 
                        Tribune!  Zelda!  Why don't you read it 
                        for the group?

           Zelda is more embarrassed than flattered by Scott's display.

                                 ZELDA
                        I would Dear, but I did the appropriate 
                        thing and left it at home.

           Scott pulls her type-written piece from his jacket pocket.

                                 SCOTT
                        I’ve got it right here!

           Zelda flushes red with shame and frustration. Scott unfolds 
           the paper, and steps up onto the nearest chair.

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott -- please -- don't --

                          an uncanny fascination.  It has been 
                          lying on that table for two years. I 
                          have been asked to analyze it carefully 
                          in the light of my brilliant critical 
                          insight, my tremendous erudition, and 
                          my vast impressive partiality.  Here I 
                          go!"

           To Zelda's surprise, the room is LAUGHING;  Scott's reading 
           only underscores her sense of irony, which of course begs the 
           question:  much of what people attribute to her as 
           eccentricity, may in fact be irony that goes unobserved...

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                          "Its value as a manual of etiquette is 
                          incalculable.  Where could you get a 
                          better example of how NOT to behave 
                          than from the adventures of Gloria?"

           Even as Scott’s boozed-up diction is laced with bitterness, 
           this paragraph gets a more enthusiastic round of LAUGHTER 
           than the last. Zelda’s face is a complex map of pride and 
           humiliation, guilt and vindication. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                          "It's a wonderful book to have around 
                          in case of emergency.  No one should 
                          ever set out in pursuit of unholy 
                          excitement without a special vest

                          exactly, and with compelling lucidity, 
                          just what to do when cast off by a 
                          grandfather or when sitting around a 
                          station platform at 4 a.m., or when 
                          spilling champagne at a fashionable 
                          restaurant, or when told that one is 
                          too old for the movies.  Any of these 
                          things might come into anyone's life at 
                          any minute..."

           This gets an UPROAR of LAUGHTER. The Guests are not only 
           impressed, but surprised by Zelda's humor and voice.

           George Nathan, standing next to Zelda, whispers to her:

                                 GEORGE

           Zelda shakes her head, and gestures for him to listen, as the 
           edge in Scott’s voice seems to bloom with spite -- though for 
           himself or for Zelda, it’s not clear...

                          shortly after my marriage."

           George's face falls with disappointment...

                        set it down somewhere, and by the time

           Now the LAUGHTER is accompanied by APPLAUSE... And George 
           Nathan wraps a sympathetic arm around Zelda...

           EXT. HOUSE - 6 GATEWAY DR. - GREAT NECK ESTATES - AFTERNOON

           SUPER: GREAT NECK  AUTUMN 1922

           It is a large, rambling home, more impressive and spacious 
           than the place in Westport... 

           INT. GREAT NECK HOUSE - SAME

           Zelda is seated in a plastic, overstuffed chair, speaking 
           with A REPORTER, 30ish, from The Baltimore Sun...
           CONTINUED:

           She is nervous, her bottom lip raw again from chewing. 

                                 ZELDA
                        I love Scott's books and heroines. 
                        Rosalind in This Side of Paradise -- 
                        I’ve always liked her... You see, I 
                        read everything he writes.  
                                 (to the next room)
                        Scott! Why don’t you come in and join 
                        us... 

           The Reporter acknowledges Scott as he enters with a nod; 
           Scott takes a seat, beaming with a certain pride.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Its spoils the fun, the surprise, I 
                        mean, a bit... But Rosalind! I like 
                        girls like that... I like their 
                        courage, their recklessness and 
                        spendthriftness. Rosalind was the 
                        original American Flapper!

                                 SUN REPORTER
                        Can you define the term, "American 
                        Flapper?"

           Zelda looks to Scott as if for encouragement. He nods: “Go 
           ahead.”  There’s an uncertainty about her now -- so very 
           different from the girl she was in Montgomery.

                                 ZELDA
                        Well -- the word “Flapper” is sorter’ 
                        like code for “living well.”  I know 
                        some people must think of it as a 
                        synonym for a lack of respectability -- 
                        but you see -- once a girl perceives 
                        that boys do dance most with the girls 
                        they kiss most, and that men will marry 
                        the girls they could kiss before they 
                        asked papa -- Well then she has no 
                        choice but to wake from that lethargy 
                        of sub-debism, bob her hair, put on her 
                        choicest pair of earrings and a great 
                        deal of audacity and rouge and go into 
                        battle. A Flapper flirts because it’s 
                        fun. And she refuses to be bored 
                        chiefly because she herself isn’t 
                        boring.

           Where there used to be a spontaneity and conviction in her 
           voice, there is now a sense of obligation: she’s giving the 
           response that Scott would want to hear...  
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 SCOTT
                                 (to the Reporter)
                        How about I ask her a few questions?

           The Reporter turns the session over to Scott.  

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                                 (to Zelda)
                        What would your ideal day constitute? 

           Again, he seems to be anticipating a “correct” answer: 

                                 ZELDA
                        Peaches for breakfast... Then golf. 
                        Then a swim. Then just being lazy. Not 
                        eating or reading, but being quiet and 
                        hearing pleasant sounds -- rather a 
                        total vacuity.  The evening -- ? A 
                        large, brilliant gathering, I believe. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Are you ambitious? 

           Zelda balks.  Chews reflexively at her lip, then stops at a 
           gesture from Scott. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Not especially, but I’ve plenty of 
                        hope.

           If Scott were a dog, the hair on his neck would rise... 

                                 SCOTT
                        And what about Scottie?  What do you 
                        want her to be when she grows up? 

                                 ZELDA
                        Not great and serious and melancholy 
                        and inhospitable.  But rich and happy 
                        and artistic.  

                                 SCOTT
                        And what would you do if you had to 
                        earn a living?

           The question has the hint of a threat about it. 

                                 ZELDA
                        I’ve studied ballet.  I’d try to get a 
                        place in the Follies.  Or the movies.  
                        If I wasn’t successful, I’d try to 
                        write... 
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Scott turns to the Reporter, his expression suggesting that 
           the session ends here.  

                                 SCOTT
                        I think that should give you quite a 
                        bit of material -- 

                                 SUN REPORTER
                        I have just one last question, if I 
                        may? 

           Scott nods... 

                                 SUN REPORTER (CONT'D)
                        How would you describe your wife? 

                                 SCOTT
                        She’s the most charming person in the 
                        world... 

           Zelda’s expression says that there was a time when those 
           words wouldn’t have sounded so hollow.

           CLOSE ON ZELDA’S HAND: she writes longhand, with nearly manic 
           speed... 

           INT. GREAT NECK HOME - LIBRARY - DAY

           Zelda is curled up in a chair, with pen and pad, lost in her 
           work. In the b.g., the NANNY feeds Scottie, now a year old. 

           INT. GREAT NECK HOUSE - STUDY - SAME

           Scott paces the room, nursing a drink.  He pauses to look at 
           the pad of paper on his desk. 

           Names are jotted down in a haphazard way:  JAY GATSBY.  DAISY 
           BUCHANAN, EAST EGG, WEST EGG, etc... There a few sentences, 
           half of which are crossed out.  

           He walks away from the pad, unable to collect his thoughts. 

           INTERCUT W/ ZELDA as she writes in an unbroken heat.  

           ON SCOTT: staring at the pad. 

           ON ZELDA: at the typewriter, ready to transcribe from her 
           longhand.  She types at the top of the page: 

                                 “OUR OWN MOVIE QUEEN”
           INT. GREAT NECK HOME - LIBRARY - MORNING

           Zelda, working all night, reviews the typed and polished 
           pages of her first short story... 

           The sound of a DOOR OPENING and then CLOSING... FOOTSTEPS... 

           Zelda turns to see Scott, who has paused in the hallway: he’s 
           in the same clothes he left in last night, looking much the 
           worse for wear.  

           She doesn’t even bother to ask. 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (re: her manuscript)
                        I finished... 

           Scott nods.  

                                 SCOTT
                        What time is it? 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (glancing at a clock 
                                 on her desk)
                        A bit before ten.  Why? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I have to be in the city by one 
                        o’clock.  To sign the contract with the 
                        Hearst people... 

           And he continues down the hall. 

           ON ZELDA & SCOTT 

           In what would become their most iconic image - the essence of 
           Jazz Age sophistication: his arm around her, their faces 
           cheerless. The CLICK of a SHUTTER and a FLASH GOES OFF.  

           The SHOT FREEZES, and the MASTHEAD FADES IN above them: 

                                  HEARST INTERNATIONAL

           INT. PALM COURT - PLAZA HOTEL - AFTERNOON

           Zelda & Scott are there with Max Perkins and Harold Ober.  

           On the table is a collection of newspapers from around the 
           country, each carrying that SAME ICONIC IMAGE. Ober beams, as 
           Scott knocks back another drink.  Scott, with a wry smile. 
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                        So I guess it’s all downhill from here -- 

                                 OBER
                        Are you kidding?  This is unique in the 
                        history of publishing: you’re a 
                        literary star and you’re not even 24 
                        years old!  If we get that book of 
                        yours, we can capitalize on this -- 

                                 SCOTT
                                 (dodging)
                        We’re thinking about going over to 
                        Europe -- A change of scenery... It 
                        might help the novel along... 

                                 PERKINS
                                 (nodding)
                        I have a number of friends in the South 
                        of France -- The Murphys left two years 
                        ago and never came back. 

           Zelda takes her moment.

                                 ZELDA
                                 (venturing)
                        Max -- I was wondering -- 

                                 PERKINS
                        The short story! Yes --

           Zelda nods, timid... 

                                 PERKINS (CONT'D)
                        I had a grand time reading it!

           Her face is vibrant with a sudden smile.  

                                 PERKINS (CONT'D)
                        A lyrical sense of description, 
                        metaphors that take on lives of their 
                        own --

                                 HAROLD
                        He gave it to me last week and I think 
                        I’ve found a place for it: the Chicago 
                        Tribune is interested. 

           Zelda is beside herself...

                                 HAROLD (CONT'D)
                        They’re offering a thousand dollars for 
                        it. 
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s wonderful!

                                 HAROLD
                        But they want to publish it under 
                        Scott’s name... 

           And like that, her eyes lose their spark. 

                                 SCOTT
                                 (to Zelda)
                        Not my name alone -- alongside yours -- 

                                 HAROLD
                        No... I’m afraid they want Scott’s name 
                        exclusively.  

           As if she’s flipped a switch, Zelda seems to shrug it off. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Well -- A thousand dollars -- We 
                        certainly won’t have any trouble 
                        finding a way to spend it!  

                                 SCOTT
                        If it hasn’t already been spent... 

                                 PERKINS
                        Do you need another advance? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Not just yet. That’s part of Europe’s 
                        appeal:  with the exchange rate, we 
                        might even manage to save some money.

           EXT. OLD WORLD VILLA - MEDITERRANEAN COAST - LATE AFTERNOON

           SUPER: VILLA MARIE   FRENCH RIVIERA  MAY 1924

           High above the sea, surrounded by terraced gardens, palm, 
           pine, and silver olive trees.  A winding gravel drive leads 
           to the entrance.  

                                 ZELDA (V.O.)
                        Oh, Goofo! We are going to be so happy!

           The Moorish balconies of brilliant white and blue that face 
           Mediterranean give it the air of an exotic fortress.  So much 
           for economizing... 
           INT. VILLA MARIE - SAME

           Scott and Zelda have just arrived, with the Nanny and Scottie 
           in tow.  The interior is every bit as elegant and old world 
           as the exterior.  

                                 ZELDA
                        So happy away from the things that 
                        almost got us but couldn’t quite -- 
                        because we were too smart for them!

           A flash of the puckish, spirited Zelda we met in Montgomery.

           THE SEA - DAY - FROM HIGH ABOVE

           Zelda swims in open water: a strong, steady stroke, all alone 
           in the vast blue.  She rolls on her back, and floating looks 
           skyward:  

           A bi-plane performs stunts high up in the air... 

           Her small figure turns over again, and swims on... 

           CLOSE ON ZELDA’S HAND

           As the fine, wet, white sand of the Riviera drips from 
           between her fingers.

                                 ZELDA (O.S.) 
                        Like this: just let the sand flow. 

           EXT. BEACH (LA GAROUPE) - CAP D’ANTIBES - DAY

           Zelda, Scottie, and two other CHILDREN, are ensconced in 
           building an elaborate drip castle.  It is a work of art: with 
           turrets, towers, a moat, etc... The Children surround her, 
           participating in the project. 

           Zelda, bronzed and slim, looks like her formerly youthful 
           self.

           Scott is at work in a room that looks out on the water.  In a 
           deep state of concentration, with a carafe of water on his 
           desk, his pen moves steadily back and forth across the page. 
           EXT. BEACH (LA GAROUPE) - CAP D’ANTIBES - SAME

           The drip castle is bigger and more elaborate still.  Zelda 
           rises to leave the children to their work.

                                 ZELDA
                        Sara! Gerald! Anyone for a swim: 

           SARA & GERALD MURPHY, late 30’s, a trim, handsome couple, sun 
           themselves in chaises. They look up from their books.  

                                 SARA
                        Maybe a bit later... 

           Zelda nods, and heads off -- but NOT toward the water.  She 
           is walking towards the cliffs... 

                                 SARA (CONT'D)
                                 (playful)
                        It’s probably none of my business -- 
                        but I thought I’d mention that the 
                        water is that way!

           Zelda flashes a smile, and keeps walking... Sara and Gerald 
           exchange looks:  “What is she up to?”

           EXT. CLIFFSIDE - MOMENTS LATER - LONG

           Zelda scrambles up the cliff, rock to rock, until she gets to 
           a carved out notch in the rock face.  There are several such 
           notches, one above the next, at about 5-foot intervals. Sara 
           and Gerald are watching her.

           EXT. CLIFFSIDE - SAME - ON ZELDA

           She positions herself at the edge of the notch, 10 feet above 
           the water, and looks down.  The cerulean blue of the 
           Mediterranean spreads before her.  She waves to the Children 
           and the Murphy’s on the beach; they all wave back. 

           After a beat, Zelda decides to climb higher still -- to the 
           highest notch -- 30 feet above the water. 

                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                        If ever you were to desert me, this is 
                        where I’d look for you first: 

           Zelda looks up to see Scott, with bathing suit and towel, 
           looking down at her. 
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Right on the edge of the world!

           There’s a tenderness and charm in his voice that has long 
           been absent.  And she delights in it. 

                                 ZELDA
                        It’s already 5 o’clock!? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I figured out the whole first third of 
                        the novel -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        Oh Goofo!  Come with me!  We’ll leap 
                        for joy! 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m a coward -- you know that. 

                                 ZELDA
                        We’ll go together... Come!

           CLOSE ON ZELDA & SCOTT’S HANDS

           As they weave their fingers together, hand in hand... 

           WIDER:  they are standing side by side on the cliffside, 
           drenched by the golden, late afternoon sun.  Zelda gives him 
           an ebullient glance then faces the ocean. 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (whispering)
                        One... Two... Three!

           And they take a synchronous leap off the cliff, chasing the 
           sun and the sea... And for just this moment, they both 
           fervently believe in the promise of their own bright spark.  
           They believe they are happy.

           EXT. SEA - MOMENTS LATER

           Zelda and Scott surge to the surface: she is ecstatic. He is 
           relieved. But they share a taste for the thrill.

           INT. HOTEL DU CAP - BAR - NIGHT

           Zelda, Scott, Gerald, Sara, and OTHERS are milling about, 
           nursing drinks. Zelda is chewing slightly on her lip. Scott 
           gently put his thumb against her lips to stop her.
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                        You’re bored...

           He knows her well. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Let’s do something. Something fun!

           Scott steps up on a chair, and CLINKS his glass with a 
           fork... The whole room goes SILENT, and turns to him... 

                                 SCOTT
                                 (clearing his throat)
                        Good evening everyone!  My wife and I 
                        are looking for something to do this 
                        evening -- and being new in town, I 
                        thought I might impose upon you all to 
                        suggest a pastime -- something lively 
                        and engaging --

           There a few who react with disdain for the vulgar way in 
           which Scott interrupted conversation.  But by and large, the 
           reactions range from mildly amused to utterly intrigued... 

           There is one set who are particularly charmed by the display:  
           a GROUP of FIVE French NAVAL AVIATORS, in uniform.

           Scott scopes the room for any takers.  

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                                 (French accent)
                        I’m having maybe an idea -- 

           It’s ONE of the AVIATORS, 26, tall, athletic, and deeply 
           tanned, he is a French echo of the boys she knew back home.   
           His very bearing is confidence incarnate, laced with a dash 
           of European chivalry -- altogether, an irresistible brew.  

           We will come to know him as EDOUARD JOZAN. 

           Scott’s expression says he likes this man -- someone game... 
           Scott glances at Zelda... Zelda shrugs: “Why not?”

           EXT. MOTORBOAT - NIGHT

           Jozan is at the wheel; Zelda, Scott, the Murphys and Jozan’s 
           Compatriots are in the back, some doubled up on others.

           Zelda is gladdened by the boat-ride alone. But as they round 
           an outcropping, Zelda YELPS with excitement: 
           CONTINUED:

           In the distance, a small stretch of isolated beach, dancing 
           with the lights of a Ferris Wheel, and the carnival that 
           surrounds it. Pure enchantment.  And Jozan seems to take 
           pleasure in Zelda’s nearly child-like joy.

           THE CARNIVAL FROM ABOVE

           As it appears to rush upwards, with the downward movement of 
           the Ferris Wheel. 

           ON JOZAN, ZELDA, & SCOTT: on the Ferris Wheel, seated in one 
           of the gondolas, as it heads down toward the ground and Zelda 
           rhapsodic with joy...  

           Gerald, Sara, and the Aviators are visible in the gondolas 
           beyond. 

           A SERIES OF SHOTS: as the Group play like children at the 
           booths and on the various rides, until the night sky gives 
           way to first light. 

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Zelda suns herself in a lounge chair, while studying from a 
           French Language book.  

                                 ZELDA
                                 (repeating)
                        Un boisson: a drink.  Je voudrais un 
                        boisson s’il vous plait... 

           To her consternation, the BUZZ of an airplane overhead 
           interrupts her concentration.  

           She looks up: there it is again -- the bi-plane performing 
           air-stunts over the water... But now, the plane sweeps close 
           enough to the beach that we can see the Pilot: it is Jozan, 
           waving to Zelda... 

           A smile blooms on her face, and she waves back.

           EXT. TERRACE OF CAFE DE LA FLOTTE - AFTERNOON

           Zelda, damp from a swim, nurses a Cinzano, while studying her 
           French book.  

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                                 (French accent)
                        It is my experience that to learn a 
                        language -- it is easier to be speaking 
                        it than reading it -- 
           CONTINUED:

           Zelda looks up and is pleased to see that it is Jozan.

           AT THE TABLE - LATER

           Zelda is with Jozan and the Aviators. Jozan is seated next to 
           her, doting on her visibly.  She has a cigarette, and looks 
           for a set of matches.  Jozan reaches for his lighter, and 
           Zelda is about to lean in -- then stops:

                                 ZELDA
                        Wait, wait... 

           He cuts the flame.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        How do you say: “Can you give me a 
                        light?”

                                 JOZAN
                        Est-ce que tu peux -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        Ess-kuh chtew puh -- 

                                 JOZAN
                        This is perfect!  Okay now: Est-ce que 
                        tu peux m’allumer? 

           And this gets a LAUGH from his compatriots, to whom he shoots 
           an admonishing look. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Why are they laughing...?

                                 JOZAN
                        This is nothing.  Ignore them -- They 
                        are being children... 

                                 ZELDA
                        You’re teaching me something just a 
                        little bit wicked, aren’t you --

                                 JOZAN
                                 (conceding)
                        “Est-ce que tu peux m’allumer?” is just 
                        one of the many ways we have to say 
                        “Will you light me up?” -- and we are 
                        not referring in this case to your 
                        cigarette.

                                 ZELDA
                        Well now -- that’s what I call 
                        motivation.
           INT. VILLA MARIE - DUSK

           Zelda enters the house.

                                 ZELDA
                        Goofo! 

           SILENCE.  

                                 SCOTTIE
                        Mama!

           The baby toddles out of the kitchen area, the Nanny just 
           behind her. Zelda scoops the baby up in her arms... 

                                 ZELDA
                        Well look who’s here!  My very own 
                        little princess!

           Scottie glows in the high beam of her mother’s attention. 

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Come -- let’s go find Daddy. 

           AT THE DOOR TO SCOTT’S STUDY: Zelda knocks on the door with 
           her free hand. SILENCE... She turns the knob and peers in.  
           Scott is so immersed in writing, that he doesn’t register 
           their presence... 

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                                 (quiet)
                        Goofo... 
                                 (a bit louder)
                        Scott...

           He looks up as if stepping out of a dream. 

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        We’re meeting the Murphys in about an 
                        hour -- 

           Scott’s face wrinkles with annoyance. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Not tonight -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        What do you mean “not tonight” -- we’ve 
                        made plans.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Then cancel them -- Or go on your own.
           CONTINUED:

           The exchange becomes more contentious; Scottie begins to 
           squirm in Zelda’s arms...

                                 ZELDA
                        And tell them what?

                                 SCOTT
                        The truth: that I’m in the thick of a 
                        chapter -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        Just leave it for an hour or two -- 
                        it’ll be there when we get back -- 

                                 SCOTT
                                 (bursting)
                        For the love of God, Zelda!  

           With that, Scottie joins in the fray with a piercing WAIL... 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Leave me alone!

                                 ZELDA
                        That’s what you want? 

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s ALL I want!

           Scottie continues to BAWL; the Nanny appears in the hallway, 
           and rushes to take Scottie off of Zelda’s hands. 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (yelling)
                        And Mr. F. Scott Fitzgerald always gets 
                        what he wants!

           And she’s gone. 

           EXT. HOTEL DU CAP - THE MURPHY’S VILLA

           Zelda is at the door alone.  She KNOCKS. 

                                 SARA (O.S.)
                        Will someone please get that?

           The door opens: Zelda is pleasantly surprised to see Jozan.  

           EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON - LONG LENS

           Jozan and Zelda play about in the surf like two children.  
           And she is luminous... 
           CONTINUED:

           The Murphys are watching the two of them from their spot on 
           the beach.  They exchange a knowing glance: 

                                 SARA
                        Scott has only himself to blame if they 
                        are.

           Gerald offers a resigned nod. 

                                 SARA (CONT'D)
                        The way she’s always having to chase 
                        around after him... And he can be so 
                        simple minded about Zelda... I mean 
                        even when he seems to use her as a 
                        fictional model, his heroines are so 
                        one sided. She’s far more complex. 

           INT. VILLA MARIE - EVENING

           Zelda wanders through the house, aimless. Her footsteps echo 
           in the emptiness of the rooms.  

           Then she sees the car keys hanging from a hook on the wall 
           near the front door.  

           INT. SCOTT’S OFFICE - VILLA MARIE - MOMENTS LATER

           Zelda appears at the door to his office, car keys in hand. 

                                 ZELDA
                        I feel like taking a drive -- care to 
                        join me...?

           Scott pops from his chair, and as if he never heard the 
           question, begins to pace and read excitedly from the pad in 
           his hand... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Just listen to this:  “... Daisy 
                          tumbled short of his dreams -- not 
                          through her own fault, but because of 
                          the colossal vitality of his illusion.  
                          It had gone beyond her, beyond 
                          everything. “

           Zelda watches from the threshold, her eyes tearing up...

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        “He had thrown himself into it with a 
                          creative passion, adding to it all the 
                          time, decking it out with every bright 
                          feather that drifted his way.

           CONTINUED:
                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                          No amount of fire or freshness can 
                          challenge what a man will store up in 
                          his ghostly heart...”  What do you 
                        think? 

           But when he looks up, Zelda is gone... 

           EXT. BEACH - BELOW THE VILLA MARIE - NIGHT

           A long stretch of deserted shore.  Zelda is there alone, 
           letting the ocean lap at her feet. 

                                 JOZAN (O.S.)
                        Close your eyes... 

           Zelda smiles at the sound of the familiar VOICE. 

                                 JOZAN (CONT'D)
                        Do you trust me? 

                                 ZELDA
                        Not a whit... 

                                 JOZAN
                        Then I will show you that you can -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        Now what’s the fun in that? 

                                 JOZAN
                        Keep your eyes closed, you will see -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        Maybe we’d all see a whole lot better 
                        with our eyes closed.  ‘Cause keeping 
                        them open doesn’t seem to prevent us 
                        from missing what’s all but sitting 
                        right there at the end of our nose... 

           As Zelda speaks, Jozan has begun to unbutton the back of her 
           cotton dress.  And for every button undone, he bestows a 
           kiss, going down her spine.  

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        What’s the word for this? 

                                 JOZAN
                                 (bestowing a kiss)
                        Un baiser... 
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                        No.  Not that... That... The way I’m 
                        all over hot and cold and if you touch 
                        me again I just might never catch my 
                        breath -- 

           His tenderness and attentiveness are a long way from Scott’s 
           more urgent, hungry physicality... 

                                 JOZAN
                        I think there is no word for this in 
                        any language.  

           INT. VILLA MARIE - BEDROOM - LATE MORNING

           Zelda is packing up her things.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Zelda?

           She continues to pack. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Zelda -- what’s gotten into you? 

           She glances up at him, her expression enigmatic. Then goes 
           back to packing. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                                 (bursting)
                        What in God’s name are you doing!

           She winces at his outburst, but continues, methodically to 
           fill her bag. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        I’m in the middle of reading something 
                        to you -- looking for help -- and the 
                        next thing I know you’re gone... And 
                        I’m up all fucking night in a flop 
                        sweat because I’m certain you’ve driven 
                        the car over a cliff!

           She looks at him now, as if to point out: “Well I didn’t.”

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        For Christ’s sake, say something!

                                 ZELDA
                                 (beat)
                        I want a divorce, Scott... 
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                                 (sardonic laugh)
                        You what ? 

                                 ZELDA
                        I’ll assume that’s rhetorical -- 

           They start talking over one another. 

                                 SCOTT
                        This is a joke...

                                 ZELDA
                        I assure you it’s not -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        If you’re trying to get my attention -- 
                        this is NOT the way to do it -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        Oh no -- ? You haven’t spent this much 
                        time talking to me in the last three 
                        weeks combined... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Just as I’m doing my best work --

                                 ZELDA
                        You should be relieved!  I’ll be gone -- 
                        you can work in peace --

                                 SCOTT
                        You want to destroy me -- is that it?

                                 ZELDA 
                        Far from it: I want to leave you alone.  
                        That’s what you said you wanted.  To be 
                        left alone.  A divorce just makes it 
                        legal -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        I couldn’t possibly divorce you -- 

           The condescension is almost as thick as the anger. Zelda 
           looks at him, defiant...

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        You don’t know the first thing about 
                        taking care of yourself -- or anyone 
                        else for that matter -- You have no 
                        skills -- no way to make a living -- 
                        not to mention what you’d do with 
                        Scottie!  You wouldn’t last six minutes 
                        on your own -- 
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ZELDA
                        I’m not on my own, Scott... 

           It’s a blow: Scott goes silent. Then:  

                                 SCOTT
                                 (dawning on him)
                        The Aviator... 

           Zelda meets his gaze.   

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Strapping man -- that Lozan --  

                                 ZELDA
                          Jo-zan -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        You’ve been working on your accent --

                                 ZELDA
                        I’m in love with him -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        You want felicitations -- 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (fierce)
                        I want my life back! 

                                 SCOTT
                        Then let him come over here like a man 
                        and ask me for it!

                                 ZELDA
                        Ask you for it!?  Like some bauble 
                        you’re going to trade out -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        If you’re a bauble it’s because that’s 
                        what you wanted:
                                 (mocking her)
                        “I feel like you had me ordered -- and 
                        I was delivered to you -- to be worn. I 
                        want you to wear me like a watch charm, 
                        or a button hole bouquet -- to the 
                        world.” Those are your words, not mine!

                                 ZELDA
                        Are they? I didn’t know I had any of 
                        my own words left, as you seem to have 
                        appropriated every last one!
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 SCOTT
                                 (almost bitchy)
                        I like to give credit, where it’s due.  

                                 ZELDA
                        Well the day my diary turns up, you let 
                        me know... 

                                 SCOTT
                        You gave it to me... 

                                 ZELDA
                        I also gave myself. And you’ve nearly 
                        used me up. Will you dispose of me as 
                        well? 

           There is so much truth in that, Scott has no reply.  After a 
           beat, Scott steps away, then out of the room.  We HEAR the 
           CLICK of a LOCK from the other side. 

           Zelda approaches the door.  

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                                 (quietly)
                        Is this it, Goofo?  
                                 (beat)
                        What you’ve always wanted?  Your wild 
                        little rabbit in a cage? You can’t shut 
                        me away for too long. You’ll run out of 
                        material. I can’t wait to see what 
                        you’ll make of my affair: will he 
                        commit suicide?  Or maybe he’ll be 
                        murdered?  

           She has every faith that he is right there listening.  

           ON SCOTT

           And he is, ear to the door, tears streaming down his face, as 
           he submits to the unsavory truth.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        There were moments -- I wasn’t sure -- 
                        I thought you’d all but contrived for 
                        it to happen. Like the plot was already 
                        written: I was just acting my part... 

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           A SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           The sequence of images shows us a woman turning inward -- the 
           only way “out” of her emotional and financial prison:
           CONTINUED:

           * Zelda is perched in front of the window, facing the water, 
           where along a small stretch of sand, Jozan lingers about.

           * Zelda sleeps.  

           * The bi-plane rolling and turning against a blue sky; the 
           blue sky starts to undulate, then liquefies; the plane moves 
           through the water in slow motion... 

           * Zelda wakes with a start... 

           * Zelda packs a trunk with nearly mechanical deliberation. 

           * At the window, watching for Jozan who appears along the 
           stretch of sand. 

           * Zelda on the bed, smoking a cigarette and blowing smoke 
           rings. Staring at the smoke rings, she seems to lose herself 
           in them. 

           * The smoke rings, shifting, and undulant, like the water.  

           * UNDERWATER, sun beams rippling in the clear blue sea, as 
           Zelda and Scott plunge beneath the surface, hand in hand, 

           * Zelda, asleep, wakes with a YELP, as the cigarette has 
           burned down to her flesh.  

           * A letter appears under the door: it is from Jozan.  Zelda 
           tears it up, unread. 

           * Zelda’s at the window looking out: the small stretch of 
           sand is empty today. 

           Zelda lingers there a moment, then flips the face of her 
           platinum watch, so she can see the inscription: 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (just barely audible)
                        From Scott to Zelda... 

           Then she steps from the window, and goes to the bedroom door.  
           She hesitates before reaching for the knob.  

           When she does, it gives no resistance when she turns it... 
           The door has been open all along: to some degree her 
           isolation was self-imposed... 

           EXT. OPEN WATER - DAY

           Zelda is back in the ocean, swimming...

           wife, OLGA KOLKOVA, LEGER, STRAVINSKY, TRISTAN TZARA, 
           MISTINGUET, THE VALENTINOS, JOHN DOS PASSOS, et al.  

           Food and liquor alike are plentiful.  Zelda, more withdrawn 
           than usual, moves through the crowd, like an observant 
           phantom. 

           She pauses a moment, catching sight of Scott across the room, 
           in an animated discussion with a tall, powerful YOUNG MAN 
           dressed in a torn fisherman’s shirt, and ragged workingman’s 
           pants: ERNEST HEMINGWAY.  

           ON SCOTT & ERNEST: Scott, animated by liquor, is on a tear: 

                                 SCOTT
                        The brief episodes, the hard hammered 
                        words, the staccato sentences -- al-
                        together a remarkable expression of the 
                        world as you see it -- 

           ON ZELDA: as she slips her dress off her shoulders, letting 
           it fall in a puddle around her feet... She steps out of her 
           shoes, and in nothing but a silken shift, walks barefoot 
           through the crowd toward Scott...

           The two men remain oblivious, as all around them the room 
           goes quiet... All eyes but Scott’s are on Zelda.

           She keeps a steady eye on him, as if willing him to notice 
           her... But he doesn’t: he’s too taken with Hemingway.  

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        I took the liberty of sending the 
                        manuscript to Max -- 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                                 (with disbelief)
                        -- Perkins? 

           And now, Zelda appears at Scott’s side, dressed ONLY IN HER 
           SLIP, and drapes herself around Scott. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Dear -- Would you care for a swim?

           Scott turns now, seeing her as if she’d just materialized 
           before him... 
           CONTINUED:

           Hemingway is clearly alarmed; Zelda’s “Mona Lisa” smile 
           suggests she takes a certain pleasure in his discomfort.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Come on Goofo -- I dare you... 

           EXT. HOTEL DU CAP - NIGHT

           In his boxers, Scott follows Zelda out to the promontory, 
           over which the hotel is built. A half-moon hangs in the sky.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TERRACE & CLIFFSIDE

           The Murphys and OTHERS, gather to watch... 

           Zelda, absorbed in thought, walks to the cliff’s edge, and 
           scrambles easily down the hill to the lowest of the notches.  

           Scott, less nimble, and clearly more inebriated, follows.  

           A few of the Men on the terrace yell out:  “That’a boy!”  
           “Don’t let a  woman show you up!”

           The Crowd watches: MOST are dumbstruck, SOME are impressed, a 
           FEW are concerned -- Sara and Gerald among them. 

                                 SARA
                                 (to Gerald, quiet)
                        What goes on in that girl’s head...

           Zelda steps up to the notch, and she’s about to dive:

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                                 (distant)
                        Take the high dive!

           Zelda turns to look at the Murphy’s terrace. 

           Sara is visibly disturbed by the suggestion... 

                                 SARA
                        You don’t think she has enough bright 
                        ideas of her own -- 

           But other VOICES join in, until half the party is CHANTING: 

                                 GROUP
                        High dive, high dive, high dive!

           Scott as just scrambled up to join her.  But Zelda, accepting 
           the implied dare without a second thought, begins to climb to 
           the highest notch.  Below, the CRASH of the WATER against the 
           rocks is the only sound.  
           CONTINUED:

           Hemingway appears behind Sara... 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        She’s a lunatic...

                                 SARA
                        Any more lunatic than men at war? 

           Zelda reaches the highest notch, and steps to the edge.  
           Scott scrambles up behind her -- winded from the climb.  

           The whole party is gathered on the terrace. We HEAR MUTTERING 
           and COMMENTARY: 

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Her sense of timing better be good -- 
                        or she’ll dive right into a nothing but 
                        rocks.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Does anyone know? Is the tide in, or 
                        out? 

           Zelda and Scott, small against the sheer face of the cliff, 
           their skin slick under a pale moon. They stand side by side 
           at the edge, knees bent, arms back, leaning into the void... 

              The image is a virtual negative of their joyful leap into the 
              sun... 

           And then their arms are in motion, rushing upwards and: Zelda 
           takes off like an animal born to the act, soaring out over 
           the abyss, then vanishing into it.  

           Scott remains alone on the cliff... He turns to look at the 
           Crowd on the terrace; even at this distance, his 
           embarrassment is palpable. He looks back down at the water... 

           Zelda surfaces, her face caught for a flash in the moonlight. 

           INT. HOTEL DU CAP - THE MURPHY’S VILLA - MASTER BATH - LATER

           Zelda is in the bath. Sara enters with a towel, and leaves it 
           on the rim of the tub.  Sara is about to take her leave, then 
           pauses. 

                                 SARA
                        You know -- that was an awfully 
                        dangerous thing to do -- 

           Zelda smiles, and in her most languid, husky voice: 
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                        But Say-ra -- Don’t you know -- we 
                        don’t believe in conservation... 

           Then with a playful wink, Zelda slips down beneath the 
           surface to rinse her hair. After a beat, Sara steps out. 

           EXT. VILLA MARIE - DAY

           Zelda is in the garden, setting up an easel. Scott wanders 
           out, speaking as he approaches. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Should it be “Trimalchio in West Egg?  
                        That’s the working title.  Or simply 
                        “Trimalchio?”  Or “Gatsby: The High 
                        Bouncing Lover.”  

           Zelda starts mixing paints on a palette. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Whatever happened to “The Great 
                        Gatsby?” That’s the one I like -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        It is?

           He’s immediately responsive to her input -- almost needy. And 
           only now, as he’s about to head back inside, does he notice 
           what she’s been doing. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        You’re painting ? 

                                 ZELDA
                        Why not? 

           Scott shrugs... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Well I don’t know... Certainly you can 
                        sketch. You’re right:  painting will be 
                        a nice change of pace... 

           And with that, she watches he heads back toward the house her 
           heart breaking on the spot at his indifference... 

           CLOSE ON WORDS AS THEY STREAM FROM THE TIP OF A PEN

           “Gatsby: ‘... She used to be able to understand. We’d sit for 
              hours.’ “
           CONTINUED:

           “He broke off.” 

           INT. VILLA MARRIE - STUDY - SAME

           Scott is at his desk which faces a window.  He pauses, looks 
           out to see Zelda at her easel.  The image is almost pastoral. 

           He starts writing again: the pen moves along, SCOTT SPEAKS 
           the lines under his breath as he composes...  

           “Nick: ‘I wouldn’t ask too much of her,’ I ventured. You 
              can’t repeat the past.” 

           “Gatsby: ‘Can’t repeat the past? Why of course you can! I’m 
              going to fix everything just the way it was before.  She’ll 
              see...’ “

           EXT. HOTEL DU CAP - THE MURPHY’S VILLA - NIGHT

           Scott BANGS on the door, candle in hand, his whole body 
           quaking in panic. Sara YELLS from inside the house: 

                                 SARA
                        Scott! Go away! It’s 4 a.m. for the 
                        love of God!

           But Scott continues to BANG on the door until Sara opens the 
           door -- Gerald appears just behind her. 

                                 SARA (CONT'D)
                        Dammit Scott! You are so juvenile!

           Then she registers the agony in his face. Without another 
           word, Sara and Gerald follow Scott out into the rain: 

           INT. VILLA MARIE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Zelda’s body is draped over Gerald, as the latter walks her 
           back and forth.  Scott is slumped on the floor, drinking from 
           his flask and going to pieces. Sara is looking at a bottle of 
           pills, now empty. 

                                 SARA
                        How many of these did she take? 

           Scott, MURMURING to himself, doesn’t hear the question. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know. Maybe it was half full.
           CONTINUED:

           Sara picks up an open bottle of olive oil, and fills a spoon 
           with it. She approaches Zelda with the spoon... 

                                 ZELDA
                        Oh... No more, Sara... Please don’t 
                        make me take that... Too much oil 
                        and... And I will spoil! Spoiled. I am 
                        already!
                                 (a giddy laugh)
                        Or soiled?  That too... Boil. Foil. 
                        Loyal.  Some princess I am... I’m so 
                        sorry Goofo... 

           Scott is on his knees in front of her, so stricken by the 
           possibility of losing her... 

                                 SCOTT
                        We’ve been happy, you and I.  And not 
                        just once. We’ve been happy a thousand 
                        times. Forget the past. I beg you. Turn 
                        about. Swim back to me. We’ll be happy 
                        again.  I promise you. We’ll be happy. 

           CLOSE ON ZELDA’S HAND

           As she draws a picture of Jay Gatsby.

                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                        Gatsby has one of those smiles... It’s 
                        understanding.  No -- more than 
                        understanding... 

           EXT. VILLA MARIE - VERANDA - LATE AFTERNOON

           Zelda is there with Scott; the table is littered with 
           drawings of Gatsby -- each slightly different.  

                                 ZELDA
                        So -- More like you --

           The sun dips on the ocean horizon. Zelda, in her bathing 
           suit, is slim and berry brown.  They are sipping Cinzano, and 
           collaborating.  The scene is almost idyllic.  She is happy.

                                 SCOTT
                        No. Not like me. I’m... I’m too 
                        delicate. He’s stronger.  More 
                        athletic. 

           She finishes one more sketch, and leaves it on the table 
           while she rises to get a cigarette. Scott’s face lights up.  
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Yes! That’s him!  That’s Jay Gatsby!

           Ebullient, he picks her up and whirls her about, then gazes 
           at her -- grateful. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        You know my dear -- If I weren’t me -- 
                        I’d want to be you... 

           Zelda looks up at him, basking in his praise... 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        You draw the same way you dance, or 
                        swim, or eat.  Even the way you speak.  
                        The way you do everything.  Effortless. 
                        I’ve never been able to write that way.  

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott -- You write the way a genius 
                        writes -- however that is -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        No... I have to wring myself for every 
                        word. And each one more hobbled by 
                        liquor and ambition than the next.  No -
                        - You are the artist. Not me.  You 
                        embody it.  With every gesture.  With 
                        your fearlessness. Your lack of 
                        artifice. I have to manufacture it.  
                        And when I do, I make sure to tell the 
                        world about it, because God forbid I 
                        should fall short of my own delusions 
                        of grandeur... 

           Zelda smiles... When Scott is sober, his self-awareness is so 
           acute -- and part of why she loves him. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Well -- if everything’s so effortless -- 
                        you’d think I’d have something to show 
                        for it... 

           Scott points to the drawing. 

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s something. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Goofo -- No one’ll ever see it but you -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        That used to be enough. 
           CONTINUED: (2)

           He says this with a sense of loss and sadness, not anger.  

                                 ZELDA
                        I know. 

           She says nothing more. 

                                 SCOTT
                        And what about the columns -- and the 
                        short stories? 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (smiling)
                        You mean the ones published under your 
                        name? 

           Scott takes this in. Then after a beat: 

                                 SCOTT
                        I have to go back to work. 

           Before he’s stepped inside, she ventures another thought. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott... I’m twenty-six years old.  And 
                        I am, in every respect, a useless 
                        thing... 

           Words all the darker for the calm with which she says them.

                                 SCOTT
                        Zelda -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        No, no... Let me -- just listen: I’m an 
                        amateur dancer, a mediocre writer, a 
                        novice painter... As a wife -- well I 
                        went ahead and bungled that but good... 

           She smiles even through tears. 

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Let’s see?  What else... As a mother?  
                        I think we both knew it wasn’t going to 
                        be my strong suit... Though neither one 
                        of us dared to speculate on just what a 
                        colossal disappointment I’d prove to 
                        be. Honestly, Goofo -- She’d be better 
                        off in the care of a goat... 
                                 (beat)
                        I want to be really good at something. 
                        Just one thing.  Good enough to call it 
                        mine. 
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Scott doesn’t know what to say in the face of these truths 
           laid bare.  Faced with his own fear and confusion, he lashes 
           out: 

                                 SCOTT
                        Why are you saying this now? 

                                 ZELDA
                        Because it’s true.  I just didn’t know 
                        it til now -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        You couldn’t wait until I’d finished 
                        with work -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        Work!? We’ve been working all day! Look 
                        at these -- 

           She snatches at a handful of drawings on the table. 

                                 SCOTT
                        This is just like you -- 

           And now they are yelling over each other. 

                                 ZELDA
                        How many -- Let’s count -- all your 
                        precious Mr. Gatsby’s -- 

           And she begins to count, sending each one over the balcony on 
           a current of air as she does. 

                                 SCOTT
                        For every day I work on the novel, 
                        there are twenty I spend on that drivel 
                        for the magazines just to service this 
                        burlesque you call a lifestyle!

                                 ZELDA
                        Is it burlesque or tragedy!?

                                 SCOTT 
                        You’re doing this to ruin me -- Christ! 
                        I’ll be doing short stories til I choke 
                        on them!

           And he’s gone. 
           EXT. VILLA MARIE - EARLY MORNING

           On the roadside, Zelda is propped against her one of her many 
           trunks, sound asleep.  Scott is coming up the road, rumpled 
           and unkempt from a night of too much drink.  

           But he is gentle as he approaches, kisses her cheek.  She 
           wakes and smiles at the sight of him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t think this is such a good day 
                        for leaving me... 

           Zelda nods.  He helps her rise, and the two of them pick up 
           separate ends of the trunk, and carry it back inside.

           INT. CASINO JUAN-LES-PINS - NIGHT

           Zelda, Scott, Sara, Gerald, Ernest, his wife, HADLEY, and the 
           MacLeishes are at a table that borders the near-empty dance 
           floor.  An ORCHESTRA PLAYS in the b.g.

           Scott is hammered, plying Ernest and Hadley with questions: 

                                 SCOTT
                        Alright -- Tell the truth:  did you 
                        sleep together before you were married?

           And now Sara has had enough:

                                 SARA
                        Scott! You think you if you can just 
                        ask enough questions you’ll get to know 
                        what people are like?

           As Sara tears into him, Zelda observes the exchange, 
           impassive, then rises from her seat.  

                                 SARA (CONT'D)
                        But you won’t.  You don’t really know 
                        anything at all about people!

           Scott’s face bloats with anger, but before he can respond, 
           he’s distracted: 

           Zelda, her skirts above her waist, is dancing... 

           Sara, Gerald, and the others sit motionless, watching her.  
           Remaining CLIENTELE begins to cluster in the archways around 
           the perimeter of the room. 
           CONTINUED:

           But Zelda is oblivious to her ad-hoc audience.  She is not 
           dancing for them.  But for herself... She looks neither 
           right, nor left; she catches no one’s eye.  

           Instead, she seems to sink deep inside herself, as the 
           Orchestra begins to play to her movements.  She surrenders 
           herself to rhythm, yet not once does she appear clownish. 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        He’s got terrible odds against him, 
                        doesn’t he? 

                                 SARA
                        Without her he’d have no odds at all. 

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        She’s unhinged -- 

                                 GERALD
                        No less than he. 
                                 (beat)
                        They’re a pair of conspirators -- in 
                        search of the same Holy Grail... Watch 
                        them.  You’ll see a look come over them 
                        as though they’re being drawn together, 
                        waiting for something to happen. 
                        They’re looking forward to something 
                        fantastic.  Something extravagant.  

                                 HEMINGWAY
                        Well he’s going to follow her right into 
                        the bughouse if he’s not careful -- 

                                 SARA
                        Try not to hold it against him, Ernest. 
                        He’s been good to you.  Everyone needs 
                        what they need: he needs her.

           INT. FITZGERALD’S CAR - NIGHT

           Scott is at the wheel, with a bottle of champagne braced 
           between his knees. Zelda is next to him; Hemingway and 
           Archibald MacLeish are squeezed into the rumble seat.  

           INT. MURPHY’S CAR - SAME

           Gerald, Sara, Ada, and Hadley are just behind Scott.

                                 SARA
                        Half the time he takes this curve, I 
                        swear he’s going off the cliff... 
           INT. FITZGERALD’S CAR - SAME

           Scott takes a swig from the bottle of champagne.

                                 SCOTT
                        Here’s to the king of the Second Rates!

           He takes one more swig from the bottle, as he approaches the  
           Villa.  And now, as Scott pulls into the driveway, rather 
           than slow down to park on the circular section of gravel, he 
           begins to put on speed. 

           INT. MURPHY’S CAR - SAME

           Gerald, Sara, Ada, and Hadley blanch white.  

           INT. FITZGERALD’S CAR - SAME

           He swerves so that the car nearly turns over, as it rounds 
           the gravel patch... And then, Scott revs the motor, and 
           drives straight for the cliff... 

           INT. MURPHY’S CAR - SAME

           Sara is at once terrified and outraged. 

                                 SARA
                        I swear I will kill him if he survives.

           INT. FITZGERALD’S CAR - SAME

           They are coming fast upon the edge of the cliff... 

           And just as it appears they are about to go over, Scott JAMS 
           on the brakes, bringing the car to a precarious stop. Scott 
           hops out of the car, red faced and HOWLING with LAUGHTER. But 
           he’s cut short, when Hemingway, MacLeish, and Gerald come 
           barrelling at him: 

                         HEMINGWAY
               You piss-for-brains son-of-
               whore!
                                                        MACLEISH
                                              You might have a death-wish, 
                                              but I’ll be goddamned if you 
                                              take me with you!

                                                         GERALD
                           SCOTT
               Where’s your sense of humor!
                                              Scott! Are you deranged! 

           Zelda looks on with blank indifference, as the Men set upon 
           Scott, and wrestle him to the ground.  
           CONTINUED:

           Hemingway throws a punch, but Gerald deflects it before it 
           lands...  Zelda turns to head inside. Scott, pinned to the 
           ground, looks up at the three men with an incongruous grin. 

                                 GERALD 
                        How can genius be so perfectly 
                        senseless.

           Scott’s LAUGHTER is all bitterness. 

                                 SCOTT
                          Gatsby: my best work, my worst sales. 
                          That, my dear Gerald, is senseless...

           PALM TREES AGAINST A BRIGHT BLUE SKY - TRAVELING 

           We move past these, and then DOWN, to REVEAL the 20 acre 
           grounds of the AMBASSADOR HOTEL... 

           SUPER: HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA  JANUARY 1927

           INT. CHAUFFEUR DRIVEN CAR - DAY

           Zelda and Scott look out the windows, as the car drives 
           through the hotel grounds -- a world unto itself: 
           restaurants, shops, beauty parlors, small private bungalows.

           As they pass the bungalows, the Chauffeur offers unsolicited 
           information. 

                                 CHAUFFEUR
                        John Barrymore’s staying there, to the 
                        right... I’ve taken more than a few 
                        ladies home from there... Von Stroheim 
                        is in that bungalow there, and Carl Van 
                        Vechten is one over... 

                                 ZELDA
                        Carlo is here!

                                 CHAUFFEUR
                        So what’s your line Mr. Fitzgerald?

           Scott looks at Zelda: “Is this for real?”  Zelda’s as new to 
           this as he is: all she can do is shrug...

                                 SCOTT
                        Like everyone else: I came west for the 
                        gold...  
           INT. COCONUT GROVE - NIGHT

           Zelda and Scott are at a table, among a smattering of MINOR 
           CELEBRITIES, WANNA-BE’S, and STARLETS. 

                                 STARLET #1
                        Does anyone have an invitation to 
                        anything? 

                                 STARLET #2
                        I heard Sam Goldwyn’s throwing a party 
                        in the Hills -- For the Talmadge 
                        Sisters.

                                 STARLET #1
                        I don’t care what you heard. Show me an 
                        escort with an invitation!

                                 SCOTT
                                 (muttering to Zelda)
                        And we weren’t invited... 

           Scott is pouting like a child. But Zelda has other ideas: 

                                 ZELDA
                        Goofo! Since when do we need an 
                        invitation? 

           EXT. SAM GOLDWYN’S HOME - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

           Zelda and Scott are at the front door of the house, on all 
           fours, barking like dogs... 

           COLLEEN MOORE, 27, the day’s biggest box office star, with a 
           page-boy of dark hair, and a petite frame, recognizes Scott.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Mr. Fitzgerald? 

           Zelda and Scott look up:

                                 COLLEEN (CONT'D)
                        You are F. Scott Fitzgerald...

           Zelda and Scott scramble to their feet... 

                                 SCOTT
                                 (introducing himself)
                        Miss Moore...

                                 COLLEEN
                        It’s an honor... But may I ask -- 
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                                 (sheepish)
                        It would appear our name is not on the 
                        list -- 

                                 COLLEEN
                        Oh please -- You can’t tell me -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        Apparently the uh -- keeper of the gate 
                        -- has never read The Great Gatsby. 

           Colleen rolls her eyes in sympathetic exasperation. 

                                 COLLEEN
                        Come with me... 

           INT. SAM GOLDWYN’S HOME - SAME

           A costume party, and glamour on a whole new scale: shameless 
           glitter and extravagance... Zelda and Scott follow Colleen 
           through the CRUSH of GUESTS.  

           WAITERS with trays of food and libations weave in and out.  

           Scott is quick to help himself to a passing glass of 
           champagne as Zelda follows Colleen up the stairs.

           UPSTAIRS: Colleen hands her coat to a VALET, and Zelda does 
           the same. 

           They turn to go back downstairs, and Zelda pauses to gaze 
           down at the CROWD below. Colleen appears next to her. 

           She finds Scott, and waves, but he doesn’t register the 
           gesture: he is ensconced in conversation with a GIRL who 
           isn’t more than 17 years old... 

           Colleen follows Zelda’s line of sight: 

                                 COLLEEN 
                        Ah... Lois Moran.  A face so fresh you 
                        want to slap it. Welcome to Babylon... 

           INT. SAM GOLDWYN’S HOME - DOWNSTAIRS - SAME

           Zelda is next to Scott, who is still engaged in conversation 
           with  LOIS MORAN, and her Mother/Chaperone, MRS. MORAN. 

                                 LOIS
                        I’ve read both novels. And almost every 
                        one of the short stories...
           CONTINUED:

           Scott laps this up like a cat at a cream bowl. 

                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                        I loved “Our Own Movie Queen.” 

           Scott flushes red.  Zelda tosses him a small, triumphant 
           smile. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Actually -- that was one I wrote -- 

           Lois brightens, surprised and impressed. 

                                 LOIS
                        I had no idea!? But I don’t recall 
                        seeing your name on the by-line.

           Lois smiles as the four of them dwell in awkward silence.

           EXT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - POOL SIDE TERRACE - LATE MORNING

           Zelda and Scott are having a late breakfast.  Zelda looks at 
           the newspaper, chewing on her bottom lip. Scott takes in the 
           surroundings, watches the WAITRESSES, the POOL BOYS, the 
           WOMEN dining around the pool. 

                                 SCOTT
                        This is a tragic city of beautiful 
                        girls... 

           Zelda glances up. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        The girls who mop the floor are 
                        beautiful, the waitresses, the shop 
                        ladies... You never want to see any 
                        more beauty.  
                                 (noting Zelda’s lip)
                        Zelda... 

           He gestures to his lip. Suddenly self-conscious, Zelda 
           releases her own. Then she changes the subject. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Miss Moran’s been quoted.  She’s 
                        included you in her list of favorite 
                        authors... 
                                 (beat)
                        “Moran.”  Just one letter off -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        Don’t be uncharitable -- 
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                        I didn’t say anything -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s that look in your voice.  And the 
                        tone on your face... 

           He smiles as he says it; she does too.  He knows her well. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Which look? The one that says: “She’s a 
                        young actress like a breakfast food 
                        that many men identify with whatever 
                        they missed in life...?” 

           Scott LAUGHS despite himself. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Yes. That look.  There’s more to her 
                        than she readily reveals. 

                                 ZELDA
                        I should hope so... She’s only 17.

                                 SCOTT
                        She’s incredibly hard working.  She’s 
                        lived in Paris since she was 11. Her 
                        French is fluent.  And at 14 she joined 
                        the Paris Opera as a ballerina.  She 
                        has a steely sense of determination... 

           Every compliment to Lois, presses Zelda’s most sensitive 
           buttons. She is about to say something, but is interrupted: 

                                 LOIS (O.S.)
                        Scott!

           Lois approaches, her mother in tow.  Scott shoots up from his 
           chair to get their attention.  

           Zelda doesn’t rise from her chair as the women arrive at the 
           table and AD LIB their “GOOD MORNINGS.”

           Lois is utterly dwarfed by Zelda -- not in size, but in 
           character. Zelda is so much more woman than Lois will ever 
           be.  And yet, it is Zelda who is feeling painfully outsized.

                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                                 (pulling up a chair)
                        I’ve had an idea... I think Scott 
                        should screen test for the role 
                        opposite me in my next film!

           Scott is transparently flattered by the suggestion. 
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ZELDA
                        I hate to disappoint you dear, but 
                        we’ve been down that road, and after 
                        talking with his editor, we both agree 
                        that it could be damaging to his 
                        writing career -- 

                                 SCOTT
                                 (cutting her off)
                        That was before I was writing for 
                        Hollywood -- 

                                 LOIS
                        It would be such fun...

           Without another word, Zelda rises, slips out of her robe to 
           her bathing suit, and takes a graceful dive into the pool.  

           UNDERWATER: from beneath her, we watch as Zelda immerses 
           herself in the rhythm of a steady stroke... 

           INT. FITZGERALD BUNGALOW - EVENING

           Scott is dressing for the evening. Zelda is in the bathtub.  
           The door to the bathroom is open. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’ll be back late. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Me too. 

           Scott looks over at her now.  

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        While you’re out romancing the Miss and 
                        Mrs. Morans, I’m going to a party with 
                        Carlo.  There’s some director he wants 
                        me to meet. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You’re not going to start with that 
                        again -- I thought we agreed -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        We did -- then this morning I could 
                        have sworn you changed your mind -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        For me to be in a film with Miss Moran is 
                        not the same as you deciding over night 
                        that you want to be a movie star -- 
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                        It’s not overnight. It’s been years 
                        I’ve talked about it, and years you’ve 
                        forbidden me make a go of it. What are 
                        you afraid of?

           Zelda gets out of the tub, enters the room, slick with suds, 
           and continues the argument.

                                 SCOTT
                        After your stint with the Aviator, you 
                        have ask?  

                                 ZELDA
                        Ah -- so this is punishment: You won’t 
                        allow me to go anywhere without you, 
                        while you  yourself engage in 
                        flagrantly sentimental relations with a 
                        child!

                                 SCOTT
                        That child has lived more in 17 years 
                        than you will in twice that much -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        If only because I’ve been too busy 
                        living your life instead!

                                 SCOTT
                        At least the girl does something with 
                        herself. Something that requires not 
                        only talent -- but effort!

           Zelda goes SILENT. The cruelty in Scott’s remark is new to 
           his repertoire. Now she reels herself in so when she speaks, 
           there’s nothing hysterical about it: 

                                 ZELDA
                        But Goofo... There is one thing I do.  
                        For which I was fated to have a gift 
                        all too singular. And if you can’t see 
                        it, it’s only because I’ve put so much 
                        work into it, that there’s nothing left 
                        of me.  You have it all: my words are 
                        yours; my stories are yours; my essays 
                        too; my mischief is yours.  I’ve even 
                        tried to give you my death. But you are 
                        the author, and I guess you’ve decided 
                        it’s too early in the story for that... 
                        So I’m still here: Mrs. F. Scott 
                        Fitzgerald.  Ask around.  People will 
                        tell you I do that better than anybody. 
           CONTINUED: (2)

           As she says this, her voice BREAKS with despair; tears make 
           tracks down her cheeks. 

           Scott moves to take his leave.  He opens the door, but before 
           passing through it: 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t have to ask anyone.  I knew 
                        that the day we met.

           Where a moment ago there was cruelty, now there is tenderness 
           and resignation, not to mention truth:  he did know better 
           than she just how much of herself she’d sacrifice for him. 
           And just how much he needed her to do so. 

           INT. FITZGERALD BUNGALOW - LATER

           In a nearly maniacal pique, Zelda goes through her closet, 
           removing dresses and coats and scarves.  She gathers these in 
           a pile and dumps them all into the now empty bath tub. 

           From the pocket of her robe she removes a cigarette and 
           lighter.  She lights up, and takes a long drag on the 
           cigarette, sinking into herself.  

           Then she holds the flame of the lighter to a piece of fabric 
           hanging over the lip of the tub, watching as it coils before 
           catching fire... She moves around the tub, holding the flame 
           to piece after piece of fabric. Then she removes the robe 
           she’s wearing and drops it into the pyre.  

           Standing there in only a pair of Scott’s boxer shorts, her 
           platinum watch, the paint on her lips, and the cigarette 
           between her fingers, she watches her work turn to ashes.  

           In the b.g. SIRENS approach. 

           INT. TRAIN - TRAVELING EAST - DAY

           Zelda and Scott settle into their car.  Scott is already 
           working on his flask.  

                                 SCOTT
                        I’ve got Biggs looking for a place for 
                        us now -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        In Delaware ? 
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                        We’ll get a whole house on the river 
                        for the price of a cubby hole in 
                        Manhattan. Anyway -- Once we’re 
                        settled, Lois and her mother will be 
                        coming out to visit.

                                 ZELDA
                        You mean you haven’t had your fill?

                                 SCOTT
                        There’s no such thing as having too 
                        much of that girl -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        Of course not -- there’s nothing to her 
                        in the first place... 

           As she speaks, she removes her platinum watch from her wrist 

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Though in the novel, you’ll bestow upon 
                        her all sorts of quixotic endowments...

           Casually, Zelda dangles the watch out the window of their 
           car.  Scott stares at the watch... 

           And with that she releases the watch to the wind... Scott 
           says nothing as he stares at the spot where the watch once 
           was.  He takes another swig from his flask:

                                 SCOTT
                        You want to explain that?

           Zelda shrugs. 

                                 ZELDA
                        I was done with it. 

           Scott lets out a harsh cough-of-a-laugh...

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        A bold gesture though. The critics will 
                        moon over it when it appears in your 
                        next piece of work. And call you so 
                        original... 

           EXT. ELLERSLIE - DUSK

           SUPER: WILMINGTON, DELAWARE  ELLERSLIE ESTATES  MARCH 1927

           A sprawling, Greek Revival mansion, with two stories, and 
           massive Doric Columns along the front.  
           CONTINUED:

           And on the vast lawn leading up to it, nothing less than a 
           Springtime Bacchanal is on display:  the green has been 
           transformed into a polo field; players are using croquet 
           mallets, and Percheron’s are being led through the gates.

           ANOTHER ANGLE - BY THE RIVER

           Lois Moran, her mother, Biggs, and OTHERS are attempting to 
           create a human pyramid. 

           Lois is climbing to the top, when someone beneath her loses 
           his balance, the whole unit comes apart, and they all land in 
           the river. 

           INT. ELLERSLIE - FOYER - SAME

           All the FAMILIAR FACES (Mencken, Sara Haardt, Carl Van 
           Vechten, Ludlow Fowler, etc...) as Zelda slips into the role 
           of hostess -- only where there used to be warmth, there is a 
           self-ironic edge.  She’s in disguise, and she knows it.  

           Max Perkins and his WIFE enter: Zelda moves to greet them. 

           The VALET helps remove their coats. Max takes a quick look 
           around and exchanges a knowing look with Zelda, as they move 
           into the main part of the house: 

                                 PERKINS
                        Welcome home -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        I thought we’d never get out of there -- 

                                 PERKINS
                        I heard -- Eight weeks of work -- for 
                        nothing.  And I still haven’t gotten 
                        his chapters... 

                                 ZELDA
                        It’s going so slow, it could be 
                        serialized in the Encyclopedia 
                        Britannica.

           They walk past the open door to the KITCHEN: Scott, a 
           cigarette dangling from his mouth, is stacking cases of 
           bootlegged liquor as another YOUNG MAN unloads them from a 
           truck just outside the service door.  
           CONTINUED:

           Lois is perched on a stool, CHATTERING away... Zelda, Max, 
           and his Wife, move on. 

                                 PERKINS
                        I suggested this place because I 
                        thought it would be far enough away 
                        from the distractions. 

                                 ZELDA
                        It was alright when he drank while he 
                        wasn’t working. But now -- he claims he 
                        can’t work unless he’s tight... 

           This is news to Max... 

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        I’ve been toying with some ideas 
                        myself. Maybe even a novel... 

           She’s tentative, testing his receptiveness. 

                                 PERKINS
                        I’ll read anything you send. Always. 

           Zelda nods and smiles, then releases them to the CROWD.  She 
           stands there a moment, watching after them, chewing on her 
           lower lip. 

           A WAITER passes out of the KITCHEN carrying a fresh tray of 
           Champagne.  Zelda helps herself to one as he goes by, and 
           then downs it like a glass of lemonade. 

           EXT. ELLERSLIE - NIGHT

           A BAND plays off to the side of a dance floor, where Zelda, 
           uncharacteristically drunk, is dancing with Lawton Campbell. 

           But she has her eye on Scott, who is dancing with Lois... 

           It recalls the day they met, watching each other on the dance 
           floor, only now, where there was once desire, there is only 
           suspicion. 

           The couples move around the floor such that Zelda and Scott 
           find themselves back-to-back.  

           Lawton takes the opportunity to get a good look at Lois. 

                                 ZELDA
                        She’ll turn up in his next book as 
                        something exotic -- 
           CONTINUED:

                                 LAWTON
                        Zelda -- She’s a child... You’re all 
                        worked up for nothing. 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (on a tear)
                        Now that would be a first: he’ll have 
                        exercised his imagination enough to 
                        create something worthy of the term 
                        “fiction.”  

                                 SCOTT
                                 (to Lois)
                        You’d be irresistible in a pair of 
                        boxer shorts... 

           The word hits Zelda like a cattle prod, and she whips away 
           from Lawton, to face Scott. 

                           ZELDA
                                                          LOIS
               What was that? 
                                                (giggling)
                                              Men’s boxers?  I don’t think 
                                              I’ve ever seen a pair -- 

           Scott turns around, startled. 

                                 ZELDA
                        Repeat what you just said... 

                                 LOIS
                                 (prompting, 
                                 oblivious)
                        About the boxers... 

           And before Scott can react, Zelda’s hand connects with the 
           side of his face.  

                                 ZELDA
                        How much more of me are you going to 
                        take!  Is nothing sacred!?  
                                 (to the Party)
                        I’m the one who wears boxers!  It was 
                        my idea!  Not his!  I’m also the one 
                        who dives into fountains! And from Eden 
                        Roc -- so when you read about that -- 
                        remember -- that’s me!

           She is working herself into a state... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Zelda -- 

                                 ZELDA
                        No... No more... 
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Her eyes are glassy with rage and something darker still.  

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Not one more breath. Not one more 
                        thought. Take from her --

                        From them -- ! 

           The band has stopped playing; the Guest stand silent, and 
           watch as Zelda, in a froth of fury and tears, beats on Scott, 
           and unravels before their eyes.  

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        But I’m keeping what’s left of me... 
                        It’s mine now -- I belong to me now! I 
                        belong to me!

           CLOSE ON A VIAL OF MORPHINE

           As it is sucked up into a syringe. 

           INT. ELLERSLIE - MASTER BEDROOM - SAME

           Scott, Lawton, and one of the SERVANTS hold down a thrashing 
           Zelda as a DOCTOR, 50, administers the morphine. Her body 
           goes slack as she surrenders to the drug. 

           INT. ELLERSLIE - DAY

           Scott wanders through the house, calling out for Zelda, his 
           voice echoing through the empty rooms. We HEAR a response, 
           from a distant room. 

                                 ZELDA (O.S.)
                        In here!

           Scott finds her at last in one of the many LIBRARIES.  She is 
           writing, and pauses when he enters. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Harold just heard from Harper’s Bazaar.  
                        They like your piece about Park Avenue --

           Her expression says she’s ready to be disappointed. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                                 (sympathizing)
                        But they’ll only accept it if they can 
                        use my name along with yours.  They’ll 
                        pay a thousand for it... 
           CONTINUED:

           She offers a small smile and nods: better than no credit at 
           all.  Scott glances over her shoulder; the desk is littered 
           with pads of paper, each dense with ink... 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                                 (reading)
                        “Save me the Waltz?” 

                                 ZELDA
                        An attempt at a title. For a novel... 

           Scott gives her a look: “Really...”

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        I’ll never manage it, but I’m keeping 
                        notes for it anyway.  

           She removes a sheet of paper from the typewriter, gathers 
           together a few from her desk, and hands these to Scott. He 
           looks at her: “And what’s this?”

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Another piece.  About the war years... 

           Scott rifles through, pauses to read:

                                 (reading)
                          Success was the goal for this 
                          generation and to a startling extent 
                          they have attained it, and now we 
                          venture to say that, if intimately 
                          approached -- nine in ten would confess 
                          that success is only a decoration they 
                          wished to wear: what they really wanted 
                          was something deeper and richer than 
                          that.

           Scott looks up at Zelda, impressed. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        My God, Zelda.  I always knew yours was 
                        the finer mind.  

           He removes his flask from his pocket, and takes a swig.  The 
           gesture is almost as reflexive as her lip-chewing. 

                                 ZELDA
                        We were all too young, Goofo.  Clever 
                        and young.  And we achieved everything 
                        we wanted --

                        And we’re still perfectly miserable. 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (softening)
                        Do you know how sorry I am?  Do you 
                        know how I reproach myself for all the 
                        grief I cause you? 

           Scott tries to protest. 

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        You are the best. The best. And genius 
                        is so much a part of you. I love you... 
                        And I want you to be happy.  We have to 
                        stop looking for solace.  There isn’t 
                        any.  And if there were, life would be 
                        a baby affair. 

           So long starved of her approval, the words come as a balm. He 
           approaches her, runs his hands through her hair.  

                                 SCOTT
                                 (barely audible)
                        You haven’t talked like that in such a 
                        long, long time... 

           It’s been as long since they’ve touched. 

           INT. ELLERSLIE - FOYER - MORNING

           Zelda is putting on her coat to leave, just as Scott enters 
           the house, still drunk from a night of carousing... 

                                 SCOTT
                        You’re heading out.  

                                 ZELDA 
                        I’m going into Philly -- I’ve decided I 
                        want to dance again. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You’ve got 29 rooms in which to dance. 
                        Dance here.  

                                 ZELDA
                        I’ll pay for it with what I earn from 
                        the articles... I’m going to be good at 
                        something -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        Zelda -- ?

           He is not critical here, but afraid of the inevitable 
           disappointment to come. For her. For himself.

                        I can’t live this way anymore. Like that 
                        little fish who swims about under a shark 
                        and, I believe, lives indelicately on its 
                        offal. I’m done with it.  

           INT. BALLET STUDIO - DAY

           Zelda, older than the other students, works at the bar.  The 
           Teacher, CATHERINE LIVINGSTON, SOUNDS OFF with instructions. 

           While Zelda’s movement is not as fluid as it was when she was 
           younger, her body has surprising muscle memory.  And her face 
           is set with a determination we’ve never seen. 

           EXT. STUDIO - AFTERNOON

           Catherine accompanies Zelda down the stairs to the sidewalk.  

                                 CATHERINE
                        You danced when you were a girl...

                                 ZELDA
                        You can tell?   

                                 CATHERINE
                        Always.  When you learn that young, it 
                        stays with you.  

           Now it’s Zelda’s turn to bask in the encouragement. 

                                 CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                        Anyway, I hope you’ll come back.

           Zelda nods, and with a smile, takes her leave. 

           EXT. ANTIQUE/JUNK SHOP - PHILADELPHIA - A BIT LATER

           Zelda looks in the storefront: a jumble of odds and ends. In 
           one window, a collection of used watches; in the next, tucked 
           behind a chair, a gigantic 19th century gilt frame mirror. 

           INT. ELLERSLIE - EMPTY ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Zelda, reflected in the gilt frame mirror as she struggles to 
           carry it, with the help of the HOUSE KEEPER, into one of the 
           mansion’s many unused rooms. 
           CONTINUED:

           She is dressed in her dance gear: tights, skirt, leotard, and 
           ballet shoes, and a simple, but delicate watch she picked up 
           at the shop.  

           Scott appears in the doorway, watching the two women wrestle 
           with the mirror without moving to help.  

                                 SCOTT
                        That thing looks like it belongs in a 
                        whore house. 

           Zelda ignores him.  The two women set the mirror down, 
           against the wall.  Zelda checks the position, and satisfied, 
           dismisses the Housekeeper with a nod. Then she drags a chair 
           and places it so that she can use the back of it as a “bar.” 

           She stands back now, reaches for the “bar” and assumes First 
           Position, checking herself in the mirror.  

           Scott, drinking from his flask, continues to watch. Satisfied 
           with the entire set up, she turns to a Victrola in the 
           corner, and drops the needle onto a record. 

           And with the first note she begins her bar work to the tune 
           of “The Parade of Wooden Soldiers,” a nearly carnival like 
           melody -- almost cartoonishly so: a clipped pace with drums 
           and trumpets.  Scott takes his leave. 

           The NEXT SERIES OF IMAGES are CUT IN TIME to the music, which 
           becomes faster and faster until both the music and Zelda’s 
           movements take on a frenzied and distorted quality.

           A SERIES OF SHOTS, FROM WIDE TO CLOSE, WITH INCREASING SPEED

           * Zelda in the studio, working at the bar in class, her 
           movements more fluid now, her clothing dark with sweat. 

           * Scott sitting at his desk, the paper blank in front of him, 
           a bottle of gin and a glass at hand. 

           * Zelda working at home, in front of the mirror, her skin 
           slippery with perspiration. 

           * Scott writes a few lines. 

           * Zelda does her first pirouette in class. Fumbles. 

           * Scott crosses out his lines. 

           * CLOSE ON Zelda’s FACE, as she whips her head around to 
           complete two turns... 

           * Scott pours himself a drink, and knocks it back.
           CONTINUED: (2)

           * CLOSE ON Zelda’s CALF MUSCLES, rippling as she rises on 
           point. 

           * Scott, just awake, in BATHROOM mirror, his hand shakes as 
           he attempts to brush his teeth. 

           * CLOSE ON Zelda’s FACE as she chugs back a glass of water. 

           * Scott looks in the fridge for tomato juice, and finds only 
           an empty bottle.  He slams the door shut.  Gets a glimpse of 
           Zelda in a far room, jumping up and down in fifth position. 

           * CLOSE ON Zelda’s FACE as she jumps up and down, appearing 
           and disappearing in the mirror, again with increasing speed. 

           * CLOSE ON Zelda’s FEET as she jumps in fifth position, 
           switching fifths every time she lands. 

           * CLOSE ON Zelda’s FACE as she whips around in pirouette 
           once, twice, three, four, five times -- and with each turn, 
           her face becomes more gaunt, her bones more pronounced, as if 
           she were literally whittling away at herself... 

           * CLOSE ON Zelda’s EYES, the mirror and herself reflected in 
           her pupil. 

           * ON THE MIRROR where Zelda’s REFLECTION is her 17 YEAR OLD 
           SELF.

           * CLOSE ON Zelda’s EYES, blinking away the sweat from her 
           brow spills past her eyelid. 

           * ON THE MIRROR as the glass LIQUEFIES, becoming a pool of 
           water -- clear at first, it grows darker, until it’s nearly 
           ink, and Zelda’s reflection is blurred until it’s gone in the 
           blackness. 

           * CLOSE ON ONE EYE: reflected in the pupil is the mirror, 
           undulating, like something alive... 

           * ON THE MIRROR as it appears to ripple, and then with an 
           unholy PEAL, it SHATTERS as if from a blow behind the 
           glass...

           Zelda drops the floor, SCREAMING, covering her head with her 
           arms, the mirror intact behind her. 

           Scott, reacting to the SCREAM, appears at the door. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        Zelda! 

           He moves to enter the room:
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 ZELDA
                        Scott, no! 

           She rises slightly from her crouch, gets to all fours, and 
           looks around her... Her eyes go wide: 

           HER POV: the floor of the room is covered in shards of 
           mirror, like small floating sheets of ice... 

           Zelda keeps her head low, as if uncertain that more won’t 
           come flying at her. 

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                                 (almost whispering)
                        Don’t move. There’s glass every-where. 
                        All around.  You mustn’t step on the 
                        pieces. They’ll break, and I need to 
                        collect them. Put the mirror back 
                        together. And keep dancing.  

           Scott stands at the door, his face fractured with despair: 
           there’s nothing at all on the floor. The only thing that’s 
           shattered is her mind.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Goofo -- Will you help me...?  Put it 
                        all back together?

           Scott nods, tears spilling down his cheeks.  

           Zelda looks down, staring at her hands.  She turns one over, 
           and sees a red, oozing lesion: this is real -- not imagined. 
           But she’s not sure. She looks to Scott again:

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        What’s happening to me?  Can you tell 
                        me what’s happening?  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           SUPER: PHIPPS PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE  JANUARY, 1932

           Nurses attend to Zelda, whose body is now covered in red, 
           oozing, psoriatic lesions.  They baste her body with cream, 
           and wrap her bandages.  

           She is wild eyed, MUTTERING to herself: 

                                 ZELDA
                        It’s appalling... Horrific.  What’s 
                        going to become of me... I have to 
                        work. And I can’t work.

                        I have to die, and yet I must work. Let 
                        me go. I must go... 

           Scott appears at the small window on the door to her room, 
           and looks in, but quickly looks away again... 

           INT. PHIPPS INSTITUTE - CORRIDOR - SAME

           Scott is there with DR. MEYER, 65, a slight man with deep 
           brown eyes, and Dr. Thomas Rennie, 40 (and the Man we met in 
           the very first scene of the movie).  They walk as they talk:

                                 DR. MEYER
                                 (slight Germanic accent)
                        She is not what I would call strictly 
                        schizophrenic... Hers is more of a 
                        joint problem -- what I would call “une 
                          folie à deux...:” 

           Scott is intrigued: 

                                 DR. MEYER (CONT'D)
                        Two people, intimately connected, with 
                        similar obsessions... The weaker of the 
                        two will eventually yield to the 
                        stronger, with the consequence that the 
                        identity of the first can become 
                        confused... Delusional. I believe her 
                        current condition -- the eczema -- is a 
                        largely psychosomatic expression of 
                        that confusion and anxiety. 

           Scott reaches for his flask, and takes a swig... 

                                 DR. MEYER (CONT'D)
                        In many of these cases it often 
                        happens that the disturbed individual 
                        will shed the delusions when separated 
                        from the other person. 

           Scott is repelled by the notion...  

                                 SCOTT
                        I get sick at the thought... I would 
                        be a ruined man for years -- Though 
                        its true:  if you asked our friends, 
                        fifty percent would say that my 
                        drinking drove Zelda insane -- the 
                        other half would assure you that her 
                        insanity drove me to drink.

                        And they would be unanimous in saying 
                        that each of us would be well rid of 
                        the other -- in full face of the irony 
                        that liquor on my mouth is sweet to 
                        her and I cherish her most extravagant 
                        hallucinations.

                                 DR. MEYER
                        If you cannot see your way to a 
                        separation -- then her prognosis will 
                        depend entirely on your willingness to 
                        be treated as well -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        Treated?  

           Dr. Meyer glances at the flask in his hand... 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                                 (bridling)
                        Dr. Meyer, my drinking does not get in 
                        the way of my ability to function in 
                        the real world -- 

                                 DR. MEYER
                        I’m well aware --

                                 SCOTT
                        And I will continue to drink -- if only 
                        because giving it up would give 
                        credence to her family’s conviction --
                        -- that I am the cause of this 
                        catastrophe.

           Dr. Meyer nods, painfully aware of the futility in arguing 
           with a drunk... 

                                 DR. MEYER
                        I will do what I can.  I want to put 
                        her on a fairly rigid schedule of 
                        activity to help her get her bearings. 
                        Routine can be effective that way --  

                                 SCOTT
                        Well dancing is out of the question -- 
                        and she may want to write, but the 
                        strain of it can be too much for her -- 
                        so I suggest --

                                 DR. MEYER
                                 (cutting him off)
                        Mr. Fitzgerald -- I think it best if 
                        you are not involved as her 
                        caretaker... Dr. Rennie will be 
                        overseeing her daily activity... 
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Scott chafes at the suggestion... 

                                 DR. MEYER (CONT'D)
                        And I’m concerned that your visits 
                        might prove to be disruptive. So if I 
                        may ask that you give her some time.

           The men stop walking: they’ve reached the entrance to the 
           institute. Dr. Meyer and Scott regard one another... 

           After a beat, Scott nods: “I’ll give her some time...”  And 
           he heads out the door, leaving Dr. Meyer and Dr. Rennie to 
           exchange a knowing look of doubt...  

           A SERIES OF SHOTS AS ZELDA EMBARKS ON HER ROUTINE 

           * Dr. Rennie pushes Zelda in a wheelchair through the lush 
           gardens of the hospital grounds; she is still covered in 
           sores.  

           * Zelda, at the desk in her room, her hands still covered in 
           red, open psioratic blisters, struggles nonetheless to find a 
           comfortable fit for a pen in her hand... 

                                 DR. RENNIE
                          “So much she loved the man -- “

           * CLOSE ON Zelda’s hand as she writes: “Save me the Waltz.” 

                                 DR. RENNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        “ -- so close and closer she felt 
                          herself -- “

           * Zelda, her body still covered in sores, but no longer open 
           wounds, swims in the hospital pool, supervised by a NURSE. 

           * CLOSE ON Zelda’s HAND as she writes haltingly with a pen.  
           The sores on her hand are beginning to heal.

                                 DR. RENNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        “ -- that he became distorted in her 
                          vision -- ”

           * Zelda sits at a desk in her room, filling pad upon pad with 
           writing... Her eczema is receding, her sores fading.  

                                 DR. RENNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        “ -- like pressing her nose upon a 
                          mirror and gazing into her own eyes.”

           * Zelda and Dr. Rennie walk the hospital grounds in animated 
           conversation.  The sores are barely visible, though her skin 
           is still flaking...

                          streams of spun glass -- “

           * CLOSE ON Zelda’s HAND, the words flowing from her pen in an 
           effortless stream.  

                                 DR. RENNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                          remains but a glimmering illusion.” 

           * Dr. Rennie peering over Zelda’s shoulder as she writes, 
           impressed.  Her sores are now entirely gone.  

                                 DR. RENNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        “Neither falling nor breaking, the 
                          stream spins finer.”

           INT. ZELDA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Zelda continues to write, as Dr. Rennie reads out loud from a 
           page he has in his hand. 

                                 DR. RENNIE

                          ecstatic.  Alabama was in love.”

           The words of course describe herself, as Dr. Rennie looks at 
           her now, the fact is not lost him... She works in a nearly 
           trance-like state, her skin not only free of the eczema, but 
           glowing with health...  

                                 DR. RENNIE (CONT'D)
                        Zelda... 

           She doesn’t seem to hear him... And for a moment, we see in 
           Dr. Rennie a flash of that spell she has always cast: he too 
           is enchanted.  

                                 DR. RENNIE (CONT'D)
                        Zelda!

           She looks up now from her pad, her eyes bright and alive. 

                                 DR. RENNIE (CONT'D)
                        This is remarkable.  Truly.  If you 
                        keep this up, it’ll be a success.

           Her face blooms with gladness at the compliments.  
           CONTINUED:

                                 ZELDA
                        I should be done by the end of the 
                        week.

           Dr. Rennie considers this, quizzical... 

                                 DR. RENNIE
                        A whole novel in 6 weeks... 

           Zelda shrugs... 

                                 ZELDA
                        If I could write as fast as I can think, 
                        it would have been done a week ago.

           Dr. Rennie smiles. 

           INT. PHIPPS INSTITUTE - DR. MEYER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Scott, red faced with indignation, rages at Dr. Meyer and Dr. 
           Rennie both. Zelda’s manuscript sits on the desk.  

                                 SCOTT
                        You let her send it to my editor 
                        without consulting me!  

           From their expression, neither Doctor expected such a violent 
           reaction to the situation... 

                                 DR. RENNIE
                        She felt it would be wrong to impose on 
                        you -- 

                                 SCOTT
                                 (over him)
                        Literally one whole section of this 
                        thing is an imitation of my own novel!
                                 (referring to the 
                                 manuscript)
                        I’m going to have to make some changes 
                        before I allow her to seriously 
                        compromise her future as well as my 
                        own. Now I’m going to go talk to her -- 

           And turns to leave. 

                                 DR. MEYER
                        Not in that state, you’re not... 

           Scott turns on him, his face distorted by something close to 
           malice... 
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCOTT
                                 (fierce)
                        Zelda is my wife !

                                 (disarmingly calm)
                        And she is my patient... As her doctor, 
                        I am obliged by oath to “first do no 
                        harm” -- you as her husband, are not... 

           Braced as if hit in the face by ice water, Scott picks up the 
           manuscript and takes his leave without another word. 

           INT. A SMALL ROOM - PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC - DAY

           Back where we began, with Zelda, Scott, Dr. Rennie and the 
           Stenographer. SUPER: PHIPPS PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC, FEBRUARY 1932

                                 ZELDA
                        So -- What do you want from me? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I want you to do what I say.  That is 
                        exactly what I want you to do, and you 
                        know it... 
                                 (beat)
                        I want you to stop writing fiction. You 
                        are a third rate writer and a third 
                        rate ballet dancer -- 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (flat)
                        You have told me that before -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        I am the professional writer, with a 
                        huge following. I’m the highest paid 
                        short story writer in the world --

                                 ZELDA
                        It seems to me you are making a rather 
                        violent attack on a third rate talent 
                        then -- 

                                 SCOTT
                                 (over her)
                        Now the difference between the 
                        professional and the amateur is 
                        something that is awfully intangible.
                                 (to Dr. Rennie)
                        She has written some nice, little 
                        sketches.

           CONTINUED:
                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        She has a satiric point of view. And 
                        some experiences to report.  But she 
                        has nothing essentially to say.

                                 ZELDA
                        Why in hell you are so jealous, I don’t 
                        know. If I thought that about anybody, 
                        I wouldn’t care what they wrote -- 

                                 SCOTT
                        Because you are broaching at all times 
                        on my material -- !

                                 ZELDA 
                        For someone with so much material -- 
                        you've taken an awfully long time --

                                 SCOTT
                                 (cutting her off)
                        If I haven't published -- in what -- 
                        six or seven years -- !

                                 ZELDA
                        Eight --

                                 SCOTT
                                 (to Dr. Rennie)
                        Three of those years were directly 
                        because of a sickness of hers, and two 
                        years before that indirectly, in that 
                        she wanted to be a ballet dancer!

           As agitated as Scott gets, Zelda remains calm, almost 
           “centered.” It is Scott who appears unbalanced. 

                                 ZELDA 
                        You mean you were drinking constantly.

           Scott bridles at the remark.

                                 ZELDA (CONT'D)
                        Lucky for you we didn't divorce.  Who 
                        would you have to blame then?

           Dr. Rennie's expression suggests he doesn't disagree with 
           that observation.

                                 SCOTT
                                 (as if in pain)
                        I am being destroyed here. It is all 
                        unfair. The whole equipment of my life 
                        is to be a novelist --
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 ZELDA
                                 (quipping)
                        I am part of the "equipment" --

                                 SCOTT
                                 (bursting)
                        But that is all you ever wanted! Look 
                        me at me... Look.  At.  Me!

           Zelda turns to him.

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                                 (quiet)
                        I dare you now -- to deny it. Say it 
                        out loud.

           Zelda's eyes brim wet, she bites down hard on her bottom lip, 
           already raw... Her fingers toy absently with her NEW watch. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        You've never loved me as much as you 
                        loved what I would make out of you.

           She breaks skin.  Her lip bleeds... Then she looks away. 
           Scott glances at Dr. Rennie, as if to say: "You see."

                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                                 (calm now)
                          I am supporting you.  It is all my 
                        material.  None of it is yours.

                                 ZELDA
                                 (to Dr. Rennie, 
                                 steady)
                        I tell you:  my life has been so 
                        miserable that I would rather be in an 
                        asylum.
                                 (to Scott)
                        Does that mean anything to you?

                                 SCOTT
                        It does not mean a blessed thing.

                                 ZELDA 
                        Then I’ll explain: it’s impossible to 
                        live with you -- I want to live 
                        someplace that I can be my own self. I 
                        want to write, and I’m going to write --

                                 SCOTT
                                 (raising his voice)
                        It has got to be an unconditional 
                        surrender on her part.

           CONTINUED: (3)
                                 SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        That is the only promise I can have. I 
                        want my own way -- I’ve earned the right 
                        to my own way --

                                 ZELDA
                        And I want the right of my own way -- 

                                 SCOTT
                                 (bellowing)
                        And you cannot have it without breaking 
                        me, so you have to give it up -- !

           Zelda lets that last outburst hang in the air.  She glances 
           at Dr. Rennie, who is looking at Scott as if wondering 
           whether or not they’re treating the right patient. 

           A LONG SILENCE.  Then very quietly, she ends the argument: 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (almost confessional)
                        It is the great humiliation of my life 
                        that I cannot support myself. It’s just 
                        something, one thing -- I can no longer 
                        abide.  I simply cannot live in a world 
                        that is completely dependent on him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Well. Now we have found rock bottom... 

           Dr. Rennie looks from one to other, nodding. After a beat: 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (to Scott, 
                                 sympathetic)
                        You know what the matter is?  You 
                        haven’t written that book and if you 
                        ever do get it written, why, you won’t 
                        feel so miserable and suspicious and 
                        mean towards everybody else.  

                                 SCOTT
                        It would have been written -- 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (finishing for him)
                        If it weren’t for me... I know. 

           She glances down now, and reflexively, in search of comfort, 
           she flips the watch face over, as if to read an engraved 
           message which is not there...

           Scott sees the gesture, and his face softens suddenly with a 
           rush of emotion:

                                 SCOTT
                        But if it weren’t for you, I might not 
                        have ever written at all.  

           And therein lies the impossible, unbearable truth of their 
           connection, for which they now offer each other the most 
           profound empathy.  

                                 ZELDA
                        What is our marriage, Goofo?  

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know... In 1921, we were about 
                        the most envied couple in America.

           Zelda considers this: 

                                 ZELDA
                        I guess so.  We were awfully good 
                        showmen. 

                                 SCOTT
                        We were awfully happy... 

                                                                FLASH TO:

           ZELDA & SCOTT

           They are standing side by side on the cliffside of Eden Roc, 
           drenched by the golden, late afternoon sun.  Zelda gives him 
           an ebullient glance then faces the ocean. 

                                 ZELDA
                                 (whispering)
                        One... Two... Three!

           And they take a synchronous leap off the cliff, chasing the 
           sun and the sea... And for just this moment, they both 
           fervently believe in the promise of their own bright spark.  
           They believe they are happy.

           And the IMAGE FREEZES...
