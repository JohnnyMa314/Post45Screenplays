                                 ART OF MAKING  MONEY 

                                     By Frank Baldwin 

                                                                    10/29/07 
           SUPER THE LEGEND: “CHICAGO, 1985”

           FADE IN.

           CLOSE ON a TEN-DOLLAR BILL. Alexander Hamilton’s face, 
           dashing and regal, stares back at us.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        I’ll give Dad this -- he loved 
                        spending quality time with his kid.

           INT. BEATEN-UP OLDS - DAY

           ART WILLIAMS SR., 35, greased hair, chewing a toothpick -- 
           holds the ten-dollar-bill out to 12-year-old ART, a bright-
           eyed kid in a White Sox cap.

                                 ART SR.
                        You up for this? Attaboy.

           Art Sr. nods out the car window at a diner.

                                 ART SR.
                        Sit at the counter, where I can see 
                        you. Look for a guy in a Butkus 
                        jersey. When he walks to the 
                        bathroom, take off your cap and put 
                        it on the counter. Got all that? A 
                        Butkus jersey.

                                 ART
                        How do you know he’s gonna walk to 
                        the bathroom?

                                 ART SR.
                        Girls ask questions. Guys give 
                        orders. Go.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Art walks to the counter. He lays down the ten-spot and 
           studies the menu like a veteran, charming the JADED WAITRESS.

                                 ART
                        What’s good today?

           She smiles.

                                 WAITRESS
                        The chocolate milkshakes.

           Art nods and closes the menu. He looks around and sees...

           A HEFTY GUY in a BUTKUS JERSEY sitting in a wall-booth. No 
           chance the guy will spot Art, because he’s busy staring at a 
           HOOKER in RED LEATHER PANTS who sits by the window.
           The HOOKER smiles back. She walks to his booth, pauses, then 
           heads toward the bathroom. Butkus follows her.

           Art stares after them, fascinated, then remembers his mission 
           and LAYS HIS WHITE SOX CAP on the counter.

           ART’S POV through the window: His dad gets out of the car... 
           walks up the block to a PADLOCKED MOVING TRUCK...

           ... and SMASHES the driver’s window with an elbow. He opens 
           the door and climbs in.

           INT. MOVING TRUCK - DAY

           Art. Sr. pries open the steering column with a screwdriver 
           and expertly hot-wires the ignition.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Art watches the truck drive away. He doesn’t even see the 
           waitress return with his shake. She raps the counter.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Your milkshake, sir.

                                 ART
                        Thanks.

           He slides her a two-dollar tip. She loves this kid.

           EXT. TAYLOR STREET - DUSK

           Art walks down the street. He steps to the window of the BENT 
           ELBOW, a no-frills, South-side neighborhood bar.

           ART’S POV: His father at the bar, drinking and laughing.

           INT. BENT ELBOW BAR - DUSK

           The crowd is a crackling mix of small-time hoods and blue-
           collar locals. And since this is Chicago, throw in a cop and 
           a priest.

           Art and his father stand at the bar.

                                 ART SR.
                        You were a pro today. I’m proud of 
                        you, kid.

           He gives Art a sip of his beer. Art’s in heaven.

                                 ART SR.
                        Attaboy. Go play Skittlebowl.
           He gives Art some quarters. Art walks to the skittlebowl 
           machine. He glances back in time to see...

           PAULINE, a young waitress with a blue-chip ass, smile at Art 
           Sr., who sneaks a hand through her slit skirt and squeezes 
           that ass. She loves it.

           Art stares, heartbroken.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Knowledge is power, kid. Don’t tell 
                        him you know.

           ANSON STOLIN, 44, stands beside him. Hard-eyed and craven, 
           the toughest Polack in the city that invented tough Polacks.

           Stolin walks to the bar. People smile, nod, or get out of his 
           way.

           Art Sr., feeling his oats, clinks his drink against Stolin’s.

                                 ART SR.
                        Hey, Stolin. Not a bad haul, huh?

           Stolin’s look stops him cold. He examines the lit end of his 
           cigarette.

                                 STOLIN
                        Don’t say something stupid that’ll 
                        make me put this out in your eye. 
                        Don’t say a truckload of TVs makes 
                        us square.
                            (beat)
                        Two more jobs. By the weekend. And 
                        if you’re late paying off your next 
                        bad bet....

           Stolin nods at ROMO, 35, huge, carrying a TV in the back.

                                 STOLIN
                        Romo’s gonna make sure you’re 
                        eatin’ and shittin’ out of the same 
                        tube.

           Pauline tries to slip away, but Stolin pulls her back by her 
           skirt. He looks her up and down.

                                 STOLIN
                        Stop by my office after you count 
                        out tonight.

           She nods nervously. He keeps hold of her. Something he wants 
           her to see.

           Stolin grinds out his CIGARETTE in Art Sr.’s scotch. He looks 
           over to see little Art watching from the skittlebowl machine. 
           He waves him over.
                                 STOLIN
                        And the next time you bring your 
                        boy in here...
                            (he flicks Art’s cap)
                        I’m gonna put him to work.

           He clinks his glass against Art Sr.’s. and drinks.

           Art Sr. stares at the cigarette butt in his scotch as his boy 
           and his mistress look on.

           INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Art walks in. His mother CLAIRE, 33, blonde, bitter, a faded 
           Texas beauty, drinks gin and leafs through a magazine.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Where’s your father?

                                 ART
                        He... had some stuff to do. He gave 
                        me pizza money.

           Art hands her a twenty-dollar bill.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Did he now?
                            (beat)
                        Who is she?

                                 ART
                        What do you mean?

                                 CLAIRE
                            (smoothing his hair)
                        It’s good to know you can look 
                        right into my eyes and lie. Just 
                        like your father.

           She TEARS THE TWENTY-DOLLAR BILL into pieces.

           INT. ART’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Art walks in, carrying the torn pieces of the bill.

           The walls are awash with COMIC BOOK COVERS. Most feature 
           superheroes: CONAN, GREEN LANTERN, the HUMAN TORCH.

           Taped beside each cover is A FELT PEN DRAWING OF THE SAME 
           COVER. Art’s “copies” are awesome -- this kid can draw.

           Art sits at his desk and scotch tapes the bill back together. 
           It’s a hell of a tape job.

           He studies the bill under the lamp. ANDREW JACKSON’S FACE... 
           THE FLYING EAGLE... THE WHITE HOUSE.
           He’s mesmerized, feeling the magic pull of money, the power 
           and promise locked inside that green paper.

           He hits the SALE button on an ANTIQUE REGISTER. The drawer 
           slides open -- there’s real money inside. Art adds the 20.

           He picks up a felt pen and starts drawing the cover of a 
           HAWKMAN COMIC BOOK. His strokes are graceful and true.

           Art hears the front door open. He hurries into the living 
           room to see Art Sr. walk in. Drunk but controlled. Chewing 
           his toothpick.

                                 ART SR.
                        Hey, Kid.
                            (he wrinkles his nose)
                        What the hell’s that?

           Art smells it too. From down the hall. He freezes, nervous.

           Art Sr. follows the scent to his bedroom door. Art trots 
           behind him, full of dread. They look in to see:

           Claire sitting on the bed. Her husband’s SHIRTS are laid out 
           neatly on the covers. She’s POURING PERFUME on them.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Let her smell my perfume on you. 
                        Just once. I think that’s fair, 
                        don’t you?

                                 ART SR.
                        Goddammit! Give me that!

           He grabs the bottle away from her. She pulls out another one 
           and finishes the job. 

           Art Sr. rushes to the closet and opens it. His suits and ties 
           are drenched. Ruined. To the dresser now. T-shirt and 
           underwear drawer -- soaked.

                                 ART SR.
                        You bitch.

           Claire sits serenely on the bed.

                                 ART SR.
                        You think it’s the perfume? She’s a 
                        real woman, Claire. Kiss her and 
                        she likes it. Lie on her and she 
                        moves.

           Claire squirts perfume in his face. He drops to his knees, 
           blinded. She empties the bottle over his head. But he’s 
           laughing now. He staggers to the vanity sink and rinses his 
           eyes. Into the mirror:

                                 ART SR. 
                        Free, baby. Fuckin’ free.
           He walks out and through the living room, Art running behind.

                                 ART
                        Dad... Dad.

           Art blocks the door. His father kneels and hugs him tightly.

                                 ART SR.
                        This ain’t your fault, kid.

           Art, desperate, takes off his WHITE SOX CAP and hands it to 
           him. Art Sr. doesn’t want it, but Art won’t take it back.

                                 ART
                        You’re coming back, Dad. Right?

                                 ART SR.
                        Yeah. Real soon. There’s just this 
                        one job I gotta take care of.

           Art Sr. gives him a last mighty hug. He walks out.

           Art stares at the door. Claire comes up behind him.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Ready for that pizza?

           EXT. BENT ELBOW BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

           Romo sits on an empty keg, smoking a joint and digging the 
           Springsteen song playing out the bar’s open door.

           The stolen moving truck sits in the alley. Suddenly, it ROARS 
           TO LIFE. 

                                 ROMO
                        What the fuck? Hey!

           INT. MOVING TRUCK - NIGHT

           Art Sr. at the wheel, putting her in gear. In the SIDEVIEW 
           MIRROR, he sees Romo running toward him. He flips him the 
           bird out the window as he drives away.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Art and Claire at the table. Art hasn’t touched his pizza.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Don’t worry. He always comes back.
           INT. MOVING TRUCK - NIGHT

           Art Sr., his boy’s WHITE SOX CAP beside him, speeds down a 
           street of brownstones.

           Pauline runs out of a brownstone. Art Sr. pulls over. As she 
           climbs up into the cab, she knocks ART’S CAP into the street.

           They kiss hard, giddy. Bonnie and Clyde.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           The truck speeds off, its back wheel crushing Art’s cap. The 
           white cap lies broken in the dark street.

           EXT. ART’S FRONT STOOP - DAY

           Art sits on the stoop, pounding a baseball into a glove and 
           staring sadly up the empty street.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        But not this time. This time, Dad 
                        was gone for good...

           EXT. ST. RITA’S SCHOOL - DAY

           The white Catholic spires and golden gates of St. Rita’s 
           shine in the sun. 

           Art pedals his bike to a bikerack.

           INT. PRINTING ROOM - DAY

           Sunlight filters through stain-glass windows, bathing a 
           beautiful HEIDELBERG PRESS in stunning light.

           Art helps a HOT GIRL work the press. She smiles at him. Art 
           looks up to see the PRINCIPAL FROWNING IN THE DOORWAY.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        And he took a lot more with him 
                        than he ever knew.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Art stares bitterly out the window.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Your mother didn’t tell you?
                            (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
                        We gave her as long as we could, 
                        Art. She hasn’t paid the tuition in 
                        months.

           EXT. ST. RITA’S - DAY

           Art on his bike, taking a last look back at the golden gates.

           EXT. WILLIAMS APT. - DAY

           As the SUPER tapes an EVICTION NOTICE on the door...

           Art opens it from the inside. He sees the notice. 

                                 SUPER
                        Sorry, Kid.

           INT. ART’S BEDROOM -- DAY

           A glum Art pulls his COMIC BOOK COVER DRAWINGS off the wall.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Art helps Claire pack up the kitchen.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It’ll be a new start. Right?

                                 ART
                        Sure, Mom.

           Art looks under the sink: A DOZEN EMPTY GIN BOTTLES.

           INT. U-HAUL -- DAY

           Art stares at his old home as Claire drives away.

           EXT. PROJECT HOUSING - DUSK

           A long row of sorry-ass one-level brick buildings. Each grim 
           unit shares a pitiful patch of brown grass with its neighbor.

           The U-Haul pulls up. As Art climbs down, he sees the BENT 
           ELBOW BAR squatting on the corner, less than a block away.

           INT. NEW APT. - DAY

           They walk into a dump. Puke yellow walls, warped floorboards. 
           Art steps on a squishy ROACH MOTEL. He looks at Claire.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You think I wanted this?
           INT. ART’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Art lies on his bed, absently pressing the SALE BUTTON on his 
           ANCIENT CASH REGISTER. The drawer slides in and out, in and 
           out. There’s no money in it anymore.

           The walls are bare. No comic book covers.

           EXT. KELLY HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Art walks through the parking lot of his new school. The 
           place has all the charm of a state prison.

           Art passes: A hoop court with busted rims... a flagpole with 
           a torn flag... a sign banning firearms from the school.

           TWO KIDS sit on a car hood, sharing a joint before homeroom.

           Art walks to the lockers, which are outside. Jaded WHITE KIDS 
           surround a beatbox, digging Grandmaster Flash.

           As Art spins his combo lock...

           A GIRL slams another GIRL into the locker beside Art’s. They 
           hit the ground, fighting. Kids crowd around, egging them on.

           Art backs up, shaking his head.

                                 CASEY (O.S.)
                        Welcome to Kelly, Homes.

           Art turns to see the two kids who were sharing the early-
           morning joint.

           CASEY is a hot-tempered redhead in AIR JORDAN sneaks and 
           JORDAN JERSEY. We’ll never see him dressed in anything else.

           DON, short and slight, wears a MARINE CORPS SWEATSHIRT.

           EXT. SMALL CITY PARK - DAY

           Art, Don, and Casey lounge on the park’s steel railing. 
           COMISKEY PARK, home of the White Sox, looms behind them.

                                 DON
                        Kelly’s not so bad.

                                 ART
                        Unless you want to learn anything.

           The guys shrug -- they never thought of that. A PRETTY TEEN 
           walks by, a bookbag on her shoulder.

                                 CASEY
                        Need a tutor, baby?
           Don takes a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE out of a small kit. Art stares 
           at him, freaking out.

                                 CASEY
                        He just needs a little hit to face 
                        Mom and Dad.

           Don rolls up his pant leg.

                                 ART
                        Hey. Don’t fuckin’ do that.

           Don shoots up and sighs. As Art starts to hurry away, Don and 
           Casey bust out laughing.

                                 CASEY
                        Insulin, Homes. He’s diabetic.

           What an icebreaker. Casey holds up a hand. Art slaps it. 
           Friends.

           INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

           Art stands by the meat section. He looks around, then slips a 
           PACKAGED STEAK under his winter coat.

           AT THE CHECKOUT STAND

           Art hands a PACK OF BASEBALL CARDS to a GRIZZLED CLERK in a 
           Bears’ jersey. He eyes Art suspiciously. Art smiles.

                                 ART
                        How ‘bout those Bears?

                                 CLERK
                            (relaxing)
                        On fire. Three in a row.

           A drop of red meat juice drips onto the floor. Art covers it 
           with a sneaker.

                                 ART
                        I’m going on Sunday. My Dad’s got 
                        season tickets.

           INT. SHOP CLASS - DAY

           Art sits at a workbench, bent over a sheet of metal.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        Kelly High didn’t even have an art 
                        class. Just shop.

           Art is fashioning the metal into some kind of pronged tool.
                                 CASEY
                        No fuckin’ way it’ll work, Homes.

                                 ART
                        Bet me a beer.

                                 CASEY
                        A six-pack. Of Busch.

           EXT. STREET - DUSK

           As Casey and a nervous Don stand lookout, Art works on a 
           PARKING METER with his new tool. He jiggles and pries.

                                 DON
                        Let’s get out of here, Artie.

           Suddenly the face of the meter pops open. A mountain of 
           quarters spill into the street. Art looks up, triumphant.

                                 CASEY
                        Fuck me.

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           Art empties parking meters... packs quarters into coin rolls 
           at his desk... walks into a supermarket, head high. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Art comes in, loaded down with groceries. Claire sits at the 
           table, gin in hand, still wearing her drab pink waitress 
           outfit from work. The open oven door heats the room.

                                 CLAIRE
                        My son the provider.

           She starts putting away the groceries.

                                 CLAIRE
                        A letter came from school today. 
                        They miss you.
                            (beat)
                        I told them you transferred. That 
                        way, they won’t report you to the 
                        state.

           She smiles. Quid pro quo.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           ART, SIXTEEN NOW, a hard glint in his eye, walks along the 
           sidewalk with Casey. They’re sizing up cars. 
                                 ART (V.O.)
                        The American dream is to go farther 
                        than your father, right? Dad had a 
                        tenth grade education. I made it 
                        through half of eleventh.
                            (beat)
                        Hey -- nobody was paying me to sit 
                        in class.

           Art BASHES IN A CAR WINDOW with his elbow. As the car alarm 
           blares, he removes the STEREO from the dash.

           He sees Casey about to do the same to a FIRE RED TRANS AM.

                                 ART
                        Not that one.

           Art walks over and admires the car. Too perfect to mess up.

                                 ART
                        I’m gonna buy me one of those.

           So Casey smashes the window of a Mazda and grabs the stereo. 
           They run to an alley, where Don waits with a duffel bag. They 
           load the stereos in.

                                 DON
                        We’re drinking Michelob tonight.

           As they walk through the alley, Don trips and drops the 
           duffel bag. The CRUNCH of breaking stereos.

                                 CASEY
                        That’s comin’ outta your cut.

           As they reach the mouth of the alley, Stolin’s thug Romo 
           appears. Huge and menacing.

           The guys look back at the far end of the alley -- TWO MORE 
           THUGS. No escape.

                                 ROMO
                        If I gotta chase you, you’ll pay.

           INT. BENT ELBOW’S BACK ROOM - DAY

           A private audience with Stolin and Romo. Art, Casey, and a 
           terrified Don sit at a table. Stolin pours shots of vodka.

                                 STOLIN
                        Art Williams Junior. I shoudda 
                        known. You boys drink?

                                 ART
                        Does the Pope shit in the woods?

           Romo backhands Art hard, knocking him to the floor. He pours 
           the shot of vodka over him.
                                 ROMO
                        Know who you’re talkin’ to.

                                 STOLIN
                        It’s real simple. You operate on my 
                        turf, you pay street tax.

           Stolin poaches half the stereos from the duffel bag. He 
           leaves the broken ones for the boys.

           Casey helps Art up. The boys head for the door.

                                 STOLIN
                        If you hear from your Dad, Art, 
                        tell him he owes me a waitress.

           INT. ART’S KITCHEN - DUSK

           Art guzzles O.J. at the fridge.

           He sees a POSTCARD on the table. It’s a tacky tourist card 
           from SAN ANTONIO. A picture of the Alamo. Art flips it over.

           ON CARD: In a drunken scrawl: “Happy Birthday. Attaboy. Dad.”

           Art rips the card in half. He sits down and tapes it back 
           together. He sees Claire in the doorway. She smiles sadly.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Check would’ve been nice.

           INT. BENT ELBOW BAR - NIGHT

           A rowdy Friday night crowd packs the place. The usual 
           suspects, drinking through their paychecks.

           Stolin roams the room, sharp-eyed, missing nothing.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        Mom appreciated my hustle -- but 
                        she kept her eyes open for a better 
                        provider.

           Claire, looking fine in a low-cut blouse, drinks with a 
           GIRLFRIEND at the bar.

                                 BARTENDER
                            (setting down a beer)
                        From the guy with the beanie.

           Claire and her friend look down the bar at...

           TONY PEZZI, a.k.a DAVINCI, 40, a pint-sized guy wearing a 
           sharp Italian suit and a black leather beanie.

                                 GIRLFRIEND
                        It’s not your night.
           Claire sees that a corner of her beer bottle label has come 
           loose. She peels off the whole label and turns it over.

           CLOSE ON LABEL: A dynamite PENCIL SKETCH OF CLAIRE. DaVinci 
           has drawn her busty and vivacious, a blouse button undone. 
           Claire loves it. She smiles at him. He walks over.

                                 DAVINCI
                        Tony. But call me DaVinci.

           INT. ART’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Art looks out his window to see DaVinci walking Claire up the 
           front steps. He jumps up, pissed.

           EXT. APARTMENT STEPS - NIGHT

           Art opens the door, glaring. DaVinci offers his hand.

                                 DAVINCI
                        I hear you draw.

                                 ART
                        Used to.

           INT. ART’S ROOM - DAY

           DaVinci smokes a short cigar and looks through a bin of Art’s 
           old comic book cover drawings. No b.s. -- he’s impressed. He 
           holds up the HAWKMAN COVER. Wow.

                                 DAVINCI
                        Why’d you stop?

           A beat. Art wants to confide in him... but the wound’s too 
           raw. He just shrugs.

           EXT. WILLIAMS APT. - DAY

           Art sits on his front steps as DaVinci pulls up in a sweet 
           BLACK FIAT. Impeccably dressed, as usual.

           Claire walks out the front door. Art can’t believe it -- his 
           mother is a woman transformed. New hair, new dress, new 
           stockings. She’s damn near beautiful.

           She reaches the car. DaVinci glances back at Art. Claire gets 
           the hint and sighs.

                                 CLAIRE
                            (to Art)
                        Wanna come?
           INT. GIBSON’S - NIGHT

           Chicago’s landmark steakhouse is packed. Art watches DaVinci 
           slip a TWENTY to the MAITRE’D.

           IN A PRIMO BOOTH

           Art wolfs down the biggest steak he’s ever seen... and stares 
           at the WAD OF CASH in DaVinci’s wallet as he pays the bill.

           He leans close to Claire and whispers.

                                 ART
                        What’s he do, Ma?

                                 CLAIRE
                        None of our business.

           EXT. COMISKEY PARK - DAY

           Art and DaVinci watch the White Sox from box seats right 
           behind the dugout.

                                 DAVINCI
                        So school’s not your thing. Ever 
                        think about using your talent?

                                 ART
                        Like someone’s gonna pay me to 
                        draw.

           DaVinci sips his beer, eyes pensive.

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           Art, wearing grease monkey coveralls, pumps gas.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        When the corner station was hiring, 
                        I pumped gas. When they weren’t...

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           A tough streetcorner in the hood. A black, long-necked DRUG 
           DEALER plies his trade.

           INT. ART’S CROWN VIC - NIGHT

           Art and his buddies -- Casey, Don, and JOEY -- a quiet 300-
           pounder -- watch the dealer close a crack sale.

                                 DON
                        What if he’s packing?
                                 ART
                        Some Marine you’d make. Rig that 
                        light, Case.

           Casey plugs a cord into the cigarette lighter and mounts a 
           RED POLICE LIGHT on the roof.

           STREETCORNER

           A sunken-eyed TEENAGE GIRL begs the dealer for a baggie. He 
           slaps her. She doesn’t give up. He leads her into an alley. 
           She drops to her knees.

           The Crown Vic speeds to the alley, police light flashing. 
           Everyone jumps out.

           Art, Casey, and Joey charge into the alley.

                                 ART
                        Police! Freeze!

           The DEALER sees three “Narcs” rushing hard, sees the flashing 
           POLICE LIGHT behind them. He kicks the girl away. He tries to 
           run, but trips on his lowered pants. He starts dumping crack 
           bags into a puddle and stomping on them.

           Art tackles him. He cuffs the dealer’s hands behind him. He 
           pulls off the guy’s pants and tosses them to Joey.

           Don’s back at the car -- the lookout. But he’s watching the 
           action in the alley, and oblivious to...

           The REAL COP CRUISER, just turning onto the block.

           ALLEY

           The dealer sits on the ground, in his underwear. He watches 
           Joey take out his wallet and poach a fat stack of bills.

                                 DEALER
                        You ain’t no fuckin’ cops.

                                 ART
                        We gotta get you on Jeopardy.

           INT. CROWN VIC - NIGHT

           As Art and the guys get back in the car...

           Art sees the COP CRUISER down the block. He yanks the FAKE 
           LIGHT off the hood.

           Too late. The cruiser taps its siren and heads their way.

                                 ART
                        Shit.
           Art floors it. He gets a little separation, then turns into a 
           narrow street bounded on the left by the freeway wall. It’s a 
           quarter-mile straightaway, with streets dead-ending into it.

                                 ART
                        Hold on.

           Art blasts down the straightaway. The NEEDLE HITS 100.

           Casey whoops, loving it. Stoic Joey. Ashen Don.

                                 ART
                        First rule of life, guys...

           Art checks the rearview. No cruiser yet. So he...

           Brakes hard and turns into a side-street... pulls into a 
           driveway... and cuts the engine.

                                 ART
                        Always have an escape route.

                                 JOEY
                        Are you nuts? You can’t stop here.

           Art taps the horn.

           TRACEN, 13, runs out of the house, grabs the TWENTY Art holds 
           out the window, and pulls a CAR COVER over the Crown Vic.

           EXT. STRAIGHTAWAY - NIGHT

           The COP CRUISER slows. The cops look down the street Art 
           turned onto. Nothing. They move on.

           INT. CROWN VIC - NIGHT

           Pitch darkness.

                                 CASEY
                        That was the balls, Homes.

           A LIGHTER clicks on, illuminating the guys.

           As Joey divvies up the cash, Casey slaps Don’s head.

                                 CASEY
                        Next time we’ll draw a picture of a 
                        fuckin’ cop car, so you know what 
                        you’re lookin’ out for.

                                 DON
                        Speed Racer here had us covered.

           Don lights a joint and hands it to Art. Just as Art takes a 
           hit...
           The CAR COVER IS WHISKED OFF. Bright POLICE LIGHTS shine in.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Art stands in the docket before a JUDGE. In the gallery, a 
           red-eyed Claire leans on DaVinci’s shoulder.

                                 JUDGE
                        Thirty days in Juvie. Next.

           INT. JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER BUNK ROOM - DAY

           Art sits on his metal bunk, reading a car magazine.

           A TEEN THUG walks over. Art stares him down. A DOZEN JUVIES 
           gather round, smelling action.

           The thug rips the magazine out of Art’s hand.

                                 ART
                            (nodding at the crowd)
                        Which one of them’s gonna read it 
                        to you?

           The boys laugh. The thug turns red. A beat. Art flies off the 
           bunk and tackles him. They go at it, fists flying.

           EXT. JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER - DAY

           Art walks out. He sees DaVinci waiting in his Fiat. Art heads 
           over, scowling to hide his shame.

                                 ART
                        Can you drive me to Pebble?

                                 DAVINCI
                        You don’t want to see your mom 
                        first?

                                 ART
                        I’ll see her later.

           INT. FIAT - DAY - DRIVING

           Art’s anger fills the car.

                                 DAVINCI
                        Do any thinking in there?

                                 ART
                        About what?

                                 DAVINCI
                        About what you wanna do with your 
                        life.
                                 ART
                        Get rich.

                                 DAVINCI
                        Boosting street dealers?

                                 ART
                        What’s it to you?

                                 DAVINCI
                        I’m not your father, Art. Your beef 
                        with him is with him, not me.
                            (beat)
                        If you’re gonna break the law, at 
                        least do it right. I could teach 
                        you something. A skill you might be 
                        good at.

           Art looks out the window instead of answering. Tough guy.

           EXT. “PEBBLE BEACH” - DAY

           DaVinci pulls up to a patch of gravel beside a highway 
           overpass. YOUNG TURKS and BABES lounge on car hoods. Coolers, 
           joints, and boomboxes abound. A half-capped fire hydrant 
           shoots a geyser of cooling spray.

           Art gets out of DaVinci’s car.

                                 DAVINCI
                        Think about it.

           Art walks toward Casey, Don, and Joey, who are pounding beers 
           on the hood of Don’s car.

                                 CASEY
                        Look who’s back.

                                 ART
                        Bend over, Joey, and I’ll tell you 
                        about the showers.

           Joey tosses Art a beer. Don hugs him.

                                 DON
                        Semper Fi, man.

           Casey, manning the hydrant, soaks the tight t-shirt of a 
           nearby BABE. Art smiles.

           Casey pulls out a CAR KEY.

                                 CASEY
                        You’re just in time, Homes.
                        See this? Opens any Corvette. I got 
                        a guy in Chinatown who’ll pay us a 
                        hundred a car.

           Art looks back for DaVinci. He’s gone.
           EXT. TAYLOR STREET - MORNING

           DaVinci sits at an outdoor cafe, finishing up a charcoal 
           sketch of the street scene around him: Kids playing hockey, a 
           pretty girl leaning out a window. Art walks up.

                                 DAVINCI
                        You’re in my light.

                                 ART
                        I wanna learn that skill.

           EXT. 39TH STREET - DAY

           The meat-packing district, hard by the Chicago stockyards. 
           DaVinci parks his car.

           He leads Art down SLAUGHTERHOUSE ROW. A hellacious din and 
           stench. Art, gagging, pulls his shirt over his nose.

           A truck dumps a load of doomed, squealing pigs into the 
           slaughterhouse dock. Art can’t believe he signed up for this. 
           But he follows DaVinci to an abandoned warehouse...

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           ... through double-dock doors... into an old-ass service 
           elevator. DaVinci closes the gate. They head down...

           INT. BASEMENT - DAY

           ... into the basement. Cool and quiet. Art can breathe again. 
           DaVinci leads him down a hall to a door.

                                 DAVINCI
                        You’re about to cross a line. A 
                        pretty big one.

           Art’s up for it. DaVinci opens the door and flips on the 
           switch. Fluorescent lights flicker on, revealing:

           A huge, immaculate room full of well-organized equipment. 
           Everything in here is clean and in its place.

           Art stares at a big PRINTING PRESS and long tables. A PROCESS 
           CAMERA on a stand. Assorted other machines.

           He parts two heavy black drapes and looks into a DARKROOM. 
           He’s thinking hard, but he hasn’t figured it out yet.

           Then he sees two HALF-GALLON JARS OF INK. “FOREST GREEN.” 
           “CHARCOAL BLACK.” The magical truth hits Art.

           DaVinci hands him a crisp new TWENTY-DOLLAR BILL.
                                 DAVINCI
                        Now that’s art.

                                 ART
                        You fuckin’ make money.

           DaVinci smiles and nods at a bar stool. Art sits down.

                                 DAVINCI
                        What I do in this room, my father 
                        taught me. His father taught him. 
                        You understand? This goes back 
                        generations. Back to Italy.
                            (beat)
                        Today, all you’re gonna do is 
                        watch.

           DaVinci changes into a pair of coveralls. He steps to an old 
           radio and turns it on. CLASSICAL MUSIC.

           He steps to a sink and washes his hands.

                                 DAVINCI
                        Never make money with dirty hands. 
                        It’s bad luck.

           He lays down the TWENTY and points the PROCESS CAMERA at it. 
           He works the contrast knobs. Fingers the button. FLASH!

           AND WE’RE OFF, Art watching in awe and wonder as... 

           INT. DARKROOM

           DaVinci lifts the NEGATIVE SHEET from the chemical tray. He 
           breathes onto it. ANDREW JACKSON’S FACE shimmers to life.

           DaVinci inspects the NEGATIVES on a light table... selects 
           TWO FRONTS and a BACK.

           He razors off the SERIAL NUMBERS and “tweezers” in new ones.

           INT. DUNGEON

           DaVinci lays the negatives onto a plate burner. A SIZZLING 
           FLASH as the master images are seared onto aluminum plates.

           DaVinci lays the four plates side-by-side. Separate ones for 
           the BILL FACE, the BACK, the SERIAL NUMBERS, and THE SEALS.

           BACH plays now, clean and clear, as DaVinci gently washes the 
           plates until just the raised images remain. He works quickly 
           and precisely -- no wasted movement, no mistakes.

           Art watches intently, completely absorbed.
           DaVinci dumps GOOEY GREEN INK onto cardboard and cuts it with 
           WHITE INK. Using a spatula, he lathers the ink onto the 
           rollers of the press.

           He fires up the press. And now the really cool part: 

           DaVinci “builds up” the bills by loading the different metal 
           plates on the press and then sending the same sheets of paper 
           through again and again.

           Art watches, mesmerized, as the “money” comes to life, 
           element by element. FIRST:

           BLANK SHEETS of MONEY-GREEN PAPER roll off the press.

           The next time through, ANDREW JACKSON’S PORTRAIT and the 
           BORDERS OF THE BILLS appear... then the FEDERAL RESERVE 
           SEALS... then the SERIAL NUMBERS...

           DaVinci slides the last metal plate onto the press. He looks 
           into Art’s eyes and pulls the lever.

           CLOSE ON ART, staring transfixed as the sheets of finished 
           bill-fronts roll off the press.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        It was like watching Christmas 
                        cookies come out of an oven.
                            (beat)
                        No. It was better.

           Art stares at the sheets of bills. Beautiful. Endless.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        It was like sex.

           INT. ART’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Art sits on his bed, looking out the window. He pulls out a 
           20-dollar bill and stares hard at it.

           INT. DAVINCI’S DUNGEON - DAY

           Art and DaVinci wear old work clothes. DaVinci holds out a 
           piece of cream-colored, ROYAL LINEN PAPER.

                                 DAVINCI
                        People touch money before they see 
                        it. You gotta fool their fingers 
                        first.

           Art rubs the paper between his fingers. He smiles, amazed.

           ART’S LEARNING MONTAGE

           DaVinci stands beside Art, letting the kid do all the work.
                                 DAVINCI (V.O.)
                        Every bill you make can get you 
                        sent away -- or worse. Don’t lose 
                        focus. Don’t get sloppy.

           Art makes every mistake in the book. Overexposes the 
           negatives... slices them up while cutting out serial 
           numbers... mixes too much white ink into the green.

                                 DAVINCI (V.O.)
                        Keep your operation small. Print 
                        enough to live well on, but don’t 
                        get greedy.

           INT. DUNGEON DARKROOM - ANOTHER DAY

           Art and DaVinci side-by-side again. Art works with confidence 
           now, getting the hang of this.

           He breathes onto a NEGATIVE, bringing Andrew Jackson to 
           ghostly life. A perfect exposure.

           He expertly tweezers in a new line of serial numbers... burns 
           an aluminum plate on the plate burner.

                                 DAVINCI (V.O.)
                        Trust no one. Money changes people. 
                        Don’t learn that the hard way.

           INT. DUNGEON - DAY

           DaVinci puts the finishing touches on a counterfeit 20. She’s 
           beautiful. He snaps her -- she crackles. He hands her to Art.

                                 DAVINCI
                        Most important -- never forget why 
                        you’re printing.

                                 ART
                        To buy whatever I want.

                                 DAVINCI
                        You think money buys you happiness, 
                        don’t you? That’s what everyone 
                        thinks.

                                 ART
                        You’re gonna tell me it doesn’t?

                                 DAVINCI
                        It buys you freedom. There’s a 
                        difference.
           INT. ART’S CROWN VIC - NIGHT

           Art, wearing a White Sox cap, rolls with Casey, Don, and big 
           Joey. Don reads a military mag.

                                 DON
                        Every marine in boot camp does a 
                        thousand pushups a day.

           Casey salutes this news with a deep hit off a joint.

                                 JOEY
                        That’s nine-hundred ninety-eight 
                        more than my personal best.

           At a red light, a COP CRUISER pulls up beside them.

                                 ART
                        Kill that J.

           Casey turns red trying to hold in the smoke from his hit.

           Art glances over and sees a HOT GIRL in the back seat of the 
           cruiser. KAREN MAGERS, 22. Short black hair, creamy skin, big 
           eyes. She smiles at Art -- and that’s all she wrote.

           The LIGHT TURNS GREEN. The cop car turns left. Art cuts 
           across a lane of traffic to follow it.

                                 DON
                        What are you doin’?

           Casey drops to the floor and hacks out his smoke.

                                 ART
                        Did you see that girl, Joey?

                                 JOEY
                        The one in the back seat of a 
                        fuckin’ cop car?

                                 CASEY
                        Pull him over, Homes!

           The cop cruiser turns into a convenience store parking lot. 
           Art pulls hard to the curb... cutting off a MUSCLE CAR, which 
           blasts its horn, then pulls in right behind him.

           Art jumps out. ART’S POV: A cop opens the cruiser’s back door 
           and lets Karen out. She starts walking away.

           TWO TOUGH ITALIANS jump out of the muscle car.

                                 CASEY
                        We got this, Homes. Go get her.

           As Art takes off after Karen...
                                 TOUGH GUY
                        What the fuck?

           Both TOUGH GUYS start toward Casey... until 300-pound Joey 
           steps out of the car. No thanks. They retreat. Casey pounds 
           the hood of their car as they drive away.

                                 CASEY
                        That’s the fuck, Homes.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Art sees Karen at a BRAT STAND. He takes off his White Sox 
           cap. As he reaches the stand, she’s laying down a TWENTY. He 
           lays one down beside hers. 

                                 ART
                            (to the BRAT GUY)
                        I got that.

                                 KAREN
                        No he doesn’t. Sorry. Not from a 
                        stranger.

           Art puts on the White Sox cap. She smiles, recognizing him.

                                 KAREN
                        Mister Crown Vic.

           The JADED BRAT GUY eyes the side-by-side twenties.

                                 BRAT GUY
                        I’m dyin’ here.

           Karen points to Art’s twenty.

           EXT. BRAT STAND - NIGHT

           Art and Karen stand at the counter, four empty beer bottles 
           in front of them. A STREET GUITARIST plays something bluesy.

                                 KAREN
                        You haven’t asked me what I was 
                        doing in the back of a cop car.

                                 ART
                        Hey, I know that drill. They drive 
                        you around the block, talk tough, 
                        warn ya, then let you go.
                            (sees her laughing)
                        What?

                                 KAREN
                        It’s called a ride-along, dummy. 
                        I’m in the police academy.
                            (Art’s in shock)
                        Want your money back?
           INT. DAVINCI’S DUNGEON - DAY

           A stoked Art watches his first batch of sheets roll off the 
           press. DaVinci sits on the barstool, puffing his short cigar.

           Art cuts the notes to size on a paper-cutter... sprays 
           acrylic glue onto the note-front... presses the note-front 
           and note-back together.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        She tells me flat out she’s a cop -- 
                        and all I wanted to do was make 
                        enough money to take her out.

           Rows of TWENTIES dry on a rack, each clipped to a taut line 
           of fishing wire. A glowing space heater speeds the process.

           Art, proud as hell, unclips a BILL and hands it to DaVinci.

           DaVinci snaps the bill AND IT PEELS APART. Art can’t believe 
           it. Back to the drawing board.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           Art hands another bill to DaVinci, who lays it under a lamp. 
           He points to the muddy, blurry FEDERAL SEAL. He touches his 
           cigar to the bill, burning it to ashes.

           EXT. CHICAGO RIVER WALKWAY - SUNSET

           Art and Karen walk across the Clark Street footbridge. They 
           step to the rail and watch the red sun sink into the water.

           Art carries a beer in a paper bag. He opens it and offers 
           Karen a sip. She hesitates.

                                 ART
                        Live a little. You’re not a cop 
                        yet.

           She laughs and takes a small sip.

                                 ART
                        What made you want to become one, 
                        anyway?

           She’s about to tell him, but stops herself.

                                 KAREN
                        It’s silly.

                                 ART
                        Tell me.
                                 KAREN
                        Something my Dad said to me once. 
                        “If you want to make the world a 
                        better place, start with your own 
                        block.”

           Art tucks a strand of her hair behind her ear. He kisses her.

           INT. ART’S CROWN VIC - NIGHT

           Art and Karen are parked by Lake Michigan. They’re hot and 
           heavy in the front seat as U2 plays on the radio. Art goes 
           for her jeans. She stones him.

                                 KAREN
                        I want it to be special. Don’t you?

           INT. DAVINCI’S DUNGEON - NIGHT

           Art hands DaVinci yet another bill. He snaps it -- fine. 
           Studies it under the lamp -- fine. Art’s eyes are shining.

                                 DAVINCI
                        One last test.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Art and DaVinci step outside.

                                 DAVINCI
                        Sunlight is the only true light. If 
                        a bill looks good in the sun, it’ll 
                        look good anywhere.

           Art holds up his bill. Shit. His great creation looks like 
           crap, its color dull and lifeless.

           Art rips it to pieces. He stares down slaughterhouse row.

           EXT. POLICE ACADEMY - DAY

           Karen walks down the steps of the police academy building. 
           She’s surprised to see Art’s Crown Vic at the curb.

                                 ART
                        Come on.

           She climbs in.

                                 KAREN
                        Where are we going?

                                 ART
                        Someplace special.
           EXT. PENINSULA HOTEL - DAY

           Art pulls up to the five-star Peninsula Hotel. A natty VALET 
           opens the door for a bewildered Karen.

                                 KAREN
                        Art?

                                 ART
                        Not too shabby, huh?

           Art walks her into...

           INT. PENINSULA HOTEL - DAY

           The gorgeous lobby. Karen looks around, awestruck.

           INT. ELEVATOR

           The two of them ride alone. Art hits the button for the 
           eighth floor.

                                 ART
                        Check-out time is noon, right?

           He checks his watch: 12:15.

                                 ART
                        Check-in time is three...

           The elevator doors open, revealing...

           A MEXICAN MAID, standing with her cleaning cart by a hotel 
           room door. She smiles at Art -- she’s been expecting him.

                                 ART
                        Leaving a nice little window for a 
                        maid to turn a profit.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Art and Karen walk in. Plush carpeting. Lake Michigan out the 
           window. King-size bed. Karen is in heaven.

                                 ART
                        Special enough for you?

           He lays her down on the bed.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

           The maid walks away, tucking fifty bucks into her uniform.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Karen lies in bed, silk sheets pulled up. Dreamy and sated. 

           Art stands at the window in his boxers. This high up, he can 
           see for miles. Lake Michigan and beyond.

                                 ART
                        There’s a whole big world out 
                        there. I’m gonna give it to you.

                                 KAREN
                        I like the world in here. We still 
                        have twenty minutes.

           INT. WAREHOUSE SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY

           Art and DaVinci ride up. A steely, hard-won confidence in 
           Art’s eyes.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           They step out into the sun. Art holds his latest bill up to 
           the light. It’s perfect.

           He’s done it. He hugs DaVinci. Awkwardly, then tight.

           INT. DAVINCI’S DUNGEON - MINUTES LATER

           A jubilant Art pulls COUNTERFEIT TWENTIES off the drying rack 
           and piles them on a table.

                                 ART
                        Let’s go spend these babies.

                                 DAVINCI
                        Whoa.

           DaVinci opens a LOCKBOX and takes out a stack of cash. He 
           hands it to Art.

                                 DAVINCI
                        I’ll pay you two grand per print 
                        run.

           He hands Art a KEY TO THE DUNGEON. Art waves at all the 
           counterfeit bills.

                                 ART
                        But what about?...

                                 DAVINCI
                        I still got all my limbs for one 
                        reason: I never pass my bills on 
                        the street.
                                 ART
                        What do you do with them?

           A beat. DaVinci stares hard at Art.

                                 DAVINCI
                        I sell ‘em in bulk. Gimme a hand 
                        here.

           DaVinci shows Art how to shrink-wrap stacks of counterfeit 
           bills. They work side-by-side.

                                 DAVINCI
                        I drive to Cincinnati every three 
                        months. Stolin’s got a connection 
                        there. He pays me twenty cents on 
                        the dollar.

           Art’s not impressed.

                                 ART
                        Twenty cents?

                                 DAVINCI
                        It adds up.

           They keep shrink-wrapping. Art stares at his two-grand cut... 
           then at the mountains of counterfeit bills. Frustration in 
           his eyes.

           EXT. TAYLOR STREET - NIGHT

           Art and DaVinci walk together.

                                 DAVINCI
                        I cut Stolin in for his ten 
                        percent, and I live my life.

           DaVinci leads Art into...

           INT. BEAUX ARTS CAFE - NIGHT

           A hip little consignment cafe. Three of DaVinci’s CHARCOAL 
           STREET SKETCHES hang on the wall.

           DaVinci stares glumly at the painting beside them, an 
           indecipherable mess of lines boasting a “SOLD” STICKER.

                                 DAVINCI
                        You believe someone paid money for 
                        that shit?

           They take a seat. DaVinci signals a WAITRESS. Art’s itching 
           to say something.

                                 DAVINCI
                        What?
                                 ART
                        I don’t get it. You could buy any 
                        painting you want. You could buy a 
                        house in Oak Park. Two Ferraris. 
                        You can print more money than God.
                            (beat)
                        But you don’t have the guts to 
                        spend it.

           There -- it’s out. The waitress arrives. DaVinci waves her 
           off. He’s pissed now. A beat.

                                 DAVINCI
                        You’re right, Art -- you don’t get 
                        it. It’s not about guts. It’s about 
                        smarts.

           INT. KAREN’S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           Art and Karen, both nervous as hell, sit at the kitchen 
           table. An UPSIDE-DOWN BOWL sits between them. U2 plays from a 
           boombox -- Bono is going to get them through this. Art takes 
           Karen’s hand. She reaches for the bowl.

                                 ART
                        Wait... Marry me.

                                 KAREN
                        What? You don’t mean it.

           Art slips a RING BOX in front of her. She opens it -- A RING. 
           Karen can’t believe it.

                                 KAREN
                        Yes.

           They laugh. Then get serious again. Eyes back on the BOWL.

                                 ART
                        What are we looking for?

                                 KAREN
                        Blue.

           Art lifts up the bowl. A PREGNANCY INDICATOR lies on a paper 
           towel. They stare into its window: A DARK BLUE LINE.

           Karen stares at the BLUE LINE... at Art... at her ring. 
           Engaged. Pregnant. All in 30 seconds.

                        I’m gonna faint.

           EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

           Art and Karen, newly married, rush down the steps and climb 
           into Art’s Crown Vic.
           INT. CROWN VIC - DAY: DRIVING

           Don serves as chauffeur. Casey rides shotgun.

                                 CASEY
                        There’s a case of Busch in the 
                        trunk. From all of us.

                                 DON
                        Some wedding night, huh? You don’t 
                        gotta worry about protection...
                            (Art and Karen stare)
                        I mean, since you guys already took 
                        care of that part... by, y’know...

                                 KAREN
                        Shut up, Don.

                                 DON
                        Yes Ma’am.

           EXT. PENINSULA HOTEL - NIGHT

           Don pulls up to the awning. Karen’s face lights up -- they’re 
           back where it all began.

                                 KAREN
                        Art. It’s too expensive.

                                 ART
                        What the hell, huh?

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           The wedding dress is thrown over a chair. Art and Karen are 
           in bed, face to face. On the brink. 

                                 ART
                        This time we got all night.

           INT. ART’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Karen feeds one-year-old Mikey in his high chair. He wears a 
           Chicago White Sox onesie.

           Karen slides a POLICE MANUAL across the table to Art.

                                 KAREN
                        Quiz me?

           Art opens to a random page and reads.

                                 ART
                        You observe a motorist driving

                        A: Call in his license plate... B: 
                        Approach the driver’s-side 
                        window... C: Blow the jagoff’s 
                        brains out.

                                 KAREN
                            (laughing)
                        Art... this is serious.

           Art nods at Mikey.

                                 ART
                        Mom’s gonna watch him tonight.

                                 KAREN
                        Three hours alone together. Can you 
                        believe it?

                                 ART
                            (to Mikey)
                        You know what your mom and I are 
                        gonna do tonight?

           Art whispers into Mikey’s ear. Under the table, he tickles 
           Mikey’s foot. Mikey laughs, seemingly at Art’s words.

                                 ART
                        That’s right. Hey, how do you think 
                        you got here, buddy?

           Karen laughs. Love in the room. The phone rings. Art answers.

                                 ART
                        Hello? What’s wrong, Mom? Slow 
                        down.

           INT. CLAIRE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Art rushes into the kitchen to see...

           Claire sitting on the floor, her back against the fridge, 
           staring blankly. She’s all cried out. Off the wagon, too, 
           judging from the empty glass in her hand and the gin bottle 
           on the table.

           Art kneels and holds her. She starts to cry again.

           INT. ALL SOULS’ FUNERAL HOME - DAY

           DaVinci lies in state in his coffin. He wears his beanie and 
           looks dapper, even in death.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        He was shot in a Cincinnati motel 
                        room. No suspects.

           Art, devastated, looks down at him. He lays one of DaVinci’s 
           CHARCOAL STREET SKETCHES beside him.
           Art watches the Bent-Elbow crowd mill around the parlor. He 
           STARES BULLETS AT STOLIN.

           Romo notices.

                                 ROMO
                        Good of him to pay for the wake, 
                        huh?

           LATER

           Art watches Stolin approach Claire at the bar. By the time 
           Art gets there, he has an arm around her.

                                 STOLIN
                        I know this is a tough time. If I 
                        can help in any way...

           He opens his suit jacket, revealing a FAT CASH ENVELOPE. 
           Claire can’t help reaching for it. Stolin closes his jacket.

                                 STOLIN
                        ... just come by the bar.

           Art grabs Claire and leads her away. Stolin smiles at him.

                                 STOLIN
                        Keeping out of trouble, boy?

           EXT. CLAIRE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Art drinks a beer on the steps. He looks up the block to see 
           Claire walk out of the Bent Elbow. She’s smoothing her hair 
           and blouse.

           Art puts two and two together. Pain and anger in his eyes.

           Claire sees him as she crosses the street. They stare at each 
           other. She flushes with shame.

           INT. ART & KAREN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Art walks in, spent. He’s holding a box of DaVinci’s charcoal 
           street sketches.

           Karen hands him a beer.

                                 ART
                        Thanks.

           Art sits down and starts sifting through the sketches.

           Karen watches him from the couch, where she’s rocking Mikey 
           to sleep. She lays him down and walks to Art. She doesn’t 
           want to say what she’s about to say.
                                 KAREN
                        Art, I ran a check at the station. 
                        DaVinci served two years in prison. 
                        For forgery and embezzlement.

                                 ART
                        Everybody makes mistakes.

                                 KAREN
                        He was murdered in a motel room. 
                        That’s a pretty big mistake.

                                 ART
                        What do you want from me, Karen? 
                        The guy taught me a lot.

                                 KAREN
                        About what?

                                 ART
                        Life. Okay?
                            (beat)
                        You gotta pick tonight to do this?

                                 KAREN
                        I’m sorry, Art. But the extra money 
                        you bring in sometimes... I know 
                        you’re not mowing lawns for it. 
                        That has to end.

                                 ART
                        Or what?

                                 KAREN
                        Or we’ll be on different sides.

           Art starts to pace. They can hear the neighbor’s TV through 
           the wall. WHEEL OF FORTUNE -- Pat Sajak thanking Vanna White.

                                 ART
                        You want Mikey growing up in this 
                        dump?

                                 KAREN
                        I don’t want to get the call Claire 
                        got. That you’re dead in some 
                        motel.
                            (Beat)
                        You know what it’s like to grow up 
                        without a father.

                                 ART
                        That was different. He ran off. I’d 
                        never do that to Mikey.
                            (beat)
                        But he... both of you... deserve 
                        better than this.

           Art KICKS THE RADIATOR. It hisses reluctantly to life.
                                 KAREN
                        C’mere.

           He kneels in front of her. She rubs his head.

                                 KAREN
                        I don’t care how much money we 
                        have. You know why? Because 
                        everything I need is in this room.

           She takes Art’s hand and leads him to the couch. They look 
           down at Mikey, sleeping like an angel.

                                 KAREN
                        Promise me he’ll have an honest 
                        father.

           EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

           Art pulls into a small, grim gas station. Four lonely pumps 
           and a one-man payment booth.

           GUS, 55, stands by the booth.

                                 GUS
                        You’re three minutes late.

                                 ART
                        I was talking to my broker.

           Humor isn’t Gus’ strong suit. He tosses Art a rag.

           INT. ART’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Art walks in, still wearing his coveralls. Bumming. He turns 
           on the light to see...

           Karen on the couch, holding two beers. Proud of him. Wearing 
           a soft teddy. She smiles.

                                 KAREN
                        Guess who’s asleep?

           INT. POLICE ACADEMY - DAY

           Art holds little Mikey and watches Karen cross the stage to 
           accept her BADGE. Art looks around nervously -- too many cops 
           here for his taste.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        At least one of us was happy.
           GAS STATION MONTAGE

           Art scrapes ice off a TRUCKER’S windshield... busts a knuckle 
           on a lug nut... shivers on a ladder in the rain as he changes 
           the digits on the gas price sign.

           Art stares at his PAYCHECK: $212.50.

           EXT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE ROW - DAWN

           Art sits in his car in the pre-dawn light, staring at 
           DaVinci’s warehouse.

           INT. ART’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Art lays two-year-old Mikey on the changing table. Mikey 
           points at the toothpick in Art’s mouth. Art holds it between 
           Mikey’s lips. Like father, like son.

           In the b.g., LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS plays on the 
           TV. Multimillion-dollar homes and sparkling yachts.

           Suddenly a table leg SNAPS and the changing table collapses. 
           Art catches Mikey by the ankle. He kicks the table in anger.

                                 ART
                        Cheap piece of...
                            (gathering himself)
                        How ‘bout some baseball?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Art and Mikey sit on the floor. Art sips a beer. NINE WHITE 
           SOX BASEBALL CARDS are laid out, arranged by position.

                                 ART
                        Okay. Where’s Ozzie Guillen?

           Mikey picks out the card of the White Sox shortstop.

                                 ART
                        Thattaboy.
                            (Mikey chews the card)
                        Hey, you’re eating an All-Star.

           Art stares through the open bedroom door at the broken 
           changing table. He’s still shaken.

           INT. GAS STATION PAYMENT BOOTH - NIGHT

           Art sits alone, smoking a cigarette and listening to the 
           Bulls’ game on the radio. SFX: A CAR HORN BLAST.

           A shiny RED CORVETTE sits at the full-service pump.
           Art walks over. The HOT SHOT DRIVER is digging a hand between 
           the knees of a TRIM BLONDE. He doesn’t even look at Art.

                                 HOT SHOT
                        Fill ‘er up.

           Art pumps gas, admiring the car’s sleek body and gleaming 
           rims. He runs his fingers along the raised emblem.

                                 HOT SHOT
                        Watch that.

                                 ART
                        V-six?

                                 HOT SHOT
                            (indulgently)
                        Yeah -- V-six. Three-point-eight 
                        liter. Turbo. You gonna pull a 
                        little overtime and buy one?

           His babe can’t stifle a laugh. Anger flashes in Art’s eyes. 
           He jams the pump back into the stand.

                                 ART
                        Twelve forty-five.

                                 HOT SHOT
                        Tell you what -- I’ll show you her 
                        zero-to-sixty.

           Hot Shot floors it, tossing a TWENTY out the window as he 
           peels away. The bill lands in a frozen grease puddle.

           Art stares after the Corvette, furious and humiliated.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        Every guy’s got his breaking point.

           INT. DAVINCI’S DUNGEON - NIGHT

           Art pushes open the door and stares at DaVinci’s equipment. 
           It’s all there.

           He washes his hands and changes into coveralls. He steps to 
           the work table and lays down a CRISP TWENTY. He stares at it, 
           then shoves it back in his pocket and lays down a pristine 
           HUNDRED-DOLLAR BILL.

           BEN FRANKLIN smiles up at him. Your move, Ace.

           Art turns his back on the table. He squats. Takes a breath. 
           Can he really do this?

           He walks to his boombox and presses the button. Classical? No 
           chance. PINK FLOYD’S “MONEY.”
           The killer guitar riff rocks the room, giving Art the kick he 
           needs. He picks up the process camera and points her straight 
           down at Old Ben. FLASH!

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           Art, laying his first FAKE C-NOTE beside the real one. It’s a 
           joke -- Art’s bill isn’t even green. It’s a sickly purple.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           Art laying down another FAKE. Better, but still a long way 
           off. Ben Franklin looks like a bloated balloon.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAWN

           A bleary-eyed Art walks to his car in the snow.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        I started closing up the gas 
                        station two hours early. Since 
                        Karen didn’t wake up ‘til seven, 
                        that gave me six hours a night.

           INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT

           INTERCUT between Art mixing inks, making plates, masking out 
           serial numbers -- and DISSOLVE SHOTS of FAKE BILLS laid 
           beside the original C-Note.

           Each bill is a little better than the last - the color 
           richer, the details crisper, the definition sharper.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        DaVinci settled for twenty percent 
                        of the dream.
                            (beat)
                        I wanted it all.

           INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT

           Art puts the finishing touches on a FAKE NOTE. This one’s 
           special.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        That meant my bills had to be 
                        perfect.

           He lays the fake beside a real one. Identical. He breaks out 
           a magnifying glass and goes over it inch by inch. The colors, 
           the portrait, the seals -- perfect.

           He shuffles the bills, then lays them down. He can’t tell 
           which is which.
           EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAWN

           It’s SPRING NOW -- the snow gone, green leaves on the trees. 
           Art holds up the C-Note. It passes the sun test. Art drops to 
           his knees -- he’s done it.

           INT. ART’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Art lies in bed, one eye open, watching Karen put on her 
           uniform. She grabs her POLICE RADIO... HER BADGE... HER GUN.

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

           Art sits in his car, holding his fake C-Note in his lap. He 
           hears his old mentor’s voice in his head.

                                 DAVINCI (V.O.)
                        If you ever want to cut your own 
                        throat, try passing a counterfeit 
                        bill to an Arab.

           Art stares through the liquor store window at the ARAB CLERK.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

           Art carries a case of Busch to the counter.

           CLOSE ON THE FAKE C-NOTE as Art hands it over. The clerk 
           holds it up to the light. A beat. He glares at Art.

                                 CLERK
                        What do I look like?
                            (beat)
                        ID.

           A relieved Art shows him his driver’s license. The clerk bags 
           the beer. As Art heads for the door...

                                 CLERK
                        Hey!

           Art turns. The clerk is holding out his change. Change! Free 
           money. What a concept.

           EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN - NIGHT

           Art sits on the hood of his car, his back to the dark lake. 
           Chicago’s skyline glitters in front of him. Waiting.
           INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT

           Art blacks out serial numbers... pulls fresh sheets of C-
           Notes off the press... hits bills with hardening spray.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        Karen thought I was making ten 
                        bucks an hour. I was printing 
                        twenty grand a night.

           Art’s beautiful fakes dry all around him. Art stares at a CAR 
           MAGAZINE. ON PAGE: A fire-red Trans Am rules the road.

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Art’s Crown Vic pulls up to a WALMART.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        Then came the tough part. Grinding. 
                        Turning counterfeit dollars into 
                        true, honest green.

           INT. WALMART - NIGHT

           Art pushes a cart down the baby aisle. But wait -- is it Art? 
           He wears thick glasses, slicked-back hair, and a goatee.

           CHECKOUT COUNTER

           Art in line. There’s a DIAPER-CHANGING TABLE (the sturdy, 
           steel kind) in his cart.

                                 GRIZZLED CLERK
                        Next.

           Art lets the OLD WOMAN behind him go ahead. Art wants the 
           other clerk, a TEENAGE GIRL. She frees up.

           As she rings up his purchase...

                                 ART
                        Cool earrings.

                                 TEEN CLERK
                            (giggling)
                        That’ll be forty-two thirty-nine.

           Still blushing, she banks the C-Note without looking at it.

           CLOSE ON the CRISP TWENTIES as she slaps them down.

                                 TEEN CLERK
                        Fifty-seven sixty-one is your 
                        change. Have a good night.
           INT. ART’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Art changes into his gas station coveralls. Karen, playing 
           with Mikey, looks over and smiles.

           INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT

           Art tosses down his coveralls and changes into a sharp suit.

           “GRINDING” MONTAGE

           DISSOLVE SHOTS of stores throughout the city. Bodegas... 
           liquor stores... greasy spoon restaurants... 7-11s...

           DISSOLVE SHOTS of ART in different disguises, passing his C-
           Notes. He’s a SUAVE GENT in Armani... a CONSTRUCTION WORKER 
           in hardhat and boots... a BIKER in black leather riding pants 
           and wife-beater, press-on snake tattoos on each shoulder...

           INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT

           Art at his MONEY TABLE, counting out a mountain of cash.

           INT. CAR SHOWROOM - DAY

           Art walks a slow circle around a FIRE RED TRANS AM. A DOUR 
           SALESMAN comes up.

                                 SALESMAN
                        I ran your credit. It’s not gonna 
                        cut it.

           Art pulls out a silver money clip.

                                 ART
                        Fuck my credit.

           EXT. PEBBLE BEACH - DAY

           Art pulls up in his Trans Am, kickass stereo blaring. Casey, 
           Don, and Joey lounge on folding chairs, drinking beers. They 
           jump up to check out Art’s new wheels.

                                 ART
                        C’mon, Jagoffs. Tonight’s on me.

           INT. TRANS AM - NIGHT: DRIVING

           Art opens her up. Doing eighty, nice and easy.
                                 JOEY
                        The payments gotta be killin’ you.

           EXT. COMISKEY PARK CONCOURSE - NIGHT

           Art leads his buddies to the door of a luxury skybox. The 
           USHER looks them over -- no way these bums can afford this.

                                 USHER
                        I don’t think so, guys.

                                 ART
                        There goes your tip.

           Art flashes his tickets and leads the guys in. The skybox is 
           plush and roomy. Art smiles at a HOT WAITRESS.

                                 ART
                        How ‘bout four beers? And eight hot 
                        dogs.

                                 JOEY
                        What are you guys gonna eat?

           She smiles and leaves. The guys look around in awe.

                                 ART
                        Not bad, huh?

                                 DON
                        This has gotta be runnin’ you three 
                        bills. Just for the tickets.

                                 CASEY
                        You got something goin’ we don’t 
                        know about, Homes?

                                 ART
                        Yeah.
                            (the guys lean in)
                        I put a grand on Thunder Gulch in 
                        the Derby. She came in six-to-one.

           A FOUL BALL heads toward the skybox.

                                 DON
                        I got it! I got it!

           Don leans too far out and starts to fall. Art and Joey grab 
           his ankles and pull him back in. The guys crack up. They’re 
           having a ball.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

           Casey, Don, and Joey sit on a girder. Smoke break. Casey 
           looks hard at the others.
                                 CASEY
                        Derby winner my ass.

           EXT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE ROW - NIGHT

           Art pulls up in the Trans Am and gets out. A POLICE SIREN 
           blares. Art jumps back in. Too late -- a cop cruiser slams 
           up. Art is dead meat. Until he sees...

           HIS BUDDIES. The cop cruiser is actually Casey’s Grand Am, 
           with the trusty police siren mounted on top.

           Casey, Don, and Joey get out and stare bullets at Art. He 
           sighs, beaten.

                                 ART
                        If you guys tell a fuckin’ soul...

           INT. WAREHOUSE SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           The four of them ride down.

                                 CASEY
                        Case of beer says it’s a crystal 
                        meth lab.

                                 DON
                        It’s a harem.

                                 JOEY
                        What the fuck’s a harem?

                                 DON
                        Sex slaves.

           INT. WAREHOUSE BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Art opens the door and hits the lights. The guys walk in. 
           Art’s equipment lines the walls, but all they see is a TABLE 
           PILED HIGH WITH CASH. They walk to it, awestruck.

                                 CASEY
                        Homes.

           Don checks out the printing press. Looks around at the setup.

                                 DON
                        Semper fuckin’ Fi. Counterfeit?

           Art nods. Casey is transfixed by the bills.

                                 JOEY
                        You mean this money ain’t real?

                                 CASEY
                        The fuck it ain’t. Is it?
                                 ART
                        Paper and ink.

           The guys stare at the bills, the full measure of their 
           buddy’s achievement sinking in.

           Art soaks in their awe. He’s waited all his life for this 
           much validation.

           Don starts playing with the stacks of counterfeit.

                                 DON
                        You can buy anything you want, 
                        Artie. Anything. Damn.
                            (beat)
                        I’d get a penthouse pad on Rush 
                        Street. Put a hot tub out on the 
                        balcony. Just sit in that thing, 
                        all day and all night.

           Joey starts handling the stacks.

                                 JOEY
                        I’d buy the Hungry Hound beef 
                        stand. Put my picture right on the 
                        front.

                                 CASEY
                        I’d get a live-in nurse for Ma.
                            (beat)
                        And a fuckin’ harem.

           Everyone laughs.

                                 ART
                        It’s not that simple. You can’t 
                        just take this stuff to the bank. 
                        You gotta be real careful with it.

                                 CASEY
                        Show us, Homes.

                                 DON
                        Yeah, Artie. Let us spend some.

                                 JOEY
                        We’d do it for you.

           A beat. Art’s head and his heart are battling it out.

                                 ART
                        One fuckin’ night only. I mean it. 
                        And you guys are gonna earn your 
                        keep.
                            (he tosses them each a 
                             stack of C-Notes)
                        Counterfeit in your left pocket. 
                        Real money in your right.
                        You spend it where I tell you. 
                        Nowhere else. Got it?
           They got it. And man, they’re stoked.

           As Art leads them out of the room, Don hangs back and GRABS 
           AN EXTRA STACK OF COUNTERFEIT. He shoves it into his pocket.

           EXT. RUSH STREET - NIGHT

           Chicago’s famous party strip pulses with Friday-night energy.

           Art and the guys, walking like playas, cross the street 
           towards P.S. CHICAGO, a hip nightclub. A huge line snakes 
           down the block. Thirty-minute wait, minimum.

           Screw that. Art heads right for the door.

           The BOUNCER nods at the long line.

                                 BOUNCER
                        You got eyes?

                                 ART
                        Yeah. You?

           Art flashes a FAKE C-NOTE. The bouncer palms it and lifts the 
           rope, wincing at their cheap sneaks and blue-collar duds.

           INT. P.S. CHICAGO - NIGHT

           A killer playland the size of an aircraft hangar. Art stares 
           in awe at all the BABES. They line the bar, rock the dance 
           floor, grace the booths.

                                 CASEY
                        Last one to score buys breakfast.

           Casey and Joey head for the bar. Art taps Don and points to a 
           sweet PAIR OF HOTTIES -- one REDHEAD, one INDIAN -- sitting 
           alone in a booth. Don is flustered, nervous.

                                 DON
                        Artie, I can’t talk to those girls. 
                        Look at ‘em.

                                 ART
                        Yesterday you couldn’t. Today...
                            (he flags a waitress)
                        Send them a bottle of Dom.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Dom? Dom Perignon? It’s three 
                        hundred dollars a bottle.

                                 ART
                        Is it? In that case, send two.
           AT THE BAR

           Casey walks up as three BABES finish off their frozen 
           margaritas. The STUD BARTENDER smiles at them.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Another round?

                                 CASEY
                        It’s on me. But make it with that.

           Casey points to a bottle of PATRON GOLD sitting alone on the 
           top shelf.

                                 BARTENDER
                        It’s gonna cost you.

           Casey drops one, two, three C-NOTES onto the bar.

                                 CASEY
                        Start blending, Homes.
                            (to the Babes)
                        Casey. With a “C.”

           DOWN THE BAR, Joey stands with a CHUNKY LATINA. A bartender 
           sets down two AMSTEL LIGHTS.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Sixteen dollars.

                                 JOEY
                        For two fuckin’ beers? What are we, 
                        on Mars?
                            (to the girl)
                        You like soda?

           INT. ART’S BOOTH - LATER

           Art sits with VAI, the Indian girl, and Don with the redhead 
           HOLLY. The Perignon has worked its usual magic -- these girls 
           are tipsy and smitten.

                                 HOLLY
                        So, what do you guys do?

                                 DON
                        Make money.

                                 ART
                            (shooting Don a look)
                        I work for a printer.

                                 VAI
                        Do you like it? Or do you just do 
                        it for the money?

           Art and Don laugh. Vai is mystified.
                                 ART
                        Both.

           Don, drunk now, can’t contain himself. He lays a C-NOTE on 
           the table.

                                 DON
                        Check this out--

           Art snatches the C-Note, pissed. He calms. He pats Don’s 
           Marine Corps sweatshirt and looks at Holly.

                                 ART
                        Ignore him. He leaves for Basic in 
                        a week -- unless someone can change 
                        his mind.

           Holly’s up for trying. She leads Don onto the dance floor.

           ART’S POV: Casey at the bar, buying another round for his 
           babes and pocketing the change... Joey, kissing his chunky 
           honey while flashing twenties at Art. 

           Art’s the Godfather of good times... but he can’t get over 
           Don’s gaffe. He stares hard at him.

           Don, oblivious, squeezes Holly’s ass as they slow dance.

           Vai rubs Art’s leg.

                                 VAI
                        This is when you say “Your place or 
                        mine?”
                            (fingers his ring)
                        Looks like mine.

           INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Art lies on his back, naked. She rides him slow and hard... 
           finishes... and collapses onto his chest.

           Art lifts her chin and we see -- it’s Karen. Art is home, in 
           his marriage bed. Karen is breathless, radiant.

                                 KAREN
                        What’s gotten into you?

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           CLOSE ON the FACE of singer BOB MARLEY. He’s a SCREENSAVER, 
           staring out from a computer monitor.

           NINA KIMM, 29, half-Asian, pretty, sits at her desk, sipping 
           Starbucks and examining a C-NOTE under a magnifying glass.

           We’re in a cubicle at the SECRET SERVICE’S bustling Chicago 
           field office.
           Nina lowers the glass, impressed. She nods at Bob Marley.

                                 NINA
                        Kid’s got game.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Nina fiddles with a laptop, which is projecting an IMAGE OF 
           THE C-NOTE onto a flat-panel screen.

           DALE JERROD, 45, Nina’s boss, strides in. He’s a gruff Cajun 
           with long hair and alligator boots.

                                 DALE
                        New printer on the streets?

                                 NINA
                        Yeah. A batch of these just hit the 
                        banks. I checked with C.I.D. -- no 
                        match on record.

                                 DALE
                        Source?

                                 NINA
                        Nightclubs and strip bars.

                                 DALE
                        My kinda counterfeiter.

           ON SCREEN: Nina zeroes in on different sections of the C-
           Note: SEAL... PORTRAIT... DIGITS. All flawless.

                                 DALE
                        A pro.

           Dale takes the mouse and zeroes in on the bottom left corner 
           of the C-Note. There’s a SMALL DIAGONAL SLASH.

                                 NINA
                        Yeah, the slash. It’s on every one.

                                 DALE
                        Which tells you...

                                 NINA
                        It’s on the plates.

                                 DALE
                        Which tells you...

                                 NINA
                            (struggling)
                        He’s sloppy. Except he isn’t. So... 
                        he put it there on purpose...
                            (truth dawning)
                        ... so he can tell his fake bills 
                        from his real ones.
                                 DALE
                        Which tells you...
                            (she’s at a loss)
                        We better nail this jagoff before 
                        he figures out how good he is and 
                        starts aiming higher than strip 
                        clubs.

                                 NINA
                        Yes sir.

           She walks away. Dale stares at her crisp ass. What a waste.

           INT. CROWN VIC - DAY: DRIVING

           Art in the driver’s seat, Karen beside him. Suburbia out the 
           window.

                                 ART
                        Where the hell is this place?

                                 KAREN
                        Elgin. We’re almost there.

           EXT. SMALL-TOWN MALL - DAY

           The Crown Vic pulls into the mall parking lot.

           INT. MALL - DAY

           Art and Karen walk in, pushing Mikey in a stroller.

                                 KAREN
                        Mervyn’s is having a half-off sale. 
                        We can get Mikey a year’s worth of 
                        clothes. Stuff he can grow into.

           Art stops. Karen is still talking, but he can’t hear her.

           ART’S POV: A SEA OF STORES stretch in every direction... ONE 
           PODUNK SECURITY GUARD sips a Big Gulp... EXIT SIGNS (ESCAPE 
           ROUTES) IN EVERY CORNER. It’s a grinder’s paradise.

                                 KAREN (O.S)
                        Art?

                                 ART
                        Right. Half off.

           INT. BENT ELBOW - DAY

           Don drinks at the bar, which is lined with CHICAGO BEARS 
           FANS. All are nervously watching the TV as...
           ON TV: The OPPOSING KICKER drills a GAME-WINNING FIELD GOAL 
           and leaps into the arms of his teammates.

           Don kicks the bar in disgust. Romo walks over.

                                 ROMO
                        Five hundred.

           Don sighs and pays him off.

           INT. SECRET SERVICE FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           Nina Kimm at her desk. Dale Jerrod stands behind her chair. 
           He can see the RED BRA beneath her open-necked blouse. Jesus.

                                 NINA
                        Our boy Slash has graduated to 
                        malls. Check out his targets.

           ON COMPUTER SCREEN: A MAP of Chicago-area MALLS. Nina clicks 
           her mouse and three of them GLOW RED.

                                 DALE
                        Small-town oldies. No cameras.

                                 NINA
                        He hits them on the weekends. The 
                        bills don’t wash up till Monday.

           Dale stares at Nina. She’s on the spot. She types in a 
           command. Two more MALLS pop up on-screen.

                                 NINA
                        He’s been working west of the city. 
                        I figure these two fit his profile.

                                 DALE
                        There goes your hot weekend.
                            (walking away)
                        This guy’s only gonna give you one 
                        shot. Don’t miss him.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           A COP PICNIC. Art plays football with Karen’s FELLOW 
           OFFICERS. He hauls in a pass and outruns two cops to paydirt.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        I had two lives going. It was 
                        crazy.

           A COP collects money in a ballcap.

                                 COP
                        Beer run. Don’t be shy.

           Art sticks in TWO TWENTIES. Karen watches, eyes narrowing.
           INT. ART’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Art and Mikey watch from the window as Karen drives away.

                                 ART
                        Ready for some fun?

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           Art belts Mikey into a car seat in the NEW TRANS AM... plays 
           videogames with him at CHUCK E. CHEESE... treats him to a 
           White Sox game at Comiskey.

           INT. GARAGE - DUSK

           Art lifts Mikey out of the car seat. They high-five.

                                 ART
                        I’d call that a hell of a day.

           INT. ART’S APT. - DUSK

           Art, wearing his grease monkey coveralls, kisses Karen 
           goodbye and walks out the door. She walks to the window. 

           KAREN’S POV: Art walking jauntily to the car, all smiles. 
           This is a guy headed for a night shift at a gas station?

           INT. CHICAGO BULLS ARENA - NIGHT

           Art and his buddies sit court-side, watching JORDAN DUNK.

           INTERCUTTING BETWEEN ART AND KAREN

           Art and his posse cruise Rush Street in the Trans Am. HOTTIES 
           smile... wave... pile into the Trans Am.

           Karen gives Mikey a bath... reads him a book... tucks him in.

           INT. FANCY STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT

           A midnight meal. Art and his crew in high spirits.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Would you like that rare?

                                 ART
                        Just wipe its ass and walk it by 
                        the stove.

           She looks at Joey.
                                 JOEY
                        No steak’s worth forty bucks. Gimme 
                        a burger.

           The others laugh at him. Casey raises his glass to Art.

                                 CASEY
                        To Mister Money.

           Art’s eyes shine. They clink and drink.

           INT. ART’S BEDROOM -- MORNING

           Art lies in bed, dead to the world, Mikey asleep beside him. 
           Karen, dressed for work, sees Art’s jeans on the floor.

           She kneels and searches them. She pulls out the CHICAGO 
           BULLS’ TICKET STUB. COURTSIDE SEATS. $200.

           She finds two C-NOTES in his pocket. Deep hurt in her eyes.

           INT. BANK - MORNING

           Romo steps to the TELLER, a 60-year-old grandmother.

                                 ROMO
                        I wanna make a deposit. Two 
                        thousand.

           He slaps down a PILE OF C-NOTES. The teller starts to count 
           them. Midway through her count, she pauses...

           CLOSE ON THE TELLER’S FINGERS.

           She glances at Romo, then coolly finishes her count. She 
           makes subtle eye contact with a BANK MANAGER.

           INT. SANGERTOWN MALL - DUSK

           A bushed Nina Kimm stands at the second-floor railing, 
           sipping Starbucks and surveying the crowds.

           NINA’S POV: Scores of shoppers walk out of stores, ride the 
           escalators, stroll the hallways. She focuses on the ones with 
           multiple bags. Most are women.

           But wait: Down on the first floor, here’s a MAN, 35, carrying 
           three shopping bags and heading into the Game Emporium.

                                 NINA
                            (into her mic)
                        Sully...
           INT. SANGERTOWN MALL FIRST FLOOR - DAY

           BRIAN SULLY, 32, Boston accent, sits in a rest island, 
           pretending to read the Sporting News. He’s pissed to be here, 
           and more pissed to be taking orders from Nina.

                                 SULLY
                            (into mic)
                        Way ahead of you. Blue jacket. Game 
                        Emporium.

           Sully watches through the store window as the suspect 
           approaches the counter and pulls out... a credit card.

                                 SULLY
                        Credit card. That’s a wrap, Kimm -- 
                        eight hours. Me, I would’ve staked 
                        out Stevens Mall. More guy stores.

           INT. SECOND FLOOR RAILING - DAY

           Nina watches Sully unclip his mic and walk away.

                                 NINA
                        Thanks... asshole.

           She drains her Starbucks and drops into a coin-operated 
           MASSAGE CHAIR. She glances over to see...

           ART, relaxing in the next chair. He wears CERULEAN BLUE 
           CONTACT LENSES. A SLEW OF SHOPPING BAGS at his feet.

                                 NINA
                        Not quite the real thing, huh?

                                 ART
                        I’ll take what I can get.

                                 NINA
                        Early Christmas shopping?

                                 ART
                        Man’s gotta provide.

           Nina closes her eyes. Art reaches over and drops a coin in 
           her slot as he gets up. Her massage starts up, surprising 
           her. She looks over toward Art -- but he’s gone.

           She relaxes into the deep-tissue rollers.

           EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - DUSK

           Art stuffs his bags into the trunk of the Trans Am. He tosses 
           in two SILVER MONEY CLIPS bulging with cash.
           INT. SANGERTOWN MALL - DUSK

           Nina’s back at her railing, sipping a fresh Starbucks. She 
           stretches, then stares, coming to life at the sight of...

           ART walking back into the mall. Wait a second -- he’s empty-
           handed. He steps into a SAM GOODY music store.

           NINA’S POV: Art walks out of the Sam Goody, bag in hand, and 
           into the B. DALTON BOOKSTORE.

           Nina’s eyes narrow. She watches Art walk into a FOOT LOCKER. 
           She starts to walk along the railing.

           INTERCUTTING between Nina, tracking Art along the railing...

           ... and Art down below, passing bills at FOOT LOCKER... 
           SPENCER’S GIFTS... RADIO SHACK.

           Art walks into VICTORIA’S SECRET.

           Nina rides down the ESCALATOR. HER POV: Art flirts with a 
           TWIGGY SALESCLERK as he pays. He glances up. Nina ducks down. 
           Did he see her?

           Nina hits the first floor and hides behind a RED MUSTANG 
           CONVERTIBLE -- grand prize in a mall raffle.

           Art walks out of Victoria’s Secret and heads for MACY’S.

           INT. VICTORIA’S SECRET - DAY

           Nina flashes her badge at the Salesclerk.

                                 NINA
                        Secret Service. Show me the bill 
                        your last customer paid with.

           She opens the register and finds the C-NOTE.

                                 SALESCLERK
                        Secret Service? Ohmigod. Tell me 
                        Bill Clinton is in the mall.

           Nina studies the note. Bingo -- the telltale SLASH.

           INT. MACY’S - DAY

           Nina scans the floor and... spots Art in sportswear. He’s 
           carrying three SWEATSUITS toward the fitting rooms.

           Nina tracks him. At the PERFUME COUNTER, she takes out her 
           cell phone and dials. Listens.

                                 NINA
                        Pick up, Sully. Come on.
           Not happening. She hurries to the area outside the fitting 
           rooms. She draws a small .45 from an ankle holster and...

           Rounds the corner. Three of the four fitting rooms are empty. 
           The fourth is occupied. Art’s SHOPPING BAGS sit outside.

           Nina takes a breath, steadies her .45, and kicks in the door.

                                 NINA
                        Secret Service! Freeze!

           A FAT GUY in a Bears sweatshirt cowers against the wall.

                                 FAT GUY
                        Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot! He paid 
                        me to lose his wife!

           Fat Guy holds up a C-NOTE.

           Nina races through a door into a storage room. The FIRE BELL 
           is ringing. Nina spots the source -- a DOOR marked “FIRE 
           EXIT. USE ONLY IN EMERGENCY.” She runs through it.

           EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Nina watches Art’s Trans Am gun out of the parking lot into 
           the street. She whips out a small pair of field binoculars.

           BINOCULAR POV: The TRANS AM’S LICENSE PLATE, visible for just 
           a split second before the car turns down a side street.

                                 NINA
                        Gotcha.

           EXT. NEARBY STREET -  NIGHT

           Art pulls the car over, jumps out, and unscrews the LICENSE 
           PLATES. The REAL PLATES lie beneath. He drops the fake ones 
           down a sewer grate.

           He takes a deep breath. He’s shaking.

           INT. SECRET SERVICE FIELD OFFICE - NIGHT

           Nina walks in, flushed with excitement.

                                 DALE JERROD
                        Ran that plate. Junkyard special.

           Nina slumps into a chair, despondent. She fires her Starbucks 
           cup at the trashcan. It hits the wall behind it and explodes.
           INT. WAREHOUSE BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Art steps off the service elevator, loaded down with the 
           night’s haul. He starts down the hallway. Suddenly he drops 
           to a crouch, staring...

           ... at the DUNGEON’S OPEN DOOR. He slowly backs away, and 
           then he hears it: U2’s “ONE,” playing from the dungeon.

           Art closes his eyes. A beat. He walks to the door, knowing 
           what he’ll see. And there’s Karen, sitting on the bar stool.

                                 ART
                        How did you...?

                                 KAREN
                        I’m a cop. Remember?

           She walks along his equipment. Stares at the mighty press. 
           She stops at the money table.

                                 KAREN
                        You swore to me. In front of Mikey.

                                 ART
                        I wanted to share this with you. I 
                        couldn’t. Karen, hear me out.
                            (beat)
                        Imagine what we could do with this. 
                        A house. Private school for Mikey. 
                        Vacations. We could have a life, 
                        Karen.

           She can see it. For one electric beat, Karen can see it all.

                                 KAREN
                        We have a life. Getting up. Going 
                        to work. Making love. Watching our 
                        baby grow. That’s a life, Art. I 
                        thought it was a pretty good one.
                        But you want this.

           She’s crying now, and furious that she can’t stop.

                                 ART
                        Who am I hurting, huh? Tell me 
                        that.

                                 KAREN
                        Everyone you give this... stupid 
                        paper to. What do you think happens 
                        when they take it to the bank?
                            (beat)
                        Get rid of all this. Or I’ll turn 
                        you in.

                                 ART
                        Karen...
           She starts knocking stacks to the floor.

                                 ART
                        Don’t do that. Stop it!

           She won’t stop. He pushes her up against the wall. 

                                 ART
                        Do you how know fuckin’ hard it was 
                        to make that money?

           He holds a COUNTERFEIT C-NOTE to her face.

                                 ART
                        Look at it.
                            (she won’t)
                        Look at it! I could hand this bill 
                        to the chairman of the Fed and he’d 
                        take it right to the bank. I’m not 
                        some hack printer, Karen. I’m the 
                        fuckin’ best!

                                 KAREN
                        Is that what I tell Mikey when 
                        you’re dead? Or in prison? That his 
                        father was the best?

           Art slams his palm into the wall by her face, denting the 
           plaster, scaring them both. Karen slides down to the floor 
           and sits there, back to the wall. Art starts pacing.

                                 ART
                        You think I’m gonna pump gas 
                        forever? Change oil, fetch 
                        cigarettes, take shit all night for 
                        eight bucks an hour?
                            (beat)
                        My Dad took shit all his life. From 
                        Stolin; from my mom; from everyone.  
                        That’s why he ran out. He couldn’t 
                        swallow one more spoonful. That’s 
                        not gonna be me. No more taking 
                        shit. No more scraping by.
                            (he pats the money)
                        This is our ticket, Karen.

                                 KAREN
                        Our ticket to what?

                                 ART
                        Freedom.

                                 KAREN
                        How free is DaVinci?

           A beat. Art has no answer. Karen walks to the door.

                                 KAREN
                        I’m changing the locks.
           She walks out. Art knocks over the MONEY TABLE. The cash 
           flies everywhere. He kicks it, furious. He sinks to his 
           knees, lost.

           INT. TRANS AM - NIGHT

           Art is parked across from his apartment. HIS POV through the 
           apartment window: Karen paces the living room, holding MIKEY.

           Art opens the gymbag beside him -- it’s full of the cash from 
           the dungeon. He looks at the cash... at his family.

           Suddenly: An EXPLOSION OF GLASS as the driver’s side window 
           SHATTERS. A BIG HAND smashes Art’s face into the steering 
           wheel, then pulls him out of the car.

           Art, dazed, stares at ROMO, who doubles him over with a 
           savage punch. TWO THUGS force Art into the Trans Am’s back 
           seat as Romo gets behind the wheel.

                                  ROMO
                        Nice ride.

           He opens the gym bag and sees the cash. He smiles.

           Art struggles to catch his breath in the back seat. The thugs 
           on either side of him press guns into his ribs.

                                 ART
                        What the hell’s going on?

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Romo pulls into the alley behind the Bent Elbow. Stolin’s 
           thugs haul Art out. He sees...

           Don on his belly, cut up and bleeding, kicking futilely as a 
           THUG holds his face in a mud puddle. He finally lets go. Don 
           gasps and gulps air. He sees Art.

                                 DON
                        I’m sorry, Artie.

           Romo slips three ROLLS OF QUARTERS into a GLOVE, then puts 
           his fist in the glove.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        Fuckin’ Don. The guy hands bad 
                        bills  to the only guy in the 
                        Outfit dumb enough to keep his 
                        money in the bank.
                            (beat)
                        No counterfeit detector on earth 
                        can match a teller’s fingers. They 
                        touch money all day, every day.

           Two thugs hold Art still. Romo punches him in the face.
                                 ROMO
                        That’s for the fuckin’ night in 
                        jail.
                            (hits him in the gut)
                        That’s for the fuckin’ judge we 
                        gotta buy...
                            (and again)
                        And that’s for the fuckin’ Bears 
                        missin’ the playoffs.

           Art drops to his knees, gasping, ribs broken.

                                 ART
                        You forgot one. For your mother.

           SFX: The CLICK of a GUN CLIP. Art squints through bloody eyes 
           to see ANSON STOLIN standing over him, holding a .45.

                                 STOLIN
                        You got more guts than your dad. 
                        Less brains, but more guts.

           Art stares down the barrel. His final seconds.

           CLOSE ON BARREL: BOOM. FLASH.

           Art flinches. A BULLET HOLE in the mud, inches from his ear.

           BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. Stolin empties the round into 
           the frozen mud. Art cringes in the fetal position.

                                 STOLIN
                        Your street tax is five grand a 
                        week. Startin’ tomorrow.

           Art, spitting blood, rolls to his knees to see Romo driving  
           away in his Trans Am. U2 floats out the broken window: “I 
           still haven’t found what I’m lookin’ for.”

           INT. DON’S CAR - NIGHT

           Art and Don, battered and bleeding, parked beneath the 
           highway overpass at Pebble Beach.`Art is furious.

                                 ART
                        You steal my counterfeit? Then you 
                        pass it to fuckin’ Romo?

                                 DON
                        I didn’t know anyone could spot it, 
                        Artie. Your bills are fuckin’ 
                        perfect. They’re like the real 
                        thing.

           Don pulls a counterfeit c-note out of his left pocket.

                                 DON
                        Look at it--
                                 ART
                        Jesus. Gimme that!

           Art snatches the bill. He starts to rock back and forth.

                                 DON
                        I’ll make it up to you, Artie. I 
                        swear.

           But Art isn’t listening. He’s rocking, and staring numbly 
           through the windshield. Searching his brain for that elusive 
           escape route.

                                 ART
                        I’m fucked, Donnie. If I don’t 
                        print money for Stolin, I’m dead. 
                        If I do -- Karen’s gone for good.
                        (beat)
                        Fucked.

           He punches the dash.

           EXT. GRACE LUTHERAN PRESCHOOL - DAY

           Art sits in a humble TOYOTA with rental car plates. His face 
           is a swollen mess. He watches Karen drive away.

           The preschool’s back door opens and a pack of wild TODDLERS 
           run into the grassy yard. Art walks over to the fence.

                                 ART
                        Mikey!

           Mikey runs over. Art takes a WHITE SOX CAP out of his pocket. 
           He puts the cap on Mikey.

                                 ART
                        I gotta go away for a little while.

                                 MIKEY
                        Why?

                                 ART
                        I just gotta do a job--

           Art stops. He’s giving Mikey the same line his own dad used 
           the night he ran out. Mikey stares at him.

           A TEACHER, suspicious, heads over.

                                 TEACHER
                            (to Mikey)
                        Is everything all right?

           Both Art and Mikey ignore her.
                                 ART
                        I’m coming back real soon, I 
                        promise.

           Art hugs Mikey tight, then hurries to his car.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING

           Art drives the open road, pressing an icepack to his cheek.

           He rolls past belching factories... past frostbitten farms. 
           His face matches the landscape -- desolate.

           EXT./INT. ART & KAREN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Karen opens the door to see Don. A beat as he works up the 
           guts to give her the bad news.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Art rolls through Arkansas. Flat and lonely. Nothing to see, 
           and nothing to keep you from seeing it.

           INT. HIGHWAY GAS STATION - NIGHT

           Art buys chips and sodas.

                                 CLERK
                        Plus twelve for the gas. Comes to 
                        fourteen thirty-five.

           Art instinctively reaches in his LEFT POCKET. Nothing there.

           He pulls out his wallet. We see the WORN SAN ANTONIO POSTCARD 
           tucked behind his cash.

           INT. SECRET SERVICE FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           Dale Jerrod walks past Nina’s desk. She’s staring blankly at 
           her Bob Marley screensaver.

           Dale knows who she’s day-dreaming about.

                                 DALE JERROD
                        Chin up, Kimm. If the streets don’t 
                        get him...

           He nods at a HUGE CUTOUT of a C-NOTE. But it’s no ordinary C-
           Note. This baby’s been radically redesigned. Ben Franklin’s 
           head is huge, his features exaggerated. The numbers, the 
           background -- everything about this bill is different.
                                 DALE JERROD
                        ... the New Note will.

           INT. BUREAU OF ENGRAVING AND PRINTING - - WASHINGTON - DAY

           Massive sheets of NEW NOTES roll off monster presses.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           NEWSPAPER FRONT PAGES rolling off printing presses.

           THE NEW YORK POST: “IT’S ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS”... THE 
           CHICAGO TRIBUNE: “SHOW ME THE MONEY”... THE L.A. TIMES: 
           “SEEING GREEN”

           REACTION SHOTS of EVERYDAY AMERICANS as the NEW NOTE hits the 
           streets. STOCKBROKERS... FLORISTS... TAXI DRIVERS... 
           everyone’s jonesing on these cool new Benjamins.

           We see NEW NOTES passing from HAND-TO-HAND. In banks and 
           ritzy nightclubs... tire shops and back alleys. From white 
           hand to black hand to yellow hand. Sea to shining sea.

           EXT. HIGHWAY REST STATION - DAWN

           Art sleeps in his car, bundled under thin blankets.

           CLOSE ON TV SCREEN: A CNN ANCHOR at her desk.

                                 ANCHOR
                        If you’re looking twice at your 
                        money these days, you’re not alone.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SUNSET

           Art drives past the “WELCOME TO TEXAS” SIGN. Past sprawling 
           cattle ranches... lonely oil fields.

                                 ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        But Ben Franklin’s radical facelift 
                        is not entirely cosmetic.

           EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           A violent WINDSTORM. Art struggles to keep the car between 
           the white lines. CITY LIGHTS twinkle in the distance.

           A SAN ANTONIO EXIT SIGN. Art pulls off the highway.

                                 ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        From security threads, to secret 
                        watermarks, to color-shifting ink, 
                        many of the New Note’s features 
                        have a purpose that might surprise 
                        you: to thwart counterfeiters.
           EXT. VAGABOND INN - NIGHT 

           Art pulls up to a dive motel. Bugs slam against a sputtering 
           neon vacancy sign.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           An agitated Art holds the phone.

                                 ART
                        I’m gonna make things right, Karen. 
                        Just give me a little time.

                                 KAREN
                        If you call again, I’ll change the 
                        number.

                                 ART
                        Karen--

           He’s talking to a DIAL TONE.

           EXT. PEPSI PLANT - DAY

           A bustling plant. Art and JUAN SANTANA, 25, haul a 500-pound 
           VENDING MACHINE up a truck ramp. Art is soaked in sweat.

           INT. PEPSI PLANT - DUSK

           A bone-weary Art punches out on the time clock.

           INT. PAYDAY EXPRESS - DUSK

           A TELLER cashes Art’s meager paycheck.

                                 TELLER
                        Two eighty-seven thirty-four. Large 
                        bills okay?

           She slaps down two NEW NOTES -- the redesigned C-Note. Art 
           stares, transfixed -- it’s the first time he’s ever seen one.

           EXT. ALAMO ARMS APARTMENTS - NIGHT

           A squat little apartment complex in San Antonio’s rough-and-
           tumble Fort St. Houston section.

           On the corner, FOUR CHICANO KIDS whack at a lamppost pinata.
           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Art soaks in the tub. He’s holding a NEW NOTE. Staring hard 
           at its intricacies. This baby is a piece of work.

           His finger traces the SECURITY THREAD -- a razor-thin, barely 
           visible strip embedded INSIDE THE PAPER. It’s tiny lettering 
           reads “100 USA, 100 USA, 100 USA.”

           Art holds the bill to the light, summoning the WATERMARK -- a 
           faint, ghostly portrait of Ben Franklin himself.

           And for the coup de grace: The “100” in the lower right 
           corner. The digits are GREEN -- until Art tilts the bill. 
           Then the color-shifting ink CHANGES TO BLACK.

           Art lays the bill on the windowsill -- this sucker is 
           impregnable. He sips his beer and soaks.

           Sitting on the toilet beside the tub is an ENVELOPE WITH 
           Karen’s RETURN ADDRESS. DIVORCE PAPERS peek out.

           INT. SECRET SERVICE FIELD OFFICE - CHICAGO - DAY

           Dale Jerrod stands in front of a roomful of FIELD AGENTS. 
           Monday morning briefing.

                                 DALE JERROD
                        Our good city’s bad bill count...
                            (pauses for effect)
                        ... is eighteen thousand.

           Cheers and fist-pumps from the agents.

                                 DALE JERROD
                        Twenty-year low. How ‘bout that 
                        fuckin’ New Note?

           Nina Kimm, sitting in the back row, flips through her field 
           notebook to a SKETCH OF ART WILLIAMS. She can’t let it go. 
           Taped beneath the sketch is one of Art’s FAKE C-NOTES. 

                                 FELLOW AGENT
                        Soon we’ll all be back on Lewinsky 
                        duty.

           The agents all laugh.

           INT. PEPSI PLANT - DAY

           Juan tosses 12-pack boxes to Art, who loads them into a Pepsi 
           truck. Toss and load. Toss and load.

           Suddenly Art stops loading. He walks to a nearby fence and 
           stares through it at a shiny pickup truck.
                                 ART
                        Juan. Your pickup. Is it red or 
                        orange?

                                 JUAN
                        Depends on the light. Pretty cool, 
                        huh?

           Art stares at the truck. A revelation.

           INT. PAINT STORE - DAY

           Art, holding a New Note, stares up at...

           A HUGE WALL OF ACRYLIC PAINTS. Hundreds of bottles -- dozens 
           of shades for every color. Art sighs -- he’s got no chance.

                                 STORE CLERK (O.S.)
                        Can I help you?

           INT. ALAMO ARMS KITCHEN - DUSK

           Art drinks a beer at the table, which is covered with half-
           finished sketches of the New Note. Frustrated, he walks 
           out...

           EXT. ALAMO ARMS APT. - DUSK

           ... onto the tiny balcony. He watches some KIDS kick a dusty 
           soccer ball in the street below.

           A DUMPY MEXICAN WOMAN is making tamales at her corner stand. 

           She slaps down a flour tortilla, lays in a strip of 
           jalapenos, folds the tortilla closed, then pounds it flat 
           with a quick blow of the fist.

           Art watches her. Casually at first, then intently.

           She’s fast and rhythmic: lay in the jalapenos... fold... 
           pound. Jalapenos... fold... pound.

           Art is transfixed. A CAR HORN breaks his reverie. It’s Juan, 
           pulling up in his shiny pickup truck.

                                 JUAN
                        Ready for a Texas happy hour?

           INT. JUAN’S TRUCK - DUSK

           Juan floors it. Art reaches for a seatbelt. There isn’t one.
                                 JUAN
                        Texas.
                            (beat)
                        So how you like the plant, Amigo?

                                 ART
                        It’s work.

                                 JUAN
                        It’s good work. In two months 
                        they’ll raise you to ten an hour. 
                        In a year you’ll be making twelve.

           EXT. S-KICKERS BAR - NIGHT

           Establishing shot. A down-home Texas roadhouse.

           INT. S-KICKERS - NIGHT

           Juan and Art at the bar. Photos of country music greats line 
           the walls. Antique farm equipment hangs from the ceiling.

           The half-acre wide dance floor is packed with people engaged 
           in a Texas specialty -- LINE DANCING. Blue-jeaned cowboys and 
           cowgirls of all shapes and sizes step in time to the music.

           Art stares in amazement.

                                 JUAN
                        You don’t got line dancing in 
                        Chicago?

                                 ART
                        If a guy danced like that in 
                        Chicago they’d never find his body.

           Juan eyes a MEXICALI BABE across the room. She smiles back.

                                 JUAN
                        See ya Monday, Amigo.

           Juan heads over to her. Art watches the line dancers.

           Soon he’s mesmerized by a TRIM BEAUTY in a white dress. Doe 
           eyes and long brown hair. Wow. Her innocent line-dancing is 
           sexy as hell. She offers up a sweet leg, then takes it back. 
           Hands on hips. Dip a shoulder on the turn.

           She catches Art staring and smiles. He holds up his beer -- 
           does she want one? She points to the HUNK dancing beside her. 
           Sorry, I’m with him.

           Art buys her a beer anyway. On her next pass, he holds it up.

           The BIG HUNK walks the girl over to Art.
                                 HUNK
                        I hope that beer’s for me. Because 
                        if it’s for her, we got a problem.

                                 ART
                        If it’s for you, I’m a fag. That’s 
                        not a problem?

           A long beat. The Hunk laughs and offers his hand.

                                 HUNK
                        Clem. And Natalie -- my little sis.

                                 ART
                        Art.

           Natalie shakes Art’s hand and accepts his beer. She pokes 
           Clem and nods across the room at a HUGE-BREASTED BLONDE.

                                 NATALIE
                        Go dance with Miss Store-bought -- 
                        you’ve been eying her all night. I 
                        can handle myself.

           Clem tips his Stetson at Art and heads for the blonde.

                                 ART
                        You always hit the bars with your 
                        brother?

                                 NATALIE
                        It cuts down on the jackals.

           Natalie’s silver, heart-shaped necklace sparkles in the 
           light. Art touches it.

                                 NATALIE
                        It’s called an Eternity necklace. 
                        It’s a Mormon thing.

                                 ART
                        Mormons can drink beer?

                                 NATALIE
                        Sometimes I stray.

           He touches her bare knee. She smiles. Heat. As they watch the 
           line dancers, Natalie reaches behind Art’s back for his beer, 
           which sits on the bar. She’s about to do something to it, but 
           stops. She can’t go through with it.

           She OPENS HER HAND, showing Art a SMALL VIAL OF LIQUID.

                                 NATALIE
                        I’m supposed to pour this in your 
                        beer. So that Clem can rob you.

                                 ART
                        Tough town.
           Art closes his eyes and holds his beer out to Natalie. A long 
           beat. Eyes still closed, he drinks it down.

           He takes Natalie’s closed hand in his. He opens it -- the 
           VIAL IS STILL THERE. Still full.

           THEIR POV: Clem and Miss Store-bought, stepping lively.

           Clem sneaks a glance over at Art and Natalie.

                                 ART
                        He’s not your brother, is he?

           INT. S-KICKERS - LATER

           Clem is passed out in a chair in a corner, his Stetson over 
           his face. Art pockets his wallet and truck keys.

           INT. CLEM’S TRUCK - NIGHT

           Natalie sits on Art’s lap, kissing him hungrily. He’s her 
           whole world. Art slips a hand under her shirt. She stops him.

                                 NATALIE
                        You promised me dinner.

           INT. CHILI HUT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Art and Natalie sit at a table. A WAITRESS clears their 
           plates away. Art eyes Natalie’s legs. He wants her bad.

                                 ART
                        Why did you show me that vial?

                                 NATALIE
                        I don’t know.

           Her eyes say it all -- she took a leap of faith.

                                 ART
                        Come home with me.

           She smiles like an angel... and shakes her head no. Art can’t 
           believe it.

                                 NATALIE
                        Guys don’t respect what they don’t 
                        earn. Don’t you listen to Doctor 
                        Laura?

           A beat. Art stares at her. He’s at a crossroads. Does he play 
           his ace card? Finally...

           He reaches into his wallet and pulls out one of his old FAKE 
           C-NOTES. He lays it on the table.
                                 ART
                        I made that.

                                 NATALIE
                        Good for you.

                                 ART
                        No, I made it. It’s counterfeit.

           Natalie picks up the C-Note and stares at it in the dim 
           candlelight. She starts to tremble. She walks out of the bar.

           Art sighs. He can’t believe it -- he’s lost her.

           ART’S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW: Natalie stands under a bright 
           streetlight, staring at the C-Note. She walks back inside.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What do you need, sweetheart?

                                 NATALIE
                        A round for the bar.

           The BAR PATRONS cheer. Natalie hands the bartender the C-
           Note. He holds it up to the light, flicks it with a finger, 
           and rings up the sale.

           Natalie stares into Art’s eyes. Soulmates.

           INT. ART’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Art and Natalie make wild love. She clutches his back, tears 
           streaming down her face. They finish. He holds her.

                                 ART
                        Don’t worry. I won’t tell Doctor 
                        Laura.

           LATER

           Art wakes up, alone. Natalie sits by the window, staring at 
           the fake C-Note in the moonlight. She walks to Art.

                                 NATALIE
                        When I was a girl in Utah a 
                        stallion broke loose from the 
                        neighbor’s ranch and ran through 
                        our yard. He was the most beautiful 
                        thing I’d ever seen. Until you 
                        showed me this.
                            (beat)
                        Just think what we could do, baby.  
                        The places we could go.

                                 ART
                        Whoa.
                            (he takes the C-Note)
                        This is an old bill, Natalie. 
                        They’re headed out of circulation.
           He pulls a NEW NOTE from his wallet.

                                 ART
                        The New Note. First guy to break 
                        this sucker is gonna get real rich, 
                        real fast.

           Natalie’s eyes shine. Art holds up a hand -- here comes the 
           catch. He brings the New Note close to the lamp. The bright 
           light pours through it.

                                 ART
                        See this security thread? Embedded 
                        inside the paper. Over here? 
                        Watermark.

           CLOSE ON the faint, ghostly watermark of Ben Franklin’s face.

                                 ART
                        And these numbers? Green, right?

           He tilts the bill. Now they’re BLACK.

           Art looks at Natalie, expecting her to be daunted. Her 
           beautiful eyes are wide and trusting.

                                 NATALIE
                        You can do it, right?

           Art smiles. He has no idea, but he can’t say no to those 
           eyes. He nods.

                                 NATALIE
                        I’ll help you.

           INT. BARRIO HOUSE - DAY

           A small house in the barrio. A MEXICAN LANDLORD walks Art and 
           Natalie through the kitchen.

                                 LANDLORD
                        Lots of cabinets. You like to cook?

                                 NATALIE
                        Yes Ma’am.

           Art opens the basement door and walks down a few steps. Big, 
           dark, and quiet. Perfect. Art closes his eyes.

           INT. BARRIO HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

           Art stands on the basement stairs again. But now Natalie 
           stands behind him, her hands over his eyes. She pulls them 
           away and Art stares in wonder at...

           An OFFSET PRINTING PRESS, wrapped up in a BIG RED BOW. Art 
           looks at Natalie, incredibly moved.
                                 ART
                        Baby?

                                 NATALIE
                        I spent everything I had.

           INT. BARRIO BASEMENT - DAY

           The basement wall is covered with dozens of FELT-TIP SKETCHES 
           OF THE NEW NOTE. It reminds us of Art’s old comic-book cover 
           wall, except now it’s all about the Benjamins.

           Art sits in front of a COMPUTER SCREEN. It’s filled with thin 
           vertical columns reading “USA 100, USA 100, USA 100.” (The 
           text printed on the New Note’s security thread.)

           Art prints the text out onto SUPER-THIN VELLUM PAPER.

           Using ruler and razor, Art cuts a tiny strip off the vellum. 
           He grips the strip with tweezers, and stares down at the BACK 
           of a COUNTERFEIT NEW NOTE.

           EXT. ALAMO ARMS - DUSK: FLASHBACK

           We’re back with Art on the second-floor landing. He’s staring 
           down at the MEXICAN TAMALE WOMAN at her corner stand.

           INTERCUTTING BETWEEN THE TAMALE WOMAN AND ART’S BASEMENT

           The TAMALE WOMAN lays a strip of jalapenos on her tortilla...

           ART lays a vellum strip onto the Note-Back...

           The TAMALE WOMAN folds her tortilla closed...

           Art presses the Note-Front onto the Note-back, trapping the 
           vellum strip in between...

           The TAMALE WOMAN pounds the tortilla flat with a hard blow 
           from her fist...

           Art lays the bill on the CORKSCREW PRESS and hits it with 
           five hundred pounds of pressure.

           BACK TO SCENE: BARRIO BASEMENT - DAY

           Art peels the bill off the press and holds it up. Voila -- a 
           beautiful, embedded security thread. Natalie hugs his neck.

           INT. BARRIO BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Art opens a box marked “ACRYLIC CAR PAINTS.” Twenty small 
           bottles inside. He dips a paintbrush into a bottle.
           Art touches up the “100” on the bill’s lower right corner 
           with green acrylic paint. He holds it up to the light: GREEN. 
           He tilts the bill: STILL GREEN.

           He opens a new paint bottle. Natalie brings him coffee.

           LATER

           All twenty paint bottles are scattered about. Art’s ashtray 
           is full, his coffee mug empty. Natalie refills it.

                                 ART
                        I’m gonna try mixing ‘em.

           INT. BARRIO BASEMENT - ANOTHER NIGHT

           Art’s still at his table. Three-day growth of beard. Dishes 
           of mixed paint lie around, cigarette butts stubbed out in 
           them. Natalie sleeps on a small sofa.

           Art sighs. He mixes two shades of green paint with a dollop 
           of black. He dips in the brush, then touches up the “100.”

           He holds it up: GREEN. He tilts it: BLACK. Victory. He shakes 
           Natalie awake and shows her the bill. She kisses him.

                                 ART
                        Just the watermark left, baby. 
                        Piece of cake.

           INT. BARRIO BASEMENT - NIGHT

           A confident Art scratches a portrait of BEN FRANKLIN onto a 
           NOTE-BACK.

           He lifts the finished note off the corkscrew press and holds 
           it up: no watermark is visible.

           He tries to STEAM THE PORTRAIT onto a note. He lifts it off 
           the press: nothing but a messy blur.

           He tries inserting a piece of paper with a drawing of Ben 
           Franklin. He lifts it off the press: Too thick.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Art paces the room. He’s burnt out, miserable. Natalie sits 
           on the counter, red-eyed, smoking a cigarette.

                                 ART
                        I can’t fuckin’ do it.

                                 NATALIE
                        There’s gotta be a way, baby. The 
                        government does it.
                                 ART
                        With million-dollar machines. I got 
                        spit and tissue paper.

           Art stares at her. Revelation.

           INT. BARRIO BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Art sketches a portrait of Ben Franklin onto a TISSUE. He 
           cuts out the portrait... glues the fragile tissue paper onto 
           a NEW NOTE BACK... presses on the FRONT.

           Art lays the bill on the hydraulic press. He hits the button. 
           Natalie takes his hand. This is it -- all or nothing.

           Art lifts the cover. He holds the bill up to the window.

           Dawn’s early light pours through the bill. BEN FRANKLIN’S 
           FACE, ghostly and beautiful, stares back at them. A perfect 
           WATERMARK.

           Art lifts Natalie off her feet. Presses her against the wall.

                                 ART
                        You ready to get rich, baby?

           INT. ALAMO ARMS KITCHEN - MORNING

           Natalie paints her toenails on the kitchen table.

                                 NATALIE
                        Are you sure we need them?

                                 ART
                        Trust me. Things are gonna get 
                        wild.

           SFX: HONKING FROM OUTSIDE. Art looks out the window. Smiles.

           EXT. ALAMO ARMS - MORNING

           Joey climbs out of a VAN. He’s up to 350 pounds now, easy. 
           Art pats his belly.

                                 ART
                        No Slim-Fast for you, huh?
                            (beat)
                        Can’t believe you jagoffs found 
                        Texas.

                                 JOEY
                        Just hung a right at Missouri.

           Don gets out the passenger side. He’s wearing the same Marine 
           Corps sweatshirt we remember from Chicago.
           Art glares at him... then at Joey. Clearly, Don wasn’t 
           invited.

                                 JOEY
                            (sheepish)
                        What are you gonna do?

           Don shuffles his feet, hangdog.

                                 DON
                        I’ll drive right back home, Artie. 
                        Alone. Just say the word. You need 
                        the van? I’ll hitch.

           A beat. Art sighs. What are you gonna do?

           Joey opens the back of the van. Casey pops out. He hugs Art.

                                 CASEY
                        Fuckin’ Lone Star State, Homes. 
                        What took you so long?

                                 ART
                        You’ll see. Did you bring it?

           Casey smiles. Art climbs into the van. He pulls a blanket off 
           a HYDRAULIC PRESSURE PRESS. Industrial strength. Art smiles.

                                 ART
                        Just what the doctor ordered.

           A SLEEPY BLONDE sits up in the back of the van.

                                 BLONDE
                        Are we in California yet?

           INT. ART’S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           Drunken reunion. Empty beer cans, burnt blunts. Art pours 
           shots of Cuervo as Natalie rubs his shoulders.

                                 ART
                        So... wanna see what I dragged you 
                        cross-country for?

           Art pulls out a COUNTERFEIT NEW NOTE and passes it around. 
           The guys are in awe. Even amateurs can see its magic.

                                 JOEY
                        Holy shit.

                                 DON
                        It’s fuckin’ beautiful, Artie.
                                 ART
                        Welcome to the big-time. Everybody 
                        else is still printing the old 
                        hundreds. When this baby hits the 
                        market... move over Bill Gates.

           The guys are hooked.

                                 ART
                        I’m gonna need a crew. Casey... 
                        you’re my point man. Joey, you’re 
                        muscle. Don...
                            (a long beat. Don’s in 
                             agony)
                        You’re gonna drive.
                            (Don’s face lights up)
                        Any questions? 

                                 CASEY
                            (to Natalie)

           INT. VAGABOND INN MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           A cramped pigsty. Don and Casey sleep in one bed; Joey snores 
           in the other. Clothes, beer cans, pizza boxes all around.

           EXT. THE ALAMO - DAY

           Establishing shot of San Antonio’s famous fortress. Tourists 
           mill about the beautiful limestone walls.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        While Don learned the streets...

           Don, DRIVING A CAB, drops off three Asian sightseers.

                        And Joey stayed strong...

           INT. BURGER KING - NIGHT

           Joey sits down. THREE DOUBLE WHOPPERS on his tray.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        Casey scouted out the local action.

           SERIES OF SHOTS
           Casey shoots pool in a ROUGHNECK DIVE... drinks with OUTLAWS 
           in a biker bar... shares a joint with LOWLIFES outside a 
           strip club.

           INT. BARRIO HOUSE BASEMENT - NIGHT

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        My job was to print my ass off.

           Art stares at stacks and stacks of beautiful counterfeit.

           INT. DURTY NELLY’S - NIGHT

           Casey leads Art into a dive bar. A BABE in a red, white, and 
           blue bikini top works the taps. A hundred bras hang from the 
           ceiling.

           Casey points to the back, where HILLY, 45, gaunt and scruffy, 
           drinks alone at a small table. They head over.

                                 CASEY
                        Guy’s a fuckin’ jagoff, but he’s 
                        got the town wired.

           Hilly looks them over as they sit down.

                                 CASEY
                        This is Art, the guy--

           Hilly rubs his fingers together. So much for small talk. Art 
           hands him two twenties. Casey seethes.

                                 HILLY
                        The king of the counterfeit jungle 
                        is a guy named Nosa. Nigerian. 
                        Badass. Runs a crew out of Dallas.

                                 ART
                        How do I find him?

                                 HILLY
                        You don’t. Nosa finds you.

                                 ART
                        I got the best paper he’ll ever 
                        see.

                                 HILLY
                        Yeah? Then put it out on the 
                        street. If it’s any good, he’ll 
                        hear.

           EXT. STREET - DUSK

           The Fiesta rages. Revelers cruise the streets, drinks in 
           hand. Fireworks light up the San Antonio River.
           INT. DINER - DUSK

           Art and Natalie in a booth. Casey walks in, sporting a black 
           eye. He joins them.

                                 NATALIE
                        What happened to you?

                                 CASEY
                        Cost a’ doing business. Got a 
                        buyer, Homes. He wants a hundred 
                        grand a week from Friday.

           Art sees that Casey is nervous.

                                 ART
                        What?

                                 CASEY
                        He’s Russian mafia. The word is, 
                        these guys don’t fuck around. Your 
                        paper better be as good as you say.

                                 ART
                        Don’t worry about my paper.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DUSK

           Art & Natalie walk down the raucous street, dodging the 
             cascarones -- confetti eggs -- that Mexican kids toss off the 
           rooftops.

           Art pulls her into a doorway beside a liquor store. He 
           brushes the confetti from her hair. He kisses her.

                                 ART
                        What’s the first thing you want me 
                        to buy you?

                                 NATALIE
                        Everything.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

           Art & Natalie grab a bottle of champagne and head for the 
           counter. Three DRUNK AIR FORCE CADETS are buying condoms.

           The CLERK takes a cadet’s TWENTY and marks it with a STRANGE 
           BLACK PEN. He rings up the sale. The cadets head out.

                                 DRUNK CADET
                            (doing Terminator)
                        I’ll be back.

           Art steps to the counter, his eyes locked on the PEN.
                                 ART
                        What is that?

           The clerk swipes the pen across a COUNTERFEIT TWENTY taped to 
           the register. A BLACK MARK appears on the bill.

                                 CLERK
                        Real bills show yellow. See?

           He swipes Art’s TWENTY -- a YELLOW MARK appears.

                                 CLERK
                        Just the champagne?

           Art and Natalie are in shock.

                                 ART
                        Pack of Newport Lights.

           As the clerk turns to grab the cigarettes, Art swipes the PEN 
           off the counter. He and Natalie hurry out.

           EXT. BARRIO HOUSE BACK YARD - DAY

           Art and Natalie stand beside a burning compost heap. Art 
           dumps counterfeit bills out of a garbage bag into the fire.

           They watch the beautiful bills burn down to ash. Art pulls 
           out a cell phone.

           INT. VAGABOND INN - DAY

           Casey holds the phone. He’s agitated.

                                 CASEY
                        Fuck that, Homes -- these guys 
                        won’t wait for the Pope. We do this 
                        buy or we get the hell outta here.

           INT. PAPER STORE - DAY

           Natalie, in jean skirt and white halter top, pages through a 
           booklet of binder samples with a YOUNG COUNTER CLERK. He’s 
           beyond smitten, which distracts him from...

           ART IN THE PAPER AISLE, swiping the counterfeit pen across 
           every sample sheet. They all MARK BLACK.

           INT. POST OFFICE - DAY

           A POSTAL CLERK hands Art a slew of envelopes. Art rips them 
           open: PAPER SAMPLES. He starts marking them right there. 
           BLACK, BLACK, AND MORE BLACK.
           INT. ALAMO ARMS APT. KITCHEN - DUSK

           It’s hot as hell. Art and Natalie sit at the table, sweating. 
           PAPER SAMPLES cover the counter. Art talks on the phone.

                                 ART
                        I need to order a sample. Number 
                        two-two-seven-eight.

           Natalie closes her eyes. She’s barely holding it together. 
           She glances into the living room, at...

           Casey, Don, and Joey. They’ve clearly moved in, their stuff 
           strewn everywhere. Joey eats potato chips out of a bag. Casey 
           smokes a joint. Don gives himself an insulin injection.

           Art is dialing again. Natalie grabs the receiver from him and 
           hangs it up. He picks it up again and dials.

                                 ART
                        Hi. I need some...

           Natalie pulls the jack out of the phone, killing the call. 
           She starts to cry. She grabs the ANTI-COUNTERFEIT PEN.

                                 NATALIE
                        You broke the New Note. Broke it. 
                        And it doesn’t matter.

           Art plugs the jack back into the phone.

                                 NATALIE
                        The paper’s not out there! Can’t 
                        you see that?

           She starts slashing the pen across every piece of paper she 
           can find. A napkin. A calendar. The wallpaper. BLACK.

                                 NATALIE
                        Nothing works!

           She marks a dixie cup. A paper plate. The San Antonio Times. 
           BLACK. She’s working herself up into a frenzy.

           Joey walks in, headed for the fridge. Natalie even grabs his 
           USA TODAY sports page and marks that. EVERYTHING STOPS.

           YELLOW. Art and Natalie stare at the newspaper in shock.

                                 ART
                        Do it again.

           She marks it again. YELLOW. They’re afraid to breathe. Casey 
           and Don stand in the doorway.

                                 CASEY
                        Homes?
           Art holds up the newspaper. Pandemonium.

           EXT. USA TODAY BUILDING - DAY

           The loading docks behind the building. TWO WORKERS toss 
           bundles of papers into a delivery truck. They look up to see 
           a PRIEST and a YOUNG LADY.

           It’s Art and Natalie. Art wears a black robe and starched 
           white clerical collar. Natalie wears a demure blouse and 
           black skirt, with a crucifix on her neck.

           Propped against a garbage dumpster are a half-dozen thick, 
           four-foot high COB ROLLS. The rolls are used, destined for 
           the recycling plant, but each has enough paper left on it to 
           print a lot of bills.

                                 WORKER
                        What do you need, father?

           Art pats one of the cob rolls.

                                 ART
                        We’re on a very tight budget at 
                        Saint Aquinas. A few of these would 
                        keep Mrs. Callahan’s fourth-grade 
                        class in coloring paper all year.

           Natalie fingers the crucifix and flashes a smile.

           EXT. LOADING DOCK - DAY

           THREE WORKERS eye Natalie as they load the heavy cob rolls 
           into the back of Art’s rented flatbed pickup.

                                 WORKER
                        She can keep me after school any 
                        day.

           INT. FLATBED PICKUP - DAY

           Natalie puts her Mormon Eternity Necklace back on.

                                 NATALIE
                        It felt like a sin to take it off.

                                 ART
                        We’ll cut the Mormons in for ten 
                        percent.

           She laughs and kisses him.
           EXT. LOADING DOCK - DAY

           A MEXICAN JANITOR drops his mop and crosses himself. HIS POV: 
           A priest kissing a hot babe in a pickup truck.

           EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           A dark, quiet lot. A dozen parked cars.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Don and Casey sit up front, Art and Joey in the back. Art 
           checks his watch: 9:58. High tension.

           A MIDDLE-AGED MAN pushes a shopping cart to his SUV. He 
           unloads his groceries. And now he starts toward the guys.

                                 CASEY
                        What the fuck?

           The man flashes a LEATHER CASE from beneath his jacket.

           Joey gets out and the man slides in next to Art. He’s slight 
           and wears bi-focals, but he has an unmistakable presence.

                                 MAN
                        Arthur. I’m Dmitri.

           Art opens his duffel bag. Dmitri examines a counterfeit note 
           under a jeweler’s light. Marks it with a PEN. YELLOW.

                                 DMITRI
                        Outstanding.

           Art is moved by the man’s respect. Dmitri hands over the 
           cash. As Art counts it, Dmitri stares at the supermarket.

                                 DMITRI
                        You think it was Reagan who won the 
                        Cold War. It was your supermarkets. 
                        Fifty kinds of cereal; twenty face 
                        creams. We had no chance.

           Art nods at the money -- it’s all there. They shake hands.

                                 DMITRI
                        You have more of this?

                                 ART
                        Whatever you can buy, I can print. 
                        Tell that to the boys in Moscow.
                            (as Dmitri gets out)
                        You got balls comin’ alone.
           Dmitri walks to his SUV. He opens the door, revealing: FOUR 
           THUGS, armed to the teeth. The guy’s hardly alone. He smiles 
           back at Art.

           INT. NATALIE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Art walks in, empty-handed. Natalie is alarmed -- what 
           happened? Art opens his shirt and dumps STACKS OF CASH onto 
           the table. She screams in joy. 

           INT. BARRIO BASEMENT - DAY

           Art hunches over his work-table. Natalie dips a cloth in ice 
           water and cools his neck. Garbage bags stuffed with fake New 
           Notes cover the floor.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        I couldn’t print those babies fast 
                        enough.

           EXT. TITO’S STRIP CLUB - DAY

           Establishing shot. DON is parked out front.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        I told Casey I wanted foreign 
                        buyers. If the bills left the 
                        country, so would the heat.

           INT. TITO’S - DAY

           Art and Joey sit in a booth. Casey, supposedly standing 
           lookout, watches a lithe stripper twirl down a pole.

           A wiry MEXICAN slides in across from Art. They exchange bags 
           beneath the table.

           The Mexican examines Art’s bills on the seat beside him. Wow.

                                 ART
                        Forty cents on the dollar.

                                 MEXICAN
                        Si.

           INT. NATALIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Natalie opens her mirrored closet door. She grabs all her 
           clothes and tosses them on the floor.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           Natalie opens the same closet door, revealing a WHOLE NEW 
           WARDROBE. She smiles at Art.
           INT. TITO’S - DAY

           A KOREAN BUYER sits across from Art.

                                 ART
                        Forty-two cents.

           INT. NATALIE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           TWO WORKERS haul away Natalie’s old sofa... and carry in a 
           fancy new one... and a fancy loveseat... and an armoire.

           Art’s still smiling, but not quite as wide.

           INT. TITO’S - DAY

           A GERMAN BUYER this time.

           INT. NATALIE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           A WORKER mounts a huge, framed painting of a white stallion. 
           Another WORKER installs special art lighting beneath it. 

           Art takes a big hit off his beer.

           INT. CHICAGO SECRET SERVICE FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           NINA KIMM stands in the conference room, hooking her laptop 
           to a flat LCD screen. DALE JERROD walks in. TWO BULLS TICKETS 
           peek out of his shirt pocket.

                                 DALE
                        Shaq’s in town, Kimm. Make it fast.

                                 NINA
                        The DEA hit a drug buy in San 
                        Antonio. Some Mexicans paid 
                        counterfeit for crystal meth.

           ON SCREEN: A COUNTERFEIT NEW NOTE. Incredible quality. Nina  
           zooms in on the IMMACULATE SEALS. WATERMARK. SECURITY THREAD.

                                 DALE
                        Looks like a Super Note.

                                 NINA
                        Except for this.
           She zooms in on the upper right of the note: A BLACK DOT.

                                 NINA
                        Same mark on every bill.

           ON SCREEN: One of ART’S OLD C-NOTES appears beneath the NEW 
           NOTE. Nina zooms in on the trademark DIAGONAL SLASH.

                                 NINA
                        Remember Slash? Made bills so good 
                        he had to put flaws in them?

           ON SCREEN: A RULED GRID appears along the side of the screen.

                                 NINA
                        Here’s his old mark: One inch in 
                        from the left; one inch up.
                            (beat)
                        This new dot: One inch in from the 
                        right; one inch down. Let’s say 
                        he’s using a razor and ruler...

           ON SCREEN: Nina rotates Art’s old C-Note until it’s upside 
           down. She lays it just above the New Note. The marks are in 
           precisely the same location.

                                 DALE

                        too. If he’s selling to Mexicans,

           INT. CASEY/JOEY/DON’S NEW PAD - NIGHT

           Casey ushers in Art and Natalie. The decor is Nouveau 
           gangster -- black leather couch, speed bag, big-screen TV. 
           The lone item on the bookshelf is the GODFATHER BOXED SET.

                                 CASEY
                        You gotta see this, Homes.

           Casey opens a closet: Two dozen pairs of JORDAN HIGH-TOPS 
           line the shelf. Beneath them, on hangers, an entire row of 
           JORDAN SHIRTS. Not just Bulls’ jerseys, either. Powder-blue 
           dress shirts tastefully adorned with the Jordan logo.

                                 JOEY
                        The jagoff gets ‘em dry-cleaned.

                        I’m a jagoff? Show Natalie the 
                        fridge.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Joey opens the fridge. All the shelves have been removed to 
           make room for a KEG OF BUSCH. Natalie pats Joey’s shoulder.

                                 NATALIE
                        Where’s Don?

                        Out buyin’ a six-month CD. Guy 
                        thinks he’s Donald Trump.

           EXT. CASEY’S BALCONY - NIGHT

           Art & Casey, twenty floors up.

                                 CASEY
                        Called my Ma today. Six fuckin’ 
                        degrees in Chicago.

           They clink beers. Casey points to a balcony ten floors below. 
           A golden-skinned BABE suns herself in a backless bikini.

                                 CASEY
                        She looks even better in bed.

                                 ART
                        The high life’s sweet, ain’t it?

                                 CASEY

                        Nosa.

           Art smiles, eyes shining. The day he’s been waiting for.
                                 CASEY
                        He wants a quarter million, Homes. 
                        Who’s your daddy?

           EXT. ALAMO ARMS APARTMENT - DUSK

           Art takes a LETTER FROM Karen out of the mailbox. He tears it 
           open. A PHOTO OF MIKEY in a baseball uniform. And Art’s 
           WESTERN UNION MONEY ORDER, ripped into little pieces.

           Art slams his palm into the mailbox, denting it.

           EXT. ALAMO ARMS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Art stands on the steps, agitated, talking into his cell.

                                 ART
                        Fine. Don’t spend a dime on 
                        yourself. Just use it for Mikey.

           Art listens, fighting to keep his temper in check.

                                 ART
                        Listen, Karen. I want to come for 
                        Mikey’s birthday.

           INTERCUT KAREN IN HER KITCHEN

                                 KAREN
                        Send me a pay stub.

                                 ART
                        A what?

                                 KAREN
                        A pay stub. From your job. One with 
                        your name on it. Then you can come.
                            (beat)
                        That’s what I thought. Don’t make 
                        this harder than it is, Art.

           Art sits down on the steps, defeated.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT: DRIVING

           The Guys on the highway, Don driving. The DALLAS SKYLINE 
           looms up ahead.

                                 CASEY
                        Fuckin’ midnight buy, Homes. Big 
                        leagues.

                                 DON
                        Artie, when you give these guys the 
                        bills, do it with your right hand.
                                 ART
                        What?

                                 DON
                        I looked up some stuff on 
                        Nigerians. They think it’s rude to 
                        hand things over left-handed.

           The guys crack up.

           EXT. SKYLARK MOTEL - NIGHT

           Art pulls up to a drab, quiet motel. Cuts the engine. A beat.

                                 ART
                        Ready?

                                 DON
                        I shouldn’t a’ watched Scarface 
                        last night.

           Art leads the guys down the outside hallway to the last door: 
           Room 39. It’s so quiet they can hear the ICEMAKER.

                                 JOEY
                            (whispering to Don)
                        Which hand do they wipe with?

           Art knocks. The door opens.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Art and his crew step in and stare at FOUR NIGERIANS, all 
           dressed in impeccable suits.

           NOSA, 35, is the leader. Sharp eyes and a blinding gold 
           Rolex. His henchmen form a solid wall in front of him.

           KENNY, 30, a black American in a sweatsuit, sits on the bed.

           A SMALL DESK WITH TWO CHAIRS commands the middle of the room. 
           On it are a LAMP and a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

           The two crews eye each other -- Nosa’s stylish Nigerians, and 
           Art’s ragtag, jeans-and t-shirt crew.

                                 NOSA
                        Is this a joke?

                                 ART
                        You tell me.

           Art sits down at the desk and unzips the duffel bag. A 
           skeptical Nosa sits down across from him.

           KENNY is clearly on something -- staring straight ahead, 
           rocking back and forth on the bed.
           Nosa pulls a stack of counterfeit from Art’s duffel bag. He 
           tests it with an anti-counterfeit pen. YELLOW.

           Nosa lays a COUNTERFEIT NOTE down beside a REAL C-NOTE. He 
           studies the bills under a magnifying glass. He snorts.

                                 NOSA
                        I couldn’t pass this shit in Lagos.

                                 CASEY
                        Fuck you. Art makes the best.

           A henchman steps toward Casey. They bump chests.

                                 ART
                        Hey!

           Casey backs off. Maximum tension in the room.

           Art picks up the two bills -- COUNTERFEIT and REAL -- 
           shuffles them behind his back, and lays them down.

                                 ART
                        Which one’s real?

           CLOSE ON THE BILLS. There’s no telling them apart. Nosa 
           smiles, conceding his bluff.

                                 NOSA
                        What’s your secret?

                                 ART
                        Kinko’s.

           Everyone laughs, breaking the tension. Everyone except Kenny. 
           He’s still rocking back and forth on the bed.

                                 NOSA
                        I’ll pay you forty cents on the 
                        dollar.

                                 ART
                        Forty-five.

           A staredown. Kenny rocks faster and faster.

                                 ART
                        Your guy’s making me nervous.

           Nosa pulls out a gun with a silencer and SHOOTS KENNY THROUGH 
           THE FOREHEAD. He falls back on the covers, dead.

           Art stares in shock. Before anyone in his posse can move a 
           muscle, the Nigerians whip out SEMIAUTOMATICS. 

           A stunned beat. Don looks down -- he’s pissed himself.

                                 CASEY
                        Fuckin’ spearchuckers.
           Nosa milks the moment... then puts his gun away. He nods to 
           his men, who pocket theirs.

           Art breathes again. He rips his gaze off Kenny’s corpse.

                                 ART
                        Forty-three.

                                 NOSA
                        Done.

           Nosa opens an AIRLINE BAG filled with cash. He removes 
           several stacks.

                                 NOSA
                        I would’ve gone to forty-five.

           He hands over the bag -- LEFT HANDED. Art cuts Don a look.

           One of Nosa’s henchmen pulls a big GOLF TRAVEL BAG out of the 
           closet. He wraps Kenny’s corpse in the bed blanket, then 
           stuffs it into the golf bag.

                                 NOSA
                        I’ll want a million next month. Can 
                        you do it?

           Art nods. They shake hands. As Art heads for the door...

                                 NOSA
                        You’re forgetting something. My old 
                        supplier.

           Art and his crew stare at the golf body bag. No way. Way.

           EXT. TEXAS WILDERNESS - NIGHT

           A hill of tangled scrub brush. Joey and Casey, nervous as 
           hell, dig with shovels, working hard. Art watches the nearby 
           road for headlights.

           Don, a wreck, paces back and forth.

                                 DON
                        Fuck, fuck, fuck.

           The guys toss the golf body bag into the hole. As Joey and 
           Casey start piling dirt on it, Art walks over to Don.

                                 ART
                        Don. He would’ve killed him anyway. 
                        He did it in there to make a point.

                                 DON
                        Yeah, well point fuckin’ taken.

           A coyote howls somewhere in the darkness.
                                 DON
                        What the fuck was that?
                            (Beat)
                        We came down to print a little 
                        money, have some fun. We’re burying 
                        a fuckin’ corpse. It’s over. Right, 
                        guys?

           EXT. DON, CASEY, AND JOEY’S BUILDING - DAY

           Don tosses his bag into a RENTAL CAR. He hugs the guys and 
           gets in. He waves Art over to the window.

                                 DON
                        Remember what you told us -- always 
                        have an escape route? How’s this 
                        gonna end, Artie?

                        something, maybe.

           Art looks down -- not what he wanted to hear. Don drives off.

           EXT. ALAMO ARMS - NIGHT

           Art, still troubled, walks to his door. As he reaches for the 
           handle, Natalie pulls it open from inside, revealing...

           Plush, luxurious, SNOW-WHITE CARPET. Four inches thick.

                                 ART
                        Jesus. What did it cost?

                                 NATALIE
                        That’s not the question. The 
                        question is...

           She takes Art’s shirt off and lays him down on the carpet.
                                 NATALIE
                        How does it feel?

           Pretty damn good. She climbs on top of him.

                                 NATALIE
                        You can buy a girl anything she 
                        wants. Do you have any idea how 
                        sexy that is?

                                 ART
                            (unbuttoning her blouse)
                        Show me.

           She kisses his neck. She starts kissing down his chest.

                                 NATALIE
                        Tomorrow they do the bedroom.

           Art stares at the ceiling. Jesus. She moves lower. Jesus.

           INT. TOWER OF THE AMERICAS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Art and Natalie sit in a spinning restaurant 600 feet above 
           San Antonio. Stunning sunset views out the window.

           Natalie is sexy and radiant. Living the life she dreamed. Men 
           at other tables check her out. Art slides her the wine list.

                                 ART
                        You pick.

           A WAITER sets down two glasses of champagne.

                                 ART
                        What’s this?

           The waiter nods at the bar. DMITRI -- the Russian from the 
           parking lot buy -- lifts his glass. Art’s shocked to see him.

                                 ART
                        I’ll be right back.

           Art walks to the bar. Dmitri is paying his tab with a C- 
           NOTE. Art eyes the note warily.

                                 DMITRI
                        Don’t worry, Arthur. Your bills are 
                        in Chechnya by now.
                            (beat)
                        I’ve been authorized to make you an 
                        offer. You’d live in a villa on the 
                        Black Sea. Print one week a month. 
                        On the best equipment. Complete 
                        security. Your salary--

                                 ART
                        No thanks. I work for myself.
                                 DMITRI
                        We’d pay ten times what you could 
                        make here. With no risk, Arthur.

                                 ART
                        And no freedom.

                                 DMITRI
                        Freedom is tricky. You’re my third 
                        supplier in eighteen months. The 
                        others retired... to Leavenworth 
                        and Lompoc. Your government catches 
                        all the good ones.

                                 ART
                        And yours doesn’t?

                                 DMITRI
                        Mine can be bought.

           Dmitri hands Art a card with just a PHONE NUMBER on it. He 
           nods towards Natalie.

                                 DMITRI
                        She’s beautiful. It’s amazing what 
                        money can buy.

           Art’s not sure how to take this. He stays quiet.

                                 DMITRI
                        I can have you and Natalie out of 
                        the country in an hour.

           Art stares at him, stunned that he knows her name. Dmitri 
           smiles and walks away.

           INT. SAN ANTONIO SECRET SERVICE FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           Nina Kimm sits with DANNY MUNOZ. 35, rugged, slicked-back 
           hair. He can’t keep his eyes off Nina’s bare knees.

                                 DANNY
                        So, you’ve seen our boy up close.

           He wheels his chair to a file cabinet, grabs a folder marked 
           INTERPOL, and wheels back.

                                 DANNY
                        His bills are getting around. 
                        Europe, Asia, Africa. Drugs, the 
                        sex trade. Even dirty diamonds.

                                 NINA
                        That’s globalization for you. But 
                        nothing local?

                                 DANNY
                        Nada. He’ll slip up, though -- they 
                        always do. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        Buy himself a hooker, or a big 
                        screen TV. You want in on the bust? 
                        Stick close to me.

           She takes the Interpol folder. As she leafs through it, 
           Danny’s eyes go back to her knees.

           Nina looks up, nailing him cold. He smiles, unashamed.

           INT. ALAMO ARMS - MORNING

           Art and Natalie sleep twined together. The PHONE RINGS.

           INT. KAREN’S APARTMENT - CHICAGO - DAY: INTERCUTTING

           Karen holds the phone. Mikey looks up at her with big eyes.

                                 KAREN
                        There’s only one thing in the world 
                        your son wants for his birthday. 
                        And I can’t talk him out of it.

           Art’s face lights up. He can’t believe it. He mouths a silent 
           “Thank you.”

                                 NATALIE
                        Who is it, baby?

           EXT. ALAMO ARMS BALCONY - DAY

           Art and a pouting Natalie. She stares out over the railing.

                                 ART
                        It’s my kid, Natalie.

                                 NATALIE
                        And your Ex.

           He wraps his arms around her from behind. Kisses her neck.

                                 ART
                        Hey. As soon as I get back, we’re 
                        gonna take a little day-trip. Out 
                        to the sticks.

           He pulls out a fake New Note. He waggles it in front of her.

                                 ART
                        I’m gonna let you in on the fun. 
                        It’s time.

                                 NATALIE
                            (lighting up)
                        You mean it, baby?

           She hugs him tight. Then worry floods her eyes.
                                 NATALIE
                        Promise me you’re coming back.

                                 ART
                        Baby. 

           EXT. O’HARE AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Art’s plane touches down.

           EXT. ART’S OLD BLOCK - NIGHT

           Art sits in a cab in front of his old apartment. Emotion in 
           his face as the memories hit him. He can see the Bent Elbow 
           on the corner.

           INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

           A bushed Nina stops at the CONCIERGE DESK. EMI is on duty. 
           She’s 28. French, stylish, creamy. Instant chemistry.

                                 NINA
                        I need a Starbucks.

                                 EMI
                        Just two blocks down, Miss Kimm. 
                        But they close at nine.

                                 NINA
                        Damn. I’m an addict.

                                 EMI
                        I’ll send a coffee-maker to your 
                        room. And a choice of blends.

           Emi eyes Nina’s gun, visible beneath her open jacket. It 
           excites her. She fights to keep her voice professional. 

                                 EMI
                        I’m on till midnight. But if you 
                        ever need anything after that...

           Emi writes a number on her card. Their eyes meet.

           EXT. CHICAGO CITY BLOCK - MORNING

           Art knocks on the door of a brownstone. For Art, he’s dressed 
           to the nines -- a smart sportcoat over his jeans, and new 
           brown loafers.

           Karen opens the door. A beat. They want to hug, but don’t.

                                 ART
                        Hey.
                                 KAREN
                        Hey.

           What else to say. An awkward beat, until...

           Mikey runs up. He’s four now. A boy, not a baby. Art hugs him 
           tight, breathing him in. Overcome.

                                 ART
                        Happy birthday, Mikey. Wait -- what 
                        the hell is this?

           Mikey wears a CHICAGO CUBS’ cap and jersey.

           INT. BIG FIVE SPORTING GOODS - DAY

           Art and Mikey stand at the counter. Mikey is now dressed in a 
           WHITE SOX CAP AND JERSEY.

           Art slides the offending Cubs’ gear across the counter.

                                 ART
                        Toss that, will you? You’re a Sox 
                        fan, Mikey. That’s for life. Cubs 
                        fans are losers.

           The clerk rings up the sale.

                                 CLERK
                        Sixty-five forty.

           Art looks in his wallet.  A couple twenties, and that beat-up 
           postcard. He doesn’t have enough money.

           He reaches into his left pocket and starts to pull out a 
           COUNTERFEIT C-NOTE. But he sees Mikey. And he realizes.

                                 ART
                            (to the clerk)
                        Tell you what. Let’s just do the 
                        cap.
                            (to Mikey)
                        Sorry, buddy.

                                 MIKEY
                        That’s okay.

           Mikey takes off his jersey and hands it back. No sweat. He 
           happily creases the bill of his new cap.

           Art smiles at his kid.

                                 CLERK
                        Fourteen thirty-nine.

           Art pays with honest cash. 

           Mikey grabs Art’s hand as they walk out of the store.
           EXT. COMISKEY PARK - DAY

           Art and Mikey in box seats. They rise at the CRACK OF THE BAT 
           and high-five as a White Sox hitter legs out a double.

           INT. GO-CART PALACE - DAY

           Art, Mikey strapped in beside him, zips down a straightaway 
           and corners hard around a bale of hay. Mikey’s in heaven.

           EXT. KAREN’S BLOCK - DUSK

           Art buys Mikey a Sno-Cone from an ice cream truck. Karen 
           waits in the doorway. They walk over.

                                 ART
                        Go wash up.

           Mikey runs inside. Karen and Art sit down on the stoop. She 
           shares her beer with him.

                                 ART
                        You’re looking good.

           He touches her knee. She weakens, but only for a second.

                                 KAREN
                        What’s her name?

                                 ART
                        Natalie.

                                 KAREN
                        She knows what you do?
                            (he nods)
                        You gonna marry her?

                                 ART
                        Jesus, you are a cop.

           Art hands Karen an ENVELOPE stuffed with cash.

                                 KAREN
                        I don’t want your money, Art. How 
                        many times do I have to tell you?

                                 ART
                        My money just showed our boy the 
                        time of his life. Go ask him.

                                 KAREN
                        You didn’t have to spend a dime on 
                        him today. He just wanted his daddy 
                        back. Are these even real?
                                 ART
                        Of course they’re real. Jesus, 
                        Karen. You think I’d...

                                 KAREN
                        I don’t know. I don’t know what’s 
                        real to you anymore. I thought 
                        being a father was real. I thought 
                        it meant something.

                                 ART
                        Hey, I’m here.

                                 KAREN
                        Today. And when he wakes up  
                        tomorrow and you’re gone? What do I 
                        do -- give him this?

           She stuffs the money envelope back into Art’s pocket.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           A desolate Art sits in first class, drink in hand. He pulls 
           out the money envelope and stares glumly at the bills inside. 
           Was it worth it?

           He wags his empty glass at the stewardess.

           INT. SAN ANTONIO AIRPORT - DAY

           Art walks through the terminal gate. Resolve in his eyes. 
           Things are going to start changing, and soon. He sees:

           Natalie at the baggage carousel, wearing a KILLER RED DRESS 
           and holding a placard: “MR. WILLIAMS.”

           She’s so damn hot, and so full of excitement, that Art can’t 
           help but smile.

                                 ART
                        That’s a hell of a dress.

                                 NATALIE
                        Buy me a car to match it?

           INT. AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           Natalie leads Art to a RED CONVERTIBLE. Art stares, shocked.

                                 NATALIE
                        Relax, it’s just a rental. I want 
                        today to be special.
           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY: DRIVING

           Art and Natalie blow down the open road. Art chews on a 
           toothpick. Natalie opens her purse, showing Art a huge stack 
           of cash.

                                 NATALIE
                        I brought fifteen thousand in 
                        counterfeit.

                                 ART
                        What? I said three thousand.

                                 NATALIE
                        I didn’t want to run out.

           Art can only shake his head.

           EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

           They pull into the parking lot of a faceless Texas mall.

           Art, nervous now, pulls a bag from his suitcase. He takes out 
           THREE WIGS - RED, BLONDE, BLACK. Natalie picks the red one.

                                 ART
                        Okay. Now, the whole key is to act 
                        normal. They’re gonna stare at the 
                        bill -- that’s fine. If they--

           She’s already out of the car.

           INT. MALL - DAY

           Art sits on a bench with a newspaper, trying to look like a 
           bored husband. But his leg taps nervously as he looks into...

           INT. BED, BATH, AND BEYOND - DAY

           ... where Natalie lays scented candles on the counter. She 
           hands over a C-Note. The CLERK marks it with a PEN. YELLOW.

                                 CLERK
                        Seventy-eight nineteen’s your 
                        change. Let’s get you a bag.

           Natalie smiles at Art. She walks out of the store and to him.

                                 ART
                        You’re a natural.
           SERIES OF SHOTS

           Natalie passes C-Notes at: Pottery Barn... Books-A-Million... 
           a hip boutique.

           EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - DAY

           A dazed Art stuffs more bags into the car’s packed trunk.

                                 ART
                        Forget natural. You’re a machine.

                                 NATALIE
                        Just a few more stores. Please.

           Art’s had his fill. But the look in her eyes... she’s got 
           him. He sighs and nods.

           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - DUSK

           Nina Kimm splashes water on her face. She’s flushed and 
           trembling. Her CELL PHONE RINGS.

                                 NINA
                        Kimm.

           INT. SAN ANTONIO FIELD OFFICE - DUSK: INTERCUTTING

           Danny Munoz stands with one boot on his desk.

                                 DANNY
                        We got an address.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Nina hangs up. We can hear a stereo playing. Nina walks out 
           of the bathroom.

           Emi, the concierge, sits on the bed, her shirt unbuttoned.

                                 NINA
                        I have to go.

           INT. NINA’S CAR - DRIVING

           Danny Munoz holds a counterfeit New Note. 

                                 DANNY
                        An illegal tried to take it to the 
                        bank. The guy’s a carpet-layer. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        Claims he laid a six-thousand-
                        dollar shag at a lady’s apartment, 
                        and she tipped him with the note.

                                 NINA
                        Sure she did. Or he took it off her 
                        dresser.

                                 DANNY
                        Right. Still, a six-grand shag in a 
                        one-bedroom? Worth a look.

           EXT. ALAMO ARMS APT. - NIGHT

           Nina and Danny knock on the door. No answer. The LANDLORD 
           lets them in. They enter carefully and start searching.

           INT. RED CONVERTIBLE - DUSK - DRIVING

           Art can see the San Antonio skyline. Almost home.

           Natalie rides sans seatbelt. She’s bouncing up and down, 
           flying high on adrenaline.

                                 NATALIE
                        You never told me how much fun it 
                        is. When they take that bill, baby. 
                        When they give you change. It’s 
                        magic. Let’s do it again tomorrow.

                                 ART
                        Whoa. One shot, remember?  Believe 
                        me, you made the most of it.

           INT. ALAMO ARMS KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Nina stands at the counter. Danny walks in.

                                 DANNY
                        Nada. You?

           Nina, eyes shining, holds up an ANTI-COUNTERFEITING PEN.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOME - CHICAGO: NIGHT

           Dale Jerrod sits on his couch, eating ice cream and watching 
           the Bulls on TV. He talks into the phone.

                                 DALE
                        Stake out the place, but don’t 
                        bring ‘em in. If we can hit a buy, 
                        or track him to his equipment, we 
                        can put him away for good.
           INT. RED CONVERTIBLE - DUSK - DRIVING

                                 NATALIE
                        Take this exit, baby.

                                 ART
                        But it’s not ours.

                                 NATALIE
                        Just take it.
                            (he does)
                        Didn’t I say today would be 
                        special?

           EXT. RIVERWALK HOTEL - DUSK

           Art pulls up to a Four-Star hotel. He can’t believe it. The 
           valet opens the door for him. He reluctantly steps out.

                                 NATALIE
                        I got us the penthouse.

           She heads for the lobby. Art tosses down his toothpick, his 
           patience wearing thin. He follows her.

           INT. RIVERWALK HOTEL LOBBY - DUSK

           Art and Natalie sneak a peek into the rocking bar as they 
           walk past. Texas-sized good times going on. A KARAOKE COWGIRL 
           belts out David Allan Coe’s redneck anthem...

                                 KARAOKE COWGIRL
                        If that ain’t country...

           ... then holds the mic out to the crowd.

                                 CROWD
                        ... I’ll kiss your ass.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           They walk in. A deluxe room, beautiful and spacious.

                                 NATALIE
                        Do you like it?

           Art doesn’t answer. He takes out the stacks of counterfeit 
           and looks for a hiding place.

           He opens the closet. On the shelf is a ROLLED QUILT. He hides 
           the stacks under the quilt’s folds.

           Natalie takes Art by the hand and pushes him onto the bed.
                                 NATALIE
                        I missed you.

           She reaches for his belt. He stops her. He’s not into it.

                                 NATALIE
                        What’s wrong, baby?
                            (beat)
                        It’s your Ex, isn’t it? She’s been 
                        giving you guilt.

                                 ART
                        No, it’s not my Ex, Natalie. You 
                        wanna know what it is? It’s this 
                        hotel. And that dress. And the 
                        fuckin’ convertible.
                            (anger rising)
                        And the rugs, and the paintings, 
                        and the restaurants. It’s you 
                        burning through cash like there’s 
                        no tomorrow. Christ, I’m gonna need 
                        another press just to keep you in 
                        clothes.
                            (beat)
                        We can’t keep going like this. We 
                        need a plan.

                                 NATALIE
                        C’mere.

           She leads him out onto the balcony. The nearby highway is a 
           snarl of bumber-to-bumper traffic.

                                 NATALIE
                        Look at ‘em. Trapped. We’ll never 
                        have to live like that, baby. We 
                        can go anywhere. Do anything. We’re 
                        free.

                                 ART
                        You’re free. I got a kid, Natalie.

                                 NATALIE
                        So send him money. You can always 
                        make more.

           Art slaps her face hard. A stunned beat.

           Natalie backs into the room and sits down on the bed. She 
           bites her lip, trembling.

                                 NATALIE
                        I’m going down to the bar.

                                 ART
                        Dressed like that?

                                 NATALIE
                        It’s who I am. Who are you, Art?
           She walks out of the room. Art goes straight to the liquor 
           cabinet.

           INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

           A BLACK MAN in a white Stetson growls ZZ TOP’S LA GRANGE into 
           the karaoke microphone.

           Natalie, upset, steps to the bar.

                                 NATALIE
                        A shot of Cuervo. And a margarita.

           He pours the shot and starts mixing the margarita.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Eight-fifty.

                                 NATALI
                        Dammit! I forgot my purse.

                                 BARTENDER
                        You can charge it to your room.
                            (beat)
                        You okay?

           She nods and downs her shot.

           Natalie moves through the packed crowd, margarita in hand. No 
           seats anywhere. Except...

           TEX MATHIS, 45, wearing a bright pink Armani shirt, shares a 
           booth with two BABES. He gestures to Natalie -- there’s room 
           for one more.

           She ignores him and keeps searching... but there really isn’t 
           a single free seat in the place. She slides into Tex’s booth -
           - any port in a storm. He smiles at her.

           Natalie nods blankly, but she’s not up for company. She downs 
           half her margarita and watches the BLACK COWBOY rock ZZ TOP.

                                 BLACK COWBOY
                        Have Mercy. A haw haw haw haw.

           DISSOLVE SHOTS as the BLACK COWBOY becomes a FAT WOMAN 
           singing DESPERADO... and then a FEY GENT singing STAYING 
           ALIVE... and finally a HIP CHICK singing MONEY.

                                 SINGER
                        They say the best things in life 
                        are free/But you can give them to 
                        the birds and bees/I want money...

           BOOTH
           Two margaritas later. Natalie watches the front door, hoping 
           Art will walk through it. Tex nods at one of his Babes, who 
           shows Natalie a BULLET OF COCAINE.

                                 BABE
                        This’ll cheer you up.

           Natalie glances at the door -- still no Art. She does a hit.

           AT THE BAR

           The BARTENDER sees Natalie hit off the bullet.

           EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - NIGHT

           Art stands at the railing, holding one of his beautiful 
           fakes. He’s searching BEN FRANKLIN’S SMILE for an answer.

           Art looks down at the street. A LONE HARLEY, bold and free, 
           zooms up the on-ramp and blasts away down the dark highway.

           There’s Art’s answer. He walks off the balcony...

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           ... and to the elevators. The doors open: Natalie. Crying. 
           Beautiful. She runs into his arms.

                                 NATALIE
                        I’m sorry, baby. I’ll be so good. 
                        You’ll see. Mikey can come out this 
                        summer. He’ll have a blast.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           The BARTENDER talks with two PLAINCLOTHES COPS. He points 
           toward Tex’s booth... but Tex and his entourage are gone.

           The bartender shows the cops a BAR CHECK: NATALIE’S 
           SIGNATURE. ROOM 427.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Art lies on the bed. Natalie pulls off his jeans. She steps 
           out of her dress.

           She walks to the closet.... grabs a wig... and comes to him 
           as a redhead, wearing just bra and panties.

           The PHONE RINGS. Simultaneously: a KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

           Art answers the phone: Just a DIAL TONE.
                                 ART
                        Natalie -- don’t!

           Too late. She opens the door a crack.

           TWO COPS rush in, guns drawn. LANNOM, 30, sunburnt and wiry. 
           HINZ, 28, short and thick.

                                 LANNOM
                        On the floor! Both of you!

           Art and Natalie get on the floor.

                                 ART
                        Let her put something on.

                                 LANNOM
                        I don’t remember deputizing you. 
                        Tell you what -- give us the coke, 
                        and she can cover her assets.

                                 ART
                        Coke? You got the wrong room, guys.

                                 LANNOM
                        Sure we do. That’s why she’s down 
                        there tootin’ with Tex Mathis.

           Art stares at Natalie. Tears in her eyes, her heart breaking.

           Hinz starts pulling out dresser drawers. He looks under the 
           bed. Dumps out Natalie’s purse. Checks their clothes.

           Lannom’s eyes roam over Natalie.

           Hinz walks to the closet. He tosses out all of Natalie’s 
           clothes. He holds up the blond and black wigs.

                                 LANNOM
                        Which one matches the carpet?

           The closet is empty now. Except for that quilt on the shelf. 
           Hinz reaches up. Feels underneath it.

           Art can’t watch. He stares at the floor. A SHARP WHISTLE.

                                 HINZ
                        Looks like we got sellers, not 
                        buyers.

           Hinz tosses the stacks of money onto the bed. Natalie is 
           hyperventilating. Art squeezes her hand.

                                 ART
                        Listen. You guys came for drugs. 
                        There’s no drugs.
                            (beat)
                        I didn’t... put... any... money... 
                        in that closet. So there shouldn’t 
                        be any in there when you leave.
           Lannom looks at Hinz. Free dough, no paperwork. Pretty 
           tempting. He lifts Natalie’s chin.

                                 LANNOM
                        He’s done his part, honey. What are 
                        you gonna do for us?

           Natalie, trembling, starts to slip off her bra, but Art wraps 
           a shirt around her.

                                 ART
                        No way.

           Lannom smiles and turns to go. Hinz is staring at a C-note. 
           He rubs it. Stares some more.

                                 HINZ
                        Something’s not right. With this 
                        money.

           Lannom holds the C-Note up to a lamp. Security strip. 
           Watermark. Color-shifting ink.

                                 LANNOM
                        That’s a fuckin’ C-Note. Let’s go.

                                 HINZ
                        No. It doesn’t feel right. I put 
                        myself through school as a teller.

           Hinz sits on the bed, studying the bills.

                                 HINZ
                        Fuckin’ A.

           He lays two bills side by-side. Their SERIAL NUMBERS ARE 
           IDENTICAL.

           Art looks at Natalie. Armageddon.

           INT. HOLDING TANK - EARLY MORNING

           Art sits on a stone bench in a killer-bright room. An 
           incessant, metallic clanging sounds from somewhere. Art is 
           completely fried -- busted, hungover, sleep-deprived.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MORNING

           Art sits alone at a table. Nina Kimm walks in.

                                 NINA
                        How are you doing, Art?

                                 ART
                        I could use a massage chair.
                                 NINA
                        Not many of those where you’re 
                        going.
                            (she hands him a 
                             cigarette)
                        What was the best part? The money? 
                        The power? What was it, Art?

           INT. CHICAGO SECRET SERVICE FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           Dale Jerrod, cigar in hand, stands in front of his agents. 
           ART’S MUG SHOT is projected on the wall behind him.

                                 DALE
                        Mister Art Williams. Apprehended.

           The room cheers.

           INT. JAIL CELL - DAY

           Art sits in his cell. He’s reading a POLICE REPORT.

           INT. HOLDING ROOM - DAY

           Art sits with his attorney, GRACE LINDE, 41. She’s a 90-
           pound, no-b.s. rottweiler.

                                 ART
                        This arrest report is a crock.

           She stares at him. Yeah, right.

           INT. HOTEL DALLAS HALLWAY - DAY

           A MAID cleans Room 427. Grace Linde steps into the open 
           doorway and SNAPS A PHOTO.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Art sits at the defense table, hope in his eyes. He 
           watches...

           Grace Linde pace slowly in front of the JUDGE.

                                 GRACE
                        In his arrest report, Officer 
                        Lannom said that when Miss Clark 
                        opened the door, they could see a 
                        huge stack of bills on the 
                        nightstand. That was their probable 
                        cause for barging in.

           Grace hands PAPERS to the JUDGE.
                                 GRACE
                        People’s Exhibit A.

           CLOSE ON LEGAL DOCUMENT: The PHOTO of Room 427.

                                 GRACE
                        It’s a pretty good lie... except 
                        you can’t see the nightstand from 
                        the door.

           The disgusted judge glares at the nervous PROSECUTION LAWYER.

                                 JUDGE
                        Tell me you have an answer for 
                        this.

                                 LAWYER
                        Your honor...

           His face says it all. Screwed, blued, and tattooed.

                                 JUDGE
                        Case dismissed.

           DEFENDANT’S TABLE

           Art smiles and shakes Grace’s hand. She smiles wryly at him.

                                 GRACE
                        I’ll take a check.

           Art laughs. He hugs Natalie. High-fives Casey and Joey.

           Nina Kimm looks on from the gallery. On his way to the door, 
           Art stops beside her.

                                 ART
                        The best part was the freedom.

           Nina smiles sadly. Art looks wistful, uncertain. Was he ever 
           really free?

           INT. CHICAGO SECRET SERVICE FIELD OFFICE - NIGHT

           Dale Jerrod slams down his phone and fires his keys across 
           the room. He stares out the window at the gray Chicago River.

           EXT. AZTEC GRILL - SAN ANTONIO - NIGHT

           Art, Natalie, Casey, & Joey celebrate beside the Riverwalk.

           BY THE DOOR

           Nina and Danny Munoz.
           Danny intercepts a WAITER carrying a tray of drinks. 

                                 DANNY
                        Federal agent. I’ll take that.

           He carries the tray to Art’s table. He slams it down, 
           splashing beer all over Casey. Casey starts up.

                                 CASEY
                        What the fuck, Homes?

           Danny shoves him down. He sticks his badge in Art’s face.

                                 DANNY
                        Every second ‘til you’re dead or in 
                        jail there’s gonna be a Fed close 
                        enough to hand you the Charmin.

           Nina nods at Art from the door.

           EXT. ALAMO ARMS APT. - DAY

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        He wasn’t kidding.

           Art and Natalie walk to their car. Nina is parked behind it.

           INT. 7-11 - NIGHT

           Art buys a six-pack. Danny Munoz waits by the door.

           EXT. BARRIO HOUSE - DAY

           The house sits quietly.

           INT. BARRIO BASEMENT - DAY

           Art’s equipment lies idle. A BAG OF CASH sits on the floor.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        I couldn’t go near my equipment. Or 
                        even send the guys for my stash.

           EXT. CASEY’S BALCONY  -  DAY

           Casey and Joey watch MOVERS haul boxes into the apartment 
           next door. A BUZZCUT GUY steps out onto the balcony.

                                 MAN
                        Hiya, neighbors. Federal Agent Cox.
           EXT. ALAMO - DAY

           Casey and Joey stand outside the historic fort.

                                 JOEY
                        Five bucks says you can’t tell me 
                        what happened here.

                                 CASEY
                        Patton got his ass kicked by the 
                        Mexicans.

           Art walks up. The trio sits down, their backs to the Alamo. 
           Across the street, TWO AGENTS watch from a parked car.

                                 JOEY
                        Fuckin’ jagoffs are everywhere.

                                 ART
                        Yeah. No phone calls, right? Don’t 
                        say shit in your apartment. Or in 
                        your cars. We gotta lie low.

                                 CASEY
                        I got bills, Homes.

                                 ART
                        Think I don’t? I can’t print, and I 
                        can’t grind.
                            (beat)
                        They’ll give up.

           SUPER THE LEGEND: “TWO MONTHS LATER”

           EXT. ALAMO ARMS FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

           A frazzled Art, beer in hand, looks down at TWO AGENTS parked 
           on the street. Behind him, inside, a worn-out Natalie smokes 
           at the kitchen table.

           INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

           Natalie pushes her cart to the checkout line. The MAN in 
           front of her -- the buzzcut AGENT COX -- waves her ahead.

                                 NATALIE
                        Thanks.

                                 AGENT COX
                        Sure thing. No lemon frozen yogurt 
                        today?

           Shaken, she rushes out of the store without her groceries.
           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Art and Natalie stand together in the shower, steaming water 
           pouring over them. Natalie is sobbing.

                                 NATALIE
                        They know what we eat. Where we go. 
                        We can’t even make love.

           She slides down the wall, sobbing. Art holds her.

                                 NATALIE
                        We’re broke, Art.

                                 ART
                        We gotta hang in there. I’m working 
                        on it. I swear.

                                 NATALIE
                        How? It’s impossible.

                                 ART
                        You trust me, baby?

           A beat. She nods.

           INT. PEPSI PLANT - MORNING

           Art punches the time clock. His old buddy Juan smiles.

                                 JUAN
                        Look who’s back.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Nina and Danny Munoz, parked by the plant, watch through a 
           fence as Art -- wearing a GRAY, HOODED SWEATSHIRT -- loads 
           cases of soda onto a truck.

                                 DANNY
                        Doesn’t the real world suck?
                        He’s going for the Eminem look.

                                 NINA
                        Now there’s a guy who’s printing 
                        money.

           Art walks out of the payment shack and slides into the

           EXT. MCDONALD’S DRIVE-THRU - NIGHT

           Natalie pulls up to the drive-thru window. Art gets out and 
           walks back to the Secret Service car.

                                 AGENT
                        What’s this?

           Art lifts his sweatshirt hood. IT’S NOT ART. IT’S CASEY.

                                 CASEY
                        Fuck both of youse, Homes.

           He flips the agents the double bird.

           Natalie watches from the car. She holds a BRAND-NEW CELL 
           PHONE.

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           Art walks out of the payment shack, wearing one of Casey’s

           Nina and Danny. Dale Jerrod talks from a speaker phone.
                                 DALE JERROD (O.S.)
                        He’s either printing, or he’s 
                        running.

                                 NINA
                        He’s not running. Not without her.

           INT. ALAMO ARMS KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Nina and Natalie sit at the table. A red-faced, furious Danny 
           Munoz stands by the window.

                                 NATALIE
                        The second I hear from him...

                                 DANNY
                            (slamming his fist)
                        You thought we were up your ass 
                        before...

           INT. ART’S CAR - NIGHT

           Art is parked on the street. He talks on his cell phone.

                                 ART
                        Put it in motion.

           Art stares at the highway on-ramp up the street. War in his 
           eyes. He drives up the ramp.

           EXT. MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL STADIUM - NIGHT

           The San Antonio Missions play a game under the lights. Casey 
           and Joey sit in box seats, drinking beers.

           Casey stands. An AGENT follows him up the stairs...

           ... to the door of the bathroom.

                                 CASEY
                        Come on in, jagoff. You can hold it 
                        for me.

           The agent waits outside.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Casey steps to the urinal. He unzips and looks to his right. 
           Nosa, the Nigerian, stands at the next urinal. 

                                 CASEY
                        Five million in paper. Forty cents 
                        on the dollar. Yes or no, Homes?
           EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT: DRIVING

           Art grips the wheel as he drives. He’s nervous. 

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        One monster print run, to set me up 
                        for life. I was either gettin’ 
                        away, or goin’ away.
                            (beat)
                        But there was one trip I had to 
                        make first.

           Art passes a town sign: SEEVERS, TEXAS. POP. 1,392.

           He parks on a residential block and stares at a small house.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        I got the address from the Bureau 
                        of Prisons.

           Art walks to the door and rings the bell.

           PAULINE opens the door. A beat as Art realizes who he’s 
           staring at -- the sexy waitress his father left town with all 
           those years ago. She’s haggard now.

                                 PAULINE
                        Yes?

           Art Sr. appears behind her. The years have been rough on him, 
           too. He stares at his son.

                                 ART SR.
                            (to Pauline)
                        Put on some food, will you?

           Art hugs his Dad.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Art and his father sit at the table. Art Sr. pours tall shots 
           of Scotch. They clink and drink.

           A long, awkward beat. What to say? Art Sr. lights a cigarette 
           and pours two more shots. Pauline flits around nervously.

                                 ART SR.
                        I knew this day would come.

                                 PAULINE
                        He did. He kept saying “One day...”

           A beat. Still awkward as hell. They down their shots again.
           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Half the Scotch bottle is gone. Beers on the table now too. 
           Art and his Dad are laughing.

                                 ART SR.
                        Ain’t that the truth.
                            (beat)
                        So, what do you do? For money?
                            (Art looks away)
                        Hey, I ain’t exactly the fuckin’ 
                        Pope. You can tell me.

           Art sips his beer. He’s waited half his life for this moment.

                                 ART
                        I make money.

           A long beat. Art Sr. gets it. He smiles.

                                 ART SR.
                        No shit. You do all right?

                                 ART
                        Yeah. I do okay.

                                 ART SR.
                        A counterfeiter. Attaboy.

           Art soaks it in. He sips his beer to hide a smile.

                                 ART SR.
                        Got any on you?

           A beat. Finally, Art holds all the cards.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A steel lunchpail sits on the table. Inside is a PORTABLE 
           COUNTERFEITING KIT. Separate baggies for the New Note fronts, 
           the backs, the watermarks, and the security threads.

           Art sits at the table, making his father a New Note. He’s 
           almost done -- just the SECURITY THREAD left. He holds it 
           with tweezers.

                                 ART
                            (pointing to his head)
                        Actually, most of counterfeiting’s 
                        up here, Dad. Lotta figuring.

                                 ART SR. 
                        Are you seein’ this, Pauline? The 
                        kid fuckin’ makes money.

           Art is proud as hell to be showing off his craft. And Art Sr. 
           is mesmerized. He’s also loaded.
                                 ART
                        This is called a security thread. I 
                        did it on a computer.

           Art holds it up. Art Sr. leans in, swaying. His cigarette 
           TOUCHES THE SECURITY THREAD AND BURNS IT TO A CRISP.

                                 ART SR. 
                        Whoops. Fire in the hole.
                            (he laughs)
                        Sorry.

           Art leaves out the security thread and just glues the front 
           to the back.

                                 ART SR.
                        I shoudda thought of this. Here I 
                        am, bustin’ my balls for every 
                        dollar, and you’re gluing the stuff 
                        together. Shortcut.

                                 ART
                        Actually, it’s really hard. The 
                        shit you gotta know, Dad...

           Art wraps the note in a napkin. He’s screwed a C-CLAMP to the 
           counter to serve as a crude press. 

           He slides the bill between its jaws and tightens the clamp.

                                 ART
                        It takes a little while to dry.

           They face each other across the table. Art Sr. crushes out 
           his cigarette and lights another. Pounds his beer.

                                 ART
                        Dad, listen...

           Art Sr. raises a hand, cutting him off. A beat.

                                 ART SR.
                        Hey, I got no excuse. Okay? But... 
                        it’s like I had to kill off a part 
                        of me so the rest of me could live.

           Art stares at his father. That’s all he’s gonna get.

                                 ART SR.
                        But hey, look at you. Big-time 
                        fuckin’ counterfeiter.

                                 ART
                        Yeah.

           Art loosens the clamp and unwraps the note. He hands it to 
           his father, who stares at it, amazed. The awesome, primal 
           power of money.

           He sits down and rocks back and forth, staring at the bill.
                                 ART SR. 
                        My fuckin’ kid. Just like that.
                        Attaboy.

           Art fights back tears. Everything he’s waited for.

                                 ART
                        See Dad, it--

           But Art Sr. is snoring. Passed out. Pauline takes the 
           cigarette from his hand.

                                 PAULINE
                        When he goes, he goes fast.
                        I’ll fix up a room for you.

           She leaves. Art stares at his Dad -- eyes closed, mouth open, 
           stinking drunk. Clutching the counterfeit note.

           Art walks out of the kitchen. He pauses in the living room. 
           He can hear Pauline upstairs, getting that room ready. He 
           walks out the front door.

           INT. ART’S CAR - NIGHT

           Art sits at the wheel. He takes out the old San Antonio 
           postcard, crumples it up, and tosses it out the window.

           He stares at a PHOTO OF MIKEY. A decision to make.

           INT. CAR - DAY: DRIVING

           Art on the highway. His cell phone rings. He listens.

                                 ART
                        Don’t worry. I’ll be there.

           He gives it gas.

           INT. SAN ANTONIO SECRET SERVICE FIELD OFFICE - NIGHT

           Nina, sipping her Starbucks, burns the midnight oil. She 
           pages through a volume of COUNTERFEIT NOTES. It’s full of 
           cheap knockoffs. Copy-machine jobs... Ink-jet specials... 
           Dollar bills with the “ONES” bleached off.

           Nina looks over at ART’S SKETCH on the wall.

                                 NINA
                        Wannabes.

           INT. BARRIO HOUSE - NIGHT

           Art opens the door to the basement. All his equipment is 
           sitting there. Waiting.
           LATER

           Art works feverishly, making bills. He’s fast and steady, 
           walking the length of his work table, affixing SECURITY 
           THREADS and WATERMARKS to a long row of NOTE-BACKS.

           All the machines are running full-bore. The PRINTING PRESS 
           churns out green sheets of bills. The HYDRAULIC PRESS 
           flattens finished notes. The DRYER tumbles them dry.

           EXT. RACETRACK - DAY

           A rowdy crowd roars as a pack of thoroughbreds thunder down 
           the back stretch and hit the finish line.

           Art’s father groans and rips up his betting ticket. He looks 
           up at the betting windows, weighing a decision.

           EXT. BETTING WINDOWS - DAY

                                 ART SR.
                        A hundred on Number Two to win.

                                 CLERK
                        Hundred to win on Two.

           Art Sr. hands him a C-NOTE. The clerk holds it up.

           CLOSE ON C-NOTE: THERE’S NO SECURITY THREAD.

           The clerk doesn’t flinch. He accepts the bill, but discreetly 
           nods to a COP stationed nearby.

                                 CLERK
                        Just a sec, guy. Printer’s jammed.

           A beat. Art Sr. looks at the printer... at the clerk... then 
           makes a run for it. Too late. The cop tackles him. Art Sr. 
           lets out a strangled cry and pounds the ground.

           INT. ART’S BASEMENT - DAY

           Art, with a three-day beard, lies on his back on the floor, 
           surrounded by an ocean of green. Counterfeit everywhere.

           He’s exhausted, loopy, triumphant. He’s done it. He starts 
           laughing and flips the double-bird up at the gods.

           INT. SECRET SERVICE FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           An AGENT lays Art Sr.’s counterfeit note on a scanner.

           ON COMPUTER SCREEN: “SEARCHING DATABASE... MATCH FOUND.”
           ART’S MUG SHOT appears on the screen.

                                 AGENT
                        Bing-fucking-o.

           INT. CHICAGO FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           Dale Jerrod picks up the phone. He listens, eyes gleaming.

           INT. HOLDING TANK - DAY

           TWO SECRET SERVICE AGENTS grill a terrified Art Sr.

                                 AGENT #1
                        Fifteen years for passing one lousy 
                        bill. You’d think we’re in Iran, 
                        right? But that’s the statute.

                                 AGENT #2
                        Or you can watch the World Series 
                        at home, with a beer.
                            (beat)
                        Where is he?

           Art Sr. twists his hands, desperate. Tears in his eyes.

                                 ART SR.
                        Please.... It’s my boy.

           The agents stare back, unmoved.

                                 AGENT #1
                        C’mon, Art. We’re gonna get him 
                        either way.

           INT. ART’S BASEMENT - DAY

           Art stares down at two briefcases packed to the gills with 
           counterfeit notes. A cool five million in paper.

           Art pulls up TWO DUMMY FLOORBOARDS and hides the briefcases 
           beneath them.

           He walks up the basement stairs. At the top, he freezes. 
           ART’S POV: A SHADOW under the door. He puts his ear to it.

           A FIST smashes through the cheap wood and sends Art sprawling 
           down the stairs.

           Romo and CARNEY, a thick Stolin thug, burst down the stairs.

                                 ROMO
                        How the hell you been? Some jagoffs 
                        never fuckin’ learn.
           Romo slams Art into the long table, then into the printing 
           press. Carney slams him into the dryer.

           Art grabs a paint roller and hits Carney in the face, 
           striping his eyes money-green, blinding him.

           Carney staggers backward, steps hard on the dummy floorboard, 
           and crashes through it, EXPOSING THE BRIEFCASES.

           As Art stares in horror at the briefcases, Romo knocks him to 
           his knees with a gut shot, then out cold with an uppercut.

           INT. BARRIO BASEMENT - LATER

           Romo slaps Art awake.

           ART’S BLURRY POV: Carney sits at the long table. The 
           counterfeit bills are on the table, stacked and counted.

           Romo holds a cell phone to Art’s ear.

           INT. BENT ELBOW BACK ROOM - NIGHT: INTERCUTTING

           Stolin sips vodka. Don, pale and sweating, in the first 
           stages of insulin shock, is cuffed to the leg of the pool 
           table. His KIT lies out of reach on the green felt.

           Stolin holds the phone up to Don.

                                 DON
                        Artie, I fucked up. I’m sorry.

           Stolin takes back the phone.

                                 STOLIN
                        Your three fuck buddies disappear 
                        six months after I run you out of 
                        town. All of a sudden Donny Boy 
                        comes back with enough money to buy 
                        out his uncle’s cab, and Casey’s 
                        old bitch mom can pay a live-in 
                        nurse to wipe her ass for her. I 
                        was born at night, but not last 
                        night.

           EXT. CRUSHING YARD - DAY

           Art’s rental car hauls a small trailer into the yard. A 30-
           foot-high CRUSHER stands like a metal dinosaur.

           The YARD OPERATOR eyes Art dubiously. Black eye, swollen 
           cheek, pained breathing. What the hell happened to you?

                                 ART
                        Rodeo.

           The operator peers into the trailer. All of Art’s counterfeit 
           equipment is wrapped in heavy blankets. 

                                 YARD OPERATOR
                        The blankets gotta come off.

                                 ART
                        They can’t come off.

                        We keep a record of everything we 
                        crush.

           Art holds up three crisp C-Notes.

                        ‘Cept on Tuesdays.

           INT. ART’S CAR - DAY

           Art, agitated, his mind working, watches the monstrous 
           crusher turn his machines into sheet metal.

           His CELL PHONE RINGS.

                                 ART
                        Hello? Dad.
                            (beat)
                        What do you mean?

           Art listens. He lowers the phone in shock. We can hear Art 
           Sr.’s broken voice.
                                 ART SR. (O.S.)
                        I told ‘em nuthin’, I swear. Say 
                        something, boy...

           Art kills the call. He punches the dashboard over and over. 
           It’s all going to shit.

           EXT. ALAMO ARMS APT. - NIGHT

           Nina sits in her car, watching Art’s apartment. Music on the 
           radio. Her cell phone rings.

                                 NINA
                        Kimm.

           INT. ALAMO ARMS KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Natalie and Nina at the table. Natalie smokes a cigarette. 
           Her tanktop strap slips off her shoulder. Nina looks away.

                                 NINA
                        We took a thumbprint off the bill 
                        Art made for his father. He’s going 
                        to prison, Natalie. You are too if 
                        you don’t help us.
                            (beat)
                        I’ve seen your closets. Prison 
                        gray’s not your color.

           Natalie’s CELL PHONE RINGS from the counter. A beat. They 
           both know who’s calling. Natalie walks to the counter.

           She stares at the ringing cell phone. Desperation in her 
           eyes. She doesn’t answer. It stops ringing.

                                 NATALIE
                        The buy is at the Motel Six out on

                        How much?

                                 NATALIE
                        A lot. But if he doesn’t see me in 
                        the parking lot, he won’t go 
                        through with it. And he’ll have a 
                        lookout. If you follow me, he’ll 
                        know.

                                 NINA
                        We’ll handle everything.
           INT. NATALIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Natalie lies in bed, eyes open, clutching her cell phone. It 
           vibrates. She stares at it.

           INT. VAGABOND INN OFFICE - NIGHT

           Art walks in. The manager looks him over.

                                 ART
                        I need a room.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Art sits on the bed, the SUITCASES open beside him. He stares 
           at his money. He takes out a notebook and starts to sketch.

           INT. SAN ANTONIO FIELD OFFICE - NIGHT

           DEREK, 36, a technician, works at a desk as Nina and Danny 
           watch. He’s removing a stone from Natalie’s ETERNITY 
           NECKLACE. In its place, he installs a GPS TRACKING CHIP.

                                 DANNY
                        That’s what you get for banging a 
                        Mormon.

           INT. VAGABOND INN - NIGHT

           Art dozes, the notebook on his chest. A KILLER SKETCH OF 
           MIKEY on the page. White Sox cap and all.

           THE ALARM SOUNDS: 3:30 A.M. Art opens his eyes.

           EXT. ALAMO ARMS APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Natalie walks down the steps. She opens the mailbox. The 
           Eternity Necklace lies inside. She slips it on.

           She walks toward a waiting YELLOW CAB.

           EXT. MOTEL SIX - NIGHT

           Establishing shot. A quiet night like a million others.

           INT. ROOM 11 - NIGHT

           NOSA and his five henchmen wait, armed to the teeth.
           Nosa looks in his AIRPORT BAG. Instead of CASH, this time 
           it’s full of SHREDDED NEWSPAPER.

           A Henchman checks the clip in his gun. He nods at Nosa.

                                 NOSA
                        Let him look in the bag first. A 
                        man should know his fate.

           EXT. ROOM 10 - NIGHT

           Establishing shot of the ROOM NEXT DOOR.

           INT. ROOM 10 - NIGHT

           SIX ARMED SECRET SERVICE AGENTS in bullet-proof vests wait 
           quietly. Nina, Danny, and Agent Cox are among them. They 
           whisper when they speak.

           Derek, the technician, monitors a GPS SCREEN on his laptop. 
           ON GPS SCREEN: A RED, MOVING DOT.

                                 DEREK
                        She’s on her way.

                        She’ll call us when she sees him.

           EXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Romo and Carney sit in their rental car, watching the door to 
           Room 11. Carney screws a silencer onto his gun.

                                 CARNEY
                        Back of the head?

           INT. ART’S CAR - DRIVING

           Art drives, the briefcases beside him. He stabs the radio 
           buttons. A U2 song. He smiles.

           EXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Natalie’s Yellow Cab pulls into the parking lot.

           INT. ROMO’S CAR - NIGHT

           Romo checks his watch: 4:03. He’s antsy.
           INT. ROOM 11 - NIGHT

           Nosa checks his watch: 4:03. He and his men are on edge.

           INT. ROOM 10 - NIGHT

           The agents wait tensely. Nina’s CELL PHONE VIBRATES. She nods 
           at the agents, who all move to the door.

           INT. ROOM 11 - NIGHT

           A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Nosa’s henchman opens the door on... 

           Romo and Carney. They stare at a roomful of armed, bad-ass 
           Nigerians. They draw their guns.

           Nosa’s men whip out theirs. A standoff. 

                                 ROMO
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        Freeze! Drop your weapons!

           The Secret Service, guns drawn, quickly fan out in shooting 
           formation behind Romo and Carney.

                                 DANNY
                        I mean it! On the fuckin’ floor!

           A long beat. Nosa nods to his men, who drop their guns and 
           lie down. Romo and Carney do the same.

           The agents move in. Nina races into the bathroom. No Art. As 
           her fellow agents cuff everyone, she walks out the door.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Nina sees the YELLOW CAB. She walks over. The CABBIE leans 
           out the window. 

                                 CABBIE
                        You Nina?

           He hands her Natalie’s Eternity Necklace.

                                 CABBIE
                        She paid me a c-note to bring it 
                        here. Said you’d understand.
           EXT. ALAMO - NIGHT

           Art sits on the low wall in front of the Alamo. The 
           briefcases are beside him. He’s holding the CARD WITH A PHONE 
           NUMBER that Dmitri gave him weeks ago.

                                 DMITRI (V.O.)
                        You understand this is permanent, 
                        Arthur. There’s no coming back.

           A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR pulls to the curb.

           The car door opens -- Natalie. She shakes out her hair and 
           smiles. Ravishing.

           The driver’s window rolls down -- Casey. Joey sits beside 
           him. Art walks toward the Town Car.

                                 DMITRI (V.O.)
                        You made the right choice. You’re 
                        the best in the world -- now you’ll 
                        be paid like it. Life’s too short 
                        to worry about money.

           INT. BLACK TOWN CAR - NIGHT: DRIVING

           Art and Natalie sit side by side. She opens the briefcase and 
           stares in wonder at the stacks of counterfeit.

                                 CASEY
                        What about Don?

           Art looks out the window.

           INT. BENT ELBOW BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Stolin stares down at his cell phone. It ain’t ringing. Don, 
           pale and stricken, is still cuffed to the pool table.

                                 STOLIN
                        You were dead either way.

           Stolin smashes Don’s insulin kit with a cue ball and heads 
           for the door. As he opens it...

           Three CHICAGO POLICE burst in, led by Art’s ex-wife Karen.

                                 STOLIN
                        What the fuck?...

           Karen pushes him against the wall. She holds up a slew of 
           BETTING SLIPS.
                                 KAREN
                        Illegal bookmaking.
                            (nods at Don)
                        And now kidnapping.

           Stolin can’t believe it.

                                 DON
                        He married a cop, jagoff. Suck on 
                        that.

           Karen cuffs him. Stolin, enraged, punches the wall.

                                 KAREN
                        I know. He just makes you want to 
                        kill him, doesn’t he?

           EXT. MOTEL SIX - NIGHT

           Nina watches the other agents load all the night’s perps into 
           vans. She squats and stares at the ground, her mind working.

           A plane flies by overhead. Nina looks up at it. She hears 
           Art’s voice in her head.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        The best part was the freedom.

                                 NINA
                        Danny -- has this town got a 
                        private airport?

           EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Art’s black Town Car drives out onto the tarmac. A PRIVATE 
           PLANE sits waiting. DMITRI stands in front of it.

           INT. DMITRI’S PLANE - NIGHT

           Art and Natalie sit together in the back.

                                 ART
                        London first, or Paris?

                                 NATALIE
                        Rome, baby. I need clothes.

           Art kisses her hard. He pats one of the briefcases.

                                 ART
                        I got a little business to wrap up.

           He walks through a curtain into the plane’s front section. He 
           sits down beside Dmitri. He hands over the briefcases.

           Dmitri opens the top one. What a sight.
                                 ART
                        Five million in paper. All yours.

           Dmitri stares at him, surprised.

                                 DMITRI
                        And your terms?

           A beat. The moment of truth. Art looks up to see Natalie 
           watching from the curtain. They stare into each other’s eyes. 
           She knows.

           EXT. TARMAC - NIGHT

           The plane takes off into the dark sky. Beneath it, we see a 
           MAN STANDING ON THE TARMAC.

           PUSH IN TO REVEAL ART WILLIAMS, standing alone, watching his 
           freedom ride disappear.

           Art pulls out one last FAKE C-NOTE. He holds it up in the 
           moonlight. He sets fire to the bottom corner.

           HEADLIGHTS AND SIRENS hit the tarmac and speed towards Art.

           He ignores them. He watches the flame consume his creation. 
           The COLOR-SHIFTING INK... WATERMARK... FEDERAL SEAL.

           The cars pull up. Nina and Danny jump out of the lead car. 
           Nina waves Danny back and walks to Art alone, gun drawn.

           Art watches the flame reach BEN FRANKLIN’S PORTRAIT. Old Ben 
           smiles sadly at Art as he burns.

                                 NINA
                        That’s gotta hurt. Your bills were 
                        the best.

           Art watches the hot ashes blow away.

                                 ART
                        It’s only paper.

           He offers his wrists to Nina. She cuffs them.

           EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

           A WHITE BASEBALL flies through the air and thuds into a 
           GLOVE. Art is playing catch with a FELLOW CONVICT.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        I got three years, four months. 
                        Nuthin’, really.
                            (beat)
                        Dad got eight years. For not 
                        ratting me out.
           INT. VISITING ROOM - DAY

           Art sits in a chair, stunned, staring across at...

           Claire. Bad news written all over her face.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        He died a year into it. A heart 
                        attack in his cell.

           INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

           Art stands at the sink. His cell wall is covered with PHOTOS 
           of MIKEY. Art washes his hands.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        Dad took the hard road. For his 
                        boy.

           Art stares at one of Mikey’s photos. Resolve in Art’s eyes.

           INT. PRISON KITCHEN - DAY

           Art washes dishes.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        As for the guys...

           EXT. JOEY’S BEEF STAND - NIGHT

           Chicago’s tiniest beef stand is wedged between a bodega and a 
           locksmith. Don’s cab is parked out front.

           INT. JOEY’S BEEF STAND - NIGHT

           Joey works the counter in a white apron. Casey, wearing 
           construction gear, and Don take up two of the three stools.

           TWO COPS walk in. They look for someplace to sit. Joey glares 
           at his buddies -- you’re costing me money. They don’t budge.

           The cops shake their heads and leave.

                                 CASEY
                        Fuck ‘em, Homes. Let’s eat.

                                 ART (V.O.)
                        ... they’re still the guys.

           EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

           Art stands at the fence, staring out at barren farmland.
                                 ART (V.O.)
                        I never heard from Natalie. 
                        Something tells me she’s doing 
                        okay.

           INT. MONACO CASINO - NIGHT

           Natalie, a cocktail waitress, carries a tray of drinks to the 
           craps table. She serves a RICH GENT just as the CROUPIER is 
           handing him the TABLE DICE.

           He holds the dice out to Natalie. She blows on them.

           HE ROLLS CRAPS. The table erupts in cheers. The rich gent 
           looks at Natalie. She smiles. He’s hooked.

           INT. PRISON BASEMENT - DAY

           Checkout day. A GUARD hands Art his personal effects.

                                 GUARD
                        ... and two hundred thirty-one 
                        dollars in cash.
                            (holding up a C-note)
                        I gotta ask, Art. Is this real?

                                 ART
                        If you gotta ask...

           EXT. PRISON GATES - DAY

           Art walks out the gates. A COP CAR is waiting for him. Art’s 
           face falls... until he sees Karen step out. And Mikey too.

           Mikey runs to Art. Art hugs him tight.

                                 MIKEY
                        I got a baseball game tomorrow. You 
                        gonna be there?

                                 ART
                        I’ll be there. I’ll be there for 
                        all of them.

           He looks over Mikey’s shoulder at Karen. They smile at each 
           other.

           Fade Out.
