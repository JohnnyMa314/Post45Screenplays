           New York City.  

           The machinery of the city is dirty, congested, chaotic:

           Snarled traffic jams clog the streets.  Crowds of bored 
           commuters, bewildered tourists, and angry homeless people 
           muddle through the daily grind.  

           They’re on the way to work, riding the bus, missing the bus, 
           cursing the world.

           As we snake through this overwhelming, infuriating, urban 
           labyrinth, we hear a woman’s voice:

                                 SARA (V.O.)
                        For every correct answer, you 
                        receive one point. For questions 
                        you omit, you receive no points.  
                        For a wrong answer to a multiple 
                        choice question, you lose a 
                        fraction of a point. 

           And suddenly, these rules apply to all these nameless New 
           Yorkers, hustling, brain-dead through their routines.  

                                 SARA (V.O.)
                        For a wrong answer to a question 
                        that is not multiple choice, you do 
                        not lose any points.  Carefully 
                        mark only one answer for each 
                        question...  

           As she talks, the sun goes down.  Commuters return from work.  
           Happy hour begins in neighborhood bars.  The homeless wrap 
           themselves in tattered blankets.

           And somewhere in the concrete jungle, fluorescent lights 
           flicker in a tiny window of an enormous office building.

           We move through that window, arriving at:

           INT. PREMIUM PREP OFFICES--NIGHT

           A drab, dingy, nondescript  space.   A group of TWENTY-
           SOMETHINGS sits around a table littered with protein bar 
           wrappers, cashews, vitamin waters.  In front of each of them, 
           a massive SAT manual.  Behind them, a dry-erase board is 
           marked up with high-school math problems.

           And here’s where that voice was coming from:  
                     (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)           SARA JACOBS, twenty-sixish, pretty in a complex and soulful 
           way, in spite of (or perhaps because of) her mussed hair,  
           her pale skin, the dark circles under her distant, 
           intelligent eyes.  

           She continues to read from her manual:

                                 SARA
                        ...Make sure each mark is dark and 
                        completely fills the oval.  Do not 
                        make any stray marks on your answer 
                        sheet.

           She looks up at the tired, bored faces, made slightly green 
           by the fluorescent lights.  

           The head of tutor training, GRETCHEN (30ish, was artsy and 
           experimental in college, now sports J-Crew cashmere and a 
           tasteful engagement ring), nods her head.  

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Great, great.  So guys, after you 
                        read that to them, you have to 
                        explain it to them like they’re 
                        children.  Which, let’s face it, 
                        they are. 

           Gretchen looks at Sara, who’s amusing herself by coloring in 
           her thumbnail with a black Sharpie.  

                                 GRETCHEN (CONT’D)
                        Any of the more experienced tutors 
                        want to give advice on how to do 
                        that?  Sar?  You with me?

           INT. SUBWAY--NIGHT

           On her way home, Sara is crammed into a crowded subway with 
           Adam, one of the group from tutor training.  He’s got the 
           bright-eyed energy of a tutoring newbie.

           As they talk, a HOMELESS GUY wanders through the car banging 
           on a cup.

                                 ADAM
                        The company charges the parents how 
                        much?

                                 SARA
                        Two-fifty an hour.
                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 ADAM
                        Two hundred and fifty dollars. 

           Sara nods as Adam’s eyes go wide. 

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        So, if we’re making twenty an 
                        hour...
                          (quick calculation)
                        We’re getting eight percent.

           Hw shakes his head in amused disbelief.  She smiles, too 
           tired to fully laugh.

                                 SARA
                        Well, it’s a lot better than 
                        working at the Gap.

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, but I went to Princeton.

                                 SARA
                        And?

                                 ADAM
                        And...I’m a poet. 

                                 SARA
                        Really?  

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah. 
                          (then)
                        I mean, not just a poet.  I’m not 
                        totally impractical.  I write music 
                        too.

                                 SARA
                          (smiles)
                        So one day you could combine them 
                        and...write an opera.

                                 ADAM
                          (smiles back, then)
                        How ‘bout you?

                                 SARA
                        Well...I went to Harvard.

                                 ADAM
                        And?
                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                 SARA
                        I write kind of.  You know, I’m 
                        still in transition really since I 
                        only graduated five years ago.

           He laughs as the train pulls into a station. He’s about to 
           say something when Sara looks up, cutting him off.

                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, this is my stop.

           She gets off.  Intrigued, he watches her go.

           INT. SARA’S APT--NIGHT

           A very small, disastrously messy studio, furnished in 
           leftover college stuff: halogen lamps, futon, bean bag 
           chairs.

           Dishes overflow in the kitchenette sink, clothes are strewn 
           everywhere.  Sara throws her huge backpack down on her 
           futon/bed, takes off her sweatshirt and lets it fall on the 
           ground.

           She goes to the fridge, looks in.  It’s empty, except for a 
           half-drunk bottle of red wine and a bowl of something that is 
           no longer recognizable.  She opens the wine, sniffs it, and 
           pours some into a mug that says, “You’re the greatest!” 

           Sipping her wine, she walks the two steps to her desk, which 
           is surrounded by stack of books, composition notebooks, SAT 
           manuals, and a folded-up laptop computer.

           On the desk, amid dirty coffee mugs and empty soda cans, is 
           her old Underwood typewriter.  

           Tacked on the bulletin board above the desk are photos of 
           younger Sara with her father and mother in a small, working 
           class rural town, along with a few inspirational Post-Its:  

           “Confidence,” or “Make of yourself a LIGHT unto the world!”

           And, in the midst of all this detritus, a huge stack of typed 
           pages:  Her unfinished manuscript.  

           Sara takes the manuscript, sits back on her futon.  Begins to 
           thumb through it.  It’s awash in corrections and revisions.

           She picks a heavily notated section, heads to her typewriter, 
           puts in a fresh page and starts to type.  No sooner has she 
           typed a few sentences than she starts to mark up the new page 
           with question marks. 
                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 SARA (PRELAP)
                        ...So, if zero times anything else 
                        is always zero, and 2x equals an 
                        integer, can x equal zero?

           INT. UPPER EAST SIDE TOWNHOUSE--DAY

           Sara’s tutoring ASHTYN, a very beautiful eleventh-grader with 
           long, shiny, dark hair, glossy lips and glowy skin.  They’re 
           at a massive, mahogany dining room table, strewn with SAT 
           materials.

           Ashtyn looks like she might cry.

                                 SARA
                        Ashtyn?  It’s okay.  Just--

                                 ASHTYN
                        No, I’m just mad.  I want to be in 
                        the school play, but Mom says I 
                        can’t stay here for rehearsals over 
                        Christmas because we have to go 
                        back to stupid Bermuda.

           Sara sighs in exasperation.

           INT. PARK AVENUE PENTHOUSE--DAY

           Sara stares at ZACH, a nerdy, tenth-grader with a light 
           dusting of zits and a few, sad strands of dark hair on his 
           upper lip.

           They’re working at a desk in his bedroom.  Nearby, there’s a 
           huge, inflatable George W. Bush doll.

                                 ZACH
                        ...well, I hate France, because 
                        everybody knows that the French are 
                        cowardly, faithless bastards.  We 
                        saved their ass in World War Two 
                        and this is how they repay us?  Am 
                        I right?

                                 SARA
                        Let’s go back to the reading 
                        passage. 

           He stares at her expectantly.  She glares back.  A beat.

CENTRAL PARK WEST DUPLEX--DAY

           Spare and minimalist, with a killer view of the park.  
           MARINA, a meaty girl jock in a school sweatshirt chews 
           hungrily on a Powerbar as she sits with Sara at a beautiful, 
           glass table in the living room.

                                 SARA
                        Great, so looking at choice A, what 
                        do you think?

                                 MARINA
                          (lots of attitude)
                        What do you think?

                                 SARA
                        I think you should work out the 
                        answer for yourself.

           Marin stares at her at beat, chewing.  Then:

                                 MARINA
                          (calls)
                        Mom.  

           As Marina stalks off to complain to her mother, Sara sighs 
           and stares out the huge window, where storm clouds gather 
           over the park.  Catching a glimpse of herself in the glass, 
           it almost seems like she might belong in this world...

           Until Marina’s MOTHER, a tall forbidding woman, appears in a 
           doorway.

                                 MARINA’S MOTHER
                        You can go.

           INT. EAST VILLAGE DINER--EVENING

           Sara runs in from the rain, to see her father, JOSEPH (sixty-
           ish, college-professor, an intellectual but very much NOT a 
           New Yorker). He’s sitting at a booth reading Proust as he 
           waits.

                                 SARA
                        Dad.  Sorry I’m late--

           He holds up one finger, keeps reading for a beat.  Finally, 
           he peers up at her over his reading glasses.

           (cid:13)                                 JOSEPH
                        Just had to get to the end of that 
                        paragraph.  

           He closes the book with reverence.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Mmm.  Proust.  Every time I read 
                        it, it gets better and better.

           Sara half-smiles, used to this, as she sits, plunking her SAT 
           manuals down on the table.

                                 SARA
                          (re the manuals)
                        Wish I could say the same about 
                        these. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Don’t tell me we’ll be doing word 
                        problems.

                                 SARA
                        No, I’ve done enough for a 
                        lifetime.  God, those little brats, 
                        and the parents--

                                 JOSEPH
                        Hold on.  I know just what you 
                        need.

           He motions for the WAITRESS, who comes over.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        We’ll have a bottle of that really 
                        cheap, practically undrinkable wine 
                        we had last time I was here.

           Sara and the waitress share a smile.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Hmmm.  The cheap, disgusting, 
                        practically undrinkable wine would 
                        be the...Montepulciano.

           Joseph nods as the waitress goes.  A pause.  

                                 SARA
                        Happy Birthday.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        Don’t remind me.

                        rolled.  T. S. Eliot--

                                 SARA
                        The Wasteland, I know. But, Dad, 
                        relax, you’re only sixty-two--

                                 JOSEPH
                        Shush.  Not a day over fifty.
                          (then, smiling)
                        Illusion is the first of all the 
                        pleasures.

           She smiles at the same old riff.

                                 SARA  
                        Anyway, I’m sorry I couldn’t come 
                        up to you--

                                 JOSEPH
                        Oh, I don’t mind coming down to New 
                        York.  I like the noise, the 
                        people.  The house is so empty and 
                        quiet now.

           An awkward pause. 

                                 SARA
                        Well, thanks, it’s just I’ve been 
                        so busy with work--

                                 JOSEPH 
                        How is your work? 

                                 SARA
                        Oh, you know, lots of students, 
                        same old same old.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I meant your novel.  
                          (holding up the Proust)
                        I’m almost through my third read of 
                        this. I’ll be looking for your 
                        masterpiece next.  

           Sara stares at the huge volume, In Search of Lost Time. 

                                 SARA
                        Mine’s not ready.

                                 JOSEPH
                        So?  I might have some useful 
                        thoughts.

                        You know, as a literature 
                        professor, I do know a thing or two 
                        about books.  

                                 SARA
                        I’m sure you’ll have lots to say.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        I always read your mom’s stuff, 
                        gave her notes...

           He looks at her reassuringly.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        She thought I was a very astute 
                        critic.  I know a good book when I 
                        read one, believe me.

                                 SARA
                        Oh, I believe you.

           That came out with a bit more edge than Sara intended.  

                                 JOSEPH 
                        At the very least, I hope you’re 
                        not still writing on your mom’s old 
                        typewriter... 
                          (off her)
                        You’re trapped in the dark ages, 
                        sweetheart.  No wonder you never 
                        get anything done--

                                 SARA
                          (enough)
                        Dad.  Please.(cid:13)

                                 JOSEPH
                        Sorry.  

           She nods.  Moving on, trying to be as upbeat as she can.

                                 SARA
                        Anyway, I’m busy, you know, I’m 
                        taking my first student in 
                        Greenwich tomorrow.  The company’s 
                        expanding into Connecticut, so that 
                        should be...different.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yes.

           The silence is broken by the waitress, who comes over and 
           pours the wine.  As she does, Joseph opens the Proust again.  
           He and Sara clink and sip.  
                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        No sooner had it touched my palate 
                        than a shudder ran through me and I 
                        stopped, intent upon the 
                        extraordinary thing that was 
                        happening to me...

           As Sara sips her wine and listens, she stares out the diner 
           window at the drenched New Yorkers, angrily struggling 
           through the rain, umbrellas blowing open, hats blowing away.  

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        An exquisite pleasure had invaded 
                        my senses, with no suggestion of 
                        its origin...

           INT. METRO NORTH TRAIN--DAY

           And as Joseph’s voice continues, Sara’s now sitting in a half-
           empty car, by a window, moving forward through space. 

           In her lap is a composition notebook filled with her own 
           writing, complete with her usual cross-outs, torn-out pages, 
           Post-It’s, question marks.  The pages tell a tale of someone 
           who spends a lot of time reworking familiar territory.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        This new sensation had on me the 
                        effect which love has-- filling me 
                        with a precious essence; or rather 
                        this essence was not in me it was 
                        me....

           She stares at her notebook, trying to write.  She makes a few 
           corrections.  Crosses out a paragraph.  Sighs in frustration.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        I had ceased now to feel mediocre, 
                        contingent, mortal. Where did it 
                        come from, this all-powerful joy?

           Sara slams her headphones on, her music drowning out Joseph’s 
           voice.  She looks out the window, where the city has melted 
           away and been replaced by...

           A small, sweet town of clapboard houses.  A still lake.  A 
           little league game.  A bucolic field of cows, grazing.  

           And, as the train hurtles forward through space, everything 
           dissolves into a darkly beautiful blur.

GREENWICH METRO NORTH STATION--DAY

           Sara’s standing on the platform as the dozen or so other 
           arriving PASSENGERS walk by her.  Her eyes scan a parking lot 
           full of SUV’s, Mercedes, BMW’s.  She watches people greet one 
           another.

           Finally, she lights on an idling gold BMW, with a license 
           plate that reads: “F-U-N-N-N.”  

           Next to it, car door still open, a very fit, adorable forty-
           something woman in a tight pink and tan jogging outfit also 
           scans the station.  If she’s had “work” done (and she has), 
           it’s done beautifully.  Her skin glows, hair shines; gold 
           hoops dangle from her earlobes, catching the light.  

           This is PAMMIE.

           She spots Sara and waves cheerfully.

                                 PAMMIE
                          (calling)
                        Sara?  Sara!
                          (points to herself)
                        Pammie Anders!  Hello!

           Sara puts her game face on and makes her way over to the car.

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m so glad I found you!  You know 
                        how when you’re looking for someone 
                        with a ponytail, suddenly everyone 
                        has a ponytail!

           Sara half-laughs politely, and touches her ponytail, pushing 
           a lock of frizzy hair behind her ear.  

                                 SARA
                        I know.  And I was looking for a--

                                 PAMMIE
                        Green Lexus hybrid SUV, right?  
                        That’s my other car.

                                 SARA
                        No, actually a gray--

                                 PAMMIE
                        Audi?  That’s Jordy’s car.  Oh, 
                        God, did I get mixed up and say the 
                        Audi?  I am so sorry.  Anyway, you 
                        made it!  Hop in!

           INT. GOLD BMW--CONTINUOUS

           Pammie power locks the doors.  The Black Eyed Peas rock out 
           on the car stereo, her attempt at being hip.  She lowers the 
           volume.

                                 PAMMIE
                        I would advise you to buckle up 
                        because I am the world’s worst 
                        driver.  

           Pammie backs the car out. They lurch forward, barely missing 
           a pedestrian.

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry!  Thought I was in reverse!
                          (laughs)
                        Oh, God, I’m a menace!  Don’t 
                        worry, the car has air bags--

                                 SARA
                        It’s fine.  I’m pretty bad myself.

                                 PAMMIE 
                        Are you?  Oh good.  

           Sara suppresses a smile as they navigate dangerously through 
           the parking lot, finally turning onto a sun-dappled street, 
           lined with lovely, old trees.

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        Well, Jordy would have picked you 
                        up himself, but he’s at soccer 
                        practice, or lacrosse...One’s fall, 
                        one’s spring, I can’t keep it 
                        straight.  Anyway, he’d better be 
                        home when we get there.  Otherwise, 
                        I’ll have to turn into, you know, 
                        bitch mom.  I’m terrible.  I show 
                        up at his friends’ houses with, 
                        like, a broomstick and just beat 
                        him.

           Sara laughs obligingly.

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious. Don’t have kids, Sara, 
                        unless you want to go insane.  
                                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                 SARA
                        I’ll keep that in mind.

           Pammie pulls the car to a screeching halt at a stop sign.  

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I know he’s very excited to 
                        work with you because he really 
                        wants to raise his score from the 
                        last time he took, the test.  He’s 
                        got his heart set on Harvard, which 
                        is great because he’s a double 
                        legacy there, so he has more of a 
                        shot.  I mean, there’s Yale and 
                        Princeton of course, but what are 
                        we supposed to do, give a library?

           As Pammie babbles, Sara half-listens and begins to take in 
           the lavish world of Greenwich for the very first time:

           It’s perfect: Rolling green hills, manicured lawns, big white 
           mansions, beautiful ponds in which pairs of swans float 
           peacefully.  This is the good life.  The American Dream.

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        I just hate the whole system.  But 
                        what can you do?  The competition, 
                        these kids with their 
                        extracurriculars and their 
                        biracial, bi-curious, native, 
                        indigenous peoples backgrounds... I 
                        mean, there is a kid in his class, 
                        Ryan Baxter, who plays polo and 
                        speaks Yiddish. Can you beat that?

           The car wings around a bend, past a golf course. 

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        The truth is, if you’re just a 
                        regular kid like Jordy it’s much 
                        harder.

           Each mansion they pass is larger than the last, all 
           tastefully set back from the road.  Sara catches glimpses of 
           them behind hedges, through trees, past fences and old 
           cobblestone walls.  

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I should tell you.  He’s 
                        dyslexic.  We had him tested by two 
                        doctors in Greenwich and a few in 
                        New York.  Plus, he has mild ADD.

                        Do you have experience?  Working 
                        with dyslexia?

                                 SARA
                        Yeah.  It’s not that unusual.

                                 PAMMIE
                        Great.  And you went to Harvard. 

                                 SARA
                        I did, yes, and I did work-study 
                        filing in the admissions office 
                        while I was there, so I’ve seen it 
                        all up close--

           Pammie turns sharply, running over a curb.

                                 PAMMIE
                        Oops.  That thing jumped out at me!  
                        Anyway, tell me more.  I’ve been 
                        babbling. Since Harvard, you’ve 
                        been...

                                 SARA
                        Tutoring, mostly.  

                                 PAMMIE
                        Yes, but what else?  That can’t be 
                        what you want to do.  My life 
                        coach, well, therapist really, says 
                        Pammie, ask yourself “what do I 
                        want?”

           Sara shrugs self-consciously.

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 SARA
                        No, it’s just, parents don’t 
                        normally ask...

           Suddenly, a JOLT, as Pammie slams on the brakes in the middle 
           of the road.  Sara goes flying forward in her seat.

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Sara.  I’m not moving this 
                        car until you come up with 
                        something.   

           As Sara catches her breath, a car pulls up behind them.  Then 
           another.  They’re too polite to honk.  But still, holding up 
           traffic makes Sara nervous.

                        Okay, okay, I just, I have this 
                        novel.  It’s nothing.  It’s just, 
                        I’ve only been working on it for, 
                        like five years, so--

                                 PAMMIE
                        Sara!  That’s fantastic!  You’re a 
                        writer!  

                                 SARA
                        Well, not yet.

           Pammie starts the car back up with a lurch.  Waves, “Sorry!” 
           to the people in the car behind her, who wave back.

                                 PAMMIE 
                        You know my best friend is Marianne 
                        Lewis. The top editor at Knopf?  If 
                        you give me some of your work I’d 
                        be happy to pass it on to her.  

                                 SARA
                        Oh, thanks.  It’s really not ready, 
                        I mean, I haven’t shown it to 
                        anyone, but when I do--

                                 PAMMIE
                        Sara, I’m telling you, she’s my 
                        best friend.  I insist.

           They pull up a steep driveway in front of a massive, white, 
           columned mansion.  From the driveway, Sara can already see a 
           swimming pool and golf course.

                                 PAMMIE
                        Here we are!  Home sweet home!

           Pammie parks between four other cars.  Three enormous, 
           beautiful, shiny DOGS bound out of the house, barking 
           furiously.

                                 PAMMIE
                          (to the dogs)
                        Peter!  Calm down.  Theo!  Stop!
                          (then)
                        And I see Jordy’s car.  He must be 
                        home! It’s a miracle!

ANDERS MANSION FOYER--MOMENTS LATER

           Sara stands in cavernous, marble foyer, as the dogs circle 
           her, sniffing.  Several Greek statues decorate the hall.  A 
           fountain cascades down a wall.  

           Pammie throws down her bag and car keys.  Sara flinches as 
           the dogs surround her.

                                 PAMMIE
                          (to the dogs)
                        Peter!  Theo!  Come on.  Leave her 
                        alone.

           The cacophony of the dogs is compounded by a ringing phone.  
           It’s chaos.  Pammie finds it, looks at caller ID.  

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, that’s going to voice mail, 
                        and--
                          (rolls her eyes to Sara, 
                           then, to dogs)
                        Peter, stop that!  Seriously!
                          (then, after the dogs 
                           relax)
                        Okay, phew, I’ll grab Jordy. What 
                        can I get you?  Water?

                                 SARA
                        Sure.

                                 PAMMIE
                        Sparkling or flat?

                                 SARA
                        Flat is fine.

                                 PAMMIE
                        Bottled or tap?

                                 SARA
                        Um, tap?

                                 PAMMIE
                        With ice or without?

                                 SARA
                        Um... ice.

                                 PAMMIE

                          (calling)
                        Jordy?  
                          (hi-pitched)
                        Jordy!  Jordan!!!

           Sara flinches at the sound of Pammie’s shrieks, as Pammie 
           goes off. 

           Alone now, Sara has the look of someone who’s just been 
           through a tornado.  Dazed but curious, she wanders into...

           INT. ANDERS MANSION LIVING ROOM--CONTINUOUS

           Sara surveys the plush white sofas, thick beige rugs, 
           beautiful antique furniture.  A wall of windows looks out 
           onto the golf course.  Orchids planted in antique china vases 
           complete the feeling of lush abundance.

           This is a level of luxury above and beyond anything she’s 
           ever seen as a tutor in New York.  It’s magnificent.

           Sara leans close to a vase, making sure not to bump it, and 
           sniffs a rare, flesh-colored orchid.  

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        They look good, but they don’t 
                        smell like much.

           Startled, she spins, to see JORDY standing in the doorway.  
           As she turns, the orchid teeters.  She grabs it, holds it 
           steady.

           Jordy smiles an easy smile, his relaxed demeanor in stark 
           contrast to her awkwardness.

                                 JORDY
                        Whoa.  Careful there.

           He’s seventeen and beautiful, still sweaty and dirty from 
           practice, with the face of a boy, but the build of a man.  He 
           holds Sara’s ice water.

                                 SARA
                          (rattled)
                        God, I almost...The vase...

           Jordy takes a few steps toward her.

                                 JORDY
                        Chill.  They have, like, a million 
                        of those.

           ponytail, runs her hands through it, smoothing it.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        I’m Jordy.

                                 SARA
                        Yeah.  I know, I mean, your mom 
                        said. So.
                          (polite conversation)
                        You... play lacrosse?

                                 JORDY
                        I was at soccer.

                                 SARA
                        Oh.  I don’t really know much about 
                        soccer.  Or lacrosse, for that 
                        matter--

                                 JORDY
                        It’s not that complicated.

           She stares at him a beat.  He smiles, hands her the water.  
           She puts it on an antique wood table.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        You should probably use a coaster.  

                                 SARA
                        Right.  Sorry.  I hope I didn’t 
                        damage it--

                                 JORDY
                        It’s just that my parents are, 
                        like, coaster obsessed.

                                 SARA
                        It’s a beautiful table.

                                 JORDY
                        It’s not even original finish.

           She shoots him a look, as she puts her water down on a 
           coaster.

                                 SARA

                        She thinks I can get in because I’m 
                        a legacy.  I’m not really that into 
                        school.

                                 SARA
                        What’s your favorite subject?

                                 JORDY
                        I don’t know.  Lunch?

           A beat.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        I’m kidding.

                                 SARA
                          (not laughing)
                        I got it.  

           Another beat, as they face off.

           INT. ANDERS MANSION LIVING ROOM--LATER

           Sara and Jordy are installed at a corner table, by the 
           windows.  They look like they’ve been there a while.  Strewn 
           between them are SAT manuals, notebooks, etc.  

           She reads from a practice test, as Jordy doodles in the 
           margins.

                                 SARA
                        Although some think the terms “bug” 
                        and “insect” are BLANK, the former 
                        term actually refers to a BLANK 
                        group of insects.
                          (then)
                        So, the trick is, before we even 
                        look at the answer choices, to 
                        think about what might fill in 
                        these blanks--

           Sara looks over at him, notices he’s not listening.  

                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        Actually, the first thing you 
                        probably want to do is pay 
                        attention.

           Jordy puts down his pencil.  Sara tries again.

                        So.  What do you think of this 
                        question?

                                 JORDY
                          (reading it, slowly)
                        Although some think the terms “bug” 
                        and “insect” are BLANK.

                        Well, I hate bugs and insects so I 
                        would just say...gross.

                                 SARA
                          (exasperated)
                        Okay, but let’s look at the second 
                        half of the sentence.  “Although 
                        some think the terms are BLANK, the 
                        former term actually refers to a 
                        BLANK group--”

                                 JORDY
                        Wow.

                                 SARA
                        Wow.  What?

                                 JORDY
                        I have, like, this really long arm 
                        hair.  See it?

           And we realize he’s been staring at his arm this entire time.  
           Sara sighs, annoyed.

                                 SARA
                        Jordy--

                                 JORDY
                        I never noticed it because it’s, 
                        like, white blond.  How does that 
                        happen?  All the other hairs knew 
                        to stop at a certain length and 
                        this one was just like, no.

                        know, rogue cells.  I have 
                        something like that on my...chest 
                        area--

                                 JORDY
                        Rogue cells?  Is that like cancer?

                        Let’s go back to the question.  
                        Some think that the terms “bug” and

                        she’s crazy anyway, so it’s like, 
                        which came first, the ants or the

           This is a clearly losing battle.  Reluctantly, she decides to

                        Nah, I was just wondering if you 
                        wanted a tour of our collection.

           Not what she was expecting.  She looks at him.

           each side.  They see a Latina maid, ANA, cleaning the glass.

                                 JORDY
                        ‘Sup Ana.  
                          (quickly, in passing)
                        This is Sara.  She’s helping me 
                        deal with the SAT and college 
                        stuff.  Hey, how’s Maria?

                                 ANA
                        Very good.  Also doing SAT studies.  
                        Muy dificil.

           Sara smiles at Ana, who smiles back.  They walk on.

                                 JORDY
                          (sotto, to Sara)
                        Ana’s got a daughter, like, my age--

                                 SARA
                        Jordy, this is not what I’m here 
                        for.  Do you want to work, or--

                                 JORDY
                          (ignoring her protests)
                        The good stuff’s all through here, 
                        in this wing.  I’m not gonna show 
                        you the antiquities, because I’m 
                        like, antiquities, whatever.

           She sighs, as her eye is caught by the sight of several 
           GARDENERS tending the hedges outside.  

           Beyond them, on the tennis courts, an eleven year old GIRL 
           hits balls with a MAN.  The girl GRUNTS as she slams a killer 
           serve.  

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                          (noticing Sara watching)
                        That’s my sister.  

                                 SARA
                        Is that your dad with her?

                                 JORDY
                        Nah, he’s at work in the city.

           Another, even louder GRUNT from Lauren.  Sara stifles a 
           laugh, as Jordy smiles at her.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                          (explaining)
                        She’s tennis obsessed.

                          (thinks)
                        Or, actually, I don’t even know if 
                        she’s that into it.  She’s, just 
                        like, crazy competitive?   My mom 
                        made us each pick something we were 
                        supposed to be amazing at-- 

                                 SARA
                        What’d you pick?

           He shrugs.

                                 JORDY
                        I’m just gonna do business.

                                 SARA
                        What kind of business?

                                 JORDY
                        Just something like what my dad 
                        does.  Something with companies.

           Sara takes note of this as Jordy walks ahead in silence.  

           Finally, they arrive at:

           INT. ANDERS MANSION, EAST WING--CONTINUOUS

           This is the modern wing of the property.  Airy, light, 
           minimal.  More informal.  

                                 SARA
                          (entering)
                        All right, ten minutes, seriously, 
                        Jordy, because we still have to--

           But Sara stops cold when she notices the very large and very 
           important works of modern art adorning the walls.  The beauty 
           and the color take her breath away.  Jordy looks at her.

                                 JORDY
                        I know, right?

           He points out a huge Jackson Pollock. 

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        This is a Pollock, um, obviously, 
                        that one over there’s a Rothko, we 
                        have a couple of those, and over 
                        there you can see the Licht--Licht--

                          (recognizing it)
                        Lichtenstein.

           He looks at her, surprised and impressed.

                                 JORDY
                        Wow.  You know everything, huh?

                                 SARA
                        Not everything.  Just, you know, 
                        most things.

           They share a smile.

                                 JORDY
                          (continuing the tour)
                        David Hockney, Rauschenberg, 
                        Schnabel.

           As he talks, Sara walks on, taking in one masterpiece after 
           another.  A painting a few feet away catches her eye.  She 
           walks over and stands in front of it, captivated by its 
           beauty.  

           Jordy comes up behind her.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah.  The Picasso.

           It’s stunning.  A late painting from the artist’s surreal 
           period.  Deep, rich colors depict bodies and faces, all 
           distorted and fragmented.  

           A beat, as they both look.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        It’s actually kind of ugly.

           She turns to him, not expecting that.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        But I think that might be why I 
                        like it.  It’s not perfect.

           Sara turns back to the painting, listening.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        I mean, look at that woman type 
                        thing, where is she looking?  And 
                        then you have that other one with 
                        that weird, like, butt face and 
                        she’s not even noticing her.  
                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                 SARA
                          (laughing)
                        Is that the back of his head or the 
                        front?

                                 JORDY
                        Exactly.  It’s so messed up.  
                        They’re all so messed up but so 
                        completely, totally...real and so 
                        alive.  I mean, here I am, like, 
                        breathing, and somehow this thing 
                        is a million times more alive.

           Sara looks at Jordy, as if seeing him for the first time.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        So when I see it I just want to 
                        know it.  I want that.  
                          (a whisper)
                        I just want to feel that.  To go 
                        inside.

           For an instant, their shoulders touch.  

           INT. METRO NORTH TRAIN--EVENING

           Sara stares at her misshapen reflection among the other 
           passengers, in the window.  The distorted faces are 
           reminiscent of the Picasso.  Only instead of being beautiful 
           and vibrant, they’re garish and sad.  

           She glances back into the car.  Next to her, a young inner 
           city GIRL is looking through a massive SAT manual.  Sara 
           watches her struggle with a question, before resorting to 
           checking the answers in the back of the book.

           The girl notices Sara staring.

                                 GIRL
                        What?

           Sara shakes her head, “nothing.”  She goes back to looking 
           out the window, as the rolling hills are replaced by concrete 
           housing projects.  

           INT. CAFE--AFTERNOON

           Sara sits at a corner table nursing a cold coffee, her 
           notebooks and her typewritten manuscript spread out in front 
           of her.  She crosses out a paragraph.  Rewrites it in the 
           margin.  Sighs in frustration.
                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)           She’s distracted by a group of TWENTY SOMETHINGS, laughing 
           and chatting at a nearby table.  Their togetherness is in 
           stark contrast to her solitude.  

           EXT. ANDERS GROUNDS--DAY

           It’s a perfect day of Indian Summer.  Sara and Jordy are 
           sprawled out in the generous shade of a huge tree. 

           Nearby, on the tennis courts, Lauren and her tennis pro are 
           slamming balls back and forth.  Lauren’s GRUNTS pierce the 
           quiet afternoon.

           Sara’s correcting a practice test; Jordy’s reading her his 
           answers as she checks them.

                                 SARA
                        5 C?

                                 JORDY
                        That’s not right?

                                 SARA
                        Just keep going.

                                 JORDY
                        6 D, 7 C, 8 B, 9 E, 10 A, 11 D--

                                 SARA
                        11 D?

                                 JORDY
                        It’s not?

                                 SARA
                        Keep going, we’ll go over it later.

                                 JORDY
                        Is it wrong?  Let me see--

                                 SARA
                        Just--here.  Give me your test. 
                        I’ll grade it myself.

           He passes it over to her and watches closely as she looks at 
           it, making a bunch of marks.  

           A moment of quiet, but for the POCK of tennis balls, the 
           SQUEAK of tennis shoes, and Lauren’s primal GRUNTS.  Sara 
           looks up from the test paper.
                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        Jordy, it’s okay--

                                 JORDY
                        Is it any better?

                                 SARA
                          (no)
                        It will be.  Just be patient.

                                 JORDY
                        Shit.  Sorry.  

                                 SARA
                        We’ll keep working.

           Jordy takes a shaky breath.  

                                 JORDY
                        No, you don’t understand. I’ve had 
                        tutors my whole life for, like, 
                        everything.  They don’t make any 
                        difference.  

                                 SARA
                        Well, you’ve never had me.

                                 JORDY
                        No offense, I’m sure you’re really 
                        special and all, but I really 
                        really can’t do this, I’m just not 
                        smart enough or whatever, and my 
                        whole life is falling apart--

                                 SARA
                        Really?  Your whole life is falling 
                        apart? 

           She looks around pointedly at the manicured lawns, the 
           mansion, the tennis courts.

                                 JORDY 
                        I know you think I’m a dumb spoiled 
                        brat, okay.  I know that.

                                 SARA
                        I don’t think you’re dumb.

           Jordy gives her a pointed look.  

                                 JORDY
                        Thanks.
                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)

           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)           Sara smiles at him.  He smiles back.  They both start to 
           laugh.

           Sara’s about to say something, but is stopped by the sight of 
           Pammie approaching from the house, carrying a tray of 
           prosciutto sandwiches.  Jordy and Sara share a look.

                                 PAMMIE
                        Hey guys, don’t mean to interrupt, 
                        I just thought you might need some 
                        sustenance.  
                          (setting down the tray)
                        Oooh, SAT word.  Jord, what’s 
                        sustenance?

                                 JORDY
                        I’m guessing sandwiches. 

           Pammie hesitates, looking to Sara for a definitive answer.

                                 SARA
                          (smiles)
                        Close enough.

           Jordy looks over what his mom brought.

                                 JORDY
                        I’m getting a Coke.

           He runs back into the house as Pammie pops a stray piece of 
           prosciutto into her mouth.

                                 PAMMIE
                        So. How’s it going?

                                 SARA
                        He’s making progress.

                                 PAMMIE
                        I actually meant you.  How are you?  
                        Where’s the novel?

                                 SARA
                        The...

                                 PAMMIE
                        Your novel.  For Marianne.  I’m 
                        having lunch with her next week, 
                        and I’m going to mention you, so 
                        you’d better have it for me pronto.

           Pammie starts off, as from the tennis courts, Lauren GRUNTS 
           and slams another ACE.

                          (calling to her daughter)
                        Hey, looking good, kiddo!

           Lauren completely ignores her mom and plays on.  Pammie keeps 
           cheering, and makes her way up towards the house.

           Sara, alone, grabs a sandwich and takes a bite.  Through the 
           leaves of a nearby hedge, she notices Ana, sitting on a 
           bench, taking a break.

           Sara smiles to herself, grabs a folder out of her back pack, 
           and quickly goes around the hedge, into...

           EXT. ROSE GARDEN--DAY

           Ana has her shoes off, enjoying a moment of peace.  When she 
           sees Sara, she freezes for a moment, caught.

                                 SARA
                        Sorry, I just--

                                 ANA
                          (explaining)
                        Sometime I need little break.  Only 
                        poquito momento, then I go back. 
                        Please don’t tell--

           Sara holds out the folder.

                                 SARA 
                        Some SAT study materials.  Practice 
                        tests, techniques, explanations.  
                        For your daughter. 
                          (off Ana’s hesitation)
                        Take it.  A gift.  From me.

           Ana smiles gratefully, taking the folder.  

           Suddenly, Jordy comes up behind Sara, holding his Coke, as 
           Ana quickly slips the folder behind her back.

                                 JORDY
                          (to Sara)
                        Back to work?

           Ana and Sara share a look of silent complicity, as Jordy 
           chugs his soda.  Sara follows him back to their spot under 
           the tree.

CENTRAL PARK--DAY

           Sara and Gretchen, lattes in hand, stroll around the 
           reservoir.  

                                 GRETCHEN
                        ...you know, I’m glad that  
                        business is expanding but with 
                        planning the wedding on top of it 
                        all, my life is just out of 
                        control.
                          (then)
                        You’re my rock, Sara.  I seriously 
                        couldn’t do it without you.  Which 
                        is why I got you a raise.  Twenty-
                        two fifty an hour. How much do you 
                        love me?

           But Sara’s staring at a musician, in the park, playing the 
           violin.

                                 GRETCHEN (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 SARA
                        I was just thinking about, back in 
                        college, when you used to do that.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Play my violin in the square?  
                          (laughing)
                        Yeah, don’t remind me.

           Sara smiles.

                                 SARA
                        You ever play anymore?

                                 GRETCHEN
                        I’m busy.

                                 SARA
                        You played beautifully.

           Gretchen shakes her head, shrugs.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        I was never that gifted.  

           Sara turns to her friend.

SARA’S APARTMENT--NIGHT

           Sara sits at her typewriter, re-typing a page full of 
           detailed changes and annotations.   

           It’s slow going on the typewriter’s old keys.  She bangs on 
           the “Q” several times to force it to drop, then lifts it back 
           up manually to re-set it.  

           She reads over what she’s typed.  Shakes her head.  Finally, 
           pulls the page out, crumples it, throws it away.

           She puts a new page in.  Starts over.

           EXT. ANDERS POOL HOUSE--DAY

           The light is blue, watery.  Sara and Jordy sit across from 
           each other at a glass table, staring into each other’s eyes.

                                 SARA
                        Handshake?

                                 JORDY
                        This is retarded.

                                 SARA
                        Jordy.  The interview is one of the 
                        most important parts of this thing.  
                        You’re going up there this weekend 
                        and I don’t want you to screw it 
                        up.  
                          (then)
                        Now, I need to make sure your 
                        handshake is--

           He takes her hand.  She’s suddenly flustered.

                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        Okay, wow, it’s good.
                          (recovering)
                        So.  Let’s imagine that I’m the 
                        admissions officer.

                                 JORDY
                        Oh God, we’re not going to role 
                        play are we?

                                 SARA
                        This is good practice.  Now come

                        I’ll role play under one condition:  
                        I get to be the admissions guy and 
                        you have to be the student.

                        Jordan, that defeats the entire 
                        purpose of the exercise.

                                 JORDY
                        No it doesn’t.  You can show me how 
                        to do this, and I can “watch, ask 
                        questions and learn.”  Take it or 
                        leave it.

                        The truth is, I... hate this.  I 
                        think what I do is not only 
                        excruciatingly boring, but also 
                        morally corrupt, completely 
                        unethical, heartbreakingly spirit-
                        crushingly soul-killing and just 
                        basically awful and evil. 

           Pause.  

                                 JORDY
                        You hate me.

                        No, not you.  It’s just -- I think 
                        hard work should be what’s 
                        rewarded, not people who can afford 
                        two hundred and fifty bucks an hour 
                        to learn how to beat the system.  
                        But that’s how it is, and the rich 
                        just keep getting more and more and 
                        everything’s handed to them, and 
                        the worst part is, I’m part of it, 
                        I’m participating, which makes me 
                        feel like, just this horrible, 
                        horrible, person.  It just makes me 
                        -- hate -- me.  
                          (then)
                        Forget it.  I’m sorry, I should 
                        just--

           She starts to go.  Jordy gets up.  Grabs her arm.  Stops her.

                                 JORDY
                        Wait.

           He puts a hand on her shoulder.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll let you in.

           A long, tense beat.

                        Our school.  

           She exhales.  He smiles, reassuring.

           He winks and starts to go.  Points back to his notebook, 
           which is laying on the table.  

                                 JORDY
                        That’s for you.

           He goes off.  She walks to the notebook, turns it over and 
           sees what he was “writing.”  It’s beautiful, slightly 
           abstract line drawing of her, standing in the pool house.  It 
           takes her breath away.

           She takes it.  Slips it in between the pages of her SAT book.

                        question about teaching the 
                        quantitative comparisons and 
                        Gretchen said to call you, maybe we 
                        could meet up and talk about it, 
                        why not...

           Only half-listening to the message, Sara reaches into her 
           backpack, pulls out Jordy’s drawing.

           Tacks it up on her bulletin board.

           She sits, contemplating it, losing herself in it.

           INT. ANDERS LIVING ROOM--DAY

           Sara sits at a table grading a practice test as Jordy paces 
           nervously.

                                 JORDY
                        I think the math went okay, even 
                        though I skipped one or two, but 
                        there were some words I didn’t 
                        know.  Like, intransigent. Is that 
                        a bad thing, because it sounds--

                                 SARA
                        Jordy, this is good.

                                 JORDY
                        It’s a good thing?  Intransigent?

                                 SARA
                        No, the test, it’s--Hand me that 
                        calculator.

           He does.  She quickly calculates the score.

                                 JORDY
                        What?

                        Yes.

           It starts to sink in.  He laughs in thrilled disbelief.

                                 JORDY
                        No.

                                 SARA
                          (laughing with him, 
                           overjoyed)
                        Yes.

           She spontaneously, awkwardly hugs him, just as ARTHUR, 
           Jordy’s father (a fifty-ish, fit, tan, good looking and fun 
           alpha-male), comes in from outside, carrying his golf clubs. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        Looks like things are going well in 
                        here.  

           He gives Jordy a little wink and extends his hand to Sara.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Arthur Anders, Jordy’s father.

           They shake.  

                                 SARA
                          (explaining)
                        Jordy just scored really high on a 
                        practice test.  Over three hundred 
                        points higher than he ever did 
                        before.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hey, that’s great news.
                          (to Sara)
                        You must be some kind of genius.

           Sara looks over to Jordy, whose face tightens ever so 
           slightly.

                                 SARA
                        Jordy did all the work--

                                 ARTHUR
                        Stay for a celebratory drink? 

                                 SARA
                        Thanks, but, I should--
                                    (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                 JORDY
                        I’ll drive you to the train.

           Jordy grabs his jacket and car keys, as Sara gathers her 
           stuff.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Okay, kids.  That’s right.  Ignore 
                        the old man.  Run along.  I’ll be 
                        fine.

           And he watches as they go.

           INT. JORDY’S CAR--DAY

           Jordy cranks the stereo, blasting something reckless.  Sara 
           looks over to him, concerned.

                                 SARA
                        You worked hard.  It’s your score.  
                        Don’t let him--

                                 JORDY
                        It’s just, why can’t he see that, 
                        you know?  It’s always, just, never 
                        good enough, he’s just...

           Sara understands.  Jordy shakes it off, recovering.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        But there’s one thing he is right 
                        about.

                                 SARA
                        What?

           He shoots her a smile.

                                 JORDY
                        We should celebrate.

           They come to the train station.  He drives right by.

                                 SARA
                        Jordy, wait.  Where are you--
                          (off him, not responding)
                        Jordy, come on.  I have to go back--

                                 JORDY
                        And do what?

           Sara doesn’t have an answer.

                        You can take a later train.  They 
                        run every hour.  Don’t worry.  I 
                        promise, I won’t bite.

           He turns the stereo up even louder to cover her protests, 
           makes an “I can’t hear you” sign, and rolls the windows down.  
           She can’t help smiling, enjoying the feeling of speed, the 
           wind in her face.

           EXT. MALL/ARCADE--DAY

           Jordy’s car screeches into the parking lot.  

           INT. PIZZA JOINT--DAY

           Music plays, HIGH SCHOOLERS hang out.  Sara and Jordy share a 
           pie at a table in back.

                                 JORDY
                          (thinking it through)
                        If I got that score, I could 
                        actually get in.  To Harvard.

                                 SARA
                        Maybe.  If that’s what you want.

           Jordy looks unsettled.

                                 JORDY
                        Well.  It’s what my parents want, 
                        and it’s where my dad went, and 
                        it’s where you went.

                                 SARA
                        Yeah, but what about you?

           Jordy takes this in.

                                 JORDY
                        I don’t know. I--

           Suddenly, WATTS and COOPER, two stoned soccer teammates, 
           bound up to the table.  Watts thinks he’s black; Cooper’s 
           neck is as thick as his head.  
                        COOPER
                                                    WATTS
           ‘Sup, Jo-Jo.

                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                            (cid:13)           But they’ve noticed Sara and are now just staring, silently.  
           Jordy takes the cue.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        This is Sara.  Sara, this is Cooper 
                        and Watts.

           They look her over, very impressed.

                                 WATTS
                        J-man, you rock my world.

           Sara smiles in spite of herself.  

                                 COOPER
                        Dude, we’ll see you at Campbell’s 
                        later?  We got, like ten cases of 
                        Veuve, tons of food.  It’s gonna be 
                        sick.  

                                 JORDY
                        Yeah, sure.  We’ll be there.

           Sara shoots Jordy a look as Cooper and Watts go, looking back 
           to check her out.  

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        You ready?

                                 SARA
                        What?

           Jordy stuffs the last crust of pizza into his mouth.

                                 JORDY
                        Well.  I think that you.  Are about 
                        to seriously.  Go down.

           INT. ARCADE--LATER

           A jukebox cranks out tunes, as Sara and Jordy play a vicious 
           match at an old foosball table in the corner.  They are 
           completely into it, grunting and sweating, fiercely 
           passionate and very intense. 

           Sara performs a complicated set of moves, as Jordy slams into 
           the table, trying desperately to block.
                         SARA
                                                    JORDY
           Goal!
                                          No, no, no!

           She does a little victory dance. 
                                (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                 JORDY
                          (agonizing)
                        How can you be so good at this?

                                 SARA
                        I actually majored in it at 
                        Harvard.  

                                 JORDY
                        It’s not fair--  

                                 SARA
                        All’s fair in foosball.

                                 JORDY
                        I want a rematch.

           Sara laughs and goes to the jukebox, picking some songs, as 
           Jordy re-sets the foosball players.  

           She comes back, smiling.

                                 SARA
                        Don’t be a sore loser.

                                 JORDY
                        Oh, I don’t lose.  It’s best of 
                        three.  And we’re switching teams 
                        because your players are obviously 
                        better--

           One of Sara’s songs starts to play on the jukebox.  Jordy 
           notices the music.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        Did you put this on?

           Sara nods.  It’s an amazing song, one Jordy’s never heard 
           before.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                          (listening)
                        It’s pretty good.

           They both listen, transported.

           INT. CAMPBELL’S HOUSE--DUSK

           Jordy leads Sara by hand through a cavernous house, full of 
           dark woods and rich fabrics. 

           Sara, suddenly nervous, grabs him.
                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                 SARA
                        Jordy--I don’t know about this.

                                 JORDY
                        I think you can handle a bunch of 
                        drunk high schoolers--

                                 SARA
                        I know, but I’m--

                                 JORDY
                        Relax, nerd.  You’ll be fine.  

           She looks dubious.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                          (off her)
                        Didn’t the math team ever go to 
                        parties in high school?

           She smiles at him, busted.

           EXT. BACK PATIO--CONTINOUS

           The French doors swing open...

           This is where the cool kids are.  

           BOYS pass around overflowing bottles of Veuve Cliquot; GIRLS 
           drape themselves lazily on lounge chairs.  Music THUMPS from 
           hidden outdoor speakers:  the riffs of Kanye.

           Nearby, a few nubile GIRLS IN BIKINIS, defying the chill of 
           fall, dangle their feet in a perfectly pale blue heated 
           swimming pool.  A COUPLE makes out hungrily in an adjacent 
           hot tub.   

           As Jordy and Sara appear, a few guys nod to him.  Sara looks 
           a bit overwhelmed.

                                 JORDY
                          (off her)
                        Drink?

           They make their way over to the grill area, where a tall, 
           skinny redhead, LEO, is cooking a new batch of burgers on a 
           stainless steel built in grill as he chows from a bag of 
           Funyuns.  

                                 LEO
                          (re the burgers)
                        Kobe beef, bitches!

           Cliquot and Red Bulls.

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        No no no, Dude, rock the punch.  

           A huge silver bowl has been dragged out onto the patio, 
           surrounded by cut crystal hi-ball glasses.  As Jordy goes to 
           it, Sara pulls him aside.

                                 SARA
                        Jordy, I mean, not to be lame and 
                        all, but do you know how much 
                        trouble I could get in if something 
                        happened here?  I’m the only legal 
                        adult--

                                 JORDY
                        Nah, Campbell’s parents are totally 
                        upstairs. It’s their house, they’re 
                        responsible.  Sara.  We’ve been 
                        doing this since, like, the eighth 
                        grade.   

           He ladles some dark brown punch into a glass, hands it to 
           her.  She smells it, giggles.

                                 SARA
                        What is that?

           He laughs.

                                 JORDY
                        I don’t know.  Try it.

           EXT. CAMPBELL’S HOUSE, POOLSIDE--LATER

           Sara, now relaxed, lounges with Jordy, Cooper, Watts, Leo, 
           CAMPBELL (the host) and a few girls:  TAYLOR, a tawny beauty, 
           RACHEL, a late-bloomer still waiting for puberty, and BEVIN, 
           a preppy ice-queen.  

           They’re passing around a joint and a couple bottles of Veuve, 
           talking smack.

                                 COOPER
                        ...British Airways, definitely.  
                        You get, like, a full-on bed, 
                        that’s like, that Swedish foam 
                        shit, you get cashmere socks, and  
                        they give you hot cookies.

                        Dude, no way, have you flown first 
                        in Lufthansa?  You get a whole 
                        cashmere blanket.  You get fuckin’ 
                        Bose headphones for your TV, plus 
                        the stewardesses give you free foot 
                        massages.

                                 WATTS
                        Yeah, well, on Singapore Air the 
                        stewardesses give you blow jobs.

           They all crack up, ad-libbing “Dude, no way,”  “Yeah, right.”  

                                 WATTS (CONT’D)
                        I swear.

           The girls giggle.  One of them lights a cigarette.  Jordy 
           puts his arm around Sara.  Taylor looks over at Jordy and 
           stalks off into the house.

                                 CAMPBELL
                          (to Jordy, re Taylor)
                        Dude.

                                 JORDY
                        Whatever.

           Bevin inspects Sara, the new object of Jordy’s attention.

                                 BEVIN
                        I love your nails.  Is that Black 
                        Diamond by Chanel?

           Sara looks down at her hands; her nails are indeed black.

                                 SARA
                        Oh, no.  It’s just, um, a Sharpie?

                                 BEVIN
                        Wow.  That’s hot.

                                 SARA
                        I get bored sometimes and I just 
                        color them in.

                                 RACHEL
                        That’s really hot.

           Sara leans back, enjoying her high, enjoying the moment, 
           enjoying the utterly foreign and seductive feeling of being 
           the coolest girl in school.

                          (looking at the empty 
                           champagne bottles)
                        Whoa, we’re out.

                                 CAMPBELL
                          (half-passed out)
                        There’s tons in the house--

                                 SARA
                        I got it.

           She gets up, in control and at ease.

                                 CAMPBELL
                          (smiles at her)
                        Nice.

           INT. CAMPBELL’S HOUSE, KITCHEN--LATE AFTERNOON

           Sara opens the sub-zero refrigerator, surveys the cartons of 
           prepared foods, and grabs two bottles of champagne.  

           She turns to see Taylor, watching her.

                                 SARA
                        Hey.

           Taylor sizes her up, not impressed.

                                 TAYLOR
                          (re Sara’s nails)
                        Black Diamond?

                                 SARA
                        Sharpie.

                                 TAYLOR
                        That’s so sad.

           Sara half-smiles to herself, slightly enjoying being a 
           threat.  She brushes past Taylor and goes back outside.

           EXT. CAMPBELL’S HOUSE PATIO--EVENING

           The sky is just starting to take on a pinkish cast, giving 
           everything a rosy glow.  Sara lays back, a bit apart from 
           rest of the party, watching the stars come out.  

           Jordy comes over and lays down next to her.  A silence.

                        Prevaricate.

                                 JORDY
                        To depart from the truth. 

                                 SARA
                        Naive.

                                 JORDY
                        Dumb.

                                 SARA
                          (correcting him)
                        Unsophisticated.  
                          (then)
                        Okay, Intransigent.

                                 JORDY
                        I always forget this.

                                 SARA
                        Refusing to agree or compromise. 

           She glances over at him.

                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        Um...Tangible.

           He thinks.  She stares back up at the sky.  He turns to her.

                                 JORDY
                        Real.  Can be touched.

           She keeps looking up, feeling his gaze.

                                 SARA
                        I should go.

           EXT. METRO NORTH TRAIN STATION PLATFORM--NIGHT

           Sara and Jordy sit on a bench, waiting for her train back to 
           the city and sharing a cigarette.  It’s gotten cold and she’s 
           wrapped in Jordy’s jacket, shivering. 

           A silence.

                                 JORDY 
                        You never said thank you.  For the

                        It’s beautiful.  I love it.  You’re 
                        so talented, Jordy.  You’re 
                        different from--

                                 JORDY
                        My friends?  Yeah, let’s hope so.

           Pause.  He’s looking right through her.  The connection 
           between them is dangerous and undeniable.  

                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        Jordy, I...

           He takes her hand, looks at it, running his fingers over 
           hers.  Around her wrist is an old piece of string.  He 
           touches it.

                                 JORDY
                        What’s that?

                                 SARA
                        Oh that’s...  It’s my lucky string. 
                          (then)
                        You can have it... if you want.

           He slips it off her, holds out his arm.  She ties it around 
           his wrist, as the train ROARS into the station.

                                 JORDY
                        Okay, did this used to be white 
                        because it’s like gray.

                                 SARA
                        Just hold still.  Nerd.  

           He grabs her hand.  Squeezes it.  He pulls her closer to him, 
           when, suddenly:

           A CONDUCTOR leans out of the train, yells to Sara.

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        Train’s leaving, young lady.

           Embarrassed, she breaks free, runs onto the train.

           Jordy watches it go.

           Sara leans back, closes her eyes, letting the feel of the 
           train overtake her.  She wraps Jordy’s jacket around her 
           tighter.

           INT. SARA’S APARTMENT--MORNING

           Sara, still covered in Jordy’s jacket, is asleep on her bed.  
           The phone RINGS.  And RINGS.  And RINGS.

           Finally, the machine picks up.  

                                 PAMMIE (ON MACHINE)
                        Sara.  Pamela Anders.  I need to 
                        speak with you as soon as possible.  
                        It’s... regarding Jordy.  So.  Give 
                        me a call.

           Sara opens her eyes, a feeling of dread.

           Her cell phone RINGS.  And RINGS.  And RINGS.

           She grabs it, checks it.  It’s Gretchen.  She sends the call 
           to voicemail.  Paces for a few moments.  Checks the message.

                                 GRETCHEN (ON VOICEMAIL)
                        Hey, Sar.  It’s Gretchen.  Just 
                        spoke with Pammie Anders.  I was 
                        hoping you could give me a call 
                        when you get this, there’s 
                        something very important I need to 
                        talk with you about--

           Sara clicks off the phone.  Panic is setting in.  She stares 
           at Jordy’s jacket.  

                                 SARA
                          (whispers)
                        Oh God.

           Her cell rings again.  It’s Pammie, now calling on the cell 
           phone.  She takes a quick breath.  Answers.

                        Now, you’re going to say I’m being 
                        one of those crazy neurotic parents 
                        but the test is in a week and a 
                        half, and we’re going to be on 
                        Martha’s Vineyard this week for 
                        Thanksgiving, you know, and we were 
                        just hoping you could come out for 
                        a few days and just drill questions 
                        with him.  I would hate for his 
                        brain to go soft, and I’ve already 
                        worked out the money with Gretchen 
                        at your company and the money’s 
                        substantial, I promise,  and the 
                        weather’s supposed to be gorgeous 
                        and Ana makes a mean turkey and 
                        this amazing stuffing, I have no 
                        idea what she puts in it, heroin 
                        probably, but...please, Sara. Say 
                        you’ll come.

           Sara’s packing as she talks on the phone.  She tries on 
           several dresses, deciding which looks best.

                        It’s just that it’s a bunch of 
                        money and I can’t afford not to 
                        take it... 

           She stands in front of the mirror, checking out her 
           reflection, her figure, in the dress.

                        as soon as I’m back.  I promise.  
                        Of course I’ll miss you.  I love

           Sara stares out over the bow of a sleek motorboat as it 
           speeds towards a small island off the coast.  

           Behind her, sitting in the boat, are Jordy, Pammie and 
           Lauren.  

           Arthur steers, his eyes wandering to the pale backs of Sara’s 
           legs under her skirt, which whips in the breeze.  

           INT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD HOUSE, SARA’S ROOM--DAY

           Sara stands in an enormous, sunshine-filled bedroom decorated 
           in lime green and lavender.  She explores.  

           Through one door: an ivory marble bathroom.  Through the 
           huge, clean windows: views of the sparkling, azure ocean.   
           On the night stand: another beautiful, exotic orchid.

           A quick KNOCK on the door.

           Sara opens it.  Ana is there with fresh towels.

                                 ANA
                        For you.

           Sara smiles, reaches in her bag and hands Ana another folder 
           of practice problems.

                                 SARA
                        For your daughter.

           goes.

           Sara starts to unpack her bag.  She takes out a few SAT 
           books, her composition notebooks.  Then, finally...

           A Xerox copy of her manuscript.

           INT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD MANSION, DINING ROOM--EVENING

           Arthur, Pammie, Sara, Jordy and another couple: BRUCE and 
           SUSAN sit around a beautifully set table, as Ana serves wild 
           salmon filets.

                                 ARTHUR
                        ...Forget Taiwan, forget Hong Kong, 
                        Singapore, screw ‘em.  Shanghai is 
                        where the big money is right now.  
                        Eighth largest city in the world 
                        now, in ten years, it’s gonna be 
                        bigger than all of South Korea.  
                        They are going to buy and sell our 
                        asses--

                                 PAMMIE
                        Well, they’re not going to buy and 
                        sell my ass.

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, sweetheart, only I get to do 
                        that.

                                 BRUCE
                        I hope you get a good price!

           They all laugh.  Another SERVANT refills their wine glasses.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        Seriously, I’m telling you, pretty 
                        soon China is going to own us all.  
                        By the time you have kids, Jord, 
                        they’ll be trading in their PB&J 
                        for General Tso’s Chicken!

           Everyone laughs again.  Lauren bops up to the table, still in 
           her cute tennis clothes, a bit sweaty from practice.  She 
           sits and chugs her water.

                                 PAMMIE
                        Have you ever traveled to the Far 
                        East?
                   (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                            (cid:13)           It takes Sara a moment to realize Pammie’s addressing her.

                                 SARA
                        No, um, you know, I actually 
                        studied Chinese in college for 
                        about three years and I took a 
                        Chinese history course, but I never 
                        made it over there.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Now that’s smart, learning Chinese.

           As they chatter and eat, Lauren subtly gestures to her own 
           mouth, letting Sara know she’s got something stuck in her 
           teeth.  Sara immediately runs her tongue over them.  Lauren 
           gestures a few more times until finally...

                                 LAUREN
                          (sotto)
                        Got it.

           The conversation continues about China, as Sara smiles 
           gratefully to Lauren.

                                 SARA
                          (sotto)
                        Thanks.
                          (then, making 
                           conversation)
                        How’s practice going?

                                 LAUREN
                        You know.  Intense.  But cool.  Do 
                        you play?

                                 SARA
                        Oh, I used to a little but not--

                                 LAUREN
                        Awesome, let’s hit some balls 
                        tomorrow.  

           Sara looks dubious.  Lauren giggles.

           EXT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD, TENNIS COURTS--DAY

           A deep, primal, BELLOW emerges from Lauren, as she slams a 
           killer serve that almost takes Sara’s head off.
                                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                 LAUREN
                        Ace!
                          (then, off her)
                        You okay?

                                 SARA
                        Yeah, sure, I’m fine.

           With another massive GRUNT, she slams yet another ace, and 
           another, as Sara flinches out of the way.

                                 LAUREN 
                        Come on!  Don’t duck!  It’s not 
                        dodgeball!  

           Lauren GRUNTS and serves again, as Sara lunges to return... 
           And hits a weird, off-balance shot that Lauren can’t get to.

           A beat.  

           They both stand there, dumbfounded.  Finally, Lauren brushes 
           it off.

                                 LAUREN (CONT’D)
                        Lucky shot.  

           Sara recovers her balance, a bit proud of herself.  Buoyed by 
           the small victory, she starts to dig deeper, bouncing from 
           side to side on her toes, anticipating Lauren’s next shot.

           And now Sara starts to win a few points. Her face scrunches 
           as she gasps for breath, her body awkward but surprisingly 
           effective.

           Now Lauren intensifies as well, stepping up her game.  Her 
           GRUNTS get deeper and even more primal, as teeth clenched, 
           eyes ablaze, she gives it her all.  

           This is war.

           GRUNT.  GRUNT.  GRUNT.

           Deuce.  Then, Advantage Sara.  And then...

           Finally, on one particularly excruciating, thrilling point, 
           Sara wins a game.

                                 SARA
                          (exhilarated)
                        I can’t believe I broke your serve!

           Sara comes up to the net, ready to switch sides, but Lauren’s 
           just standing still, watching Sara, stunned. 
                                      (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        Lauren?  Hey, can you believe I won 
                        a game?

           Suddenly, Lauren smashes her racket down on the ground, 
           cracking it.  She stomps on it a few times, furious.

           Sara stifles a smile as Lauren storms off, muttering to 
           herself.

                                 LAUREN 
                        Stupid fucking tennis.

           EXT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD HOUSE, FRONT LAWN--SUNSET

           Sara, still sweaty and a bit sore from the game, sits out 
           enjoying a few last rays as she grades one of Jordy’s vocab 
           drills.

           Suddenly a male form emerges from running on the beach, 
           backlit.  

                                 SARA
                        Jordy?

           He comes closer.  It’s Arthur.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Just me.  I’m flattered, though, 
                        that you could mix an old guy up 
                        with a high school kid.

           He takes off his shirt and uses it to wipe the sweat from his 
           brow.  He’s in beautiful shape.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Come for a swim.

                                 SARA
                        No thanks, it’s way too cold for me 
                        this time of year--

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s refreshing.  Come on.  You 
                        look like you could use a cool 
                        down.  

                                 SARA
                        No, really, I--I don’t even have a 
                        suit--
                                            (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                 ARTHUR
                        There’s extras in the pool house.  

           Sara shakes her head.

                                 SARA
                        I really can’t, you know, honestly 
                        the ocean has never been my thing.  
                        There’s sea creatures and 
                        monsters...

                                 ARTHUR
                          (he chuckles, then)
                        Don’t worry.  I’ll protect you.

           Sara takes a breath.  No way out of this.

           INT. POOL HOUSE--MOMENTS LATER

           The pool house is outfitted with hair brushes, dryers, 
           towels, sunscreens, a soda machine, everything.

           Sara chooses a blue bikini from a rack of spare suits.  She 
           puts it on, checking herself out in the mirror.  Despite her 
           pale skin, and the fact that it gaps a bit in places, she 
           looks pretty great.

           EXT. OCEAN--SUNSET

           Arthur swims with strong strokes.  Sara is a bit slower but 
           still keeps up, despite the waves hitting her in the face.

           She swims underwater for a moment, opening her eyes to the 
           deep green.  It’s very quiet.  A bit eerie.

           When she resurfaces, Arthur’s nowhere to be found.  Finally, 
           she spots him, climbing up onto a nearby buoy.  She swims 
           over to join him and he helps her up.   

                                 ARTHUR
                        Not too bad.  For a writer.

           She can’t tell if he’s talking about her swimming...or her 
           body.

                                 SARA
                        Oh.  Thanks.

           He leans back, relaxing.
                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 ARTHUR
                        Of course, personally, I don’t 
                        trust books

                                 SARA
                        Don’t trust them?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Full of lies.

                                 SARA
                        I think they’re full of truths.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Ha.  Even worse.  

           Sara laughs in spite of herself.  

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        You spend all your time sitting 
                        around reading, suddenly, life just 
                        passes you by.  You end up with 
                        nothing but missed opportunities...

           He looks over to her.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Life’s a war.  You have to fight 
                        for your moment.  That’s why when I 
                        see something I want...I take it.  

           Arthur’s eyes wander down to the deep neckline of her 
           swimsuit.  She folds her arms over her chest.

                                 SARA
                        That’s...quite a philosophy.

           Suddenly Arthur grabs her arm, not hard but not lightly.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Sara.

                                 SARA
                        Look, I don’t, um, I--

                                 ARTHUR
                        Don’t screw with my son.

           She’s completely thrown, which is just where Arthur wants 
           her.  

                                 SARA
                        What?  How would I...
                                      (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                 ARTHUR
                        Just get him in.

           Arthur smiles, ice cold and terrifying.  He dives off the 
           buoy and starts a brisk crawl towards shore.  Sara shivers 
           under the darkening sky.

           EXT. BEACH--AFTER DUSK

           Sara, lips blue, comes out of the ocean and grabs a towel. 
           She wraps herself in it, as she looks back out to the water 
           and shakes her head in disbelief at what just happened.

           She starts up to the house.

           EXT. FRONT TERRACE--CONTINUOUS

           Sara passes by the family, sitting out enjoying cocktail 
           hour.  Arthur, already dressed for dinner with his wet hair 
           slicked back, mixes drinks.  He looks over to Sara, still in 
           her suit and towel.  She quickly averts her eyes.  

           Pammie notices, sips her vodka gimlet.

           INT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD HOUSE, LIVING ROOM--DAY

           Sara and Jordy work at a desk.  Sara looks a bit worn out 
           from the “family vacation,” but Jordy’s intensely focused.  

                                 SARA
                        Okay.  Break time.

                                 JORDY
                        One more drill? 

           She looks at him wearily.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 SARA
                        Yeah, it’s just...

                                 JORDY
                        My family?
                          (off her)
                        Now you see what I’m dealing with.

                        I can see that...you’re nothing 
                        like them.  You’re so different, 
                        Jordy, you know, you’re deeper, you 
                        love art, and you draw and you’re--

           Pammie pokes her head in.

                                 PAMMIE
                        How’s it going in here?

                                 SARA
                        Good.  Good.  He’s about to do 
                        another practice math drill--

                                 PAMMIE
                        Great idea. So...
                          (to Sara)
                        Can I steal you for a bit?  Please?

           EXT. DRIVING RANGE--DAY

           Pammie, in a Burberry jacket and Hermes scarf, hits balls 
           under the bright November sun while Sara watches.  

                                 PAMMIE
                        Can you believe this weather?  I 
                        hate to admit it, but sometimes I 
                        just love global warming.

           Pammie laughs and takes a swing.  It’s terrible.  She rolls 
           her eyes and hands Sara the golf club. 

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh God, I’m awful.  Now Sara, give 
                        it a try.  Just let it happen.  
                        Don’t think about your arms.  Don’t 
                        think about your back, your hips, 
                        just let go and...

           Sara gives it a shot.  It’s even worse.  They both laugh.

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, for God’s sake, we need a 
                        daiquiri.

           INT. CLUB HOUSE--DAY

           They sit at a large pebbled glass table, sucking down frothy 
           banana daiquiris.  Pammie’s sneaking a cigarette, enjoying 
           the girl time.
                                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                 PAMMIE
                          (re the smoke)
                        Don’t tell my family.  I’ll get the 
                        biggest lecture, but sometimes I 
                        just need one.  

           Pammie blows smoke rings.

                                 SARA
                        Your secret’s safe with me.

                                 PAMMIE
                        You’re so good to be here.  I hope 
                        your father isn’t furious with me, 
                        taking you on the holiday.  I just 
                        worry about Jordy.  Ugh.  How did I 
                        get this neurotic?  I was a hippie, 
                        you know.  I was at Woodstock.  I 
                        mean, I inhaled.

           She takes a long, satisfying drag.  Sara sucks on her 
           daiquiri.

                                 SARA
                        And then?

                                 PAMMIE 
                        You know, I met Arthur.
                          (sighs, then)
                        Tell me he behaved himself.  During 
                        your little swim?

                                 SARA
                        Oh.  Yeah, that was just--we were 
                        talking about Jordy--

                                 PAMMIE
                        Sara.  I’m not a fool.  I know my 
                        husband.  I just hope he didn’t 
                        upset you.  

                                 SARA
                        It was nothing.  Really.

           Pammie looks down, suddenly vulnerable.

                                 PAMMIE
                        I know what you must think of me.  
                        If I were your age and saw a 
                        woman...accepting that, I would 
                        think, well, I would think she was 
                        so...
                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                 SARA
                        I don’t--

                                 PAMMIE
                        But I’m not like you, Sara.  I’m 
                        not smart.  I don’t have any talent 
                        for anything except just... being 
                        myself.  And, well, Arthur is 
                        willing to compensate me for that.  
                          (then, with a laugh)
                        Or he was, anyway... Who knows what 
                        the future holds.  Who know what 
                        happens if I gain five pounds, or 
                        rock the boat, or Jordy doesn’t get 
                        in.

           Pammie, puts her hands to her face, as her sunny facade gives 
           way to heartbreaking desperation.

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        You have no idea how jealous I am 
                        of you.  You have a book.  A voice.  
                        I’d give anything for that.

                                 SARA
                        You have a lot.  Your children, 
                        your beautiful homes, you 
                        have...Jordy.

                                 PAMMIE
                        Come on.  You’re smarter than that.  
                        You know that none of that stuff is 
                        really, truly mine.

           Pammie takes a sip of daiquiri, recovering.  She squeezes 
           Sara’s arm.  A bond.

           INT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD, DINING ROOM--NIGHT

           The whole Anders family including GRANDPARENTS, an AUNT, an 
           UNCLE, and several COUSINS, sit gathered at a Thanksgiving 
           table.  

           Ana serves, giving an extra little smile to Sara, as if to 
           say, “Thank you.”  Sara smiles back.  Everyone clasps hands.

           Lauren, for the first time in normal (non-tennis) clothes, 
           says grace.

                                 LAUREN
                        Thank you God for providing food, 
                        and shelter and each other.

                                 LAUREN (CONT’D)
                        And thank you for our good fortune.  
                        Amen.

           Lauren looks up, and everyone begins to eat, Sara’s voice 
           blending with the voices of the family, until she is truly, 
           completely one of the group.

           EXT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD DOCK--CONTINUOUS

           Pammie stands on the dock as Sara gets into a waiting boat, 
           about to spirit her off.

                                 PAMMIE
                        ...and you’ll be met by a car at 
                        the main dock, which will take you 
                        home.

                                 SARA
                        Don’t worry about Jordy.  He’s 
                        ready.  Just make sure he keeps 
                        looking at that vocab--

           A DECK HAND grabs Sara’s duffel bag and throws it in the 
           boat.  He’s about to take her backpack, when she stops him.

                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                          (to the Deck Hand)
                        Wait.  Hold on.
                          (to Pammie)
                        Here it is.  As promised.  

           She opens her backpack, pulls out the manuscript and hands it 
           to Pammie.

                                 PAMMIE
                        Your novel.  Sara.  This is a big 
                        step.  

           She looks at the title page.

                                 PAMMIE
                          (reading the title)
                        Small World.  I like that.  
                          (then, full of maternal 
                           love)
                        I’m so proud of you. 

           They hug warmly.

                        I can’t wait to give this to 
                        Marianne.

                                 SARA
                        Thank you.  For everything.

           Sara climbs in the boat and it speeds off, over the clear, 
           blue sea.  From the lawn, Jordy watches her go.

           EXT. JACOBS HOUSE--DAY

           The front door of a modest house in very rural Massachusetts 
           swings open to reveal Joseph, in a ratty tweed jacket and 
           jeans.

           Sara stands on the doorstep with her backpack, an overnight 
           bag, and several shopping bags of things she’s picked up 
           along the way.

                                 SARA
                        Happy Thanksgiving, Dad.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Well, well, well.  Better late than 
                        never, I suppose.

           He gives her a little kiss on the head, and she comes inside.  

           INT. JACOBS HOUSE--EVENING

           Joseph, wearing an apron, has attempted a full Thanksgiving 
           dinner in the cramped, dingy little kitchen.  Dirty dishes 
           fill the sink.  Books are everywhere, stacked in piles, on 
           shelves, on chairs, on the table.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        The nice thing about celebrating so 
                        late is that the turkey was half-
                        price.

                                 SARA
                        I’m sorry, Dad.  It’s just, like I 
                        said, the money was--

                                 JOSEPH
                        Sure, of course.  I understand.

           A pause.  Sara can tell her father’s hurt.

                        I have something for you.

           She opens one of her large bags, starts to rummage through 
           it, pulling out a few sheaves of papers, folders, stacks of 
           notebooks.  Her father’s eyes light up in anticipation.

           Finally, she pulls out a large box.  She opens it to reveal a 
           beautiful pink orchid, wrapped in colored plastic paper.  
           It’s exactly the same as the ones in the Anders houses.

           If Joseph is disappointed, he covers it well.

                                 JOSEPH
                        An orchid.  Sara, this was 
                        expensive.

                                 SARA
                        I just thought it was cool.  

           He looks closer, appreciating its strange beauty. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        To see the world in a grain of 
                        sand, and a heaven in a wild 
                        flower.

                                 SARA
                        Hold infinity in the palm of your 
                        hand, and eternity in an hour.
                          (she smiles)
                        Blake.

           He nods, proud of his smart daughter.

                                 JOSEPH 
                        You know “orchid” is from the 
                        Greek, “orkheos,” meaning testicle.

                                 SARA
                          (embarrassed)
                        Really?  Oh, God, I--

                                 JOSEPH
                        No, it’s perfect.  Who couldn’t use 
                        more balls?

           Sara laughs, as Joseph smiles at her: she’s forgiven.

JACOBS HOUSE--NIGHT

           Sara and Joseph sit at the kitchen table. Joseph unwraps a 
           bottle of Veuve Cliquot.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I have been saving this for almost 
                        a year.  And...
                          (pops the cork)
                        Now is the moment.

           He pours, and holds up his glass.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        A toast.  To health and happiness. 
                        To hard work. To enlightening young 
                        minds of future generations.  To 
                        you finishing your novel.
                          (then, some advice, 
                           quoting)
                        Trust thyself.  Every heart 
                        vibrates to that iron string.  
                        That’s--

                                 SARA
                        Emerson.  I know.

           They clink glasses, and sip.

           INT. JACOBS HOUSE, SARA’S BEDROOM--NIGHT

           Nothing has changed in here since Sara was in high school:  
           Math Team trophies, French Club prizes, and old stuffed 
           animals gather dust.  

           On the walls are photographs of Sara and her parents, Sara 
           and her mother at graduation, her mother as a young woman, in 
           front of Sara’s same Underwood typewriter.

           Sara lays in bed, covered by a graying pink Hello Kitty 
           bedspread, staring at the ceiling.  An alarm clock on the 
           bedside table says it’s 3 a.m.  

           A vibrating noise comes from her phone, also on the table.  
           She reaches for it, answers.

                                 SARA
                        Hello?

           It’s Jordy.

           INT. ANDERS MANSION, JORDY’S BEDROOM

           The room is enormous, and includes an indoor putting tee, a 
           pool table, and a huge flat screen TV with a Playstation 
           system attached.  Jordy is in a plush, overstuffed bed, 
           shirtless under a Frette sheet, his cell phone to his ear. 

                                 JORDY
                        I’m freaking out.

                                 SARA
                        Jordy?  Do you know what time--

                                 JORDY
                        What’s the area of a cylinder?

                                 SARA
                        They’ll give you that formula on 
                        the--

                                 JORDY
                        What’s the difference between mean, 
                        median and mode?

                                 SARA
                        You know this.  I know you know it.  
                        Get some sleep.  

           Pause.

                                 JORDY
                        Sara?

           A long pause.  Both of them breathe together on the phone.  

           Sara kicks off her blanket.  Her tank top is bunched up 
           around her shoulders, exposing her body in the moonlight.  
           She lays her hand on her belly, gently, rising and falling.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        I just feel, like, this huge huge 
                        weight crushing me all the time.  
                        And I think it might be...my 
                        future. 

           Pause.  He might be crying.

                                 SARA
                        I feel that way too.

                        No, you don’t.  

                                 SARA
                        Really--

                                 JORDY
                        You’re better than anyone in 
                        Greenwich... Anyone I’ve ever met.

                                 SARA
                        Well, there’s a wide world out 
                        there.

                                 JORDY
                        Mmmmmm.  

           A silence.  Jordy’s starting to get sleepy.

                                 SARA 
                        Jordy?

           He wakes up for a moment.  Then starts to fall asleep as he 
           talks.

                                 JORDY
                        I would like to, you know, keep 
                        traveling, just go everywhere and 
                        just maybe meet people and, like, 
                        draw pictures of everything I see.  
                        And paintings.  Make paintings.  
                        And make people and things into 
                        beautiful art, you know, 
                        colors...and... 
                        shapes...and...beautiful, amazing 
                        things...  

                                 SARA
                        Jordan.  Good night.  Good luck 
                        tomorrow.

           Sara waits on the phone for him to hang up.  He doesn’t.  
           He’s asleep.  She lays her head on the pillow, listening to 
           his breathing get deep and heavy.  She stays that way for a 
           very long time.

           EXT. CEMETERY--DAY

           Sara stands with Joseph at her mother’s grave.  It is carved 
           with her mother’s name, and with the Buddha’s last words:  

           “Make of yourself a light unto the world”

                                 JOSEPH
                          (quietly, to the 
                           gravestone)
                        My North, my South, my East, my 
                        West.  My working week, my Sunday 
                        rest...  

           Sara watches, feeling for him--and with him.  After a moment, 
           he gets up, ready to go.  

           As they walk back to the car, Sara nervously glances at her 
           watch.  The minute hand ticks to exactly nine a.m.

           INT. GREENWICH HIGH SCHOOL--DAY

           A clock on the wall ticks to exactly nine a.m.

           Jordy sits in a long row of nervous-looking high school KIDS, 
           tugging on his lucky string.  A TEACHER addresses the 
           students.

                                 TEACHER 
                        Please open your test booklet to 
                        page one.  And begin...now.

           INT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR--DAY

           It’s a chilly, gray day.  Sara walks along the perimeter, 
           deep in thought.

           She turns to see Adam jogging over to her.  

                                 ADAM 
                        Hey!  Wow.  What a crazy 
                        coincidence, bumping into you like 
                        this.  You come here a lot?

                                 SARA
                        Um, not that much, no--

                                 ADAM
                        Oh.  Really?  Gretchen said you do-- 

           A beat.  Adam realizes he’s busted.  Sara smiles as he looks 
           around sheepishly.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Whew, it’s freezing.  Coffee?

CAFE--AFTERNOON

           Sara and Adam sit on an overstuffed sofa, as jazz plays in 
           the background.  She warms her hands on a large mug of 
           coffee.

                                 ADAM
                        So.  Hey, I took your suggestion, 
                        and I started working on turning  
                        some of my poems and music into 
                        this whole rock opera.

           Sara sips her coffee, trying to remember.

                                 SARA
                        I suggested that?

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, it’s kind of about love and 
                        the search for humanity in this 
                        post apocalyptic wasteland.
                          (then)
                        That sounded lame.

                                 SARA
                          (laughs)
                        No, it’s sounds good.

                                 ADAM
                        Anyway, thank you.

           A little pause.

                        So...Gretchen said you’re a great 
                        writer.

                                 SARA
                        She’s never seen any of my writing.

                        You know I’d love to read some of 
                        your stuff sometime, maybe.  If you 
                        ever wanted to show me anything.

                                 SARA
                        Maybe.

           He looks at her.  
                                (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 ADAM 
                        You want to see what I’m reading 
                        right now?  These really beautiful 
                        poems... 

           He reaches in his bag and pulls out a book of poetry, flips 
           to a page, and reads.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        ....they catch the moon in cup-
                        shaped bowls/And they raise it’s 
                        floating light/ To their lips, 
                        burning with desire to see/ Into 
                        the gullet of night, each one/dips 
                        and drinks and dips and drinks,/ 
                        Until there is only dark water,/ 
                        Until there is only the dark.

           A pause.  He looks up.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        I mean, how good is that?  

           She looks at him knowingly.

                                 SARA
                        Yeah.  It’s...my mom’s. 

                                 ADAM
                        Really?

           His face breaks into a sly smile: Clearly, he knew.  She 
           smiles back, getting it.  He looks at her for a beat, 
           thinking.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        It kind of makes you never want to 
                        write another word, because what 
                        would be the point?

           Sara nods, understanding all too well.  He opens to the 
           dedication page.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        I love this, she dedicates it to...
                          (reading)
                        My North, my South, my East, my 
                        West.  My working week, my Sunday 
                        rest.   
                          (then, to Sara)
                        Your parents must have had an 
                        amazing relationship.

Smiles at him.

                                 SARA 
                        Thank you.  

           She starts to put on her jacket.

                                 ADAM
                        You’re going?  Wait, here, take my 
                        number.  

           He scribbles his number on a napkin.  She takes it, folds it 
           and puts it in her bag.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Call me...anytime.

           She nods, and goes.

           INT. SUBWAY--NIGHT

           Sara sits among the other PASSENGERS, pale under the 
           flickering fluorescent light.  Over the loudspeakers, an 
           unintelligible announcement plays.  Nobody reacts.

           INT. SARA’S APT--NIGHT

           Sara curls up on her bed, staring at Jordy’s drawing, still 
           tacked up on her wall.

           The lines blur, slowly...slowly...

           FADE TO BLACK

           CRASH!

           INT. ANDERS MANSION, KITCHEN--DAY, SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

           Pammie, in the kitchen (which is now impeccably decorated for 
           Christmas), has just SMASHED an antique vase against the 
           wall.  Cut flowers and broken porcelain are everywhere.

                                 JORDY
                        Mom, what the--Jesus Christ.  What 
                        are you--

           He sees, on the marble counter top, his opened SAT score 
           report.  He picks it up, looks at it.
                                                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        Oh.
                          (then, off her)
                        Mom, calm down.  God.  Nobody died.

                                 PAMMIE
                        It’s twenty points lower than you 
                        did last time around.  It’s  three 
                        hundred and fifty lower than your 
                        practice test--

                                 JORDY
                        I can see that. 
                          (then)
                        I just choked, okay?  I had a bad 
                        day.  And maybe, maybe, have you 
                        considered that maybe I’m just not 
                        smart enough for this shit?  I have 
                        dyslexia and ADD-

                                 PAMMIE
                        Oh, grow up, Jordan.  

                                 JORDY
                        What?  The doctor-

                                 PAMMIE
                        Do you know why the doctor said 
                        that?  Because we paid him a lot of 
                        money.  I mean, have you ever 
                        wondered why eighty percent of kids 
                        in Greenwich have some damned 
                        learning disability?  Do you think 
                        there’s something in the water 
                        here?  There’s an idea!  Call Erin 
                        Brockovich!

                                 JORDY
                        God, Mom, why do you have to be 
                        such a bitch about this--

                                 PAMMIE
                          (very nasty)
                        I don’t know, why do you have to be 
                        such a fucking-baby-idiot.
                          (then)
                        I’m sorry.  It’s just...your father 
                        is not going to like this.

           Long, painful pause.  Jordy tries to make it better.

                        I don’t know. Your father may know 
                        someone on the board.

                                 JORDY
                        I think I can do it.  If I write a 
                        really strong application...

           Pammie slowly brightens at this ray of hope.

                        You’re right.  That’s the right 
                        attitude.  Good, I know you can do 
                        this sweetheart.

                        Now, your father and I are leaving 
                        in a week, for Aspen, a business 
                        ski thing.  Lauren’s going to stay 
                        with the Ellises, but you won’t be 
                        alone, we’ll get someone great to 
                        help you.  The Friedmans had this 
                        Chinese guy for Bennett.  Yao or 
                        Yen?  Anyway, he went over the 
                        whole application, the essays--

                        Sara or nobody.  Sara or I won’t

                        That wasn’t her fault.  Besides. I

           INT. UPPER EAST SIDE CAFE--DAY

           A favorite hang out of the ladies who lunch, decorated with 
           aggressively pink floral tablecloths, serving tea sandwiches 
           galore.  A beautiful, Christmas tree sparkles in the corner.

           Pammie and Sara sit at a table by the window, the score

                        And, as Jordy says, nobody died.  
                        God, high school is hard enough 
                        without all this pressure.  I 
                        should know.  I was the fat girl.

                        They used to call me Fat Pam.  It

                        fast, Fat Pam!”

                        Willpower and strength.  The kind 
                        of strength it’s going to take to 
                        get Jordy into Harvard.

                        Quite frankly, after what happened 
                        I wanted to try another tutor.  But 
                        he said he’ll only work with you.

                        It seems you do have a very good 
                        track record, you went to Harvard, 
                        you did work-study in admissions--

           Sara scans the parking lot, looking for Pammie or Jordy’s 
           car.  Nobody’s there to pick her up.

           EXT. ANDERS HOUSE--DAY

           Sara walks up the drive, rings the bell.  She knocks on the 
           massive door.  No answer.

           She walks around the perimeter of the house, peeks in a few 
           windows.  Through one window she notices Jordy, asleep, on 
           the sofa.  She taps on the window.  Harder.  He doesn’t wake 
           up.

           Finally, she spots a half-open window, goes to it, opens it 
           all the way and climbs in.

           AN EAR-PIERCINGLY LOUD ALARM SYSTEM GOES OFF.

           INT. ANDERS LIVING ROOM--CONTINOUS

           Jordy, groggy and not in good shape, wakes up to see, Sara 
           coming through the window.  They shout over the sound of the 
           alarm.
                                                    JORDY
                         SARA
           Fuck!  Fuck!  Jordy, turn off 
           the fucking alarm!
                                          Sara?  What the fuck?  Are 
                                          you robbing us?

                         SARA
           No, I’m not robbing you!  
           Turn off the fucking alarm!
                                                    JORDY
                                          What the fuck are you doing?  
                                          You climb in our window, 
                                          fuck!

                                                    JORDY
                         SARA
           I could see you in here.  We 
           have a session.  Nobody came 
           to pick me up.  I wanted to 
           wake you up.
                                          Are you insane?  Have you 
                                          lost your mind?  A session, 
                                          what day is it?  I’m awake, 
                                          Jesus, fuck!

           The alarm suddenly stops.  Silence.  Sara looks around the 
           living room.  It is in a complete state of disarray, 
           thoroughly trashed.

                                 SARA
                        What happened in here? 

           She sees a few empty bottles of booze.

                        No--

           She grabs for her phone.  Jordy knocks it out of her hand, 
           stumbles and falls to the floor.

           pan, cooks.

                        lacrosse.  And your Mom said

Smiles.  

                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        Jordy.

                                 JORDY
                        What?

                                 SARA
                        Stop that.  

                                 JORDY
                        Stop what?

                                 SARA
                        Stop looking at me like that.

                                 JORDY
                        Like what?

           He keeps staring straight at her.  Then, trying to recover, 
           she hands him the plate and a fork.

                                 SARA
                        Okay, why don’t you just...go 
                        start.  Just write for a bit, 
                        anything you want, stream of 
                        consciousness, get the thoughts 
                        flowing.  

           He nods, takes a bite of the omelette.

                                 JORDY
                        Mmm.  This is delicious.  

           And, taking his food, he’s off.

           INT. ANDERS HOUSE--DAY 

           Sara walks down the hallways of the quiet, empty house, 
           thrilling at the silence, the feeling of trespassing.  She  
           moves past beautiful art work, rare books, family photos in 
           Tiffany frames.  

           The house is still beautiful, but it’s no longer so 
           overwhelming.  It now feels personal, specific.

           She peers into:

           ARTHUR AND PAMMIE’S BEDROOM, a large, beautiful room with an 
           enormous, plush king-sized bed.  Two walk in closets house 
           tons of beautiful, barely worn clothes. 
                                      (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)           PAMMIE’S BATHROOM is just off the bedroom and has a huge 
           marble tub and cabinets full of Pammie’s expensive lotions 
           and creams.  She dabs some on her hands, enjoying the feel of 
           it.

           ARTHUR’S BATHROOM is still luxe, but obviously not much used.  
           Sara sniffs a bit of cologne.

           Walking further through the house, she finds herself in:

           INT. SUN ROOM--DAY

           A room with glass walls.  As the snow falls harder and harder 
           outside, it’s like she’s in a life-sized snow globe.  

           She sits watching the snow as slowly the day turns to dusk.  

           INT. JORDY’S BEDROOM--EVENING

           Sara peers into Jordy’s bedroom where he is stretched out on 
           his bed, staring at a sheet of paper.  Crumpled up pages are 
           all around him, along with a few loose drawings.  Several 
           drawings are also tacked up on the wall, near his desk.

                                 SARA
                        How’s it going?  

                                 JORDY
                        I suck at this.

           He covers up what he was writing.

                                 SARA
                        Let me see what you got?

                                 JORDY
                        No.

           She reaches for his paper.

                                 SARA
                        Jordy, come on.  Show it to me.

                                 JORDY
                        It’s bad.

                                 SARA
                        We have to start somewhere. 

           She holds out her hand for him to give her the paper.  He 
           hesitates.
                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        Fine.  Then read it to me.  
                          (off him)
                        Jordy, it’s just me.  It’s okay.  
                        It doesn’t have to be perfect.

           He looks at her.  Finally, he unfolds his paper, relenting. 

                                 JORDY
                        Sit down?

           She sits on the bed next to him.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        It’s really dumb.  Okay.
                          (a deep breath, reads)
                        I’m sorry I’m not black.
                        I'm not Latino or part Cherokee.  I  
                        have no affiliation with any of the 
                        Native tribes.  In fact, I've never 
                        even been to a reservation.  I 
                        don't speak Swahili or Yiddish or 
                        Farsi or know American Sign 
                        Language or Braille or even Morse 
                        code.  I've never won a Nobel 
                        Prize.  I've never won a free coke 
                        from my bottle cap.  When I call 
                        into the radio station, I'm never 
                        the twelfth caller.  I've never 
                        invented anything, like soda that 
                        doesn't explode when you open it no 
                        matter how shook up it gets or a 
                        robot that brings you snacks in 
                        front of the TV.  

           He takes a deep breath, his voice starting to break.

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                        I wasn't born in a leap year.  I 
                        don't have a twin.  I don't have a 
                        pet who does tricks.  I don't want 
                        to be president.  I haven't 
                        overcome great obstacles only to 
                        realize the meaning of true 
                        strength and then write a book 
                        about it.  My life will not be made 
                        into a movie, made for TV or 
                        regular.  I’ve never had major 
                        surgery.  I've never had a near-
                        death experience -- or died on the 
                        operating table and then come back 
                        after seeing a white light and my 
                        dead grandma.

                        I've never been in a car wreck.  
                        I've never had stitches.  I don't 
                        have any scars.  So that's me.

                        way.  That's me.

           Sara looks at him, moved.  

                                 SARA
                        Not bad.  Not bad at all.

           A beat.  Suddenly, the tension is thick.  She stands up. 

                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        That’s all for tonight.  I should, 
                        um, try to get back...

           She looks out the window, where the snow is coming down 
           harder.

                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        Somehow.

                                 JORDY
                        I doubt the trains are running 
                        anymore.

                                 SARA
                        I know.

           She stares out the window, not sure what to do.

                                 JORDY
                        Why don’t you just stay here?

                                 SARA
                        Where?

                                 JORDY
                        Stay here.

                                 SARA
                        Here?

           A charged beat.

                                 JORDY
                        Lauren’s room.  Right down the 
                        hall.

           She looks at him for a moment, hesitating, and goes.

LAUREN’S ROOM--NIGHT

           Sara curls up on a frilly, pink bed under a huge picture of 
           an adorable (and somehow slightly evil) kitten.  

           She nestles her head in the fat, down pillows.  Soon she’s 
           fast asleep.

           INT. ANDERS FRONT PORCH--MORNING

           Sara emerges from the house, just waking up.  She finds Jordy 
           on the steps, wrapped in a blanket, shivering.  He looks over 
           at her.

                                 JORDY
                        Sleep well?

                                 SARA
                        I should go--

                                 JORDY
                        You have plans later?  

                                 SARA
                        No, Jordy, it’s just, it’s, I can’t 
                        stay here another--

                                 JORDY
                        What about my application?  

           She takes a breath, caves.  

                                 SARA 
                          (gently)
                        The thing you wrote.  You--can’t 
                        send that in.

                                 JORDY
                        I know.

                                 SARA
                        So, what are you going to write 
                        about?  The essay question is, 
                        “Tell us something we won’t learn 
                        about--”

                                 JORDY
                        You’re making me cold.

           He moves over to share the blanket with her, gestures for her 
           to sit next to him.  She does.

                        Jordy.  Tell us something we won’t 
                        learn about you from the rest of 
                        your application. Come on, think.  
                        Surprise me.

           Pause.  Jordy looks out at the snow covered trees.

                                 JORDY
                        I read your book.

                                 SARA
                        What?

           She looks down.  Her manuscript is next to him, half-hidden 
           under the blanket.  He picks it up, holding it close.

                                 JORDY
                        Last night.  My mom had it on her 
                        desk and I took it and I read the 
                        whole thing, I couldn’t stop...

           She looks at him.

                                 SARA
                          (carefully)
                        What did you think?

                                 JORDY
                        I loved it.  I mean I really loved 
                        it.

           Sara takes this in.

                                 SARA
                        Why?  

           He opens to a dog-eared page.

                                 JORDY
                        She’s looking at the painting.  
                        Here. 
                          (reads)
                        We stood in front of it breathing, 
                        our hearts beating.  My heart 
                        slammed into the walls of my chest, 
                        my blood, red as paint.  I 
                        whispered, softly, to the half-
                        ghost at my side, “God, I wish we 
                        could go inside there. Don’t you 
                        wish we could go inside?”

           He looks at her.

                        That’s exactly what I said to you, 
                        in front of the Picasso.  

                                 SARA
                        I know.

           And it hits them both.  The connection is undeniable, very 
           seductive and very dangerous.

                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        I should go.

           She starts to get up.  He grabs her arm.

                                 JORDY
                        Sara, no, please...

                        Please...what?

                                 JORDY
                        Help me. Sara.  It’s me.  It’s my 
                        future.  It’s my life.  

           He leans in, about to devour her. She backs away, her last 
           resort.

                                 SARA
                        Okay.  Okay.  

           INT. METRO NORTH--DAY

           Sara stares out the window at the passing, snow-covered 
           countryside.  She pulls out a legal pad and writes:

           Personal Statement.  By Jordan Russell Anders.

           And she begins to fill the page with words:

           The hot Guatemalan sun beat down on the back of my neck...

           INT. SARA’S APARTMENT--NIGHT

           Sara spreads the pages of the hand written essay on her desk.  
           She grabs her laptop, considers it for a second, and then 
           moves it aside.  A beat.  She feeds a blank piece of paper 
           into her typewriter.

           She begins to type the essay, with great care.

           (cid:13)           INT. ANDERS LIVING ROOM--DAY

           In an ALCOVE, by the door:

           Sara hands Jordy a stack of envelopes with the essay in each.  
           The Harvard envelope is at the top of the stack, bearing its 
           insignia: Veritas.

                                 SARA 
                          (quietly)
                        Here you go-- 

           Further into the room, Pammie’s arranging cut flowers in a 
           vase by Arthur, who lays on the sofa, elevating a sprained 
           ankle and reading the Economist.

                                 PAMMIE
                          (calling over to her)
                        Tell me this nightmare is over, 
                        Sara.  Is he finally done?

                                 SARA
                          (calling back)
                        I think he’s in good shape.

           Sara turns back to Jordy.

                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        So you just put this in with your 
                        recommendations, your transcripts, 
                        your scores, everything else, okay?

           He nods, deeply appreciative.

                                 JORDY
                        Thank you.

           A pause.  Sara doesn’t want to leave, but has no more reason 
           to stay.  

                                 JORDY (CONT’D)
                          (softly)
                        No matter what happens, I won’t 
                        live here anymore, starting in the 
                        Fall...Just a few more months. 

                                 SARA
                        I know.  

           They share a last smile.  She goes.  Pammie and Arthur watch 
           her leave.

PREMIUM PREP OFFICES--DAY, A FEW WEEKS LATER

           The same bedraggled group of tutors, including Adam, sits 
           around the table, listening to Gretchen.  

                                 GRETCHEN
                        ...so now we have AP’s to look 
                        forward to of course, and then a 
                        new crop of Juniors will start SAT 
                        prep soon.  Sara, will you take the 
                        Ward’s younger child? You did such 
                        a great job on Elizabeth.  

           Sara is coloring in her nails again, not listening.  She’s 
           wearing Jordy’s jacket.  

           Adam looks over at her, making eye contact.  She smiles, then 
           goes back to her nails.

           INT. UPPER EAST SIDE MANSION--DAY

           Sara sits with Cole, a new student, in a bright, sunny room.

                                 COLE
                          (reading from the manual)
                        Although some think the terms “bug” 
                        and “insect” are BLANK, the former 
                        term actually refers to a BLANK 
                        group of insects.

           It’s the same question Sara first did with Jordy.  One of his 
           doodles is still in the margin of her manual.

           Cole looks up at her expectantly.  

                                 COLE (CONT’D)
                        Um...are you going to help me with 
                        this or what?

           But she’s somewhere else.

           INT. SARA’S APT--NIGHT

           Sara stares at her telephone.  Finally, she picks it up, 
           dials.  The voice mail picks up.

                                 PAMMIE (V.O.)

           BEEP.  Sara pauses.  Tries to sound cheerful.

                                 SARA
                        Hey guys.  It’s Sara...Jacobs.  Um, 
                        so just wanted to check in, say hi.  
                        It’s been a little while.  You 
                        probably haven’t heard from schools 
                        yet, but hope you guys are good...  
                          (pause, an afterthought)
                        Also, hey, you know, I was just 
                        curious about my manuscript. 
                        Anyway, no worries, I know these 
                        things take time, so... Yeah.  Call 
                        me whenever and we’ll catch up.

           She stays on the line.  A woman’s voice comes on.

                        press two--

           Sara presses two.  Tries again.

                                 SARA
                        Hey guys!  Sara here.  Just saying 
                        hey.  Wondering how it’s going up 
                        in Greenwich.  Hope everything’s 
                        okay.  Happy New Year.  Well, I 
                        guess that was like over a month 
                        ago, two maybe, whatever, 
                        but...Anyway, just checking in...

           As she talks, Jordy’s drawing catches her eye.  She 
           straightens it.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK--DAY

           It’s the first warm-ish day in a long time.  Here and there, 
           crocuses peek through the hard ground.  Sara and Gretchen 
           walk around the reservoir, drinking iced lattes.

           Gretchen is pregnant, just starting to show.

                        Anders?  The dumb jock in 
                        Greenwich?  He got in.

           Sara is stunned.

                                 SARA
                        To Harvard?

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Miraculous, right?  The Mom called 
                        last week.  That’s right, you 
                        worked with him.  Sorry, I 
                        should’ve called you.  You know, I 
                        have so many students right now, 
                        and with the renovation, and being 
                        pregnant my brain is like soup.

           Sara sits on a bench.  She can barely breathe.

           INT. MACY’S--AFTERNOON

           Sara walks past sheet and towel sets, laundry hampers, mugs 
           and tea kettles. 

           She examines a sweatshirt.  Considers a bean bag chair.  
           Checks the price tags.

           Trying to select the right gift.

           INT. MACY’S CAFE--EVENING

           Sara sits at a table, a small, one-cup coffee maker next to 
           her.  
                                                     (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)
                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)           She puts the coffee maker in a gift bag, and ties a sweet bow 
           around the top.  She unties the bow and re-ties it.  Making 
           it perfect.

           EXT. ANDERS LIVING ROOM--DAY

           Sara stands awkwardly in front of Lauren, who sits at a brand 
           new grand piano plunking out a joyless Fur Elise.   

                                 LAUREN
                          (not looking up)
                        Oh, he’s not here.  I think he has 
                        lacrosse camp for, like, two more 
                        weeks before he finally gets out of 
                        here and goes to Harvard.

                                 SARA
                        Is your mom around?

                                 LAUREN
                        Nope, she’s--

           Lauren hits a wrong note.  Bangs on the keys furiously.  

                                 LAUREN (CONT’D)
                        Goddammit!

           Sara stares at her a beat, turns, and goes.

           EXT. LACROSSE FIELD--DAY

           Bodies of boys slam into each other with ferocious abandon, 
           spraying sweat and blood. 

           Sara approaches slowly, holding the wrapped coffee maker, 
           until she’s standing near the sidelines, slightly hidden 
           behind a tree.

           Her eyes find Jordy among the players.  She watches him make 
           a glorious, game-winning play.  

           He rips off his helmet.  Sara’s about to go to him, when he’s 
           mobbed by his friends, many of whom she recognizes from her 
           night out with him.

           Not wanting to interrupt, she just watches him go.

           INT. UPS STORE--EVENING

           Sara puts the coffee maker in a mailing box.  She picks out a 
           card and struggles to think of what write in it.
           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                           (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)           She starts to write:  Congratulations on Harvard!  I am so 
           happy to--

           She changes her mind, crosses out what she was writing, 
           crumples the card and picks a new one.  

           She stares at the new, blank card.  No idea what to say.

           Finally giving up, she crumples the new card and takes the 
           coffee maker back out of its mailer, starting to go.

           An angry, heavily pierced and tattooed CLERK calls after her:

                                 CLERK
                        Hey.  You’re gonna have to pay for 
                        that stuff.

           INT. SARA’S APARTMENT--NIGHT

           Sara lays back on her bed, staring at the ceiling.  The 
           coffee maker, still wrapped, is on her desk.  She listens to 
           music, blasting the same great SONG that she and Jordy heard 
           in the arcade.

           INT. AMTRAK TRAIN--DAY

           Sara is a bit dressed up, wearing make-up.  She stares out 
           the window of the train at the passing landscape, catching a 
           glimpse of her reflection.

           EXT. HARVARD SQUARE--DAY

           Sara emerges from the T station into the chaos of college 
           life.  She walks through the throngs of STUDENTS, making her 
           way towards Harvard Yard.

           A huge sign over the front gate reads:

           WELCOME HARVARD CLASS OF 2011!

           EXT. HOLWORTHY DORM--DAY

           Sara stands outside of the freshman dorm.  Through an open 
           window, she can just make out Jordy.

           She checks in her backpack for the wrapped coffee maker, 
           nestled among her composition notebooks, and takes a deep 
           breath.
                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                     (cid:13)           INT. HOLWORTHY DORM--DAY

           Sara steels herself and knocks on a door that has Jordy’s 
           name on it, along with a mini dry-erase board and the name of 
           his roommate:  ERIC CHEN.

           From inside, Jordy’s voice.

                                 JORDY (O.S.)
                        It’s open!

           Sara opens the door to see Jordy and Eric drinking beer and 
           shooting a Nerf basketball into a hoop mounted on the wall.

           Jordy freezes at the sight of her.

                                 JORDY
                        Sara.  

           Eric tosses the ball to Jordy, who still doesn’t move, 
           letting it drop to the floor.

                                 ERIC
                        Hey, what the--

                                 JORDY
                          (softly, to Sara)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 SARA
                        I know this is unexpected.  I just 
                        thought maybe we could...

           Eric looks to Jordy.  Then to Sara.  He takes his cue.

                                 ERIC
                        I’ll take off, man.  No problem.  
                        Just, hey...remember our deal?  

           Eric holds out his hand.  

                                 JORDY
                        Our deal?

                                 ERIC
                        You know, you copy my Econ notes, I 
                        get the keys to your Beemer.  

           Jordy nods, casts an embarrassed glance to Sara, and starts 
           rooting through a drawer for his car keys.
                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)

                          (to Sara, re Jordy)
                        This guy’s the best. 

           Jordy finds his keys and tosses them to Eric, then looks over 
           to Sara nervously.

                                 JORDY
                        You know, the thing is, Sara, I 
                        kind of have class--

           Eric snorts with laughter.  Jordy shoots him a warning look.

           Eric shrugs, “whatever,” grabs his jacket from a hook, and 
           goes, the door slamming behind him.

           Alone together, Jordy and Sara stare at each other, neither 
           one knowing exactly what to say.  She notices his wrist:  The 
           “lucky string.”

           Jordy shifts, self consciously.

                                 JORDY
                        It’s just that...it’s still 
                        shopping period, you know, when we 
                        pick classes--

                                 SARA
                        Yeah, I remember.

                                 JORDY
                        So I should probably go check this 
                        one out.

                                 SARA
                        What are you thinking of taking?

                                 JORDY
                        Just, like, Econ 101, Statistics, 
                        Macroeconomic Theory, and, um, 
                        something about markets.

                                 SARA
                        Does any of that interest you? 

           He looks at her, no response.

                        Jordy.  
                          (then, quietly, 
                           truthfully)
                        What are you doing?

Finally, he turns away, grabbing 
           his jacket and backpack, heading for the door...

                                 JORDY
                        It’s not that easy.

           He leaves, the door swinging shut behind him.  Alone, Sara 
           looks around the dorm room.

           On Jordy’s desk, amid empty beer bottles and packets of Ramen 
           noodles, the Harvard Course Catalogue is still in its shrink 
           wrap.   

           She opens her bag, pulls out the wrapped coffee maker, 
           hesitates for a moment, wondering what to do with it.  
           Finally, she puts it on the bed.

           Next to it, on the bed, she notices a SKETCHBOOK.  She flips 
           it open.  All of the pages are blank.

           She closes the sketchbook, and goes.

           EXT. HARVARD YARD--AFTERNOON

           Sara walks past STUDENTS, scurrying to and from class.  

           She gazes up the imposing stone staircase of Widener Library, 
           as an elderly PROFESSOR laden with a stack of books carefully 
           makes his way down. 

           Walking on, past Lamont Library, she catches her warped 
           reflection in the shiny bronze, abstract Henry Moore 
           sculpture of a reclining woman.

           She walks through Emerson Hall, glancing in at a couple of 
           classrooms where class is in session.

           On her way out, she pauses in front of the large, seated 
           statue of Emerson, stately and serene. 

           She walks on.

           EXT. ADMISSIONS OFFICE--DUSK

           Sara stands in front of the old, red brick building.  A 
           large, brass plaque by the front gate carries the Harvard 
           seal, with its motto in large, stern capitals: 

           VERITAS

           Sara stares at it.

The Dean of 
           Admissions, DEAN STEWART, a kind older man, answers.

                                 DEAN STEWART
                          (smiles, glad to see her)
                        Sara Jacobs?

           INT. ADMISSIONS OFFICE--DAY

           Sara sits with the Dean, her heart racing.

                                 DEAN STEWART
                        So, you’re sure.  He didn’t write 
                        any of it?

                                 SARA
                          (hard to say)
                        I don’t even think he read it.  
                          (then)
                        Talk to him.  

           He takes this in.  Bad news.  For him and for her.

                                 ADMISSIONS OFFICER
                        Why are you telling me this now?

                                 SARA
                        Because.  It’s the truth.

           EXT. HARVARD YARD--DUSK

           Sara walks, in a daze, back through the darkening campus.  
           Lights have started to go on in dorm rooms, where students 
           can be seen laughing, studying, talking on the phone, going 
           about their lives.  

           Sara glances up at them a moment.  

           INT. PREMIUM PREP OFFICES--DAY

           Sara stands in front of Gretchen, red-faced and furious.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        The truth?  Are you kidding me?  
                        Sara, how could you?

                                 SARA
                        I--

                        friend.  Where’s the truth in that?

           EXT. PREMIUM PREP OFFICES--MOMENTS LATER

           Leaving, Sara bumps into Adam, who’s just arriving, his arms 
           full of new SAT manuals. 

                                 ADAM
                        Sara.  Wait up--
                          (off her)
                        You okay?

                                 SARA
                        Actually, I just got fired.

                                 ADAM
                        Fired?  From this job? 
                          (a thought)
                        Hold on, don’t go anywhere.

           He runs off.  She stands, a bit confused.  Finally, he 
           reappears, a big smile on his face.

                                 SARA
                        What?

                                 ADAM
                        I just quit.

                        What?  Why?

                                 ADAM
                        Well, if you’re gone, that job 
                        loses pretty much all of its charm.  
                          (then)
                        So...now that we’re both free, a 
                        little celebration is in order, 
                        don’t you think?

           Adam and Sara sit at a corner table, a candle flickering 
           between them, as Sara drinks a large, lovely glass of red.

                        wasteland?

                                 ADAM
                          (flattered)
                        You remembered.  

           He looks at her.  

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Well, um, there’s going to be a 
                        little mini production thing 
                        downtown at the Flea in a few weeks-

                                 SARA
                        Hey, congratulations--

                                 ADAM
                        Thanks, so, if you wanted to...come 
                        check it out-- 
                          (then, nervous)
                        Just, don’t judge because it’s 
                        really, totally new--

           Sara smiles, nods a little, “I get it.”

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        But, I play in the band, on-stage, 
                        so if you did come, I’d definitely 
                        be there in person embarrassing 
                        myself. 

           A nice moment. 

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        What about you?  What are you going 
                        to do?

           Sara shrugs.  He leans in a bit closer to her.

                        Can I make a suggestion?  If it’s 
                        not too presumptuous of me...

           She braces herself for him to ask her out.

                                 SARA
                        Sure.  Go ahead.

           A beat.  

                                 ADAM
                        Send out your novel.  

           She looks at him, taking that in.

           INT. SARA’S APT--NIGHT

           Sara gathers up all her SAT materials, collecting them in a 
           pile. She puts them in a corner.

           She looks up on the bulletin board above her desk.  Her eye 
           is caught by Jordy’s drawing.

           She stares at it a moment.  She dials Jordy’s cell.  The call 
           goes right to voice mail.

                                 JORDY(V.O.)
                        Hey, it’s Jordan. Leave a message.

           BEEP.

                                 SARA
                        Jordy.  It’s Sara.  I just wanted 
                        to say, I hope that you understand.  
                        If not now, then someday. And...
                          (a breath, thinking)
                        Goodbye.

           She hangs up, resolved.  Takes Jordy’s drawing off her 
           bulletin board, puts it away.

           MONTAGE

           We see SARA:

           --Browsing Barnes and Noble in the “How to Sell Your Novel,” 
           section.

           --Going through How-To books, book reviews, magazines, making

           --Typing up query letters on her laptop, filling in one 
           address after the next.

           --Addressing envelopes to publishers, putting stamps on them, 
           taking them to the mailbox.

           --Checking her mailbox for responses.  

           --Taking her PREMIUM PREP manuals, boxing them up, dropping 
           them off at GOODWILL.  She smiles at a YOUNG INNER CITY GIRL 
           who seems interested in them.

           INT. JACOBS HOUSE--EVENING

           Sara sings the last line of “Happy Birthday” to her father, 
           his face lit by the glow of the candles in his misshapen, 
           very homemade cake.  He looks at the cake, thinking.

                                 JOSEPH
                          (quoting)
                        Do not go gentle into that good 
                        night/Old age should burn and rave 
                        at close of day--

                                 SARA
                          (amused)
                        Dad, you’re only sixty three--

           He shoots her a smile.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Do not go gentle into that good 
                        night...

           She obliges him, smiling back.

                                 SARA
                        Rage, rage, against the dying of 
                        the light.

           He blows out his candles.  Licks some icing off his finger.

                                 JOSEPH 
                        Mmm.  Delicious.

           He takes another lick, as she grabs a wrapped box, hands it 
           to him.  

                                 SARA
                        This is for you.

                        Sara, this had better not be 
                        something expensive.

                                 SARA
                        Just open it.

           He unwraps the gift to reveal a Xerox copy of Sara’s 
           manuscript, Small World.  His eyes light up.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Sweetheart...

           He stares at the title page, at his daughter’s name.  
           Finally, he looks up, very moved.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.  

           He looks back to the manuscript for a moment.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        I’ll read this right away to give 
                        you my thoughts.

           She nods, appreciating him.

                                 SARA
                        That would be great.

           He opens the manuscript to the first page.  He puts on his 
           glasses, peers down at it, reads for a beat.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Hmmm.  Good opening.  

                                 SARA
                        Dad, just don’t--not now--

                                 JOSEPH
                        What, I like it--

                                 SARA
                          (embarrassed)
                        Don’t read it in front of me--

                                 JOSEPH
                        Sorry, sorry.  

           Joseph looks over at her, cradling her novel in his lap.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        I’m so proud of you.

STREETS OF NEW YORK--DAY, WEEKS LATER

           Sara, looking rested and refreshed, comes home with a bag of 
           groceries.  Her cell rings.  The number:  UNKNOWN.

           Sara hesitates.  Answers.

                                 SARA
                        Hello?

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        Sara?  Amy Mickelson.  I’m an 
                        editor at FSG.  I received your 
                        query letter regarding Small World, 
                        your novel...

           Sara drops her groceries in shock.  Oranges roll into the 
           gutter.  She barely notices, smiles wide, enjoying this 
           moment.

           INT. FSG OFFICES--DAY

           Sara, nicely dressed, waits in the reception area.  Her 
           manuscript is on her lap.

           A beautifully put-together woman, AMY, pokes her head out 
           from behind a door.

           INT. AMY’S OFFICE--MOMENTS LATER

           It’s very sleek and modern.  Amy is obviously type AAA, very 
           successful, very kind.

                                 AMY
                        I was interested at first because I 
                        think I was in your class at 
                        Harvard.

                                 SARA
                        You’re kidding.  

                                 AMY
                        So our paths must have just gone...

           She makes a gesture with her hands of two lines almost 
           crossing, then not.

                                 SARA
                        And now they’re...
                                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)           Sara crosses her hands.  Amy laughs.  This is going well.

                                 AMY
                        And, then, you know, the strangest 
                        thing happened because I mentioned 
                        you to a few friends in the 
                        publishing world...

           Sara listens intently, very excited.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        And I described your story, which 
                        you outlined in your letter, and a 
                        few of them said it sounded very 
                        similar to a book that Knopf just 
                        bought.  Also called Small World.  
                        By Pamela Anders.

           Beat.  It takes a moment for this to sink in.  

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        She’s a forty-something new writer, 
                        but everyone’s calling her a hot 
                        young voice.  So then I called her 
                        editor, Marianne Lewis, who’s also 
                        a mentor of mine, and Marianne 
                        asked her about it, and apparently 
                        you used to work for them? 

           Amy looks at Sara, full of pity.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Look, I don’t want you to get in 
                        any kind of trouble.  You’re 
                        obviously...and this is such a 
                        tough business...I was hoping I 
                        could just...head this off before 
                        you get caught.

           Sara’s too stunned to speak.

           EXT. FSG OFFICES--DAY

           Sara walks outside, in a state of shock.  Harried NEW YORKERS 
           bump into her, as they rush past.

           A beat.  Her breath quickens.  She starts to move, making her 
           way more and more quickly down the crowded street...
                                                                 (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)           INT. SUBWAY--DAY

           Sara stands on the express train, hanging onto a pole.  She 
           watches the stations pass.  Finally, she arrives at Grand 
           Central...

           INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION--DAY

           Sara rushes through the station, under the magnificent, blue 
           dome, the canopy of illuminated stars.  She glances up at the 
           constellations that seem to swirl above her...  

           INT. METRO NORTH TRAIN--DAY

           Sara sits by the window, willing the train to go faster.  
           Trees, lakes, houses blur outside the window...

           EXT. METRO NORTH TRAIN STATION--DAY

           She bolts out of the train, past the other arriving 
           passengers, the idling cars picking up friends and family.

           She runs to the taxi stand, flags down a cab.

                                 SARA
                          (getting in, to the 
                           cabbie)
                        16 Deer Park Road...

           INT. TAXI CAB, GREENWICH--CONTINUOUS

           The cab speeds through the quiet streets.  Sara’s, in the 
           back seat, windows open, mind racing.

           EXT. ANDERS MANSION--CONTINUOUS

           The cab pulls up and Sara gets out.  She takes a breath, as 
           she stares up at the enormous entrance.  

           She goes up to the door, pushes hard on the doorbell.  She 
           bangs on the huge, gold door knocker.  Over and over and 
           over.  The dogs go crazy inside.

           Finally, from the other side of the door, Pammie’s voice:

                          (to the dogs)
                        Peter!  Peter, stop that!  Theo, 
                        down!  Shush!  For God’s sake--

           The door opens.  Pammie goes pale.

                                 PAMMIE
                        Sara.

                                 SARA
                        Tell me it’s not true.

                                 PAMMIE
                        What are you--

                                 SARA
                        My book. My book.

                                 PAMMIE
                        Your book?  Oh.  Well.  Not 
                        anymore, is it.

           Sara’s hit with the full horror of the truth.

                                 SARA
                        Oh my god.  How could you--

                                 PAMMIE
                        Sara, you need to calm down--

           Sara goes right for the jugular, hurt and furious.  

                                 SARA
                        Just because you have nothing, 
                        doesn’t make it right to-- 

                                 PAMMIE
                        When are you going to realize, 
                        Sara, it’s not about right and 
                        wrong.  Life’s not a test.  It’s a 
                        war.  

           Sara’s too stunned to respond.

                                 PAMMIE (CONT’D)
                        Besides.  I’ve always wanted to be 
                        a writer.

                        You’re insane to think you’ll get 
                        away with this.  I wrote that book, 
                        all I have to do is...

                                 PAMMIE
                        What?  What proof do you have, 
                        really? 

           For Sara, a light bulb.

                                 SARA
                        Jordy.

                                 PAMMIE
                        What could Jordy do?  He’s eighteen 
                        years old and instead of starting 
                        college with his friends he’s 
                        upstairs in his room playing video 
                        games--

                                 SARA
                        He’s here?

           A charged beat.  Sara breaks into the house, past Pammie, who 
           lets her go.

           INT. ANDERS HOUSE--CONTINUOUS

           She runs down the hallway, up the stairs, to Jordy’s bedroom, 
           throws open the door...

           INT. JORDY’S BEDROOM--CONTINUOUS

           Jordy’s laying in bed, doodling on the back of an old Sports 
           Illustrated. Seeing Sara, he bolts upright.  He sits very 
           still, looking at her, stunned.

           She takes him in.  His face is different, older, wearier, 
           pale and unshaven.  No longer boyish, he finally looks like a 
           man.

                                 SARA
                        Jordy...

           He stares at her, not saying a word, impossible to read.  A 
           long silence, thick with the weight of everything that’s 
           happened between them.

           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        I had to do it.  That life you were 
                        leading, cheating on everything, 
                        lying, doing exactly what your 
                        parents wanted you to, that’s not 
                        you.  You’re an artist, Jordy.  You 
                        could never be happy living a lie.  
                        You deserve to live your own life, 
                        to create beautiful, amazing 
                        things, to live in a world that’s 
                        honest and unique and completely, 
                        utterly yours.  I want that for 
                        you.

           He listens, does not move.

                                 SARA (CONT’D)
                        You’re the only person in the world 
                        who knows about my book.  Who knows 
                        that I gave it to your mom, who 
                        read it before anyone else, who 
                        knows everything that happened.  
                        And so I‘m asking you, please, I 
                        need you to vouch for me, to tell 
                        the truth.  It’s a chance for you 
                        to do the right thing.  Please.  
                        Help me.

           A long beat.  He slowly stands. 

           He moves to her.

           Very close now, he puts his hands on her shoulders.  The 
           touch is electric.  He looks deeply into her eyes...

           And finally, gently, he pulls her into him, enveloping her in 
           his arms.  

           At long last:

           They kiss.

           Passionately, hungrily, devouring each other.  Jordy’s hands 
           roam her body, as all the long months of pent-up tension 
           finally release.

                                 JORDY
                          (whispering)
                        Sara...

           She breaks away for a moment, breathless, losing herself in 
           his eyes.  A long beat.  He takes her in.

                        Don’t be so fucking naive. 

           He backs away from her, leaving her standing alone.

                                 SARA
                        But--

                                 JORDY
                        Grow up.

           His face is hard, his eyes pure ice.  She can’t speak, the 
           wind completely knocked out of her.  She looks at him.  He 
           doesn’t give a millimeter.

           Finally, she turns, slowly walks towards the door...

           And leaves, closing the door behind her.

           INT. ANDERS HOUSE--DAY

           Sara, eyes focused straight ahead, walks down the hall, and 
           descends the long staircase.  At the bottom of the stairs 
           stands Pammie, silently victorious.

           Sara looks at Pammie for a beat.

           And walks right by.  

           Past the:

           LIVING ROOM, where Ana is polishing an antique wood table.  
           Sara and Ana’s eyes meet for a moment, and Ana gives Sara a 
           small, appreciative smile. 

           With Pammie behind her, Sara makes her way to the front hall.  
           The dogs silently watch her go.  

           She heaves open the heavy, front door, and emerges into the 
           bright day.

           Pammie closes the door behind her.

           EXT. ANDERS DRIVEWAY--DAY

           Sara stands in the bright light, on the doorstep.  She walks 
           slowly down the driveway through the iron front gates.

           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)           EXT. GREENWICH--DAY

           She walks on, down the long shady roads, past the mansions, 
           the golf courses, the hedges, the ponds...

           Slowly, the late afternoon turns to dusk...

           And the world of Greenwich begins to recede into long, deep 
           shadows.

           EXT. GREENWICH TRAIN STATION--EVENING

           Sara sits on a bench, the same bench where she once sat with 
           Jordy.  A few lonely COMMUTERS join her on the platform, 
           waiting.  The day has dissolved into darkness.

           The train ROARS into the station and the commuters board it.  
           Sara does not move.  A CONDUCTOR leans out of the train.

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        Ma’am?  Train’s leaving.

           She nods to him, gets up, slowly, deliberately.  She looks 
           around Greenwich one last time, and gets on the train.

           INT. METRO NORTH TRAIN--NIGHT

           Sara gazes at her reflection in the glass as the train 
           hurtles forward through space, leaving behind all she’s lost.  

           As the train moves through small dark towns at night, closer 
           and closer to the city, she reaches into her backpack.  

           She rifles through her stack of composition notebooks, all of 
           them filled with her old writings, torn out pages, added 
           pages, and Post-Its.  Wedged in between them is the napkin 
           with Adam’s phone number on it.

           She searches through a few more filled notebooks, finally 
           finding one that is new, completely blank.

           She takes it out of her backpack, along with a pen. 

           Inspired, she opens to the first, pristine, white page.
