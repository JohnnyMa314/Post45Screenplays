           OVER BLACK we hear the sound a few Humvee engines humming 
           along. Some gravel kicks up, but other than that, the engine 
           sounds so smooth it purrs. Moments pass before... 

           A BLOOD CURDLING EXPLOSION of an IED ripping through metal 
           and glass. 

           It’s all melee and heavy breathing, panicked and 
           indiscernible screams, both in Arabic and English. 

           Automatic guns begin FIRING, concrete and bricks CRACK under 
           heavy shelling.

                                 SSGT. BEEK (V.O.)
                        There’s a girl over there!

                                 MAJOR VANN (V.O.)
                        Where’s your squad, Sergeant? 

                                 SSGT. BEEK (V.O.)
                        There’s a girl. She’s stuck over 
                        there!

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN (V.O.)
                        So what?!

           Fade up:

           EXT. TIKRIT ROADWAY - DAY

           A thousand newspaper pages dance in the air amidst enemy 
           fire, two obliterated Humvees, and a sea of debris scattered 
           all around.

           Across the road an IRAQI GIRL, no older than 15, has taken 
           refuge in front of a concrete doorway. 

           Walls have collapsed all around her and a Humvee FIRE rages 
           dangerously close by. Frozen. She looks absolutely terrified.

                                 SSGT. BEEK
                        She’s gonna get killed!

           SERGEANT BEEK, mildly overweight, crew cut, and military 
           mustache is bogged down in a narrow city street.
           Alongside Beek, crouching between a FLAMING HUMVEE and the 
           concrete wall of a blown-out newspaper factory is 
           SHERIFF/MAJOR VANN, 45, a powerful presence who seems like he 
           was born in military uniform. On Beek’s left side is the 
           rugged and all-American looking CAPTAIN KENNETH BOWMAN, 30. 

                                 VANN
                        Where’s your fucking squad, 
                        Sergeant?!

                                 SSGT. BEEK
                        We just got ambushed. I don’t know 
                        where the fuck anybody is! 

           Sergeant Beek is fixated on the young girl.

                                 SSGT. BEEK (CONT'D)
                        I can’t just...

           Beek suddenly breaks out into the line of fire now towards 
           the distressed teen. Bowman tries to grab him, but misses. 

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN
                        Idiot. Beek!

           Captain Bowman and Major Vann fire aimlessly into the street 
           and helplessly watch Beek run for about twenty yards 
           before...

           He trips over THE BOOT of a fallen comrade who’s body is half 
           buried under a pile of rubble.

           Beek’s POV: Footballs of fire fly towards him, all 
           miraculously missing him. 

                                 SSGT. BEEK
                        SHIT.

           INT. / EXT. TIKRIT ROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Across the road, in the shelter of a second storey window, 
           SPECIAL FORCES/SERGEANT ZAYAS, a square jawed rock of 
           soldier, late twenties, methodically sets up his sniper rifle 
           and takes aim.

           THROUGH HIS SCOPE: He has the drop on all six of the Iraqi 
           opposition shooters-- hiding behind a pair of white panel 
           vans about a hundred feet down the street. 

           Sfc. Zayas aims ever so carefully.

           CLICK. BOOM.
           One drops.

           CLICK. BOOM.

           And another.

           EXT. TIKRIT ROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Beek can only watch as a million bullets whiz inches past his 
           face, he covers his head and fires wildly into the smoke, 
           praying to God a shell doesn’t find him-- A hand reaches out 
           and yanks him by the ankle, behind a pile of rubble and out 
           of harms way. 

           Beek looks up: The hand belongs to one pissed off Captain 
           Bowman. 

           Beek is gasping, breathing so hard that he can’t spit the 
           words out, but his eyes scream ‘thank you.’

           INT. / EXT. TIKRIT ROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Sfc. Zayas continues his spectacular sniper assault on the 
           opposition, systematically eliminating every one of them. 

           CLICK. BOOM.

           CLICK. BOOM.

           CLICK. BOOM.

           He’s on a roll.

           And then, just like that... there’s no one left. 

           The atmosphere RINGS in aftershock. No one moves a muscle.

           Zayas raises his rifle... Looks like he’s got ‘em licked. 

                                 SGT. ZAYAS
                        Told you fuckers... Lord’s on my 
                        side.

           Everybody stays down. 

           EXT. ROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Beek shuffles to his feet, his nerves shot, his face 
           bloodied. 
           He steps forward, looking for the young girl in the smoke-- 
           She’s vanished. 

           He heads towards the ROW OF DOORS along a STOREFRONT of a 
           bombed out building.

                                 MAJOR BOWMAN
                        Watch yourself Beek! 

           Vann casually gets up and saunters across the bombed out 
           roadway.

                                 MAJOR VANN (O.S.)
                        WHO’S DOWN? WHO’S HURT?

           Beek climbs through the rubble by the storefront. He walks 
           alongside the row of doors-- One suddenly swings open to 
           reveal-- 

           The Iraqi girl cradling an AK-47 like a baby--

           By the time Beek sees her she’s already FIRING erratically. 

           Beek dances a dance of fear, trying to dodge the bullets-- 
           one smashes into his chest armor, knocking him into a spin, 
           but he somehow manages to stay on his feet... She stops.

           INT. / EXT. TIKRIT ROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Zayas spots the girl, aims his rifle and PULLS THE TRIGGER. 

           CLICK. A jam. 

           EXT. TIKRIT ROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Shivering with fear, the girl steps out from the rubble cave. 
           The gun’s as big as she is.

           Beek keeps his gun down.

           She screams at him in Arabic to stay away, petrified of him.

                                 SSGT. BEEK 
                             (gesturing frantically for 
                              her to drop the gun)
                        NO! NO! I am not going to hurt you! 
                        Hold on! Wait!

           But she won’t wait. She continues towards Beek. She points 
           the gun at him, her finger on the trigger. She aims. 
           Beek doesn’t blink-- Frozen. The girl closes her eyes 
           tightly, and squeezes the trigger.

           A SHOT rips through her heart... 

           Before anybody can react Vann routinely walks up to within a 
           few feet of the girl, aims his 9mm, and fires twice more. 

           She drops RIGHT IN FRONT OF Beek’s eyes. 

                                 MAJOR VANN
                             (like nothing happened)
                        Who’s down? Who’s hurt?

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN 
                             (approaching Beek)
                        Move, Sergeant...

           Beek doesn’t move.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN (CONT'D)
                        Beek! Let’s go! 

           But Beek cannot turn away. Vann looks back. The girl’s face 
           is pristine, her body fragile but strong... In this moment 
           she very much resembles the Virgin Mary cradling a weapon. As 
           he looks down at her we FADE TO BLACK.

           SUPER: 3 days later

           OVER BLACK the sound of lockers opening and slamming closed. 
           A TV blares INTENSE ABC NEWS HOUR MUSIC before:

           SUPER: Louisiana: September, 2005

                                                            FADE UP TO:

           EXT. SOUTH LOUISIANA - HURRICANE EVACUEE TRAILER PARK - DUSK

           Rows upon rows and miles upon miles of identical white 
           trailers stretch into the dusty sun drenched horizon. Out of 
           the cracked dirt roadways sprout weeds and blue grass beside 
           tire tracks and sporadic puddles of black mud-- Occasionally 
           a car passes through.

           A labyrinth of a townscape, flat and never ending. Around 
           every corner is the same, all of it pale and tin. 

           Only a random few trailers have power. Huddles of jaded 
           locals comfort themselves around open camp fires. Exhausted 
           faces and empty smiles glow in the shadows.

           EXT. HURRICANE EVACUEE TRAILER PARK - WRESTLING RING - DUSK

           Far and deep into this make-shift dodge, nestled into one of 
           its very few clearings, stands a crudely erected octagon-
           shaped wrestling ring. 

           The ring is surrounded by a small but capacity crowd of a 
           hundred-or-so cheering onlookers. 
           Inside the ring are two acrobatic silhouettes tangled in a 
           cat like flurry of fury. This is backyard wrestling at its 
           finest.

           Seated on the hood of a baby blue Chevette parked just beyond 
           the edge of the crowd is the mildly gruff but handsome STONE, 
           17, hiding himself in a slouch and lazing beside his pretty 
           gal pal, CHRISTIE, 15. They are still amidst the chaos. 

                                 STONE
                        Can you tell me what’s wrong 
                        please?

           Stone’s wiry little brother MATTY, 16, is one of the 
           wrestlers, much smaller than his opponent in physique, but 
           very apparently more dominant in skill, as he twists and 
           turns the MASKED MAN’S arm behind his back into an upside 
           down V.

                                 CHRISTIE 
                        I don't think I want to see you 
                        anymore.

                                 STONE
                        Why?

           Christie massages the sunflower tattoo on her left shoulder.

                                 CHRISTIE
                        Because....

                                 STONE
                        Because? What am I supposed to do 
                        with because?

                                 CHRISTIE
                        I dunno... Move on, or something.

           The monstrous masked man takes one deep breath before he back 
           swings with both of his arms, hurtling Matty from his body 
           and bulldozes him into the canvas. 

           Completely paralyzed beneath the fat man’s weight, Matty is 
           pinned. The referee counts.

                                 REFEREE
                        1-2-3!!!

           And it’s over.
           INT. PAUL'S CHEVETTE - EVENING

           Stone is buried in the back seat amidst a flood of baby toys. 

           On the other side, Matty is seated behind PAUL, 20, the 
           oldest and merriest of the three brothers-- A pair of 
           crutches hang out of the passenger window. 

                                 MATTY
                        Bull-shit match... How am I 
                        supposed to see the guy without any 
                        fucking lights on?

           LESLIE, 20, Paul’s girlfriend and mother of his baby 
           daughter, is behind the wheel-- Accentuated by a punk rock 
           red pixie cut, Leslie’s big brown eyes meet Stone’s gaze in 
           the rearview mirror.

                                 LESLIE
                        How ya doing back there, Stone?

                                 STONE
                        OK...

                                 MATTY
                             (to Stone)
                        Dude, did she actually say the 
                        words, “I'm fucking another guy?”

                                 STONE
                        No... but she is. I know it.

                                 MATTY 
                        Man, oh, man... We are gonna kill 
                        the guy. 

           Matty pulls his LARGE HUNTING KNIFE from his pocket and flips 
           it open.

                                 STONE
                        Can you not be a weirdo, Matty? 
                        God. Put that away. You’re such a 
                        fucking weirdo.

           Matty smiles and puts the knife back into his right pants 
           pocket. Paul looks back at Matty.

                                 PAUL
                        Got enough leg room back there, 
                        buddy?
                                 MATTY
                        What? Yeah, I got enough room.

           Paul launches his seat as far back as it can go. He stretches 
           out his broken and cast-bound right leg.

                                 MATTY
                             (struggling for leg room)
                        Ow! Fuck you, Paul.

                                 LESLIE 
                        Has Christie been acting weird at 
                        all lately, Stone? A girl's 
                        behavior can help reveal a lot 
                        about what she's thinking.

                                 STONE
                        She's just been sick some times. 
                        She just found out that she's 
                        anemic or something. I don't know.

                                 LESLIE 
                        Oh really? My sister was anemic. 

                                 MATTY
                        My ex-girlfriend was anemic. She 
                        was a vegetarian too. 
                             (a beat)
                        Is Christie a vegetarian? 'Cause if 
                        she is, I'll bet you that's her 
                        problem. Vegetarians are usually 
                        crazy.

                                 STONE
                        Ironically enough Christie is a 
                        vegetarian now, but-

                                 LESLIE
                        You can't generalize like that. I'm 
                        a vegetarian, and I'm not crazy. 
                        What do ya think of that?

                                 MATTY
                        I think it's just a matter of time 
                        before you're crazy too, Leslie.

           The boys crack up.

                                 LESLIE
                        Oh, whatever! Don't you laugh Paul!

           Leslie punches Paul playfully but harshly in the shoulder.
                                 LESLIE (CONT'D)
                             (to Paul)
                        Don't you laugh! I'll break your 
                        other leg in front of your little 
                        brothers! 

                                 PAUL
                        See Stone? She's already crazy! 

           EXT. ORANGE DRAGON ARCADE - DUSK

           Paul, Leslie, Stone and Matty pull into an arcade/bar on the 
           right lit up with a couple of neon signs. The structure is a 
           massive barn... with an attitude. Neon signs flash ORANGE 
           DRAGON -- GAMES -- BEER 

           A small rectangle of land is used as a parking lot with lots 
           of pickup trucks and beaters.

           INT. CHEVETTE - DUSK

           The car eases into a parking spot. The orangy incandescence 
           of a neon sign fills the car.

                                 PAUL
                        Well... We're here now. 

                                 STONE
                             (as he climbs out of the 
                              car)
                        Jesus. Looks crowded. 

                                 PAUL
                        Mm-hm. No more generators.

                                 LESLIE
                        They got electricity here?

           INT. 129TH PARISH JAIL - DUSK

           Deputy Beek holds up a smoke-blackened glass CRYSTAL METH 
           PIPE in front the bars of a holding cell.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        You get this at church?

           Inside the cell is Beek’s wife, LISA, 25, dressed in sweats,  
           sitting on the edge of a metal slab/holding cell bed-- She 
           looks about ten years older than she should.
           The sight of the pipe is too much for her to bare. 

                                 LISA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        What were you thinking?

                                 LISA
                             (through heavy tears)
                        I... just... baby... Don’t... 
                        Leave...

           She is crying so hard we can barely make out her words 
           through her sobs.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        I can’t understand you, hon. You 
                        have to calm down for me.

                                 LISA 
                        Don’t leave me... Don’t leave me...

           Lisa’s gaunt and pale face has weathered under drug 
           addiction. Beek reaches a few fingers from his right hand 
           through the bars and holds onto her hand. 

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        You are never going to be alone 
                        again. OK? I’m home, babe. 

           Sheriff Vann hurries in. 

                                 VANN
                             (re: keys)
                        Found ‘em. Of course nothing’s 
                        where I left it... 

           He opens the holding cell. 

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Thank-you, Sheriff... 

           Lisa bolts into Beek’s arms and won’t let go.

           INT. VANN’S HUMVEE - DUSK

           Vann drives the beat up old Humvee through the trailer city. 
           Deputy Beek sits tensely in the passenger seat.

                                 VANN
                        She’s going to be OK.
           Deputy Beek doesn’t answer.

                                 VANN
                        Cal.
                             (waits until Beek looks at 
                              him)
                        She’s going to be OK. 

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        I spend a year in Iraq and come 
                        home to twenty thousand refugees in 
                        my Parish, and my wife in a holding 
                        cell... How does this happen? She 
                        never did anything wrong in her 
                        life.

                                 VANN
                        Well then she was about due. 
                             (Beek half grins)
                        It’s over now. There’s counselling 
                        on the base... You should take the 
                        night off. Go be with her.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        No... I can’t.

           Vann notices how run down and pale the Deputy appears-- The 
           back of his left wrist is covered in BLADE BURN MARKS.

                                 VANN
                        You sleeping any better?

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Worse.

           Vann’s cell phone rings. He answers.

                                 VANN
                             (into phone)
                        Vann here... Hi honey. Nah, I won’t 
                        be home ‘til pretty late. I’m at 
                        the station... I know, but our 
                        Parish has twenty thousand 
                        unexpected guests... OK, I will... 
                        Bye. I love-

           Vann looks at his cell, trying to figure out if the phone 
           just died, or if he was hung up on.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        The wife?
                                 VANN
                        Yeah.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        How’s she doing?

                                 VANN
                        Great... Thanks. Thank you for 
                        asking.

           THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD hundreds of evacuees are visible 
           lining up for food under a shoddy tent. 

           A gang of young teens cockily stride by, darting mean 
           spirited eyes towards the two officers. Beek’s fingers 
           anxiously CLENCH THE DOOR until the teens pass.

           INT. THE ORANGE DRAGON - NIGHT

           Sweat glistens on the young patrons of the crowded arcade. 
           The atmosphere is drenched in a tungsten glow. The nicotine 
           stained walls are lined with a garden variety of occupied 
           video games. 

           At the back of the arcade, Paul and Stone play pool. Paul 
           sinks two high balls in a single shot. Matty and Leslie lean 
           against a nearby bar table and observe.

           A WAITRESS comes over and clears some empty beer bottles from 
           around the boys.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Y'all wanna drink?

                                 PAUL
                        Um, four Buds.

                                 MATTY
                        Can we get four tequila shots? 

                                 LESLIE
                        And a lemon and the salt, please?

                                 WAITRESS
                        IDs?

           Everyone pulls out their IDs. The waitress smirks and hands 
           them back.

           As she leaves:
                                 PAUL
                        Why don’t you get a better fake ID?

                                 STONE
                        What’s wrong with this one?

                                 PAUL
                        You’re not a Mexican. 

                                 MATTY
                        Hey! Anyone wanna smoke a bowl?

           Paul and Stone barely shake their heads, and proceed to play 
           pool.

                                 LESLIE
                             (waves Matty away)
                        Go ahead, Matty. 

           EXT. THE ORANGE DRAGON - REAR PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Matty keeps the exit door propped open with his left foot, as 
           he lights the tightly packed hash pipe with a PLAYBOY BUNNY 
           BUTANE LIGHTER. 

           As Matty inhales his first long haul from the pipe, he turns 
           and spots a national guard military jeep. 

           Matty hacks in surprise and juggles the pipe, nearly dropping 
           it in a panic. 

                                 MATTY
                             (discreet)
                        Shit!

           He quickly snuffs out the pipe on his pant leg, and stuffs it 
           into his shirt pocket. 

           Matty backs into the exit door, but pauses when he notices 
           how foggy the jeep's windows are. He squints for a moment. 

           Inside the vehicle is a National Guardsman feverishly making 
           out with a very young girl, an ARMY INSIGNIA on his shoulder. 
           Matty, amused, moves in for a closer look.

           The bodies of the officer and the girl SLAM up against the 
           driver's seat window, wiping some steam from the glass. 

           Matty spots a tattoo on the back of the young girl's 
           shoulder:
           INSERT OF TATTOO: A small sun flower containing the initials 
           C. G. 

                                 MATTY (CONT'D)
                        Oh, my, sweet Jesus.

           INT. THE ORANGE DRAGON - NIGHT

           Matty walks swiftly towards Stone at the pool table with 
           purpose, as if he is the head of a task force with a briefing 
           for the president. 

                                 MATTY
                        Stone... I found Christie.

           INT. THE ORANGE DRAGON - NIGHT

           Across the bar a group of young girls laugh, oblivious as 
           Stone furiously tries to storm out of the arcade and is 
           restrained by his brothers in the B.G. by the pool tables. 
           Stone finally slumps against the wall, devastated.

           INT. THE ORANGE DRAGON - SAME SCENE

           Leslie rubs Stone’s back compassionately. 

                                 STONE
                        OK. This situation is officially 
                        disgusting now.

                                 MATTY 
                        She's outside right now. Let's go 
                        get the Nazi.

                                 STONE
                        It has to be Captain Bowman. I know 
                        it’s him.

                                 MATTY
                        Who the fuck’s Captain Bowman? 

                                 STONE
                        She...
                             (barely spits it out.)
                        Christie Baby-sits for him. 

                                 LESLIE
                        Yeee-uck! She's sleeping with a guy 
                        she baby-sits for? Yeee-uck! 
                                 STONE
                        I should have figured it out. She 
                        came back from baby-sitting drunk 
                        three times this month.

           Matty puts his arm around Stone. 

                                 MATTY 
                        He's outside right now! Let's go 
                        get the piglet.

                                 PAUL
                        He’s a Guardsmen not a cop.

                                 LESLIE
                        Tell Christie’s dad about it.

                                 STONE
                        No.

                                 LESLIE
                        Your uncle was in the guard. Tell 
                        him.

                                 STONE
                        No. I'm- I'm just leaving. 

                                 MATTY
                        To do what? Sulk?

                                 STONE
                        Yes.

                                 LESLIE
                        No, you're staying. 
                             (hugs Stone's neck)
                        Paul, baby, tell him he's staying.

                                 PAUL 
                        Don’t let her control you, man. 
                        Stay for one more game of pool, 
                        Stone, OK? We’ll figure this out.

           A line of fashion conscious city girls file past brushing up 
           against the pool tables. Stone takes a drink, nods and begins 
           to rack up the next pool game. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I’ll even give you the good pool 
                        cue this time.

                                 STONE
                        ....mean the one that’s not broken?
           INT. THE ORANGE DRAGON - NIGHT

           JAYDA SILVER, 17, sits on a stool next to the wall with her 
           small entourage of urbanites who stand-out like beautiful 
           novas in this rural-clad arcade.

           Directly across the room Stone stands motionless, staring at 
           a seemingly impossible shot. The eight ball lies directly 
           between the cue ball, and the only other ball on the table, 
           the seven.

           Jayda hops from the stool and grabs a FIST FULL of bills from 
           her homemade purse. She selects a dollar bill and shoves the 
           rest of the money into the back pocket of her tight 
           corduroys. 

           Jayda saunters past the three brothers. Paul's eyes follow 
           her instead of Stone's pending shot.

           Leslie smacks Paul on the arm.  

                                 LESLIE
                        Looking at something, Paul?!

                                 PAUL
                             (making intense eye 
                              contact)
                        Only your pretty eyes, sugar pants.

           Stone hits the balls into all the wrong directions. The eight 
           ball sewers. 

           Jayda walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the dollar 
           bill, selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on 
           a record, and the great blue surf tune I Get Around by The 
           Beach Boys comes blaring through the arcade.

           Jayda starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the 
           arcade. Her back to the pool tables. She's really getting 
           into it. Fearless--

           She downs a couple of waiting whiskey shots at the bar, and 
           glimpses over at the table where the three brothers are 
           playing pool. She smiles with sly amusement as--

           Stone stares down at the pool table, lost in his head 
           somewhere.

                                 MATTY
                             (about Jayda)
                        Jesus Christ.
                                 LESLIE
                        Tongue away, Matty.

           Jayda's pals have joined her, as well as one or two cowboy 
           patrons of the arcade who dance with the city gals, trying to 
           flirt. To look at Jayda move, you can see that any man would 
           be doing the exact same thing. 

           Stone stares down at the pool table and nods his head 
           slightly to the jukebox. 

                                 STONE
                             (singing quietly)
                        From town to town. Get around 
                        'round 'round.

           For a brief second Stone lets his heart go with the music. He 
           bobs his head, almost in a dance. And then....

           Jayda grabs a hold of Stone's arm as naturally as a Great 
           White Shark grabs a seal from the crest of a wave and tugs 
           him close to her. 

           Stone is completely caught off guard. He awkwardly stands in 
           front of Jayda as she moves rhythmically and flawlessly. He 
           tries to copy what she's doing. 

           Jayda laughs at him and pulls him close. Her forehead is 
           touching his. She puts her hands around Stone's waist, and 
           sways his hips with hers. She spins herself under Stone's 
           arm. 

                                 JAYDA
                        Relaaaxxx. Get around-round-round, 
                        why don't you?

                                 STONE
                        Sorry. I, uh... Sorry.

           They shuffle and circle. Jayda leads Stone to dip her. She is 
           laughing wildly. Stone is dumbfounded.

           In the blink of an eye Jayda stops and pulls Stone to an 
           emptier spot by the fire exit. She raises her voice over the 
           blaring music.

                                 JAYDA
                        Where you from?

                                 STONE
                        Now, or before?
                                 JAYDA
                        I know where you are now. Where are 
                        you from originally?

                                 STONE
                        New Orleans... You?

                                 JAYDA
                        Same.

           A beat.

                                 JAYDA (CONT'D)
                        You like to dance or what, Albert?

                                 STONE
                        Albert?

                                 JAYDA
                        You look like an Albert.

                                 STONE
                        Really? I don't look like an Albert 
                        do I?... Am I fat?

                                 JAYDA
                        You're not fat Albert, you're my 
                        Albert, but no one else can call 
                        you that but me... You want to know 
                        why? 

                                 STONE
                        Um, yeah.

                                 JAYDA
                        Because this makes the relationship 
                        between you and me different from 
                        any other relationship that you 
                        ever had with any other person. To 
                        me you're Albert, but to everyone 
                        else you're someone different.

                                 STONE
                        Sounds good... Um... Betty?

           Jayda grins.

                                 JAYDA
                        Cute. My name's Jayda. It's a 
                        pleasure to meet you.

           Jayda extends her hand for a hand shake. 
                                 STONE
                        Jayda? That's a very cool name. 
                        Jayda.

                                 JAYDA
                        Thank ya!

           Stone shakes her hand.

                                 STONE
                        My real name is-

                                 JAYDA
                        Albert! Your real name is Albert! 
                        Do we have to go through this 
                        again?

                                 STONE
                        No.

           They laugh.

                                 JAYDA 
                        Thanks for being my dance partner. 
                        You were swell!
                             (adjusts her top)
                        I've gotta go to the ladies room 
                        now, though. So, bye-bye! 

           Stone grabs her hand swiftly, almost desperately.

                                 STONE
                        Well. You know-

                                 JAYDA
                        Yeeeesss?

                                 STONE 
                        Wait. I mean- 

                                 JAYDA
                        What's your phone number?

                                 STONE
                        Exactly.

           Jayda smiles.

                                 JAYDA
                        No, I mean what's your phone number 
                        silly?
                                 STONE 
                        Oh! Sorry. 513-9597.

                                 JAYDA 
                        K! I'll call you.
                             (a beat)
                        If you're lucky!

                                 STONE
                        Oh, uh. OK. Shouldn't you write it 
                        down or-

                                 JAYDA 
                        513-9597.

                                 STONE
                        Wow...OK.

                                 JAYDA
                        I never forget phone numbers! 
                        Remember that about me.

                                 STONE
                        That's really, uh. But... like-

                                 JAYDA 
                             (singing)
                        Ohhh, the ladies room is callin'! 
                        The ladies room is callin'! While 
                        terrorist bombs are fallin', the 
                        ladies room is calling! Yeahhh!

           Stone now has full-fledged case of the stupids. He's 
           speechless. 

                                 JAYDA (CONT'D)
                        Just made that up right now.
                             (a beat)
                        Do I scare you?

           Stone doesn't answer. Jayda grabs Stone by the face and gives 
           him a big kiss on the cheek and whispers in his ear.

                                 JAYDA (CONT'D)
                        You should never be afraid of 
                        anything. Such a waste of fucking 
                        time.
                             (a beat)
                        It was so good to meet you...

           Jayda winks and dances off the floor.
                                 JAYDA (CONT'D)
                        ALBERT! ALBERT! WHOOH!

           EXT. THE ORANGE DRAGON - LATER 

           The Orange Dragon sign casts a heavy glow on the dirt roadway 
           and the line of people filing outside the two giant wooden 
           front doors. The crowd is rowdy, loud, and grows steadily. 
           Stone Matty Leslie and Paul lean against the arcade wall. 

                                 STONE
                        OK. OK. Why did that chick talk to 
                        me? 

                                 PAUL
                        She was probably high on E or 
                        something.

           Leslie claps her hand over Paul's mouth.

                                 LESLIE
                        Shush! She was probably high on 
                        Stone's good looks. Don't be an ass-
                        hole. What was her name Stone?

                                 STONE
                        Jayda. Isn't that a cool name? 
                        Jayda.

           Paul spots Captain Bowman across the street.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey. Lookie. Lookie. Is that our 
                        Rambo and his underage girlfriend? 

           Captain Bowman is chatting casually with Christie, Deputy 
           Beek, and CORPORAL Thomas, 22, a bespectacled and skinny 
           soldier.

                                 MATTY 
                        I'm gonna deal with this.

                                 STONE
                        Don't bother Matty. It's-

           Matty abruptly starts walking towards the men. The others 
           watch agog as Matty taps Captain Bowman on the shoulder.

                                 MATTY 
                        Captain Bowman, you old son of a 
                        gun! I haven't seen you in forever.
           The entire circle of officers suddenly go silent. 

           Paul attempts to follow on his crutches, but Leslie clutches 
           his arm with all her might and gestures towards his cast. 

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN
                        Do I know you?

                                 MATTY 
                        Oh, don't be coy with me. Isn't 
                        that just like ol' Captain Bowman 
                        to be coy.
                             (winks at the other 
                              officers)
                        Heyyy, last I heard you were 
                        fucking a fifteen year old girl, 
                        Captain Bowman? How's that going?

           Christie looks at Matty taken aback.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN
                        Now you're making false accusations 
                        against an officer. Real smooth.
                             (to Christie)
                        Don’t worry Chris.

                                 MATTY
                             (impersonating Bowman)
                        Yeah. Yeah. Don’t worry "Chris."- 

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN
                        What's your problem fuck nut?

                                 CHRISTIE
                        He's a loser! That's his fucking 
                        problem! 

                                 MATTY 
                        You're my problem you fascist, in 
                        more senses of the word than just 
                        one! People saw you fucking her in 
                        the back parking lot, like an idiot 
                        for everyone to see-

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Hey. Hey. Watch yourself buddy. You 
                        better watch yourself. I just heard 
                        you call him a fascist. Not smart.

                                 MATTY 
                             (to Beek)
                        Hey. Easy there. I ain't got no 
                        problem with you other fascists.
                                 STONE
                        Will you shut up, Matty.

           Bowman grabs Matty by the shoulder.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN
                        We are here to keep the peace and 
                        we do have the authority to 
                        restrain and/or detain anyone who 
                        might be trying to break that peace-

                                 MATTY
                        Buh-buh-buh, blah, blah, blah from 
                        the wannabe marine. 

           Stone tries to pull Matty away.

           Bowman pulls pepper spray from his belt and BLASTS Stone and 
           Matty for a few seconds, both of whom instantly collapse to 
           the ground in vocal agony.

           All three of the guardsmen pounce on the brothers and 
           restrain them face down in the mud.

                                 MATTY (CONT'D)
                        WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU 
                        PIGS? WHAT DID I EVEN DO?

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                                            FADE UP TO:

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - MORNING

           Heat waves begin to rise as the sun peeks over the vast plane 
           of mobiles. An alligator splashes into the nearby swamp-- A 
           freight train approaches on the horizon.  

           EXT. BOWMAN FARM - MORNING

           A vast Louisiana farm. An open field. Captain Bowman loads 
           his M16 alongside Deputy Beek.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        You believe I actually miss the 
                        desert. These refugees are doing a 
                        stupendous job of pissing me off. I 
                        come home-- They got my wife hooked 
                        on drugs. And you hear what that 
                        little shit was sayin’ last night? 
                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN
                        What do you expect? New Orleans 
                        coddles criminals. They got boys in 
                        blue with criminal records. Guys 
                        who haven’t even graduated high 
                        school...

           A small paper target with the shape of a human being’s upper 
           body is stapled to some tree stumps a hundred feet across the 
           field.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                             (swigging a can of 
                              Budweiser)
                        Yeah, but it ain’t no different for 
                        the military, Ken. We got moral 
                        pardon’s letting dumb ass criminals 
                        in too...

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN
                        That’s different.

           The duo crouch down to their right knees, and aim at the 
           targets.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        How’s that any different? 

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN
                        Volunteers are always better than a 
                        draft. I want a soldier who wants 
                        to be watching my back watching my 
                        back. You know?

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Yeah... 

           THUNDEROUS AUTOMATIC ROUNDS escape Bowman’s M16. 

           Beek’s gun JAMS before it even gets a shot off.

           Bowman’s target shreds and splinters. Beek cringes as if the 
           bullets might bounce right back at them.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                             (covering head)
                        Shit! Shit!

           Bowman stops. Beek raises his head.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN
                        What?
                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                             (checking gun)
                        Oh... Fucking thing jammed again.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN
                             (giving Beek a look)
                        Oh.

           Bowman goes back to shooting. Again, Beek cringes with every 
           shot. 

           INT. SUN TIMES OFFICE - DAY

           Stone beat up, rubbing his eyes, hungover, gives his editor, 
           and uncle JIM, 52, the article he has written for his school 
           co-op. Jim is a white bearded former marine who’s clearly 
           used to holding reign over whoever is in his presence.

           Jim skims over the article and hands it back to Stone.

                                 JIM
                        Rewrite it. Once again, journalism 
                        is not self indulgence. It's the 
                         Who? What? When? Where? And Why? 
                        Not the Me, me, me, me, and I!

                                 STONE
                        Right-o. 

                                 JIM
                        You should write a feel good story.

                                 STONE
                        I write the St. Mary’s school news, 
                        Uncle Jim. 

                                 JIM
                        I know.

                                 STONE
                        Well... St. Mary’s High School has 
                        been underwater for three weeks.

                                 JIM
                        The glass is always half empty with 
                        you, isn’t it?

                                 STONE
                             (nodding “yes”)
                        Especially when the glass is under 
                        ten feet of water.
                                 JIM
                        Tell me where you are right now?

                                 STONE
                        Um... A trailer park?

                                 JIM
                        Bingo. Write about our trailer 
                        park.

                                 STONE 
                             (laughing)
                        What about? The three trailers that 
                        actually have electricity, the 
                        trailers that nobody’s allowed to 
                        live in, or how ‘bout an inspiring 
                        little piece about the heroes that 
                        finally cleaned up the raw sewage? 
                        Oh, wait, that was the parents of 
                        the kids who got typhoid.

                                 JIM 
                        Very funny... Here’s one: The army 
                        just presented the Hammond Sheriff 
                        with an award recognizing him as a 
                        “Patriotic employer.” 

                                 STONE
                        What is a “Patriotic Employer?” 

                                 JIM
                        It’s an employer who supports the 
                        armed forces and/or employs the 
                        armed forces.

                                 STONE
                        Isn’t the Sheriff running the 
                        Hammond National Guard?

                                 JIM 
                        He’s a Major in the 239th Military 
                        Company, 519th Battalion right up 
                        there out of Fort Polk!

                                 STONE 
                        So, he just got an award for 
                        supporting himself?

                                 JIM
                        Don’t be such a smart ass all the 
                        time. 

           Stone awkwardly tries to leave the office. 
                                 JIM (CONT'D)
                        You know I've never had a problem 
                        with a school news co-op student 
                        before you? Never.

                                 STONE
                        I know, Uncle Jim, I know. It’s 
                        very terrible. 

           INT. HAPPY TOM'S GROCERIES -  DAY

           Matty stocks aisle six full of ketchup. His name tag reads: 
           HAPPY MATTY!

           Paul and Stone stand in the aisle.

                                 MATTY
                        I still feel that pepper spray-

                                 STONE
                        It never goes away-

                                 MATTY
                        I know. I've felt it all day. You 
                        can't rub your eyes because it 
                        makes it worse, and when you don't 
                        rub your eyes, all you can think 
                        about is how much you want to rub 
                        your fucking eyes.

                                 STONE
                        I can say without a shadow of a 
                        doubt that pepper spray is the 
                        worst pain. The absolute worst pain 
                        on this planet.

                                 PAUL
                        Unless you've been bear sprayed. 
                        You know, pepper spray for bears? 
                        Have you ever been bear sprayed?

                                 STONE
                        No, I haven't been bear sprayed? 
                        Who the hell's been bear sprayed? 
                        Have you been bear sprayed?

                                 PAUL
                        Yes once. By an angry shop teacher.
                                 STONE
                        You did not get bear sprayed by an 
                        angry shop teacher Paul. Why are 
                        you making this up? 

                                 PAUL
                        I did too. Grade ten. Mr. 
                        Macgillicuddy.

                                 STONE
                        Mr. Macgillicuddy did not bear 
                        spray you!
                             (to Matty)
                        You should have left it alone last 
                        night. 

                                 MATTY
                        Well someone had to do something. I 
                        can't believe you're letting this 
                        guy get away with banging your 
                        girlfriend-

                                 STONE
                        I don't want to talk about this 
                        again.
                             (to Paul)
                        What are we doing here again?

                                 PAUL
                        Getting um, some eggs, and a 
                        cheese, and...

                                 STONE
                        Didn't you write it down?

                                 PAUL
                        No.

                                 STONE
                        Leslie's gonna be mad as a...
                             (a beat)
                        Mad as something.

                                 PAUL
                        She's always mad, though.

           INT. HAPPY TOM'S GROCERIES: AISLE 6 - MOMENTS LATER

           Matty works alone stocking the ketchup section. He glimpses 
           over at a man who is checking the prices of mustard. 

           It's none other than Captain Bowman in plain clothes. 
                                 MATTY
                             (whispers to himself)
                        Aw, no way!

           Matty hastily leaves the aisle without being noticed by the 
           Captain.

           INT. HAPPY TOM'S GROCERIES: VEGETABLE SECTION - DAY

           Paul sorts through the tomatoes.

                                 PAUL
                        How do you tell what a good tomato 
                        is? I know whatever I pick for 
                        Leslie it's going to be the wrong 
                        tomato. 

                                 STONE
                        I don't know, just make sure 
                        they're not soft or green or 
                        anything.

                                 PAUL
                        Ah. 

           INT. HAPPY TOM'S GROCERIES: AISLE 6 - DAY

           Bowman retrieves a jar of mustard. Suddenly FEEDBACK from the 
           intercom, then:

                                 MATTY (V.O.)
                             (over intercom)
                        Good afternoon ladies and 
                        gentlemen, I hope you're enjoying 
                        your shopping experience today at 
                        Happy Tom's Groceries. If I could, 
                        I'd like to draw your attention to 
                        aisle 6, where we have Captain 
                        Kenneth Bowman of the Louisiana 
                        National Guard, an Iraqi war hero, 
                        and one of our trailer town's 
                        finest peace keepers. 
                             (a couple of people 
                              applaud)
                        Captain Bowman is also one of our 
                        town's very own pedophiles! This 
                        polyester molester has recently 
                        been indulging in sex with his 
                        adolescent baby-sitter! Let’s give 
                        him a hand ladies and gentlemen!
           Bowman drops his groceries in a rage and goes running to the 
           front of the store.

           INT. HAPPY TOM'S GROCERIES - DAY

           The Captain arrives at the front of the store just as Matty 
           emerges from using the intercom in the office. Matty is 
           laughing hysterically. 

           Happy Tom's employees and managers are urgently walking 
           towards Matty, some with their arms outstretched as if to ask 
           what's going on.  

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN
                        Better run.

           Bowman bolts towards him. Matty scampers towards a nearby 
           fire exit and slips outside. Bowman is seconds behind him. 

           Stone pushes his way through curious onlookers just in time 
           to see the exit door closing. 

           EXT. HAPPY TOM'S GROCERIES - CONTINUOUS

           The Captain grabs Matty and immediately punches him harshly 
           across the teeth knocking the smile off his face. Matty's 
           knees buckle and he collapses to the ground beside a garbage 
           bin. 

           Cars whipping by on the busy street beside the grocery store. 
           A few cars slow down, but nobody stops.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN
                        You asked for it.

           Bowman picks Matty up and slams him against the brick wall of 
           the grocery store. 

           Stone emerges from around the exit and Bowman immediately 
           swings at Stone. Stone blocks it, but falls to the ground 
           with his forearms up over his face.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN (CONT'D)
                        BACK THE FUCK OFF.

           He points scoldingly at Stone.

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN (CONT'D)
                        First of all you little shits! I'm 
                        30. I'm not an old man!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN (CONT'D)
                        And second, I’m a goddamn Captain 
                        in the Louisiana Army National 
                        Guard. You will respect that, and 
                        you will stay the fuck out of my 
                        business. She's my baby-sitter, 
                        nothing more-

                                 MATTY
                        WE SAW YOU MAKING OUT WITH HER, YOU 
                        PEDOPHILE.

           Bowman kicks Matty in the ribs. 

                                 CAPTAIN BOWMAN
                             (as he's kicking)
                        Don't. You. Ever. Call. Me. A. 
                        PEDOPHILE.

           Stone jumps to his feet and runs at the Captain. Bowman 
           easily picks him up and slams him to the ground, onto his 
           spine, knocking the wind out of him. 

           Paul emerges from the door to see Bowman kicking Stone 
           several times in the kidneys.

           Paul takes his crutch and swings towards Bowman, at first 
           just barely catching him in the knee.

                                 PAUL
                        Why don't you try to pick on me?

           Bowman turns to attack Paul but Stone grabs and clings to the 
           officer's right arm, and doesn't let go.

           Paul swings the crutch again at the Captain and this time 
           makes full contact across the side of Bowman's face. He is 
           stunned for a second and backs away from the brothers.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        PICK ON ME FUCKER.

           Matty gets up from the ground, reaching for something in his 
           pocket.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I'LL KICK YOUR ASS WITH A FUCKIN' 
                        BROKEN LEG. LET'S GO!

           The Captain and Paul circle one another. Bowman has fists up, 
           smirks and kicks Paul with full force on his broken leg, 
           cracking the cast. Paul howls in pain and falls against the 
           garbage bin.
           Bowman suddenly drops his fists as he looks past Paul towards 
           Matty who brandishes his large hunting knife, his arms spread 
           in a threatening pose.

                                 MATTY
                             (to Bowman)
                        Better run. 

           Bowman turns and darts towards the front of the grocery store 
           with Matty in pursuit.

           Stone, winded, lags behind them turns back to the injured 
           Paul. He tries to help Paul get up.

                                 STONE 
                        C'mon man. You alright? Let's go! 
                        Let's go! 

                                 PAUL
                        My leg's broken. He broke my 
                        fucking leg again.

                                 MATTY (O.S.)
                        STONE. I GOT HIM.

           Stone turns and freezes in shock. Matty's shirt is splashed 
           with scarlet, and he hoists his BLOOD STAINED KNIFE.

                                 MATTY (CONT'D)
                        Look! Blood!

           Happy Tom's employees gasp, and a female employee, EILEEN, 
           18, runs inside.

           Stone grabs Matty by the arm.

                                 STONE
                        Run. We gotta run.

           INT. HAPPY TOM’S GROCERIES - DAY

           An oblivious female CASHIER scans various FOOD ITEMS. A PHONE 
           sits next to her register.

           A frantic Eileen comes running up to her.

                                 EILEEN
                        Call 911!

           The cashier holds up a finger signalling her to wait a 
           second.
                                 EILEEN
                        Matty stabbed a guy. Call 911.

           EXT. CHURCH ALLEYWAY - DAY

           A few hundred feet from Happy Tom’s Groceries, Matty stumbles 
           into a church trailer’s alleyway. Seconds behind, is the 
           injured Paul who uses Stone as a crutch. They all collapse 
           into the alleyway breathlessly. 

           A church choir’s southern hymns escape from an open stained 
           glass window. 

                                 STONE
                             (in pain)
                        You stabbed him?!

                                 MATTY
                        I guess. 

                                 STONE (CONT'D)
                        Well, is he fucking dead?

                                 MATTY
                        He looked pretty dead man.

                                 PAUL
                        What the fuck were you thinking?

           Matty’s proud posture turns to a bag of sand. 

                                 MATTY
                             (holding back tears)
                        It was self defence... 

           Creeping SIRENS bounce off the trailers around them as Paul 
           rips the shattered cast from his leg in a frenzy. 

                                 PAUL
                        If we run, we’ll look guilty.

                                 STONE
                        If we run we are guilty. It’s 
                        accessory to murder.

                                 PAUL
                             (shaking his head)
                        I’m not waiting for the National 
                        Guard to find us. They’ll kill us.
                                 STONE
                        No they won’t. We’ll call Uncle 
                        Jim. 

                                 MATTY
                        Everything’s nuts right now. The 
                        guard‘ll probably hang us from 
                        trees to make an example-

                                 PAUL
                        Shut the fuck up Matty. 
                             (to Stone)
                        The dumb little shit’s right. 

           EXT. HAPPY TOM’S GROCERIES - DAY

           Some MEDICS run up to the strewn out body of Captain Bowman 
           in the parking lot. They check his vitals. Nothing.

           EXT. TRAILER PARK RAVINE - DAY

           Malicious vegetation strangles away the trees and the 
           sunlight is broken into a million tiny shafts as Stone, Paul 
           and Matty inch down the ravine with their backs to the hill 
           and their hands on the ground. 

           Mud churns beneath their feet creating tiny mud slides that 
           roll off the cliffs below to the bottom of the chasm.  

           Paul is forced into a balancing act, the pain from his leg is 
           affecting his every move. He never lets his leg touch the 
           ground as they inch downwards ever so slowly.

           Deputy Beek is on the scene in full National Guard attire, is

                        Thanks for your help, Eileen.

           Two Humvees overflowing with National Guardsmen pull into the 
           store lot. 

                                 EILEEN
                        You don’t need anything else?

           Beek’s phone rings.

                             (shaking his head)
                        You can leave. 

           Beek answers.

                             (concerned)
                        Hey sweetie... I know, Lisa, and 
                        I’m sorry, but it’s crazy tonight. 
                        They barely have anybody working 
                        here. Everybody’s still stuck in 
                        New Orleans.

                        I can’t sleep if you’re not home.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        You’re doing so well. I know you 
                        can do this. I’ll be home in a few 
                        hours. You can call me any time. 
                        OK?

                                 LISA
                             (hesitant)
                        OK.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        I’m proud of you.

           As Beek hangs up, Sergeant Zayas and Corporal Thomas step out 
           of their Humvee. They salute as they approach.

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        Beek. Good to see you again man!

           A handshake hug.

                        What’s up?

           Beek is looking particularly sullen and agitated.

                        How the hell did that happen?
                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Some piece of shit stabbed him... 

           Vann, already on the scene, approaches. Some E4 soldiers join 
           the crowd. Everybody salutes the Sheriff/Major.

                                 VANN 
                             (addressing squad)
                        OK. We’re gonna have to conduct a 
                        search as one group. And for the 
                        record, gentlemen, while I am 
                        Sheriff in this Parish, I am 
                        addressed as Sheriff, even though I 
                        am, in addition, your acting Major. 
                        Understood? Sheriff and Parish. It 
                        rhymes. Is that clear? 

           Everybody nods.

                                 VANN
                        We have three Deputy’s already 
                        searching. 

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        Anyone else from the brigade gonna 
                        show?

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Earliest we can get anyone out here 
                        is tomorrow morning. We only have 
                        your squad for the night.

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        That’s not enough.

                                 VANN
                        It’s gonna have to be.

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        How many vehicles we got?

                                 VANN
                        Four Humvees and five squad cars. 

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        That’s it?  No trucks?

                                 VANN
                        That’s it. Everything else is in 
                        New Orleans or the desert... 

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        How many suspects we looking at?
                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Witness saw three guys. Teens. 
                        Apparently brothers. 

                                 VANN
                             (gesturing out over the 
                              ravine)
                        Last seen headed towards the west 
                        trailers over there.

                                 CORPORAL THOMAS
                        How many were there? 

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        I just said there was three. 

                                 CORPORAL THOMAS
                        You said at least three, but does 
                        that mean there’s a possibility 
                        there was more than three.

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        Jesus, Thomas, are we actually 
                        having this conversation? He said 
                        we’re looking for three guys.

                                 VANN
                        OK, let’s shut the fuck up, and 
                        find these fucks. We’ll make up for 
                        manpower with some speed. Let’s go!

           SAME SCENE - SECONDS LATER

           A half-dozen guardsmen, pull thirty calibre machine guns from 
           the back of the Humvee. 

           Led by their Staff Sergeant Zayas, and framed by the ravine 
           forest’s brooding branches, the soldiers march off towards 
           the west group of trailers. 

           Deputy Beek and a PRIVATE with a German Shepard follow 
           behind.

           EXT. RAVINE - DAY

           At the bottom of the gorge, Paul hops off a river bank into 
           some tall glades plunging knee-deep into the murky black 
           swamp. 
                                 PAUL
                             (to Matty)
                        Get in, psychopath. Water throws 
                        off police dogs.

                                 MATTY
                        No it doesn’t.

                                 PAUL
                        It sure as fuck does.

                                 STONE
                        How the fuck would you know?

                                 PAUL
                        Discovery channel... Just get in 
                        the fucking water. 

           Stone follows clumsily into the water. Matty’s eyes are 
           locked on the muddy water, his mind is locked in deep 
           thought.

                                 PAUL
                        Matty. Wake the fuck up and hurry 
                        the fuck up, please.

                                 MATTY
                        I did this for Stone and you are 
                        treating me like I was the one who 
                        fucked his girlfriend-

                                 PAUL
                        The only reason you did anything is 
                        because of you, Matty. You didn’t 
                        do it for Stone. You didn’t do it 
                        for me.  You stabbed the guy for 
                        you. You’ve always had so much to 
                        fucking prove, and now we’re all 
                        screwed because of it.

           Matty melts into a sulk and climbs away from the water. 

                                 PAUL
                        And right on cue: Matty tries to 
                        make us feel sorry for him. 

                                 STONE
                        You always pull this shit, Matt. 
                        C’mon.

           Matty stops. He contemplates his words carefully and then:
                                 MATTY
                        Do you know what the meaning of 
                        life is?

                                 PAUL
                        Oh, God... 

                                 STONE
                        Don’t even do this.

                                 MATTY
                        I’m serious. Take a guess. Give me 
                        your theory on the meaning of life.

                                 STONE
                        No. 

                                 PAUL
                        To go forth and reproduce!

                                 STONE
                        You’re being a real fucking flake, 
                        Matty.

                                 MATTY
                        The meaning of life is to give 
                        something back to other people’s 
                        lives... 

           The two older brothers would probably laugh out loud if they 
           weren’t so pissed off. 

                                 PAUL
                        Profound thought is not your 
                        friend, Matty. 

           Matty stares up, and glances back and forth between both 
           sides of the ravine. The ground at the top is covered in 
           white mobiles as far as anyone can see.

                                 MATTY
                        Listen to me. My point is they're 
                        gonna be looking for three guys-

                                 STONE
                        Get in the water.

                                 MATTY
                        So we should split up...

                                 STONE
                        We’re not splitting up. Get in the 
                        water.
                                 MATTY
                        Until I confess to what I did, 
                        they’re going to think we all did 
                        it. 

                                 STONE
                        We don’t need to split up for you 
                        to confess. 

           Matty looks at his brothers and takes a deep breath. He 
           begins back up the bank and into the bush.

                                 STONE
                        Don’t be fucking stupid. We don’t 
                        have time... Matty!

                                 PAUL
                             (Matty distances himself)
                        We’re not gonna chase after you 
                        dude! 

                                 MATTY
                        Don’t then.

           And Matty fades into the densest Louisiana brush you’ve ever 
           seen. 

                                 STONE 
                        Matty... Ya little freak. 
                             (starts after Matty)
                        MATTY! GET BACK HERE!

           He stops. Looks back, and keeps on going. Stone looks at 
           Paul. He has no choice but to stay.

           EXT. RAVINE - MOMENTS LATER

           As Matty scales back up the ravine he fails to notice hints 
           of military green uniforms becoming visible through the trees 
           in the distance. 

           INT. CHRISTIE’S HOUSE: KITCHEN - DUSK

           Christie, in her pajamas, eats a bowl of Lucky Charms cereal 
           and paces impatiently around her massive family kitchen.

           INSERT OF DECORATION SIGN OVER SINK: God blesses this 
           kitchen, but he doesn’t clean it!
                                 CHRISTIE
                        I think we’re leaving the cake in 
                        too long. 

           Christie’s mom, FAYE, forties, an earnest housewife, picks up 
           invisible specks of dust off the kitchen floor and wipes down 
           the counter to make way for a chocolate CAKE rising in the 
           oven. 

                                 FAYE
                        You sound like your Aunt Sue. Cake 
                        made from scratch takes a little 
                        bit longer. We used to just argue 
                        to death about this.

                                 CHRISTIE
                        People don’t argue about this kind 
                        of stuff, mom.

                                 FAYE
                        They do too! I once knew two 
                        sisters who stopped speaking 
                        because they cooked chicken 
                        casseroles differently. 

                                 CHRISTIE
                             (laughing)
                        OK, correction: Sane people don’t 
                        argue about this kind of stuff, 
                        mom.

           Faye wanders out of the kitchen. 

           Christie turns her attention to a local NEWSCAST playing on a 
           small TV in the B.G. 

                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                        ...murder took place behind Happy 
                        Tom’s Groceries this afternoon. No 
                        names have officially been released 
                        by officials, but sources tell us 
                        that the victim’s name was a 
                        Captain Kenneth Bowman of 519th 
                        Battalion in Fort Polk. Again, we 
                        want to stress that this is not 
                        official, but...

           Christie drops her bowl of cereal. Yellow stars, green 
           clovers, and purple horseshoes swim at her feet. 

           Faye comes back in with a dustpan.
                                 FAYE
                        What’s wrong with you? 

           Christie has turned white.

                                 FAYE (CONT'D)
                        What?

           EXT. RAVINE - DUSK

           Sergeant Zayas and Deputy Beek approach the top of a hill 
           above the water. 

           Zayas breaks over the brow of the hill only to find...

           Matty climbing towards them. He freezes in his tracks. 

           All the soldiers turn and aim their guns at Matty. 

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                             (amused)
                        Well, ho-lee shit! 

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Hands! Hands! Hands!

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - DUSK

           Just away from the ravine, surrounding the bottom of a rustic 
           water tower, is an abandoned football field, and a cluster of 
           a few thousand empty FEMA trailers. 

           GUTTERS

           Stone and Paul hurry between the no man’s land of gutters, 
           thin muddy drain-ways that hide behind the back ends of every 
           trailer and stretch for miles on end. 

           EXT. RAVINE - DUSK

           The squad’s guns are up, sights locked on Matty, who is 
           frozen in his tracks in the midst of frantic negotiation.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Where your brothers at? They here?

                                 MATTY
                        No! Why?! They didn’t do shit! I 
                        did it! I did it!
                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        What you got in that back pocket? 

           Matty has his right hand clasped to something in his back 
           pocket. He lets go.

                                 MATTY
                        Just listen! Just listen!

           The Private and his barking German Sheppard edge towards 
           Matty.

                                 MATTY
                        What’s up with that dog? Keep that 
                        dog away! 

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        We’re going to let the dog go!

                                 MATTY
                        Let that dog go then and see what 
                        happens!

                                 PRIVATE
                        I plan on it! I plan on it!

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Hands up! And the dog won’t go near 
                        you!

                                 MATTY
                        Alright, but y’all need to just 
                        listen to me!

           The Sergeant clutches his gun tight, aiming carefully. Matty 
           and Beek’s lock eyes. The Shepard is getting pissed, barking 
           louder.

                                 CORPORAL THOMAS
                        You can end this peacefully! You 
                        can end this peacefully!

                                 MATTY
                             (slowly raising hands)
                        You can end this peacefully too!

           And suddenly the Sheppard is loose and charging at Matty. 

           Matty pulls his knife, but it’s too late.

           Beek FIRES, and all within five seconds COUNTLESS THUNDEROUS 
           AUTOMATIC ROUNDS are fired at Matty.
                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        HOLD! HOLD!

           Matty and the dog drop like trees. The shooting stops.

                        SSGT. ZAYAS
                                                         PRIVATE
           What the fuck?!
                                              YOU HIT THE DOG!

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        Godammnit!

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           What sounds like the CRACKLE OF DISTANT FIREWORKS echoes a 
           couple of miles off. The brothers barely notice as they hurry 
           to the nearest trailer. Stone runs up the trailer steps and 
           shoulders into the door, once. Twice. Nothing. 

                                 PAUL
                             (unimpressed)
                        What are you doing? 

                                 STONE
                        What?

                                 PAUL
                        You know they only have three 
                        different sets of keys for the 
                        whole fucking trailer park. 

                                 STONE
                        Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! That’s right.

           Stone tries his key on the trailer. Doesn’t work. He moves on 
           to the next trailer. Like a charm.

           EXT. HAPPY TOM’S GROCERIES - DUSK

           There’s a small commotion amongst the police. Vann’s noting 
           blood spatter at the crime scene. His walkie crackles:

                                 WALKIE (O.S.)
                             (talking fast)
                        ... suspect down. He had a gun-- 
                        Need a paramedic... 

                                 VANN
                             (into walkie)
                        10-4. What’s your twenty?
           EXT. RAVINE - DUSK

           A few feet into the ravine, caught on a fallen tree, and 
           hanging upside down with his shirt up over his face, is the 
           barely distinguishable body of Matty-- A forensics 
           photographer taking photos.

           A bullet has ripped half his name tag away, all that remains 
           of the tag is the blood spattered word, ‘Happy.’ 

           Beek, slouching under the weight of remorse, is in animated 
           conversation with Sheriff Vann. 

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        He said he had a gun, and we fired 
                        when he went for it... 

                                 VANN
                        And how the fuck did you manage to 
                        shoot the dog?

           The Private picks up the body of his dog, shot to death, and 
           carries him up out of the ravine.

           Beek breathes deeply, trying to hide what appears to be a 
           small panic attack.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        The dog broke loose and bolted for 
                        the suspect simultaneously with the 
                        suspect pulling, what we thought 
                        was a gun. 

                                 VANN
                        And when did you realize his gun 
                        was a six inch hunting knife?

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                             (a little ashamed)
                        After the suspect was deceased.

           Corporal Thomas is sitting on a tree stump, staring wide eyed 
           out into space. 

                                 CORPORAL THOMAS
                        We were just doing our job...
                                 VANN (CONT'D)
                        And, of course, I can’t send any of 
                        you fucks home to properly 
                        investigate ‘cause then we’ll have 
                        no boots in the fucking Parish 
                        tonight? Right? 

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        That’s not my call, sir.

                                 VANN
                        Christ!

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                             (to Vann)
                        Not everybody fired, sir.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                             (very offended)
                        We had no choice but to do what we 
                        did, Sergeant.

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        No offence meant, Cal. It just 
                        feels ugly.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        I know it does-

                                 VANN
                             (ending conversation)
                        OK.

           Without missing a beat, Vann turns to the congregation of law 
           enforcement and Guard.

                                 VANN 
                        Alright, listen the fuck up! Our 
                        suspects have been on the run for 
                        sixty minutes. One suspect is 
                        deceased, and it appears we have 
                        two more on the run. One is 
                        believed to be injured, so it’s a 
                        safe bet they have not left this 
                        trailer park. I want a section by 
                        section search of every trailer in 
                        this park if need be and I want 
                        check-points up at every half mile, 
                        where possible! 
                             (to Beek)
                        I got control here, Cal. Take 
                        control everywhere else. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VANN  (cont'd)
                        Get to the families, hangouts, 
                        girlfriends. Anywhere these boys 
                        might be!

           Everybody springs into action. Police and guard disperse from 
           the scene like waves of an explosion.

           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - DUSK

           The otherwise empty mobile is adorned with only a small 
           plastic platinum crucifix. Paul is on his cell phone.

                                 PAUL
                             (to Stone)
                        Ouch! That is not how you do a 
                        fucking splint man!

           Stone throws his hands up, abandoning Paul’s boorish leg 
           splint made from sticks and shoe laces.

                                 PAUL
                             (into phone)
                        No, Leslie, don’t call 911... 
                        You’re breaking up. I can barely 
                        hear you.. Leave Gracie with your 
                        mom, and get down here before the 
                        fucking army’s on your front 
                        lawn... I know you don’t have a 
                        front lawn. It’s called a figure of 
                        speech.

           EXT. LESLIE’S MOM’S TRAILER - EVENING

           The baby blue Chevette screeches up the front of a trailer 
           and comes to a sudden halt. Leslie leaps out of her Chevette 
           and runs into her mom’s trailer with the crying baby GRACIE, 
           still strapped into the baby seat. 

           A second later she runs out of the trailer, leaps back in the 
           car, and tears away, leaving everything in a CLOUD OF DUST.

           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - EVENING

           Stone has his mouth wide open beneath the kitchen faucet, 
           unsuccessfully attempting to shake just one single drop of 
           water onto his tongue.

           Paul dissembles the CRUCIFIX. He takes the wooden cross, and 
           lays the Christ down on a nearby windowsill.
                                 PAUL
                        Sorry Jesus... 

                                 STONE
                             (giving up on faucet)
                        We gotta call Uncle Jim?

                                 PAUL
                        He’s probably happy this happened 
                        to us.

                                 STONE
                        Don’t joke about this.

                                 PAUL
                        Who’s joking?

                                 STONE
                        What do you think’s gonna happen to 
                        Matty?
                             (before Paul can answer)
                        Fuck. We shouldn’t have let him go. 

                                 PAUL
                        Either you chased after Matty, or 
                        you stuck with me. It was Matty’s 
                        choice to fucking take off.

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - TRAILER - EVENING

           Stone is on his feet-- Paul ties the last knot of his 
           professional looking leg splint, made from a crucifix, held 
           together by some shredded curtains. 

                                 STONE
                        I gotta go.

                                 PAUL
                        Where?!

                                 STONE
                        I gotta go see Jayda.

           Paul looks at Stone like he’s from another planet.

                                 PAUL
                        Let me get this straight: You want 
                        to go on a date right now?

                                 STONE
                        I’ll wait ‘til Leslie gets here and 
                        then I’ll go. Two hours. That’s it.
                                 PAUL
                        We’re on the run.

                                 STONE
                        And I might not ever get another 
                        chance to date a chick again. It’s 
                        become more than a very real 
                        possibility that after today I’ll 
                        end up dating a fucking drag queen 
                        in the penitentiary. 

                                 PAUL
                        Ohhh, dating the drag queen?! 

                                 STONE
                        Shut up, man.

                                 PAUL
                        Some optimistic thinking there. 
                        Wow.

                                 STONE
                        Fuck off.

           Paul and Stone hold eye contact. Paul smiles. He gets it.

                                 PAUL
                        Go on your little date then, fuck 
                        head... Leslie’ll be here any 
                        second. You got two hours. 

                                 STONE
                        I’m not leaving before Leslie shows-

                                 PAUL
                        I would leave before Leslie gets 
                        here, dude. No way she’s gonna let 
                        you go on a date.

                                 STONE
                             (trying to brush off mud)
                        Should I call Uncle Jim or should 
                        you?

                                 PAUL
                        Um. You. Definitely you. He trusts 
                        you... 
                             (re: cell phone)
                        Reception sucks out here anyway.

           Stone takes a deep breath, gives Paul a handshake/hug, but 
           still hesitates.
                                 STONE
                        Nah... I can’t go.

                                 PAUL
                             (strongly)
                        Go. Go for your two hours. 
                             (Stone still waits)
                        Before I punch you.

           INT. KING’S HOTEL: JIM’S ROOM - EVENING 

           Jim is in shock, seated at the hotel desk in mid conversation 
           with Deputy Beek who stands in front of him.

                                 JIM
                        I just need a straight answer here. 
                        Do you have a witness that saw 
                        Matty stab the guy, or what?

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                             (hesitant)
                        No one solid, sir. This is why we 
                        need you to help us help Stone and 
                        Paul.

                                 JIM
                        Help ’em? I’m gonna kill ‘em.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Any idea where they would be?

                                 JIM
                        Nah. Why should they tell me 
                        anything? I’m just their bank 
                        machine.

           The Deputy picks up a stack of photos of the boys, at least 
           ten years out of date from a nearby table.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Is this all the photos you got?

                                 JIM
                        Yeah... Everything was gone after 
                        Katrina.

           The Deputy stops on one photo in particular.

           INSERT OF PHOTO: A pic of all three brothers, grade school 
           age, with their mother at a picnic table.
                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Their parents both dead, sir?

                                 JIM
                        Father’s a dead beat. Long gone... 
                        Katie... Their mother was driving 
                        home after a shift at the hospital 
                        where she worked the night the 
                        levees broke... They found her 
                        car.. Never found her...

           And then it really hits him.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        And now Matty... Shit... How could 
                        they be so stupid?

           EXT. HAPPY TOM’S GROCERIES - EVENING

           Beek walks with Vann and Sergeant Zayas through the chaos of 
           the crime scene parking lot. Guardsmen jump into a couple of 
           jeeps behind them. 

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                             (frustrated for him)
                        What about their parents?

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Father walked out on ‘em ten years 
                        ago... Mother died in Katrina.

                                 VANN
                        Christ... What’s the press doing 
                        for us?

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        KRCQ and crime stoppers are issuing 
                        a reward for witnesses or 
                        information leading to the arrest 
                        of the suspects.

                                 VANN
                        Good.

           They slip past THREE FORENSICS WORKERS combing the scene with 
           an ALS LIGHT. 

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        So, I was thinking.
                                 VANN
                             (kidding around)
                        Uh-oh. 

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        I don’t know if the squad should be 
                        on duty after a shooting. 

           Vann opens the driver’s seat door and steps one foot into his 
           Humvee.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Three weeks ago every one of us was 
                        in Tikrit. Not one of us would have 
                        been pulled after a shooting.

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        This is America.

                                 VANN
                        It’s America minus man power... Our 
                        Parish is under siege by twenty 
                        thousand refugees, Sergeant, and we 
                        have a grand total of twenty-three 
                        bodies helping us tonight. Eight of 
                        them are in your squad. We can’t 
                        afford to lose a single man, never 
                        mind a whole squad. 

           Zayas nods in surrender. Beek salutes as Vann shuts the 
           Humvee door.

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                             (saluting)
                        Happy birthday, sir... by the way.

                                 VANN
                        Thank you, Sergeant.

           The Humvee pulls away.

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - CEDARWOOD LANE- EVENING

           Stone sneaks and peeks through the park and hides himself 
           from the glare of passing cars behind some dying cedars 
           around the streets. 

           He looks at the address he has scribbled on the corner of a 
           beat up, and somewhat inaccurate, map of the trailer city.

           INSERT OF MAP: Jayda-- 199 28th Section, West.
           INSERT OF NUMBER ON TRAILER: 199

           EXT. TRAILER 199 - MOMENTS LATER

           Stone climbs the steps of TRAILER 199. He knocks and jumps as 
           he catches a glimpse of his reflection in the door window. 

           He swipes some caked blood from his forehead and cheek.

           The door swings open to make way for Jayda, smiling wide.

                                 JAYDA
                        Heyyyy, how the...
                             (her smile melts away)
                        Oh my God! You're bleeding! 

           She looks him up and down.

                                 JAYDA
                        What in the name of everything...

                                 STONE
                        A bit of a mishap... on the way 
                        over. 

                                 JAYDA
                             (not buying it)
                        Uh-huh.

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS: TRAILER - EVENING

           Paul finishes up his splint modification and hears the sudden 
           and fast approaching sound of several ARMED BODIES coming 
           right up behind him.

           He pulls out the trailer steps, squeezes his body underneath, 
           and pulls the steps back up against the trailer wall.

           INT. CHEVETTE: EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - EVENING

           Leslie has stopped at the edge of the empty FEMA trailer 
           section. She looks around, clueless about where to go. She 
           hurriedly dials her cell.

           INSERT OF CELL: NO SERVICE AVAILABLE

           Frustrated, she dials again-- Nothing. 

           She SCROLLS through her cell menu to SEND TEXT MESSAGE-- and 
           CLICKS ON IT.
           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS: UNDER TRAILER STEPS - SECONDS LATER

           Under the steps, Paul resembles a broken legged 
           contortionist, comically uncomfortable. The sound of boots on 
           mud tread implacably all around him.

           In the trailer above is the BANGING of the military tearing 
           the place apart looking for him. It soon ends.

           The footsteps become distant. Paul relaxes, and then KA-BANG.

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS (O.S.)
                        Check under the steps!

           The steps he is under move a couple of inches out from the 
           trailer wall. A flashlight’s beam swoops around Paul. Whoever 
           has the flashlight is sloppy. Miraculously, they miss him.

                                 CORPORAL THOMAS (0.S.)
                        Looks clear here! Fuck it... 

           And again, the footsteps become distant.

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS: TRAILER STEPS - SAME SCENE

           Everything is very still a few beats before:

           The trailer steps begin to play THE GHOSTBUSTERS THEME SONG.

           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS: UNDER TRAILER STEPS - SAME SCENE 

           The theme song is revealed as Paul’s cell phone text message 
           alert. Paul ties himself in a knot, scrambling to retrieve 
           the cell phone. He shuts off the music.

           INSERT OF TEXT MESSAGE: Where the fuck are you jerk??? >:(

           Paul begins to TYPE OUT A REPLY: B-careful... I M near 
           RAVINE...

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS: TRAILER  - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul worms out from beneath the steps. 

           Leslie’s Chevette breaks through the tree line. Paul limps 
           out into the grassy road and flags her down as she fishtails 
           towards him and screeches to a halt beside him, muck and 
           pebbles flying.
           INT. CHEVETTE - EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - EVENING

           Paul gets in. Leslie is fuming, arms crossed-- about to blow. 

                                 PAUL
                             (lightning fast)
                        Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

                                 LESLIE
                        Shut up.

           Paul goes for a hug and is promptly body checked to the other 
           side of the car. 

                                 PAUL
                             (slamming into window)
                        OW! Jesus, Leslie!

                                 LESLIE
                        Just don’t fucking fuck with me 
                        right now, mother fucker!

           Paul rubs his shoulder, but his feelings are what’s hurt.

                                 LESLIE
                        Where’s your two idiot brothers?!

                                 PAUL
                        Matty went to confess to murder. 
                        Stone went on a date.

                                 LESLIE
                        What?!

           EXT. JAYDA’S TRAILER - EVENING

           Jayda comes out onto the steps and shuts the door behind her. 
           She LOCKS it, and checks her canvas purse making sure she has 
           everything.

                                 JAYDA
                        OK, let’s go.

                                 STONE
                        Where are we going?

                                 JAYDA
                        I stole a new trailer last week and 
                        moved in. Let’s go.
                                 STONE
                        What do you mean, you stole a new 
                        trailer?

           Jayda is already down the steps and walking up the street.

                                 JAYDA
                        FEMA fucks gave us one without 
                        power, so I stole one... You coming 
                        or staying?

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS: JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - EVENING

           Jayda leads Stone into a group of unused trailers and stops 
           in front of an optimistic looking mobile decorated with blue 
           Christmas lights and a semi-psychedelic paint job. 

                                 STONE
                        Subtle.

           They begin up the tiny lane way past a group of garden gnomes 
           painted to look like a rock band.

                                 JAYDA
                        You ever been to this section 
                        before?

                                 STONE
                             (looks up at water tower)
                        Once.

                                 JAYDA
                        No one’s even checked on it yet. 
                        You believe it?

                                 STONE
                        I very much do believe it, 
                        actually.

           Stone’s eyes meet one gnome that looks exactly like Jerry 
           Garcia with wings, perched on a cloud, singing his heart out 
           from heaven. 

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS: TRAILER  - EVENING

           Leslie is backing up and pulling forward trying to squeeze 
           into a tiny gap between a parking barrier and some trailers.
                                 LESLIE (O.S.)
                        So, I’ve been trying to watch the 
                        news but my sister wouldn’t let me 
                        ‘cause she was watching The Wheel 
                        of Fortune. She watches The Wheel 
                        of Fortune voluntarily. Daily. Why? 
                        Why in God’s name would anyone do 
                        such a thing?.. And why are we 
                        parking?

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        I told you, we have to wait for 
                        Stone.

                                 LESLIE (O.S.)
                        We shouldn’t be waiting around. You 
                        should be calling your uncle.

           INT. CHEVETTE - EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - EVENING

           As she struggles to park, Paul snaps on the radio. 

                                 PAUL
                             (surfing through channels)
                        Should be listening to the radio... 
                        Figure out what the fuck’s going 
                        on.

                                 LESLIE
                        Be pretty funny if we found out 
                        they weren’t even looking for you 
                        guys.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. Hilarious.

           Paul stops at the first channel that gets reception.

                        ...Newt Gingrich addressed CPAC 
                        today...

           Leslie finally parks safely between two mobiles.

                             (on the radio)
                        How can you have the mess you have 
                        in New Orleans, and not have had 
                        deep investigations of the federal 
                        government, the state government, 
                        the city government, and the 
                        failure of citizenship in the Ninth 
                        Ward, where 22,000 people were so 
                        uneducated and so unprepared, they 
                        literally couldn't get out of the 
                        way of a hurricane. 

                                 LESLIE
                             (stunned)
                        He did not just blame us.

                             (on the radio)
                        And yet there’s no sense of, we 
                        should be changing these things. 
                        Not just accepting them, and not 
                        just complaining about them.

           Radio applause. Paul is absolutely speechless.

           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS: JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - EVENING

           Jayda digs around in her freezer and flops a bag of frozen 
           peas down on the table with a thud. She pulls out a chair.

                                 JAYDA
                        Sit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Stone holds the frozen peas firmly on his head and guzzles 
           down a 2 litre bottle of water. 

                                 JAYDA
                             (going to fridge)
                        Wanna beer, Stone?

                                 STONE
                        Thanks... You gonna call me Stone 
                        or Albert? What’s the verdict on 
                        that?
                                 JAYDA
                             (laughing)
                        “Drunk Jayda” likes to give people 
                        nick names. “Sober Jayda” will call 
                        you by your real name, Stone.

                                 STONE
                        So, who are tonight? 

                                 JAYDA
                        “Sober Jayda.”
                             (leaning into fridge for 
                              beer)
                        Soon to be drunk again.

           Stone tries not to stare at her perfect ass, back, and every 
           single curve of her, all the way down to her slender legs to 
           her sandaled feet-- Time for some awkward chit chat.

                                 STONE
                        I can’t believe you stole this. 
                             (looking up)
                        This thing even has sunroofs! 
                        Nobody noticed you here? Seriously?

           Jayda returns with a beer for Stone and another for herself. 

                                 JAYDA 
                        Told ya, nobody checks. Nobody 
                        cares... All the good trailers are 
                        tied up in the contract dispute 
                        thingy... But I’m happy. No 
                        neighbors for five miles.

           Stone is completely enamored by this girl.

           EXT. SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - NIGHT 

           Vann’s Humvee eases into the rear parking lot alongside a 
           couple of squad cars all in a row. The trailer park city 
           glows from a few miles away. 

           INT. POLICE STATION: AUTOPSY LAB - NIGHT 

           Vann and a skinny bald FORENSICS WORKER, fifties, walk past a 
           series of cold concrete rooms as they snake through various 
           fluorescent kindled hallways. 

                                 FORENSICS
                        Heard you’ve had a tough night.
                                 VANN
                        You kidding? Been an easy night. 
                        They’ll be wheeling in our first 
                        suspect any second now. 

           They chuckle at their black humor and carry on through the 
           web of passageways.

           Finally, they stop at the sudden sight of the Captain 
           Bowman’s body strewn out on a steel examining table.

                                 VANN (CONT'D)
                        Alright then. Enlighten me.

                                 FORENSICS
                             (gesturing towards body)
                        So far? I can see it was a single 
                        stab wound in the front chest. Hit 
                        him directly in the heart. An 
                        eighth of an inch either way, he'd 
                        have survived. 
                             (illustrating sideways 
                              stabbing motion)
                        The shape of the victim’s wound 
                        insinuates that the suspect was 
                        stabbing from the side, but the 
                        fact that the victim’s also got 
                        blade contusions all across the 
                        backs of his arms are, to me, very 
                        clear signs that--

                                 VANN
                        The Captain had his attacker in a 
                        reverse choke hold.

                                 FORENSICS
                             (nodding “yes”)
                        That’s right. 

                                 VANN
                        Unarmed combat 101... 
                             (re: stab wound)
                        So was this the result of self 
                        defence?

                                 FORENSICS
                        I don’t know which came first, the 
                        choke hold or the knife, but I do 
                        know that the suspect was more than 
                        likely being choked to death when 
                        he stabbed Captain Bowman.
                                 VANN
                        OK, is there any physical evidence 
                        from the suspects?

                                 FORENSICS
                        I haven’t found anything yet. No 
                        blood. No nothing.

           A BEEPER cuts in. Vann checks his beeper. Not his.

                                 VANN 
                        That yours?

                                 FORENSICS
                        No. Not mine. 
                             (points at the body)
                        It’s his.

           Vann looks at the Forensics guy like he’s kidding, and then 
           dashes to the beeper sitting on a nearby cart containing all 
           of Bowman’s belongings.

           THE BEEPER READS: CALL ME! 911- IT'S CHRISTIE! 545-5659

                                 VANN
                             (shocked)
                        Christie? 

                                 FORENSICS
                        What’s wrong?

                                 VANN
                        You sure this isn’t somebody else’s 
                        beeper?

                                 FORENSICS
                        Absolutely positive. Why?

           Vann’s eyes leave don’t leave the beeper-- his face is tense.

           Leslie watches Paul devour a can of Zoodles. The radio plays 
           overzealous synthesizer music before the news.

           For a tense moment nobody moves. Then Paul launches a mean 
           right hook into the radio, killing it. The Zoodles can

           is shaking violently under the weight of a barrage of punches 
           and elbows, all smashing into the radio and dashboard in a 
           tantrum of hurt.

           Lisa, on a portable phone with Beek, timidly stares down at 
           FIVE BIG BLUE BINS OF RICE in her closet in a daze.

                                 LISA
                             (confused)

                                 DEPUTY BEEK (V.O.)
                        I have two bins of flour too.

                        Under the trap door I installed in 
                        the kitchen floor.

           Lisa walks into the kitchen, crouches down, and discovers a 
           secret trap door built into the floor tile. She opens finds 
           the latch, opens the door, and sees two bins of flour under 
           the house.

                                 LISA
                        Baby, you’re freaking me out a

                        reward? I was a witness at Happy

           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS: JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - EVENING

           Jayda grabs a pile of records, and flops herself into a 
           yellow bean bag chair beside a vintage record player. 

                                 STONE
                        You got running water... Power!

                                 JAYDA
                        And I even gotta phone line.

                                 STONE
                        No. Now you’ve gone too far. I 
                        don’t believe you.
                                 JAYDA
                        All trues. No lies.

                                 STONE
                        So, do your mom and dad know about 
                        this place?

                                 JAYDA
                        Yeah. They’re hilarious about it. 
                        They love that I stole a FEMA 
                        trailer, but they refuse to step 
                        foot in it. 

           Putting on an Ani Difranco record, Jayda kicks her feet back 
           and her sandals fly off into the middle of the floor.

                                 STONE
                        I am mesmerized by your madness. 

                                 JAYDA
                        I put a spell on you? I tend to do 
                        that.

                                 STONE
                             (laughing)
                        I think you did...

           Jayda is back at Stone’s side in time to take hold of the icy 
           bag. 

                                 JAYDA
                        So you gonna tell me what happened 
                        to you today?

                                 STONE
                        Honestly, it’s no big deal. Just... 
                        It’s nothing.

           She brushes some dried mud off his shoulder. The needle hits 
           the record as:

                                 JAYDA (CONT'D)
                        You’re not going out with me when 
                        you’re this filthy, Sugar.

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER: BATHROOM - LATER

           Stone showers in the tiny bathroom. A foggy shower curtain is 
           all that separates him from Jayda, who is just barely visible 
           through the seventies style floral print, as she tries on 
           various outfits in front of the bathroom mirror.
                                 JAYDA
                        So where are we going tonight? 
                        Anywhere special?

                                 STONE
                        Um, solid question... I’ll get back 
                        to you.

           Through the curtain, Stone watches the vague silhouette of 
           Jayda. Her back to the shower, she drops her Jean shorts to 
           her ankles, rips off her white tank top, and slips into a 
           quaint little sundress. He smiles.

                                 STONE (CONT'D)
                             (joking)
                        You know I usually don’t shower 
                        until after I sleep with a girl, 
                        Jayda... 

           She glimpses devilishly towards the curtain.

                                 JAYDA 
                        Oh, reallllly? 

                                 STONE
                        Yup. Yup, I--

           Jayda tears open the shower curtain. Stone attempts to cover 
           himself as he sees Jayda standing there in the summer dress 
           that compliments her every curve.

                                 STONE (CONT'D)
                        Whoa! Jesus!

                                 JAYDA
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 STONE
                        Um... OK?

                                 JAYDA 
                        Wouldn't it be fun to do an entire 
                        date backwards? I mean, it starts 
                        with a shower, instead of ending 
                        with one. And then you get to score 
                        with me without the petty games 
                        designed for people with no self 
                        esteem. And then maybe we play the 
                        petty games, just to say we did. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAYDA  (cont'd)
                        And, then, if I’m lucky, you tell 
                        me your last name, and what you’re 
                        doing with your life, and what your 
                        astrological sign is, and I’ll act 
                        like I give a fuck. And all the 
                        boring bull shit will come last. 
                        All the fireworks will come first. 
                        The way I think it should be. All 
                        backwards. Wouldn't that be cool, 
                        Stone?

           A beat.

                                 STONE
                             (blown away)
                        Yes, it most certainly would. 

           Jayda climbs into the shower, still dressed in her summer 
           dress, and hits Stone with a hot blooded kiss as she pulls 
           the curtain half closed behind her. Stone pulls her dress up 
           over her head.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. JAYDA'S STOLEN TRAILER: BATHROOM - EVENING

           Stone showers in the tiny bathroom. The previous sequence is 
           revealed as a fantasy. 

           Indeed, a foggy shower curtain is all that separates him from 
           Jayda, who is just barely visible through the seventies style 
           floral print, as she tries on various outfits in front of the 
           bathroom mirror, but Stone’s wit is a little less piercing 
           than his fantasy.

                                 STONE (CONT'D)
                             (mumbling)
                        You know I usually don’t shower 
                        until after... Um...

                                 JAYDA
                        What’s that?

                                 STONE
                        Nothing.

           EXT. CHEVETTE - EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - NIGHT

           The radio and plastic vents are in several pieces scattered 
           around the Chevette. It looks like a bomb’s hit the 
           dashboard. 
           Paul, in tears, sits in a heap on the dusty old parking 
           barrier in front of the car. Leslie rubs his back and rests 
           her head on his big shoulder. 

           INT. JAYDA'S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT 

           Stone’s clothes tumble around and around in the dryer across 
           the room. Stone lounges beneath a navy blanket covered in 
           stars and moons. Jayda climbs in beside him.

           They’re looking through some photographs of India, half-
           watching The Wizard of Oz on a tiny TV in the b.g. 

                                 JAYDA
                        The best people I met there were 
                        the monkeys...

                                 STONE
                        Aren’t monkeys like pests in India?

                                 JAYDA
                        Oh, on the contrary! You know that 
                        when the sun rises in a city there, 
                        the streets are filled with 
                        monkeys? Monkeys everywhere. And 
                        you know what they’re doing? 

                                 STONE
                        Um- Being pests?

                                 JAYDA
                             (playfully whacks him)
                        No. They’re cuddling. They cuddle 
                        with each other just for the sake 
                        of each other. No other reason. 
                        There’s no selfishness involved. 
                        It’s really amazing.

                                 STONE
                        That is kinda amazing, I guess. Did 
                        you take any pictures?

                                 JAYDA
                        No... Some things aren’t meant to 
                        be photographed, ya know?

           Stone and Jayda make long eye contact...

                                 STONE
                        Why are you single, Jayda? 
                                 JAYDA
                        After Katrina... I... I don’t 
                        know...

           And Stone finally gets his kiss.

           EXT. VANN FAMILY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Vann drags himself up the steps of his beautiful three story 
           house. White picket fence. Large and well kept lawn. 
           Beautiful gardens. Perfect.

           INT. VANN FAMILY HOUSE: KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Vann sits down across from his daughter Christie, still in 
           her PJs who hides behind her knees up at her chest, her arms 
           wrapped around her legs. 

                                 CHRISTIE
                        I refuse to talk to you about 
                        anything in front of mom. I’m 
                        pretty sure she has no soul.

           Faye obsessively wraps up the undecorated birthday cake 
           sitting on the counter.

                        He finally comes home to see his 
                        family when his daughter’s part of 
                        a murder investigation... Nice to 
                        see ya, John!

                                 VANN
                             (to Faye)
                        Can I talk to Christie a moment?

                                 FAYE
                        No you can’t. It’s my house and you 
                        can talk to her in front of me!

                                 CHRISTIE
                        Mom, just go!

                                 FAYE
                        You don’t tell me when to leave and 
                        when to stay. I tell you.

           Christie SLAMS down her mug. 
                                 CHRISTIE
                        OK, mom. You wanna know what 
                        happened?! I fucked the army guy 
                        that got murdered today- 

                                 VANN
                        Christie.

                                 CHRISTIE
                        And he probably got murdered 
                        because I fucked him!

           Faye is speechless. She storms out of the kitchen. A DOOR 
           SLAMS O.S.

                                 STONE
                        Don't get all angry!

                                 JIM
                        How many lives have to end before 
                        you decide enough is enough?

                                 STONE
                        You sound like such a reporter 
                        right now.

                                 JIM
                        I am a reporter.

                                 STONE
                        Well then you should wanna hear 
                        both sides. 

                                 JIM
                        Where are you?
                                 STONE
                        In the abandoned section by the 
                        water tower. We need a-

                                 JIM 
                        Hold on. Hold on a moment. 

           He covers the mouthpiece and watches his COMPUTER SCREEN. The 
           poker dealer reveals his opponent’s cards.

                                 COMPUTER VOICE
                        Flush-- beats your-- pair of Kings. 
                        You lose!

                                 JIM
                        Shit, shit! Damn it all.

           This only adds to his wrath. He puts the phone back to his 
           ear in time to hear Stone say:

                                 STONE 
                        ...We need a lawyer.

           And Jim’s up and pacing like a lion in a cage, 

                                 JIM
                        Oh no! I’m not helping you with 
                        this one. The cash flow ends when 
                        you start committing crimes, bud.

                                 STONE
                        What?! You can’t even accept the 
                        remotest possibility that all this 
                        may not be our fault, can you?

                                 JIM
                        Even after what happened to Matty 
                        you’re still the most stubborn son 
                        of a-

                                 STONE
                        What does that mean? What happened 
                        to Matty?

                                 JIM
                             (hesitant)
                        Shit... You don’t know.

                                 STONE
                        What?!
                                 JIM
                        Well, Matty got himself shot. He’s 
                        dead... I’m sorry.

           And everything is different. 

                                 STONE
                        Who shot him?

                                 JIM
                        The National Guard.

           Stone is trying to keep his cool. Neither one of them says 
           anything for a moment.

                                 JIM (CONT'D)
                        Stone??

                                 STONE
                             (beat)
                        Jim.

                                 JIM (V.O.)
                        What?

                                 STONE
                        Go fuck yourself.

           He hangs up.

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Stone sits on the edge of the bed beside the phone and just 
           stares at the wall. 

           INT. JAYDA'S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT 

           On the couch, Jayda, in a tiny white shirt and cut-off Jean 
           shorts, stands on her knees and folds some clothes. 

           Stone emerges from the bedroom. 

                                 STONE
                        Something happened. I gotta go. 

                                 JAYDA
                        Are you OK? What happened?

                                 STONE
                        It’s easier if I tell you 
                        everything later.
           Jayda hands him his clean shirt and pants.

                                 JAYDA
                             (kidding around)
                        Just using me for my washing 
                        machine?

           EXT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT 

           Stone steps outside of Jayda’s trailer entrance. The door 
           shuts.  He stares at the door. He just can’t leave. He raises 
           his hand to knock, but stops himself. 

           The door flies open to reveal a very amused Jayda.

                                 JAYDA
                        Stalking me?

                                 STONE
                        I have no idea what I’m doing...

           Jayda grabs Stone, gives him a long kiss, then pushes him 
           away. She smiles and winks as she shuts the trailer door in 
           his face.

           Stone allows himself a slight smiles as he walks away from 
           the trailer, a different man than the one who walked in.

           INT. VANN FAMILY’S HOUSE: KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Fay can be heard O.S. BANGING around upstairs. Vann slides 
           his plate of cake across the table to Christie. She slides it 
           back. 

           On the stove, the kettle SLOWLY BOILS to a SCREAM.

                                 VANN 
                             (retrieves kettle)
                        I remember you were the neatest 
                        kid. You used to run around the 
                        house in a Supergirl costume. You 
                        remember that? You weren’t into 
                        Barbies, or tea sets. You wanted to 
                        save the world... I remember one 
                        time I made the unforgivable 
                        mistake of addressing ‘Supergirl’ 
                        as ‘Christie.’ You flew right into 
                        the kitchen and let me have it. 
                        ‘Christie’s not here right now, 
                        daddy! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VANN  (cont'd)
                        I’ll go see if I can find her!’ And 
                        you flew away... You never did find 
                        her.

           Vann smiles and pours an instant coffee. Christie rolls her 
           eyes, annoyed by the story.

                                 CHRISTIE
                        You can’t let anybody hurt Stone, 
                        dad. I’ll kill myself... This is my 
                        fault.

                                 VANN
                        It’s not your fault.

                                 CHRISTIE
                             (very upset)
                        Yes, it is.

                                 VANN
                        How did you end up dating a refugee 
                        kid?

                                 CHRISTIE
                        Believe it or not, they are human 
                        dad. They are dateable... And the 
                        politically correct term is 
                        evacuees. You should probably know 
                        that.

           Vann sits down beside her and looks her in the eye.

                                 VANN
                        Listen to me. I’m going to ask you 
                        again, do you have any idea where 
                        he might be? You have to tell me.

           Christie shakes her head “no” as Faye CLUNKS into the kitchen 
           with two packed suitcases.

                                 FAYE
                        C’mon Christie! Let’s go!

                                 CHRISTIE
                        I’m not going anywhere with you!

           Faye yanks Christie by the arm from the table.

                                 VANN
                             (stepping in)
                        Hon, what are you-
                                 FAYE
                        Get away from us!
                             (outraged)
                        You haven’t even been here for a 
                        year and now you want to act like 
                        some heroic father- 

                                 VANN
                        Faye-

                                 FAYE
                        Even when you’re home, you’re never 
                        here. 

                                 VANN 
                        Faye, I have been in a war fighting 
                        for our country. 

                                 FAYE
                        Spare me! Spare me the “I have been 
                        fighting for our country” crap!

           Vann stops. This is an impossible fight, and he knows it. He 
           looks at Christie.

                                 VANN
                        Go with your mother tonight.

                                 CHRISTIE
                        No!

                                 VANN
                        Yes, and we’ll talk about this in 
                        the morning, OK? We all just need 
                        to cool off tonight.

           Christie stares Vann dead in the eye, defeated.

                                 CHRISTIE
                        You don’t even care...

           Before Vann can even respond Christie is gone. 

           Vann just stares at his wife who is looking at him like this 
           is all to be expected and all his fault.

                                 VANN
                        Where can I call you?

                                 FAYE
                        You can’t... I’ll call you.

           And she is out the front door.
           INT. EILEEN’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Beek sits across from Eileen, seated at kitchen stool. He 
           gives her a blank look.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                             (pulling out note pad)
                        So what happened? Exactly?

                                 EILEEN
                        It’s just like I told you before.
                             (acting it out)
                        There was a big huge scrap between 
                        the three brothers and Captain 
                        Bowman...

           FLASHBACK HAPPY TOM’S IN SLOW MOTION - DAY

           Matty chases Bowman. He stops and heads back. Bowman swings 
           around and sneaks up behind Matty, and begins to give Matty a 
           few vicious punches to the head. 

                                 EILEEN (V.O.)
                             (simultaneous with action)
                        ...And then Matty pulls a knife and 
                        chases the Captain. Matty stops. 
                        Then the Captain turns around and 
                        gets him in this choke hold... and 
                        Matty’s panicking ‘cause he can’t 
                        breathe. His face is going purple 
                        and he’s swinging all over the 
                        place, and then he just stabs him. 

           He grabs Matty and puts him in a reverse choke hold, slowly 
           crushing his wind pipe. Suffocating, Matty swings wild, 
           sideways, slicing into the backs of Bowman’s arms before his 
           six inch hunting knife lands right in Bowman’s heart. 

           Bowman falls to the ground, dead instantly. 

           BACK TO THE SCENE

                                 EILEEN
                        His brothers weren’t even near him 
                        when it happened.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                             (making notes)
                        So, why are you only coming forward 
                        when there’s a reward being 
                        offered?

                             (very strongly)
                        What are you talking about? I told 
                        you all this before at Happy Tom’s 
                        yesterday! Remember?!

                             (mystified)
                        No... I’m sorry. Remind me.

                                 EILEEN
                        You didn’t listen. You just wanted 
                        to know what the boys looked like 
                        and which way they went and what 
                        kinda shirt they was wearin’, and-

                        Where are you from Eileen?

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                             (dismissive)
                        That’s what I thought... Would you 
                        have any reason to lie for these 
                        boys?

                                 EILEEN
                        What?! No! What kind of a thing is 
                        that to say?

           Deputy Beek just looks at her with skeptical disdain. His 
           cell phone rings. He answers.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Hello... 
                             (getting up)
                        What? Where did they say they were?

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT 

           Jayda lays on her back and listens to music on her retro head 
           phones. 

           INSERT OF TV: A FEMA spokesman shows a reporter around a 
           trailer.

                                 FEMA SPOKESMAN 
                             (on TV)
                                 (MORE)
                                 FEMA SPOKESMAN  (cont'd)
                        We’ve enacted a plan that will put 
                        every hurricane victim without a 
                        home inside one of these trailers. 
                        They’re state of the art...
                             (with a chuckle)
                        ...I would be surprised if they 
                        ever wanna leave.

               Every State Line by Ani Difranco drowns out the sound of the 
           television set in front of her. 

                                 ANI DIFRANCO (V.O.)
                             (singing)
                        ...he said, baby do you like to 
                        fool around? / baby, do you like to 
                        be touched? / I said, maybe some 
                        other time / fuck you very much...

           The song plays over the following scenes:

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT 

           Stone wanders-- The trailer park is a labyrinth. Every which-
           way leads to another which-way that may or may not lead to a 
           dead end clogged with trash and a few shady customers. 

           A hand scrawled sign hangs from a nearby mobile that reads 
           simply:

           OUR FATe IS YOUR FATe

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT 

           Deputy Beek and a few other Humvees drive as a group through 
           the narrow gravel roads, barely wide enough to fit a large 
           vehicle. The roads are haphazard, and zigzag throughout the 
           park before breaking into wide open planes, seemingly with no 
           rhyme, reason, or any sort of respect for the laws of 
           engineering. 

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - NIGHT

           At the forty-five yard line of the abandoned football field, 
           the shadows of the trees dance in the September breeze and 
           crash with Stone’s silhouette in the night light. 
                                 ANI DIFRANCO (V.O.)
                             (singing)
                        ...there’s a thousand shades of 
                        white / and a thousand shades of 
                        black / but the same rule always 
                        applies / smile pretty and watch 
                        your back...

           Stone crosses the field towards the Chevette in the distance. 

           The music ends. Stone gets into the car.

           INT. CHEVETTE - EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - MOMENTS LATER 

           Leslie, in the driver’s seat, waits beside Paul in the 
           passenger. Stone is sunken into the back.

                                 STONE
                        I just don’t want to talk about it, 
                        Leslie.

           Leslie is trying to achieve a Dr. Phil breakthrough.

                                 LESLIE
                        You know, you both did the same 
                        thing when your mother died. You 
                        never talk about anything. Paul 
                        smashes things, and cracks jokes 
                        forever, and Stone turns into a 
                        mute. It’s not healthy.

                                 PAUL
                        We can’t have a grief counselling 
                        session right now, OK? The bottom 
                        line is that we’re going to kill 
                        the guy who killed Matty.

                                 LESLIE
                        No you’re not.

                                 STONE
                        No we’re not, Paul.

           IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR: A pair of headlights climbs over the 
           cusp of the hill. 

                                 LESLIE
                        How was the date?
                                 STONE
                        Went from the best to the worst 
                        night of my life... She’s fucking 
                        amazing.

                                 LESLIE
                             (re: headlights in mirror)
                        Are those cars coming here?

           Another pair of headlights comes in from another direction, 
           but these headlights conspicuously vanish.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Did you see that?

                                 STONE
                        Yeah.

           And another pair of lights from another direction appears, 
           and again, vanishes.

                                 STONE
                             (looking back)
                        They’re trying to sneak up on us.

                                 LESLIE
                        No... No, no, they’re not. 

                                 STONE
                             (embarrassed)
                        I told Uncle Jim where we were... 
                        Shit! I can’t believe he did this.

                                 PAUL
                        I can’t believe you fucking told 
                        him where we were!

                                 STONE
                        It was before he said he wouldn’t 
                        help us. Shit.

           The cars are edging closer and closer.

                                 LESLIE
                        What should we do?

                                 PAUL
                        Go.
           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT

           Jayda cleans up around the trailer in a dance, grinning from 
           ear to ear. 

           She throws some dresses on the couch and ties back her thin 
           dreadlocks as the TV blares in the b.g.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (O.S.)
                        ...A massive manhunt is under way 
                        for at least two more suspects... 

           She glances at the TV, and the smile is wiped from her face 
           by the sudden imposition of a poor quality photo of Stone, 
           accompanied by his name and a “wanted” graphic flashing 
           ominously beneath. 

           INT. CHEVETTE - EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - NIGHT

           The four mystery vehicles wind towards them. The ignition key 
           is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life. 

           Leslie hesitates.

                                 LESLIE
                        Where are we going?

                                 PAUL
                        Anywhere.

                                 LESLIE
                        Well, you have to tell me where? 

                                 PAUL
                        Anywhere Leslie!

           Leslie THROWS the car into drive, and STOMPS on the gas 
           pedal. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Wait!

           The car TUMBLES in one large THUMP over top of a cement 
           parking barrier in front of them. Everything jerks to a halt.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:
           EXT. CHEVETTE - EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - SECONDS LATER

           The tiny Chevette balances on the parking barrier like a 
           teeter-totter, muffler dangling to the ground. 

           Paul, uses a large walking stick as leverage to inspect the 
           damage beneath the car. 

                                 PAUL
                        Yup. We’re fucked. 

           A SHADOWY VEHICLE surreptitiously moves through the trailers 
           towards them, very close.

           Leslie clasps her elbows around her ears in panic. Stone 
           ponders hard and then--

                                 STONE
                        I know where we can go. 

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - REAR GUTTERS- MOMENTS LATER

           Stone, Paul, and Leslie squeeze and splash down the middle of 
           a mucky and very narrow gutter between the back ends of two 
           long rows of trailers-- A no man’s land. Paul relies on a 
           tree branch walking stick, and drags his leg behind him. 

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - MOMENTS LATER

           A whirlwind of Humvees simultaneously pull onto the scene. 

           Deputy Beek leaps from his vehicle in a frenzy, shines his 
           flashlight on every trailer within eye shot, but it’s a hall 
           of mirrors. His suspects are long gone.

           They search everywhere. Every trailer is checked. 

           A couple of squad cars join the crowd. One car parks and 
           another secures the grounds with a spotlight search.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Check out back!

           TWO UNIFORMS take off running out back. They try to squeeze 
           into the gutters, but barely fit and abandon the idea.
           INT. HOLIDAY INN: FAYE AND CHRISTIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Through the windows a Jade-green hotel sign buzzes into the 
           night.

           We HEAR a key in the lock-- DOOR opens. 

           It is Faye with a brown paper bag filled with wine and 
           snacks. She sees her daughter is asleep in the bed across the 
           room.

           INT. SHOWER - FAYE

           Faye is under the water for a few moments before she half 
           opens her eyes... A weird intuition.

           She jumps out of the shower, throws on a robe and is out of 
           the bathroom.

           INT. HOLIDAY INN: FAYE AND CHRISTIE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Faye hurries to Christie’s bedside.

                                 FAYE
                             (urgently)
                        Christie... Christie? Sweetie?

           Christie does not respond.

           Faye rips the blankets off of Christie’s bed to reveal...

           BLOOD EVERYWHERE. Christie has cut her wrists. 

                                 FAYE
                             (trying to stop the 
                              bleeding with a sheet)
                        OH NO! CHRISTIE?!

           She grabs the phone, shaking, and dials 911.

                                 FAYE
                        Yes. My daughter’s tried to kill 
                        herself... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. VANN’S FAMILY HOUSE - DAY

           Vann hurries out to his Humvee in the driveway.
                                 VANN
                        How did you know they were there? 
                        Why am I finding out about this 
                        now?... 
                             (call waiting beeps)
                        Hold on... Hold on a second, Cal. 
                             (clicks to the other line)
                        Yeah... 
                             (very concerned)
                        What hospital?

           EXT. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Vann’s Humvee pulls up simultaneously with an ambulance. Vann 
           runs out and sees:

           CHRISTIE ON A STRETCHER

           Oxygen and life support on her calm face.

           Attendants rush at him and one or two try to hold him back. 
           Vann knocks them down like bowling pins and races into the 
           hospital.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. EMERGENCY CORRIDOR - SAME SCENE

           Faye catches up to Vann who is right beside his daughter as 
           she’s whisked down the hall.

                                 VANN
                             (to Christie)
                        Christie. I’m with you, baby... I 
                        love you. I love you.

           They make eye contact. Christie relaxes for second and is out 
           cold again. The paramedics start to pump her chest.

                                 ORDERLY
                        You have to wait in the waiting 
                        room. 

                                 VANN
                        It’s my daughter.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Sheriff, you know you can’t-

                                 VANN
                        Doc. Let me be with my daughter.
                                 DOCTOR
                        You gotta give us room, Sheriff.

           Christie’s face is pristine, her body fragile but strong... 
           In this moment she very much resembles the Virgin Mary.

           Helpless, Vann just stands in the middle of the hallway and 
           watches his daughter's stretcher disappear down the long 
           white corridor.

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - LATER

           A DOCTOR approaches Vann and Faye who are seated in the back 
           of the crowded waiting room.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mr. and Mrs. Vann?

                                 VANN
                        Yes.

                                 DOCTOR
                        You’re daughter's going to be OK. 
                             (Vann and Faye gasp in 
                              relief)
                        You are extremely lucky for two 
                        reasons: 1: That you found Christie 
                        in when you did, and 2: That she 
                        appears to have been extremely 
                        healthy before this. She will 
                        require a blood transfusion because 
                        her blood loss caused some 
                        hypovolemia, which can lead to 
                        what’s called retro-stress-
                        relaxation, and that is severe, but 
                        we were lucky enough to bring her 
                        back from that. We need to keep her 
                        for observation, of course, but I 
                        will let you know the second you 
                        can see her... OK?

                                 VANN
                             (nodding)
                        Thank you, Doctor.

           The doctor nods assuredly and heads back into emergency.

           Vann has his arm around Faye.  

           She leans back against him.
                                 VANN
                        You OK?

           She shrugs. Then she moves closer to him, pulls herself into 
           his shoulder... and she cries her heart out...

           EXT. - JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT

           Stone knocks lightly at Jayda’s door. The blue lights’ glow 
           kindles the three tired faces. 

                                 PAUL
                        This is three hundred yards from 
                        where we just were.

                                 STONE
                        So?

                                 PAUL
                        So we should have gone to my place.

                                 LESLIE
                        Our place.

                                 PAUL
                        Our place. That’s what I meant. 

                                 STONE
                        Your place might be a bit of an 
                        obvious secret hide out, don’t you 
                        think?

           The trailer lights slowly turn on one by one. 

           A few seconds pass before Jayda appears at the door, unlocks 
           it, and opens it. She does not look impressed.

                                 JAYDA 
                        We having a party?

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           Jayda emerges from a linen closet, and hands Stone a couple 
           of pillows, some bread, chips, and meat slices.

                                 JAYDA
                             (tired and annoyed)
                        Give these to Paul and Leslie too.

                                 STONE
                        I‘ll explain everything.
                                 JAYDA
                        Yeah, OK. I need a drink. Do you 
                        need a drink?

                                 STONE
                        Sure. Yeah.

           INT. JAYDA’ STOLEN TRAILER: BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Stone tosses some pillows to Leslie who has the bed already 
           perfectly made. 

           Paul pours some Tylenols down his throat as Stone hands him 
           the food and ice wrapped in elastic tied plastic bags.

                                 LESLIE
                        Does this poor girl have any idea 
                        what the hell is going on?

                                 STONE
                        I’m going to tell her.

           Paul removes the elastics and wears four of them like rings--
           He puts an ice pack on his leg.

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT

           Jayda has a bottle of vodka out on the counter and rolls a 
           joint beside a FANCY RED TIN of marijuana decorated with mock 
           golden arches, with the word marijuana written across, and 
           the slogan ‘Over 1 billion stoned’ underlining the logo.

           Stone spots a variety of children’s records on the counter 
           beside the tin. He picks one up. 

                                 STONE
                             (re: records)
                        Some classics.

           INSERT of vinyl: Three little Pigs, Little Red Riding Hood, 
           etc.

                                 JAYDA
                        Remnants of a pop culture junkie.

           He puts on a record. The needle lands, The Three Little Pigs 
           begins to play quietly.
                                 JAYDA
                        So, um, why does your brother have 
                        a splint made from a crucifix on 
                        his leg?

                                 STONE (CONT'D)
                        That’s a fair question. It is. He 
                        broke his leg in a backyard 
                        wrestling match and the splint... 
                        It’s... I have something that I 
                        have to tell you.

                                 JAYDA
                        And I’ll bet it’s damn good, 
                        considering you and your entire 
                        family showed up at 4 AM in need of 
                        a place to stay, for no discernible 
                        reason. 

                                 STONE
                        Yeah. It’s... It’s... It’s...

           Jayda lights her joint and exhales a deep blue cloud into the 
           cramped surroundings. 

                                 JAYDA
                        Breathe, Stone.

           Jayda pours Vodka shots into a pair of glasses.  She bumps 
           Stone as she sits down as close to him as possible and offers 
           Stone a toke before she butts it out.

                                 STONE
                        I don’t smoke. Thanks. 

                                 JAYDA
                        You going to tell me this century, 
                        what seems to be the trouble, 
                        bubbles?  

           Jayda downs her shot.

                                 JAYDA (CONT'D)
                        You don’t have to tell me. 

                                 STONE
                        I’m going to tell you.

           Jayda walks over to the bottle of Vodka and brings the entire 
           bottle back to her seat.
                                 JAYDA
                        OK. Can I ask you one thing, 
                        though?

                                 STONE
                        Of course. What?

                                 JAYDA
                        You have a wife, or kids, or 
                        something? Cancer? You a hit man?

                                 STONE
                        None of the above.

                                 JAYDA
                        You a registered sex offender, or 
                        something really weird like that?

                                 STONE
                             (disgusted)
                        Fuck no. Why would you ask me 
                        something like that?

                                 JAYDA
                        It was a joke. 

           Stone shoots back his shot and coughs as part of it goes down 
           the wrong way.

                                 JAYDA 
                        Well this sounds pretty huge, so 
                        I’ll let you get comfortable.

           Stone takes a breath as if he is about to speak, but stops 
           short.

                                 JAYDA (CONT'D)
                        Can I just ask you one other little 
                        thing, Stone?

                                 STONE
                        Yeah. 

           Jayda gets up and walks across the room, distancing herself.

                                 JAYDA
                        Does this have anything to do with 
                        that army guy you killed today? 

           Stone is dumbfounded.

                                 JAYDA (CONT'D)
                        Cat got your tongue?
                                 STONE
                        How long have you known?

                                 JAYDA
                        What difference does it make?

                                 STONE
                        Jayda, I was there, but I didn’t do 
                        it.

                                 JAYDA
                        Just quit lying to me.

                                 STONE
                        I’m not lying to you.

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER: BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Paul’s eyes are locked on a SUPER NINTENDO sitting by a TV at 
           the foot of the bed. Leslie is almost asleep when--

                                 PAUL
                        Fuck this. I can’t sleep.

           He gets out of bed and turns on the TV and Nintendo.

           INT.  JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT

           Stone pours himself yet another shot. Jayda smiles, keeping 
           her cool.

                                 JAYDA
                        You’re all over the news. 

                                 STONE
                        Why didn’t you say anything when we 
                        got here?

                                 JAYDA 
                        Why didn’t you say anything when 
                        you got here?

                                 STONE
                        I was scared to I guess.

           Jayda nods as if to say that is her answer too.

                                 STONE
                        I thought you weren’t afraid of 
                        anything.
                                 JAYDA
                        You didn’t think, if you thought 
                        that... Jesus, if you’re innocent, 
                        just say you’re innocent. Why did 
                        you even show up for our stupid 
                        little date in the first place?

                                 STONE
                        Because I didn’t do anything. I was 
                        there, yes, and I am going to turn 
                        myself in, yes, but I made the 
                        decision that I had to see you.

                                 JAYDA
                        Why?

                                 STONE
                        In case I never got another chance.

           Jayda doesn't answer right away. She’s digesting this.

                                 STONE 
                        Jayda, I-

           Jayda covers Stone’s mouth.

                                 JAYDA
                        I’m sorry about your brother. I 
                        really am... but I don’t feel the 
                        same way about you. And I think you 
                        should leave.

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT

           A weathered old American flag hangs from an empty trailer and 
           flutters in the wind as--

           Three Humvee and two police cruisers roll out of the edge of 
           the park. The leading Humvee stops. Sits-- And U-turns back 
           into the park. The line of vehicles follow.

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER: BEDROOM - NIGHT

           ON THE TV: Paul is the character Ryu, battling it out with 
           Colonel Guile. 

           He clicks away on the controller-- old game maneuvers are 
           instinct to him.
                                 PAUL
                        So some dude called you today, 
                        after he heard on the news that I 
                        was a wanted man? 

                                 LESLIE
                             (sitting up in the bed)
                        He just wants to help. He’s a 
                        really really nice guy.

                                 PAUL
                        Leslie, there is no such thing as a 
                        ‘really really nice guy.’ He’s just 
                        really really nicely trying to get 
                        in your pants.

           Paul wins the first round of Streetfighter with a sharp upper 
           cut.

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

           Vann and Faye sit. The Sheriff’s CELL PHONE RINGS.

                                 VANN
                             (into phone)
                        Yeah... Nobody move until I’m 
                        there...

           He hangs up. Faye looks at him. 

                                 FAYE
                             (understanding)
                        Go.

                                 VANN
                             (rubs her shoulder)
                        One of these boys knew Christie.

                                 FAYE
                        I know.

                                 VANN
                        I’m so sorry for everything.

                                 FAYE
                        So am I... 

           A hug and kiss good-bye. 

           As he’s rising--
                                 FAYE
                        Be careful... We’ll be here when 
                        you’re done... 

           Vann nods “OK.” It’s extremely hard for him to leave. He 
           turns and hurries out of the hospital.

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT

           Stone is sitting on the kitchen counter and Jayda is 
           standing, not fucking around. 

                                 JAYDA
                        Leave.

                                 STONE
                        No. I want to be around someone I 
                        care about right now.

                                 JAYDA
                        You don’t even know me.

                                 STONE
                        You wanna know how I know it’s real 
                        with you?

                                 JAYDA
                        No I don’t, to be honest. 

                                 STONE
                        Yes, you do.

                                 JAYDA
                        No, I don’t. 

           Jayda’s body language screams “fuck off.”

                                 STONE 
                        Every time I see you smile it 
                        instantly makes me happy, and I 
                        instantly want to protect you--

                                 JAYDA
                        How fucking original!

           Uneasy, the rest of her answer is lyrics from the song Modern 
               Romance by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
                                 JAYDA
                             (singing)
                        Don’t you know / It never lasts / 
                        This is no / There is no modern 
                        romance...

                                 STONE
                        Just listen to me! Ever since I 
                        came to this park, I have been 
                        caught in this angry feeling... I 
                        can barely function. I can barely 
                        eat. I can barely sleep. Every 
                        single thing I’ve ever cared about 
                        is gone, but when I was with you 
                        tonight you made me feel like 
                        everybody else.

                                 JAYDA
                        Stop.

                                 STONE
                        You make me feel normal again. 
                        Despite losing every single thing 
                        I’ve ever had, I feel just like 
                        everybody else when I’m with you...

           The last words appear to hit Jayda like a freight train.

                                 JAYDA
                             (almost whispering)
                        Stop it... 

                                 STONE (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 JAYDA
                        Save this stuff for somebody else. 

                                 STONE
                        I don’t feel it for somebody else.

           Jayda stares into Stone’s eyes for a few seconds. Her eyes 
           begin to fill with tears.

                                 JAYDA
                        Stone... 

                                 STONE
                        Yeah.

           A beat.
                                 JAYDA
                        Run.

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER: BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The Street Fighter match rages on. As round 2 begins--

                                 LESLIE
                             (tying ice bag closed)
                        I really miss Gracie. 

                                 PAUL
                        It’s only been five hours... 

                                 LESLIE
                             (grabbing the bag of ice)
                        I know... But, you know she never 
                        stops crying when you’re gone?

           Paul continues playing... Leslie come to the foot of the bed 
           and places a bag of ice on his leg.

                                 LESLIE
                        Keep this on your leg.

           INT. HUMVEE - EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - NIGHT

           Beek is in the passenger seat looking annoyed.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        We’re nowhere even close.

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        We’ve gotta be close. 
                             (spotting it)
                        Hold up! I see it.

           They spot Jayda’s brightly lit trailer on an adjoining road-- 

           The line of vehicles turn towards it.

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT

           Jayda walks to the other side of the trailer. She is keeping 
           as much space between her and Stone as possible.

                                 STONE
                             (laughing)
                        What do you mean, run?
                                 JAYDA
                        I mean you have to run. I called 
                        the police. I called them when you 
                        got here. 

                                 STONE
                        I don’t believe you. They would 
                        have been here by now.

                                 JAYDA
                        They just have to find the place.

                                 STONE
                        No. I don’t believe you. 

                                 JAYDA
                        You can’t risk not believing me!

                                 STONE
                             (starting to give 
                              credence)
                        You’re lying, right?

           Stone slides down the counter to the floor. A couple of vinyl 
           records catch his shirt and fall with him.

                                 STONE (CONT'D)
                        This is a really cruel joke. I mean-

                                 JAYDA
                        It’s not a joke. 

           Stone has an awkward smile of disbelief on his face.

                                 JAYDA (CONT'D)
                        I don’t even like you that much, so-

                                 STONE
                        Why are you saying all this?

                                 JAYDA
                        Because it’s true!

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - NIGHT

           Tearing around the empty trailer lot, Vann’s Humvee BEELINES 
           into the park towards water tower. 
           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER: BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Paul is lying on the bed, looking up at the sky through the 
           sunroof-- He braids together three elastics into a SMALL 
           RING, doing his best to hide it from Leslie, who is 
           readjusting his splint and tying on the ice pack on with a 
           pillow case.

                                 PAUL
                        I really love you, ya know?

                                 LESLIE
                        You’d better. 

                                 PAUL
                        How ‘bout we go to Vegas and make 
                        this thing official? 

                                 LESLIE
                             (not even looking)
                        Somebody popped way too many 
                        codeine pills today. 

                                 PAUL
                        Is that a “yes?”

           She stops and looks at him.

                                 LESLIE
                        No, it’s not a “yes.” It’s an 
                        acknowledgment of what is quite 
                        possibly the shittiest proposal in 
                        modern history... Where’s my ring? 
                        Do I even get a ring?

                                 PAUL
                        Maybe you do, maybe you-

           A Humvee door slams O.S.

                                 PAUL
                        You hear that?

           Leslie gets up and pulls open the curtains a little-- then 
           RIPS THEM CLOSED so fast they nearly come off the window.

                                 LESLIE
                        The fucking army’s out front!

           Paul falls out of bed, gets to his feet-- and begins to pull 
           a three drawer dresser under the skylight.
           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT

           Jayda tries to pull him up off of the floor from beside the 
           cupboards. He’s dead weight.

           Stone picks up a Three Little Pigs record cover from the 
           floor and stares at it.

                                 STONE
                        I can’t run anymore.

                        I don’t care if they come. I-

           Jayda tries to pull Stone to his feet with all her might. 
           He’s dead weight.

                                 JAYDA 
                        Go! This is stupid. They might kill 
                        you!

                                 STONE
                        You care. You wouldn’t want me to 
                        run if you didn’t.

                                 JAYDA
                        I’m not worth this!

                        We haven’t got some magical fucking  
                        connection. OK? OK?!

           Shuffling can be heard outside. Jayda smacks Stone’s face 
           extremely hard.

                                 JAYDA 
                        Wake up!

           Zayas, two specialists, and four privates follow behind 
           Thomas. They line up behind as Thomas mounts the first of the 
           trailer's front porch. 
           About eight DEPUTIES spread out in front, unable to access 
           the sides of the mobiles because the buildings are too close 
           together.

           EXT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT.

           Beek and Vann have slipped out of the their cars, and wait 
           behind them, watching keenly as--

           Thomas pulls the MP-4 Assault Rifle to his right side, 
           reaches out and knocks loudly with his left hand...

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Paul, balancing on one foot, tries with all his might to get 
           the sunroof open but he doesn’t have the leverage. It’s 
           sealed shut.

           Leslie screams out to Stone:

                                 LESLIE
                        Stone! WE GOTTA GO. 

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT

           The DOOR RATTLES under a heavy knock. Jayda again, tries to 
           pull him up off the floor. Stone won’t move a muscle. 

                                 LESLIE (O.S.)
                        C’MON GUYS.

                                 JAYDA 
                        Your brother’s in there! Go! Go!

           Stone shakes his head “no.”

           EXT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT

           A Private yanks a 12 lb. sledgehammer from the Humvee and 
           hurries towards the trailer...

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT

           Jayda hits Stone with a flurry of punches and smacks across 
           his head and shoulders and accidentally knocks the volume of 
           the stereo WAY UP. 
           Stone manages to block a couple, but the hits that do land 
           don’t budge him an inch.

                                 JAYDA 
                        Run! Run! Run, will you, ya idiot?! 

           Jayda is nearly in tears. 

           The trailer DOOR RATTLES a second time with knocking.

                                 JAYDA (CONT'D)
                        RUNNNNNN-

           THE DOOR CRASHING IN cuts through Jayda’s scream.

           EXT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT

           The door, half off its hinges, gives in to the second swing 
           of the sledgehammer and DROPS TO THE FLOOR. 

           Vann and Deputy Beek race towards the trailer, guns up...

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - NIGHT

           The squad is inside. Everybody aims their guns. 

           The trailer appears empty. 

               Who’s Afraid of The Big Bad Wolf plays loudly:

                        and you’ll be sorry, when the wolf

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           As quick as the Flash, Jayda grabs a BROKEN OFF SUNROOF LEVER 
           from a DRAWER, hops up on the TABLE, and CRANKS the sunroof 
           WIDE OPEN, all within seconds.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           INT. / EXT. JAYDA’S TRAILER - BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Jayda and Leslie, on the roof, tug Paul up through the 
           sunroof. Stone boosts him up from underneath.
           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Zayas, M16 out front of him, shuffles heel to toe down the 
           hall towards the CLOSED DOOR. Thomas is right behind.

           Zayas boots down the door.

           INT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - BEDROOM - SAME SCENE

           It’s empty.... Just an unmade bed.

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        Magic mother fuckers.

           The stereo blares:

                                 THREE LITTLE PIGS SONG (V.O.)
                        Who’s afraid of the big bad wolf / 
                        big bad wolf, big bad wolf? / Who’s 
                        afraid of the big bad wolf?

           Everyone aims there guns, rabidly searching.

           Vann and Beek arrive inside. 

           Vann looks up at the ceiling. The sunroof is wide open-- He 
           looks down-- A three drawer dresser directly beneath.

                                 VANN 
                        Since when do these things have 
                        sunroofs?

           As the Deputy searches all around--

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        This is a family unit. It’s not 
                        even legal to live in this thing.

                                 VANN
                             (dumbfounded)
                        Does that mean that nobody covered 
                        the roof?

           Silence.

                                 VANN (CONT'D)
                             (harsher)
                        Sergeant Zayas, does that mean that 
                        nobody covered the fucking roof?

           A bunch of embarrassed heads hang. 
                                 VANN (CONT'D)
                        Well, get the fuck up on the roof 
                        then!

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - ROOFTOPS - SECONDS LATER

           Stone, Jayda, and Leslie’s silhouettes scurry across the 
           rooftops towards the vast scarlet sky. 

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - GUTTERS - CONTINUOUS

           The four of them slide off a roof into a rear gutter-- Paul 
           slips in the mud behind them. Leslie desperately tries to 
           yank Paul to his feet by his left arm. 

                                 PAUL
                        I’ll catch up. I’m hurt-

                                 LESLIE
                        If you think I’m leaving here 
                        without you, you’re fucking crazy!

           Jayda scrambles to help. They get Paul up.

           Footsteps and shouts of their pursuers rain down from the 
           rooftops and alleyways in the distance. 

                                 STONE (CONT'D)
                        We gotta get inside one of these 
                        trailers. 
                             (his fingers count)
                        Ready? One. Two. Three...

           They DART around the corner onto the roadway into the waiting 
           arms of...

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - NIGHT

           Two more MILITARY VEHICLES tearing into the park. 

           In a split second Stone swings to the right, uses his key. 
           The key WORKS. A miracle.

           He ROCKETS through the door of the trailer-- Jayda follows 
           and helps Leslie pull Paul in as-- 

           One MILITARY DRIVER looks over, just missing them. 
           INT. / EXT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - ROOF - NIGHT

           A SOLDIER hoists himself up through the skylight onto the 
           rooftop, gun aimed in front. 

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                             (getting off phone)
                        Second squad’s here. Third’s on its 
                        way.

           EXT. JAYDA’S STOLEN TRAILER - ROOF - NIGHT

           A ladder SMACKS the side of the trailer and three more 
           SOLDIERS climb up from the outside of the trailer. 

           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - NIGHT

           Everyone is dispersed around the trailer, looking out windows 
           and drawing blinds. 

           Paul collapses onto the couch, clutching his leg. 

                                 LESLIE
                        Why are we running? This is stupid!

                                 STONE
                             (frustrated)
                        Do you even remember what happened 
                        to Matty a few hours ago, Leslie? 
                        I’m not going near those guys.

                                 LESLIE
                        So you’re just going to run for the 
                        rest of your life?!

                                 STONE
                        I don’t know... I haven’t thought 
                        that far ahead. 

                                 PAUL
                             (choking down a fistful of 
                              Tylenols)
                        How did the police know where we 
                        were?

                                 STONE
                        Who the fuck knows? 

           A beat.
                                 JAYDA
                        I do.

                                 PAUL
                        What do you mean, you know? 

           Silence.

                                 LESLIE
                             (to Jayda)
                        Did you call?

                                 STONE
                        No, she didn’t fucking call.

                                 JAYDA
                        Yes, I did... I called. 

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - NIGHT

           Draped over the hood of a Humvee, Sheriff Vann is looking at 
           a TRAILER PARK MAP with Sergeant Zayas and his squad. Deputy 
           Beek approaches.

                                 VANN 
                             (to Zayas)
                        Take your squad and search every 
                        trailer in this section. If and 
                        when you find them, do not fire. 
                        Set up a perimeter and wait for me. 
                        I do not want another dead body, 
                        Sergeant. Understand?

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        Yes-

                                 VANN
                        I need you to make sure all the 
                        squads that just arrived understand 
                        that. I want these guys brought in 
                        alive, or it’s your badges, or your 
                        military careers, or whatever else 
                        you motherfuckers have to spare. 

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        Yessir.

           Zayas salutes before him and his squad move.

                                 VANN
                        Deputy, anything else?
                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        No, sir.

           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - NIGHT

           Jayda stares out the window across the room and addresses the 
           first hints of a rising sun as if they were her only friend.

                                 STONE
                        You don’t owe us this-

                                 JAYDA
                        Yes, I do.

                                 PAUL
                        Yes, she does.

                                 LESLIE
                        She could have left us, Paul- but 
                        she’s the one who got the sunroof 
                        open.

                                 JAYDA
                        When I called I was just doing what 
                        I thought was right.

                                 PAUL
                        Well, why isn’t it “right” 
                        anymore?!

                                 JAYDA
                        Because of what Stone said to me... 
                        I just believe him. It’s hard to 
                        explain, but-

                                 PAUL
                        But you didn’t believe him two 
                        hours ago?

                                 JAYDA
                        No.

           Paul scoffs.

                                 STONE
                        Jayda. Leave. 

                                 JAYDA
                        No.

                                 STONE
                        I’m not saying this to-
                                 LESLIE
                        So what if she was scared? I woulda 
                        been freaked out too!

                                 STONE
                        I’m not saying this to punish 
                        her... You shouldn’t be with us 
                        either, Leslie. 

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT

           The veins of the trailer city are congesting with waves of 
           EMERGENCY VEHICLES, SOLDIERS and JEEPS.

           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - NIGHT

           Leslie is giving Stone a look like she is trying to make him 
           spontaneously combust with her mind.

                                 LESLIE
                             (seeing red)
                        And just who the fuck do you think 
                        you are now?!

           Sounds of soldiers and Deputies TEARING APART THE PARK O.S.

                                 STONE
                             (trying to get Paul on 
                              board)
                        They’re going to kick down every 
                        door in this trailer park... They 
                        only want you and me, bro.

           A beat.

                                 PAUL
                        Let me talk to my girlfriend.

           BATHROOM 

           Stone enters the bathroom. He tries to shut the door, but 
           Jayda stops him, and follows him in. 

                                 JAYDA
                        How is it that you and me spend so 
                        much time in the can together? 

           Stone won’t even humor Jayda with eye contact. A few shafts 
           of morning light creep in through the bathroom blinds.
                                 JAYDA (CONT'D)
                        What would you have done a day ago, 
                        if a bunch of suspected murderers 
                        showed up at your house in the 
                        middle of the night? You would have 
                        freaked the fuck out, is what you 
                        would have done because that’s what 
                        any normal person would do.

           Stone thinks. She’s right. He finally looks at her and nods 
           as she breaks down.

                                 JAYDA
                             (overcome with emotion)
                        I just want to go home... 

                                 STONE
                        We will.

           Stone hugs her... 

           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - DAWN

           Leslie sits on the couch beside Paul, whose injuries have 
           rendered him a little inarticulate.

                                 LESLIE
                        You can’t just go making my 
                        decisions for me.

                                 PAUL
                        We have a baby now... That’s what 
                        makes the decisions, I think...

                                 LESLIE 
                        I can’t just leave you now. 

           Leslie is getting very upset. She knows he’s right. Paul 
           sifts through his pockets for something.

                                 PAUL
                        Hold out your hand... Other hand.

           In his hand, Paul is holding a RAINBOW COLORED ENGAGEMENT 
           RING that he has meticulously braided out of three elastics: 
           One red. One blue. And one green.

           He puts it on her ring finger.  

                                 LESLIE 
                             (very happy)
                        Ohhh... You’re such a nerd.
           Leslie can’t wipe the smile off her tear stained face.

                                 LESLIE
                        How long did it take you to make 
                        this?

                                 PAUL
                        Like a long time... Three minutes.

                                 LESLIE
                             (satisfied)
                        My engagement ring.

                                 PAUL
                        ‘Til we get to Vegas. 

           Leslie grabs him and pulls him close, kissing him so 
           passionately that Paul nearly falls right off the couch.  

                                 LESLIE
                        You’re gonna call me when you turn 
                        yourself in?  

           Paul nods “yes.”

                                 LESLIE
                        Promise?

                                 PAUL
                        I promise.

           They both look over at the CLOSED BATHROOM DOOR.

                                 LESLIE
                        I should wait for Jayda.

           A BANGING can be heard off in the distance O.S.

                                 PAUL
                        You just need to go.

           EXT. TRAILER - DAWN

           Right outside the door, A PRIVATE waits a couple of beats 
           before he BOOTS DOWN THE DOOR with one kick. 

           Like clockwork six squad members rush inside, guns up, lights 
           flash all around the interior. 

                                 CORPORAL THOMAS (O.S.)
                        HANDS UP! HANDS UP!
           Zayas remains on the exterior covering the front door waiting 
           for their squad. 

           Zayas’s M16 locked... Petrified voices O.S.

                                 CORPORAL THOMAS (O.S.)
                        Just some fuckin’ squatters. Ain’t 
                        them. 

           Two beaten up looking HOMELESS MEN, mid sixties, and one 
           WOMAN, fifties, hurry out of the trailer.

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - DAWN

           A DEPUTY, early twenties, approaches the Sheriff and hands 
           him a cell phone.

                                 UNIFORM 
                             (re: cell phone)
                        You better take this...

           The Sheriff nods, takes the cell and heads for his vehicle.

                                 VANN
                             (into phone)
                        This is Sheriff Vann

           As Beek watches Vann head towards his Humvee he looks off 
           into the distance and just happens to briefly spot Leslie 
           walking through some trailers. He looks around for somebody-- 
           Everybody is gone-- He is standing by himself. 

           M16 up, he hurries towards where he spotted Leslie.

           INT. EILEEN’S HOUSE - DAWN

           The TV NEWS is on in the b.g. Eileen, waiting on the phone, 
           is buttoning up her Happy Tom’s uniform getting ready for 
           work. 

           Her name tag reads: HAPPY EILEEN

                                 EILEEN (V.O.)
                        Hi Sheriff! This is Eileen 
                        Bartlett!

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:
           INT. VANN’S HUMVEE - DAWN

           Vann climbs into the front seat of his Humvee to escape the 
           clatter.

                                 VANN
                        How can I help you this mornin’, 
                        Eileen?

                                 EILEEN (V.O.)
                        Yes, well, I got up for the early 
                        shift this morning and the news is 
                        still saying that Stone and Paul 
                        Green killed this National 
                        Guardsmen, um, Kenneth Bowman, or 
                        whatever, at the grocery store 
                        yesterday... 

                                 VANN
                        Uh-huh.

                                 EILEEN (V.O.) 
                        And, anyway I was there and they 
                        didn’t kill nobody.

           And suddenly Vann has the look of a man who just lost his 
           life savings at a roulette table.

                                 VANN
                        Eileen, why on earth didn’t you 
                        tell anybody yesterday?!

                                 EILEEN (V.O.)
                        I did, Sheriff! Twice! I told 
                        Deputy Beek. Like a bird’s Beek. 
                        Such a weird name... He must have 
                        forgot to tell you, or something, 
                        or the news is just reporting it 
                        wrong... or he didn’t believe me.

                                 VANN
                        That piece of shit.

           INT.  EILEEN’S HOUSE - DAWN

           Eileen frowns.

                                 VANN (V.O.)
                        I need you to take the day off and 
                        go to the police station. 
                                 EILEEN 
                        Oh cool! Well, I won’t argue with a 
                        day off, Sheriff! Should I dress 
                        good?

                                 VANN (V.O.)
                        Just wear whatever is on your back 
                        and get down there.

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Leslie wanders a few seconds from the trailer when her glance 
           meets Deputy Beek’s BOOTS and ASSAULT RIFLE stepping into her 
           path. 

           She smiles shyly up at him.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                             (looking her up and down)
                        Can I ask you what you’re doing out 
                        here?

           Leslie slowly walks backwards as she speaks. 

                                 LESLIE
                        I’m just going for a walk. 

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Got any ID?

           She stops.

                                 LESLIE
                        Course.

           Leslie hands Beek her FAKE ID. He looks it over. We can hear 
           the COMMOTION OF ZAYAS’S squad searching a trailer nearby. 

           He hands her ID back.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK 
                        First off, Juanita, this is an off 
                        limits site. 

                                 LESLIE
                        Really? Sorry.

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        We’re looking for some dangerous 
                        people and I wouldn’t want to see 
                        you get hurt. OK?
                                 LESLIE
                        OK. Sorry... I’m leaving.

           Leslie nods graciously, turns, and disappears into the 
           direction from whence she came. 

           Beek heads back to the squad... He stops. It hits him. 

           He turns and jogs back after Leslie.

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - GUTTERS - CONTINUOUS

           He hits a pair of forking paths between the trailers. Leslie 
           could have gone left or right. 

           He thinks... and then goes right.

           INT. / EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

           Stone and Jayda emerge from the bathroom. Stone takes Jayda’s 
           hand and leads her past Paul. She stops at the door.

                                 STONE
                        It’s impossible to know what to 
                        say. 

                                 JAYDA
                             (very upset)
                        And that is the perfect thing to 
                        say: “It’s impossible to know what 
                        to say,” is probably the most 
                        perfect thing anybody’s ever said 
                        to me... 

           She looks at him for one last moment, takes a deep breath and 
           opens the door to reveal--

           Deputy Beek-- startled by the door, swings his M16 up at 
           Stone and PULL THE TRIGGER...

           CLICK. But the damn thing is jammed. 

           Beek cannot believe he just pulled the trigger. Neither can 
           anybody else.

           Beek shakes the JAMMED BULLET LOOSE.

           Jayda lunges at Beek like a woman possessed. 

           They begin to wrestle for the gun. Jayda is surprisingly 
           feisty.
           He uses the rifle to toss her back into the trailer, she goes 
           flying, but she does not let go of the gun. 

           Stone throws all of himself into the scrap and grabs a piece 
           of the gun’s barrel in an attempt to pull the weapon away.

           But Beek is still winning this tug of war. 

           Paul flops off the couch onto his stomach and DRAGS HIMSELF 
           up the side of the couch to his feet. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - DAWN

           SQUAD CARS and MILITARY VEHICLES continue to flood into the 
           park from all directions like angry waters breaking over a 
           dam. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - DAWN

           The muzzle dances back and forth, taking aim from the walls 
           to the ceiling. The duo is having a tough time.

           As fast as he can, Paul pulls himself up the side of an 
           armchair and hops up onto his left foot.

           The pile of people that is Jayda, Stone and Beek comes 
           tornadoing towards the middle of the trailer.

           The second Paul is close enough to leap into the fight he 
           dives in. He gives Deputy Beek FOUR really solid uppercuts to 
           the chin... He’s hurt. 

           Now Paul manages to get a really good grip on the gun’s 
           handle and they all heave at the rifle with everything they 
           have.

           Beek is losing his weapon, his finger on the trigger. 
           Slipping away. Slipping away... Slipping... Until...

           Paul’s CHEST SUDDENLY EXPLODES behind the sudden thunder of a 
           GUN SHOT.

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAWN

           The intense blood red Louisiana sun breaks over the horizon 
           and floods the trailer park. 
           From high above it all looks like a pulsing maze, personnel 
           everywhere..

           SERGEANT ZAYAS’S SQUAD hears the shot and all hurry back 
           towards the scene.

           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - DAWN

           Paul, bleeding badly but still breathing, is down on the 
           floor. 

           Stone and Jayda continue to desperately wrestle with Beek 
           until the gun breaks free. Beek crashes into the door. Stone 
           flies backwards onto the couch, and Jayda has come up the gun 
           in her hands. 

           Nervous and shaking terribly from what must be pure 
           adrenaline she points the gun at Beek’s surprised face.

           Jayda FIRES... And doesn’t come within three feet of him.

           Deputy Beek goes running right out the front door. 

           INT. / EXT. VANN’S HUMVEE - DAWN

           Vann looks around at all the soldiers frantically yelling to 
           each other. 

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS (V.O.)
                             (police radio)
                        Suspect down inside, uh, building 
                        185 27th Section, West! Three more-

           As he’s getting out of his Humvee--

                                 VANN
                             (into walkie)
                        Set up a perimeter. Do not fire. 
                        Repeat. Do not fire.

           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - DAWN

           The COMMOTION OF VEHICLES AND VOICES OUTSIDE is growing.

           Paul is strewn out in front of the couch. His chest moves up 
           and down. He’s still alive. His eyes just stare.

                                 JAYDA
                             (hysterical)
                        Shit!
                                 STONE
                        You OK?

           Jayda is about to lose her mind-- Stone is calm. Too calm.

                                 STONE
                             (to Jayda)
                        Stay on the floor.

           On his knees, Stone drags Paul away from the window towards 
           the back of the trailer. 

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - DAWN

           A line of shielded soldiers and a loudspeaker are setting up 
           outside the front of the mobile. Vann arrives on scene.

           INT.  EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - DAWN

           Stone kneels PICKS UP THE M16. 

                                 NATIONAL GUARD (O.S.)
                             (over loudspeaker)
                        We want you to be OK, so come on 
                        out-- If you don’t come out, we 
                        will come in and it will get a lot 
                        more intense...

           Jayda watches Stone cock the M16. He knows his way around a 
           gun.

                                 JAYDA
                             (in tears)
                        Stone... Don’t... Don’t... 

           In this moment we see that Stone is a completely different 
           person. A fire in his eyes and a calm in his voice that is 
           signature of anyone with nothing left to lose.

                                 STONE
                        No matter what: Stay with him. 

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - DAWN

           On the horizon, a freight train winds towards them. Vann 
           comes up to the front line.

                                 VANN
                        EVERYONE STAND DOWN.
           The squads lower their weapons. The FREIGHT TRAIN draws 
           close. 

                                 VANN
                             (to Beek)
                        Who shot him?

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        I think that I had to shoot, sir... 
                        They got my gun from me and-

                                 VANN
                        You “think” that you had to shoot, 
                        Deputy?

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                             (in a daze)
                        I don’t know...

                                 VANN
                        I want you off my scene. 

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        Why? For what?

                                 VANN
                        I just talked to a girl named 
                        Eileen, who was working at Happy 
                        Tom’s yesterday when Kenneth Bowman 
                        was killed. Ring any bells? Those 
                        boys were innocent, and you knew 
                        it! Goddamn you!

                                 DEPUTY BEEK
                        And you just believed her?! She’s 
                        from New Orleans, John. Every 
                        person from that shit hole is a 
                        fucking liar! Our fucking friend is 
                        dead!

           Vann stares hard into Beek’s empty eyes.

                                 VANN
                        You’re all gone, Cal. 
                             (to Corporal Thomas)
                        Corporal Thomas, escort the Deputy 
                        to the Sheriff’s Department.

           Corporal Thomas steers the stunned Deputy Beek out of the 
           crowd as--
                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                        The squad’ll go in whenever you’re 
                        ready, sir.

                                 VANN
                             (to man on loudspeaker)
                        Inform the suspects that I am 
                        coming in and that I am unarmed.

                                 SSGT. ZAYAS
                             (shocked)
                        You kidding, sir?

                                 VANN
                        No, I’m not.

           The Sheriff takes off his gun and hands it to Zayas. He looks 
           over at the GUARDSMEN manning the loudspeaker.

           Everyone with a gun is a little confused as they hide behind 
           vehicles and riot shields. Zayas bites his tongue.

                                 NATIONAL GUARD
                             (over loudspeaker)
                        A man-- the Sheriff is coming in to 
                        talk. He is not armed. Repeat. He 
                        is not armed.

           Hands in the air, Vann starts cautiously towards the trailer. 

           He is almost at the door. The train RIPS PAST as--

           Stone BURSTS OUT of the front door of the trailer, gun 
           pointed squarely at the Sheriff who is only a few feet away. 

           Every man with a gun SWINGS THEIR M16s UP. 

                                 VANN
                        HOLD YOUR FIRE. DO NOT FIRE.

           From 15 feet, Stone see down the barrels of M16s aimed 
           squarely at him. He keeps his sights on the Sheriff. Stone 
           boldly moves closer.

                                 STONE
                        My brother needs help. Send in a 
                        medic.

                                 VANN
                        You need to put down your gun.
                                 STONE
                        Send a fucking medic into the 
                        trailer!

                                 VANN
                        Stone. I need you to listen to me-

                                 STONE
                        And I need you to send in a medic 
                        before I blow your fucking head 
                        off! NOW!

           Guns CLICK behind Vann.

                                 VANN
                             (to the Guard)
                        Everybody stand down.

           They hesitate, leering at the Sheriff like he’s really lost 
           it. He looks back at them.

                                 VANN (CONT'D)
                        Now.

           Everybody obliges. Zayas holds out, before finally lowering 
           his gun... Stone puts takes one step towards the huge wall of 
           manpower.

                                 VANN (CONT'D)
                        You have to listen-

                                 STONE 
                             (finger grazing trigger)
                        NO. YOU HAVE TO SHUT THE FUCK UP... 
                        Now, my brother didn’t do anything! 
                        I will be forced to fire this gun 
                        if you don’t send a medic in right 
                        now...

                                 VANN 
                             (very fast)
                        I know Matty did what he did in 
                        self defence. I know you didn’t do 
                        it. I know Paul didn’t do it. We 
                        have a witness who will testify-

                                 STONE
                        Bull shit!

                                 VANN
                        I don’t know what happened today, 
                        but-
                                 STONE
                        The mother fucker tried to shoot me 
                        and then shot my brother in the 
                        chest is what happened today.

                                 VANN
                        He’s been taken off duty.  

                                 STONE
                        Send a medic in. 

           INT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILER - DAY

           Paul lies on the ground suffocating. Jayda holds her hand 
           over his wound. His lungs wheezing, his breathing faster and 
           more labored by the second.

           EXT. EMPTY FEMA TRAILERS - DAY

           All of the men’s eyes are frantically shifting back and forth 
           between Stone and Vann.

                                 STONE
                             (stepping forward 
                              threateningly)
                        HURRY THE FUCK UP!

                                 VANN
                        No medic will risk their life and 
                        go into that trailer until you 
                        lower that gun. 

                                 STONE
                        Just send the medic in! He’s dying 
                        man!

                                 VANN
                        Put the gun down and let me help 
                        your brother, Stone. If you don’t 
                        put the gun down, chances are Paul 
                        will die waiting for medical 
                        attention, and by the looks of how 
                        things are going right now, you and 
                        me will die here too... Is it worth 
                        this? 

           Stone feels the first hint of sense returning.
                                 VANN
                        I know you’ve been nothing but 
                        fucked over by everything and 
                        everyone you have ever trusted... I 
                        know everyone let you down... I 
                        know that. 

                                 STONE
                             (emotional)
                        Don’t fuck with me...

                                 VANN
                        My word, Stone. He will be OK the 
                        second you lower that gun. I give 
                        you my word, a soldier’s honor... 
                        means more than anything else I can 
                        give you.

           Stone still doesn’t move a muscle.

                                 VANN (CONT'D)
                        Look at me.
                             (he’s losing Stone again)
                        Look at me... I mean what I’m 
                        saying to you. 

           Their eyes lock... A long tense moment and then...

           Stone lowers his gun... 

           A huge sigh of relief escapes Vann and everybody else.

                                 VANN
                        GET THE MEDICS! MEDICS.

                                 NATIONAL GUARD
                             (over loudspeaker)
                        Medics. Medics! Medics!

           MEDICS run onto the scene and into the trailer. Everybody 
           lowers their weapons. A cloud of dust blows THROUGH THE 
           FRAME. No one can believe what has just happened. 

           EXT. TRAILER PARK / INT. HUMVEE - DAY

           Stone, in handcuffs, is escorted by Vann and the younger 
           Deputy out of the park into the waiting chaos. 

           Paul, breathing steadily, on a stretcher, is loaded into an 
           ambulance by paramedics.
           Jayda is led out by the younger deputy. Her and Stone barely 
           catch a glimpse of each other as they disappear into the 
           crowd... 

           A pair of television camera lights blanket the scene as Stone 
           and Vann move into the crowd of spectators on the periphery. 
           Stone lowers his head. A couple of local reporters move 
           towards them.

                                 REPORTER
                        Stone, are you innocent?!

           Vann wants them out of the way.

                                 VANN
                             (to police)
                        Get everybody back.

           The guardsmen and cops hold back the reporters and spectators 
           allowing Vann to get into a waiting Humvee away from the 
           crowd. The young Deputy opens the back door and helps Stone 
           inside.

           The Deputy climbs in behind the wheel. Vann in the back next 
           to Stone. 

                                 VANN
                             (to Stone)
                        Let me see your hands.

           Stone hesitates, then holds up his wrists and Vann unlocks 
           Stone's handcuffs. 

                                 VANN
                        You all right?

           Stone nods “yes.”

                                 STONE
                        How’s Christie doing?

           Vann looks at Stone, a little surprised by the question. 

                                 VANN
                        She’ll be a lot better when she 
                        knows you’re OK.

           Stone nods to Vann-- Respect. He turns and watches the barren 
           townscape pass by out the window.
           EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME SCENE

           The Humvee carrying Stone pulls onto highway heading into 
           Hammond - at first alone on the dusty highway - then 
           gradually joined by other cars until finally becoming one 
           with the traffic, and the movement of the town.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DUSK

           The elastic strewn wedding ring on her finger, Leslie HOLDS 
           PAUL’S HAND. They’re napping on a hospital bed, their six-
           month-old daughter sleeps soundly on a pillow between them. 

           A NURSE comes in and tidies up some pop cans.

           The news drones on a HOSPITAL ROOM TV:

                                 NEWSCASTER (CONT’D)
                             (on TV)

                        deprivation, hypervigilance, memory 
                        loss are just some of the 
                        symptoms... The former Army

                              and turns on the smile)
                        Time to move onto some lighter 
                        news, with some early Christmas 
                        gift tips from our very own 
                        Christmas expert, Patty Sosnowski! 
                        Hi Patty!

           The nurse picks up the remote and shuts the TV off. 

           Paul’s eyes blink open. He sees his FRESH LEG CAST, an 
           assortment of bandages, oxygen, and a heart monitor BEEPING 
           steadily.

           PAUL’S POV Baby Gracie’s bright eyes looking right at him. 
           She smiles. He smiles back. 
           THROUGH HOSPITAL WINDOW: A crudely erected octagon-shaped 
           wrestling ring stands off in the distance. 

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - WRESTLING RING - CONTINUOUS

           The ring is surrounded by a small but capacity crowd of a 
           hundred-or-so cheering onlookers. The trailer park stretches 
           out forever behind them-- construction on the horizon.

           At the back of the crowd, is our baby blue Chevette, its 
           muffler bound on by a coat hanger. 

           Sitting on the car’s hood is Stone. He just watches. He 
           barely notices as somebody sits down beside him. 

           After a moment he looks over. It’s Jayda. 

           Inside the ring are two acrobatic silhouettes tangled in a 
           cat like flurry of fury. This is backyard wrestling at its 
           finest.

           THE END
