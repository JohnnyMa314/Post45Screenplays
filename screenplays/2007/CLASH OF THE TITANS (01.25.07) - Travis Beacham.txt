                                 CHEOPS (V.O.)
                        O Muse, paint in me the world forgot
                        so it may live again in my tale of
                        war.  And the birth of a hero.

           Morning sunlight spills across a vivid Mediterranean-

           TILE MOSAIC FLOOR

           depicting men posing under the celestial sphere.  The painted
           tile figures animate.  They pray to the heavens.

                                 CHEOPS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        In those vanished days, when Man was
                        young, he prayed to the Gods.  But
                        Man grew up, as children do...

           One tile figure stands, turns away from the stars, and sits
           at a work bench.  He tinkers with a small invention.

                                 CHEOPS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        He turned from darkness, fear, and
                        superstition to invention, art,
                        learning, self-determination...

           The figure stands and lifts his invention, a spyglass, to
           study the stars he once worshipped. 

                                 CHEOPS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But the Gods hungered for worship as
                        lions for blood.  They breathed our
                        prayers to survive.  

           The animated mosaic stops.  The colors age.  

                                 CHEOPS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And they would claim our awe again. 
                        If not by love, then by fear.  To
                        ensure their continued existence.

           Dry leaves rustle over the floor.

                        This is how war broke between Man
                        and Gods...

           A trickle of blood runs between the tiles.  Tilt up to-

           INT./EXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Past the blood trickling from a human soldier dead on the
           tile floor and beyond the toppled pillars...

           CONTINUED:

           A storm rages over ranks of human armies and their clockwork
           soldiers of rain-slick bronze.  A charging wave of MINOTAURS,
           RHINO-HEADED GIANTS, and others crests the hill.  

           The bronze automata ratchet their arms, raising battle-axes. 
           The storming beast armies crash into the charging humans. 
           The spring-loaded arms of the clockwork soliders SNAP down
           in a wave that rolls along the front.  Battle is met.

           A fury of clubs, swords, and spears.  Cogs, springs, and
           steaming hot blood spills.  A sea of rippling muscle and
           firm armour gleaming with mud, rain, and lightning.

           Flashes back-light vast GOD-SHADOWS in the stratospheric
           fog of thunderclouds as lightning bolts splinter from their
           hands to strafe the human forces on the ground.  

           Catapults respond with blazing bombs of oil and tar. 

                                 CHEOPS (V.O.)
                        The war escalated.  Humans were
                        slaughtered as starving Gods faded.  

           EXT. VILLA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Torches flicker along the stone parapet.

                                 CHEOPS (V.O.)
                        But one wise God foresaw the unending
                        deadlock and formed a plan to bring
                        peace to both sides.  

           A shadowed horse and GOD rider breaks the fog and trots up
           to the gate.

                        So, cloaked in magic, he descended
                        to an outpost of Man.  Disguised as
                        its King returned from war.  

           INT. ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           The God's hands rest his helmet on the nightstand as behind
           silk curtains, the bewitched Queen DANAË unties her gown.

                                 CHEOPS (V.O.)
                        And the spellbound Queen believed
                        the impostor to be her husband even
                        as he took her to bed.

           Their silhouettes join in the dark.
           INT. ROYAL CHAMBERS - MORNING (FLASHBACK)

                                 CHEOPS (V.O.)
                        And by dawn, his seed sowed, the God
                        was gone.  Leaving only memories of
                        her husband, if not a dream.

           Danaë wakes, mystified, to an empty bed.

           INT. ROYAL CHAMBERS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           The Queen hums and fondly strokes her round tummy.  The
           doors explode open.  The real King- ACRISIUS enters.  Danaë
           stands and smiles.  She doesn't understand his fury.

                                 CHEOPS (V.O.)
                        But the true King returned.  And
                        where his wife saw cause for joy, he
                        saw only evidence of infidelity.

           EXT. WARSHIP - EVENING (FLASHBACK)

           On the rocking deck, Acrisius watches as soldiers force
           Danaë, bound-up, into a big cedar trunk.

                                 CHEOPS (V.O.)
                        Mad with jealousy, he cast his wife
                        and the unborn to the deep.

           They close the trunk, chain it, and toss it overboard.

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           The trunk bobs on the violent rolling waves.  The faint
           sound of a BABY CRYING under the CRASHING surf.  

                                 CHEOPS (V.O.)
                        There- In that dark tomb, the Queen
                        gave birth.  And died.

           EXT. TRAWLER - MORNING (FLASHBACK)

           A net rises heavy with writhing fish and the trunk. 
           FISHERMEN set it down for closer inspection.  Silence.  

           The Fishermen hammer the lock.  CRACK.  CRACK.  POP.  They
           open the lid.

           DARKNESS.  An infant CRIES.

                        Sired by God and Man.  He doesn't
                        yet know.  But he will be history's

                        greatest hero.  This is how it came

           FADE IN:

           INT. CONCLAVE OF OLYMPOS

           A wide rotunda extends into black above and below. 
           Bottomless and summit-less.

                                 CHEOPS (V.O.)
                        A quarter century of war passed. 
                        Perseus came of age in the shelter
                        unaware that his name was being
                        uttered deep in the halls of Olympos
                        as the Gods debated the peace he
                        would bring.  And so, the fate of
                        Perseus and all Man is put to a vote
                        by the mightiest Gods...

           Flickering candles hang mid-air.  The Olympians, in hooded
           robes, hover.  They cluster according to their philosophies
           with imperial ZEUS presiding over...

           Four pacifists (including ISIS).  Four undecided (including
           APOLLO).  And the three militants -- 

           1) Bronze-helmeted ATHENA...

           2) SET the Void, the dry, scaled skin of a Nile croc with
           rows of scutes tracing the curve of his bald head.  The
           frayed hem of his red cloak licks like a flame's edge...

           And 3) Tiamat (who we will later witness in her full divine
           glory) now hooded in her cloak of black liquid fabric.

           (NOTE: Hereafter, passages in English italics indicate
           subtitle text accompanying spoken God-language.)

                                 TIAMAT
                        Peace?  Never.  Many of you feel
                        hunger pangs from scarcity of worship. 
                        But there are those- Gods of War and
                        Chaos- supping power from the blood
                        of war in worship's absence,
                        invigorated as others starve.  If
                        you cannot give us victory then give
                        us the reins and we will finish the
                        war.

                        Your argument is tedious.  You may
                        draw consecration from the purge of

                        Our mercy will give them reason to

                        whisper our names with more passion

                        Why should the mighty uphold this
                        servile treaty drafted by an enfeebled
                        leader barely clinging to his rank
                        as the Prime?

           Zeus suddenly lights up.  Furious arcs of lightning jump to
           the walls as his voice booms like thunder.

                                 ZEUS
                        Silence, Tiamat!  Lest you wish to
                        discover how enfeebled I truly am.
                                (beat)
                        Arguments have been heard.  Let us

                        in favor of the proposed treaty...

           The pacifists raise their hands.  The undecideds join them. 
           Much to Tiamat's dismay, Athena raises her hand.

                                 TIAMAT
                        Athena!  You are a Goddess of War!

                        I am also Goddess of Reason.

           She leaves Tiamat and Set and coasts to join the ranks of
           the treaty's supporters.  Zeus takes stock and nods.

                                 ZEUS
                        Thoth, bring this to the Humans. 
                        Athena, give our forces standing
                        orders to defend our strategic
                        interests until the treaty's
                        execution.  Henceforth, there is a
                        local armistice shielding the signers. 
                        The bridegroom and the Joppan Royal
                        Family are not to be touched.  We

                        Our losses are hidden.  Theirs are
                        plain to see.  They know not the
                        depth of our reserves, hence they
                        have no choice but to assume we are
                        paying them a favour.

           INT. CONCLAVE OF OLYMPOS - LATER

           Only Set and Tiamat remain in the dark, huddled close and
           conspiratorial in the glow of a single hovering candle. 
           They whisper in a language we understand.

                                 TIAMAT
                        He's grown weaker than I assumed. 
                        They all have.  They can no longer
                        see the future as clearly as before.  

                                 SET
                        Not as clearly as we can see it.

                                 TIAMAT
                        The Humans will revel.  They will
                        drop their guard, pacified by joy
                        and wine.  Someone will be careless. 
                        Someone will misspeak.  It is fated
                        to occur.  And when it does, we shall
                        strike.

           She pinches out the flame between her fingers.

           EXT. THE AGORA OF JOPPA - EVENING

           A market of tri-storied stoas.  MERCHANTS' rugs laid out in
           colonnades bristling with crowds.  SHEDU bull-men with thick
           assyrian beards and wild angel-wings.  Tall CYCLOPEAN
           TRADERS.  NAVIGATORS and EXPLORERS in armour and pelts. 

           SUPERIMPOSE: "Joppa, Capital of the Dominion of Illyria..." 

           Bushels of garlic and cinnamon.  Lush byzantine carpets. 
           Smoke, performers, noise, and music.

           CHEOPS clumsily pushes thru carrying his lyre.  A youngish
           man with eyes blindfolded.  He taps the ground with a stick
           like an invalid.

                                 CHEOPS
                        Epics, ballads!  Cheops knows the
                        classics!  Help a blind rhapsode?

           CONTINUED:

           He bumps into a COUPLE, mumbles an apology.  They pass. 
           Cheops clutches the lady's pearls.  He lifts a corner of
           his blind to peek, pockets his prize.

                                 CHEOPS (CONT'D)
                        Hymn of Akhilleus!  The Promethiad! 
                        Cheops sings for only three obols!

           He passes an evangelist (FANTASOS) haranguing the crowd.

                                 FANTASOS
                                (mid-speech)
                        -one true God is not Zeus but she
                        called the Deep- Tiamat!  "Before
                        the first dawn, the eyes of the Deep
                        watched the earth." Succumb to the
                        Goddess of Chaos or know despair!

           Cheops moves under sun-dried octopus tentacles hanging from
           a line and stops at a fruit stand.

                                 CHEOPS
                        Hear a verse for three obols!

           As the MERCHANT is distracted, Cheops grabs a handful of
           grapes and stuffs them in his mouth.  The Merchant turns.

                                 CHEOPS (CONT'D)
                                (mouth full)
                        Pity a blind rhapsode, friends!

           Before the Merchant can speak-

           The lively market falls suddenly SILENT, as if startled by
           unheard thunder.  They exchange glances of quiet panic.

           A LITTLE GIRL spills a basket of dates.

           The clouds surge and stop dead.  Time stops.  And grinds
           backwards.  

           The spilt dates roll into the basket as it leaps to the
           Little Girl's arms.  

           A string on Cheops's lyre plucks itself.  One SHRILL NOTE. 
           Over and over again.  Other instruments do the same.  Cheops
           tears off his blindfold.

           All recognize the signs with dread- An Olympian approaches.

           THOTH the Quick floats down the uneasy street.  A black
           cloak and hood.  His cape billows in brief shapes of raven
           wings, trailing feathers that melt into smoke.

           All eyes try not to watch as Thoth makes for the marble
           domes and columned peristyles of the Basilica- the royal
           residence and assembly hall.
           INT. ANTE ROOM - SAME

           A long table.  KING KEPHEUS, the grey-haired, worried ruler
           of Joppa, sits at one end nervously drumming his gold ring
           on the marble tabletop.  Expecting someone.

           AMOUN, Magi Strategos and special advisor, stands behind
           the King.  This dour, cryptic scholar sports a dark mantle,
           a necklace of bones, and a cleanly shaven head.

                                 AMOUN
                        Be humble and speak scrupulously. 
                        The Olympians can be mercurial and
                        they don't take offense lightly.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        I've received ambassadors before.

                                 AMOUN
                        Not like this, you haven't.

           The door creaks open.  Kepheus holds his breath and stops
           drumming.  A PAGE enters and stutters.

                                 PAGE
                        Thoth the Quick, Ambassador of the
                        Gods is -

           Kepheus motions urgently.  The Page steps aside.  Thoth
           floats in.  He removes his hood.  His head has the look of
           a crystal skull poured with night.  Stars and galaxies shine
           dimly thru swirling black nebulas.

                                 THOTH
                        Kepheus, I've come to talk of peace.

           EXT. THE AGORA OF JOPPA - LATER

           The crowded, quiet market tries to return to normalcy.  But
           the Basilica looms, pregnant with the gravity of the God's
           presence inside.  Cheops anxiously eyes the building.

           INT. ANTE ROOM - SAME

           The room seems to breathe.  The walls GROAN as the room
           ethereally compresses and expands- a constant vertigo.

           A tabletop war-game map and inlaid grid with legion marbles
           in pits at each grid point.  The marbles roll from their
           pits, to and fro over the board, as if on a boat at sea.

           The liquid in wine cups tilts back and forth.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        A treaty marriage?  

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           They talk diplomatically but there is an underlying rift.

                                 THOTH
                        You have a daughter of age.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        Andromeda?  You'll no doubt understand
                        my hesitation to give my only daughter
                        to a God.

           Amoun swallows hard.  He tries to gauge Thoth's reaction.

                                 THOTH
                        No.  Such a union would be unclean.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        Then what are we talking-?

                                 THOTH
                        A scion of tangled blood would satisfy
                        the terms of the marriage.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        A demigod.  You're talking about
                        Andromeda marrying a demigod.

                                 THOTH
                        A demigod prince.  A boy has been
                        sired for just this purpose.  Son of
                        Olympian and Human royalty.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        And I'm to take your word?

                                 AMOUN
                        Majesty, if I may- the boy does exist. 
                        Perseus.  He lives in a small fishing
                        village to the West.

           Kepheus turns, surprised at Amoun's foreknowledge.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        You knew about this?

                                 AMOUN
                        I was the boy's tutor.  He doesn't
                        know from where he came, but he is
                        the one destined to bring peace.

           Kepheus weighs his daughter's joy and the greater good.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        If this proposal means an end to the
                        war, what choice is there?  Don't
                        think me blasphemous.  But I still
                        don't trust you.  And if any harm
                        comes to my daughter...

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Amoun gapes, stunned at Kepheus's audacity.

           Thoth sits still, hands folded.  The ebb and flow of his
           influence on the room breaks rhythm and shifts...

           The rolling marbles cascade and pile up on one side of the
           war-game map.  They hold there without rolling back.

           The wine tilts more and more in Thoth's direction.  So far
           it begins to dribble from the cups.

                                 THOTH
                        The Princessa shall not be harmed.

           The wine continues to seep over the cup's brim.  A couple
           of marbles finally spill over the lip of the tabletop map
           and PATTER across the stone floor.

           Kepheus recognizes he has no control and scrawls his name
           at the bottom of the treaty.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        Where's the suitor?

           The spatial distortions resume their metrical rhythm.

                                 THOTH
                        An attache has already been dispatched
                        to bring him to Joppa.

           CLOSE ON PERSEUS 

           underwater, face intense with effort, holding his breath
           for a grueling span.  He dives deeper and deeper.

           At the bottom, a shining coin rests in the silt.  Perseus
           strains as he kicks further down.

           EXT. TRAWLER - DAY

           The crew of shabby YOUNG FISHERMEN acutely watch the ocean's
           still surface.  An hourglass rests on the deckrail.  The
           sand empties from the top.  One Fisherman flips it.

                                 FISHERMAN 1
                        How many turns is that?

                                 FISHERMAN 2
                        Twelve...

           The others react, astounded but suddenly troubled.

                                 FISHERMAN 3
                        Something's wrong.  

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           They look at the still water.  Unsure of what to do.

           Perseus suddenly breaks the surface with a gasp.  He holds
           up his empty hands.  The Fishermen collapse in a playful
           chorus of "Aaaww!"  "No!"  And "So close!"

                                 FISHERMAN 1
                                (impressed nevertheless)
                        Twelve turns, Perseus!  Twelve!

           His friends pull Perseus up from the water and we get our
           first clear daylit look at him.

           The wiry sun-roasted body of a young mediterranean man,
           aged 21, with a finely stubbled jaw.  A tousled snarl of
           dark hair hangs over keen hazel eyes.  He's incisive, deep,
           and haunted by the unease of youth.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Twelve.  That a record or something?

                                 FISHERMAN 1
                        "Is that a record?"  This bastard...

           Fisherman 1 puts Perseus in a teasing headlock.

           EXT. TRAWLER - LATER

           Perseus sits on the prow as the sun sinks in the shimmering
           sea.  He has a hungry way of looking at the horizon.

           He watches the shore sail by.  The sun pops the reds and
           blacks in the rocks, the yellow and lavender blooms.

           Perseus spies a girl on shore.  Her eerily washed-out color
           cuts a pure, bleached contrast against the natural colors
           around her.  The boat nears.  A closer look- 

           A huntress.  A pagan leather bandeau and braided belts hug
           her lithe gazelle figure.  Wilted dahlias in her cornsilk-
           gold hair.  Young yet ancient.  THE WILTING GIRL. 

           She watches Perseus intently as the boat passes.  He turns
           to see if his friends see this curious fair girl, but no
           one pays attention.  When he looks back, she's gone. 

           INT. PERSEUS'S LOFT - NIGHT

           Perseus sits on the floor with a scroll titled "Periplus of
           Memnon the Navigator" -a lushly illustrated travelogue of
           exotic places and things- unfurled on his straw bed.

           Perseus reads with deep curiosity.  He scans entries on
           Cyclopes, Lost Worlds, the Medusa- 

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He pauses, chilled by the crude charcoal contour of a woman's
           torso on a snake's tail, a head ringed by vipers.  Details
           blotted by slag-ink except her shining eyes.

           A clatter of pots and his Mother's voice snaps him out.

                                 MOTHER
                        Perseus!  Come and eat!

           He rolls the papyrus and stuffs it aside many others.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Perseus's adoptive family sits around the dinner table-
           mother (YAYA), little brother (IASON), and grandfather
           (PAPOUS) who's in the middle of a rant.

                                 PAPOUS
                        I'm just saying-- back when we prayed
                        to the Gods, gave them the glory,
                        they looked after us.

                                 PERSEUS
                        No God's cooled my brow in illness. 
                        Or picked me up when I've fallen. 
                        You may as well pray to stone.

                                 PAPOUS
                        Spoken like all those other young
                        idiots who joined the war.  Remember
                        what happened to those heretics?

                                 YAYA
                        Papous!  Those boys were our neighbors--

                                 PERSEUS
                        Those boys were my friends!

           Perseus glares at Papous who just chews and squints,
           unapologetic.  Yaya, the consummate peacemaker, sighs.

                                 YAYA
                        Perseus, do you know what you're
                        doing for the off-season yet?

                                 PERSEUS
                        There's a voyage passing thru. 
                        Sailing around the subcontinent to
                        find a sea route to the Iron Horde.

                                 PAPOUS
                        What, you're some kind of argonaut
                        now?  I thought we decided you'd
                        stay here and man the trawlers.

           A discouraged Perseus sees what's coming.

                        But no, you're too big for that,
                        aren't you?  Too clever to work...

                                 PERSEUS
                        I just want my existence to have
                        made a difference.  I want to matter. 
                        Just like anyone, Paps.

                                 PAPOUS
                        Your scrolls.  Tinkerings.  Dreams
                        of heroic argosies.  Nothing.  The
                        fish on your plate is what's real!

                        But there's more to us than that.  A
                        Man strives.  He dreams.  He risks. 
                        He hungers for wisdom.  And he
                        outgrows his limits.

                                 PAPOUS
                        What do you mean by "his limits?"

           Perseus glares.  He refuses to take the bait.

                                 PAPOUS (CONT'D)
                        We are as they made us.  You're a
                        fisherman.  We pulled you from the
                        sea and you'll belong to her always.  
                                (beat)
                        Fate's something even the Gods can't
                        rewrite.

           Perseus wipes his mouth and tosses his napkin down.  He
           starts away.  Yaya gently takes his arm and stops him.  She
           gives him a warm smile.

           INT. PERSEUS'S LOFT - LATER

           Candlelight shimmers on shelves of polished spyglasses,
           astrolabes, and other devices.  

           Perseus sits and studies a scroll- a schematic.  He compares
           the drawing to the device on his table...  

           An amber wheel and a crank.  A vise with copper rods holds
           a strip of hide against the wheel.

           Eyes sharp, Perseus turns the crank.  The wheel HUMS against
           the hide.  Perseus cranks faster.  The HUM RISES.

           He lets go.  The disc spins.  The amber WHIRS on the hide
           strip.  He catches his reflection in the wheel.  He reaches.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           An arc of static electricity jumps from the copper orb to
           Perseus's fingertips.  He draws back, startled.  He looks
           down at his fingers, more surprised that it didn't hurt.

           The plate keeps spinning.  Perseus reaches out again.  A
           crackling arc leaps to his hand from the orb.  He doesn't
           pull back this time.  He reaches slowly closer.  

           The arc glows.  It shivers and flexes as it kisses his
           fingertips.  He laughs, astonished as he finesses the arc.

           Suddenly, a KNOCK at the door.  Loud.  Perseus pulls back
           his hand.  He holds the crank to stop the amber disc.

           He listens and waits for someone else to get it.  Another
           KNOCK.  No one stirs.  Perseus climbs down and heads to 

           THE FRONT DOOR

           as another KNOCK sounds.  Perseus opens the door.

           The Wilting Girl stands in the doorway.  

           Up close, her strange beauty strikes Perseus like lightning.

                                 PERSEUS
                        You...  I saw you...  Watching.

           He stands, rapt by her eyes, one lucid blue / one like
           burnished copper, shining loud on her whisper-white skin.

           He doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry inside
           between her feet like a scuttling black cherry.  

           Followed shortly by another.  Then a slithering centipede. 
           Then swarms of velvet cow killer ants and scorpions.  All
           trickling silently towards a mesmerized Perseus.

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        I'm sorry.

           Perseus looks confused and about to speak.  

           He feels that first black widow on his ankle, lifts his
           foot and quickly swats the spider off.  More spiders and
           centipedes climb his other leg.

           He winces as they bite and brushes them off- a futile fight,
           the swarm finds which ever foot touches the ground.

           The Wilting Girl stands patiently in the doorway.

           Perseus backs away as he smacks the biting, stinging
           creatures.  He backs into the dinner table.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He grabs a handful of forks and knives and flings them like
           darts into the growing black flood of feelers and scuttering
           legs pouring inside.

           He hops on the table and jumps to the loft ladder.  He
           clambers up and slips, weakened by the venom in his system.

           He hits the floor.  Within seconds, he's blanketed by the
           swarm.  He falls still as the Wilting Girl calmly watches.

           EXT. BASILICA - DAY

           A long stone wall at the Basilica's foundation facing the
           open piazza.  The stones, chalked up and down with rows and
           rows of countless tally marks.

           A HERALD climbs up on a box and unrolls a scroll.  A SCRIBE,
           chalk in hand, searches for the end of the tallies.  The
           Herald clears his throat and reads...

                                 HERALD
                        A bulletin from the War Ministry. 
                        The monthly death tolls.  The
                        Witchloams Campaign reports forty-
                        two hundred casualties.  The
                        Anotuulian Front reports sixty-five
                        hundred.  The Naval Campaign in the
                        Agyros has ten warships and seventeen
                        hundred men lost at sea.  In the
                        Eastern Theater, the Iron Horde is,
                        as usual, not reporting...

           EXT. PERISTYLE - SAME

           SERVANTS hang laundry in the atrium.  A nimble girl slinks
           behind the columns- a cleopatra-bob bounces over- cat ears?

           She's PESHET, a Sfinx girl- humanoid/feline.  Slit nostrils
           and yellow eyes.  Fine tawny fur.  Lean arms end in paw-
           like hands.  Her cat tail snakes nervously.  

           She scouts the hall and whistles.  A girl (18) steps out.

           Silks cling to her pert cinnamon skin.  Plunging jet curls
           shine like spilt ink.  Warm coffee-dark eyes hide a spark
           of mischief.  ANDROMEDA.  A princess- willful and impish.

           She catches up with Peshet, her nursemaid.  Andromeda puts
           her hand on the doorknob and quietly enters the scullery
           closet.  Peshet sighs and keeps watch.
           INT. SCULLERY CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           Sweltry.  A cauldron boils cookware clean.  Iron pans hang,
           dripping steam.  AGENOR -a grimy, ripped scullion boy- scours
           a pan.  Andromeda watches with a rakish grin.  He looks up.

                                 AGENOR
                        Princessa...  You tart...

           They kiss with familiarity.  Break, smiling slyly.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Muggy in here, isn't it?  I feel a
                        little overdressed... 

           EXT. PERISTYLE - SAME

           Peshet hears RIPPING FABRIC and a GIRLISH PEAL.  A MAID
           spies Peshet.

                                 PESHET
                        Just catching some fresh air.

                                 MAID
                        I bet you need all sorts of breaks
                        from minding that pampered minx.

           Peshet gives an uneasy affirming smile as the Maid passes.

           INT. SCULLERY CLOSET - SAME

           Andromeda listens appalled as Agenor necks her.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Pampered minx!  Are they so bold?

                                 AGENOR
                        Are you always so accustomed to
                        getting what you want?

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        I am the Princessa.  And you, little
                        boy, have lost your chatter rights.

           He glares bravado and rolls his hips into her.  She feigns
           an unexcited smirk even as their bodies find a rhythm.  The
           heaving of her ribs doesn't show on her cool face.  

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                        I'm really quite serious.

           Sighs seep between her words but she holds eye contact.

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                        I... don't want... to hear...
                        another... peep... out of... you...

           The room fills with HUSHED PANTING.  Cookware CLATTERS.

           EXT. PERISTYLE - SAME

           Peshet watches QUEEN CASSIOPEIA, Andromeda's prim and proud
           mother and queen of Joppa, stride down the colonnade.

                                 CASSIOPEIA
                        Peshet, have you seen my daughter?

           Peshet keeps her cool.  The BANGING cookware in the closet
           behind her could easily be routine kitchen sounds.

                                 PESHET
                        Is she not in her chambers, ma'am?

                                 CASSIOPEIA
                        She is not and-

           The BLISSFUL MOANS however could only be one thing. 
           Cassiopeia knows it.  She purses her lips and squints at
           the closet.  Peshet shamefully lowers her head.

                                 CASSIOPEIA (CONT'D)
                        Tell Andromeda, should you find her,
                        that her father and I request an
                        audience at her convenience.

           She sharply turns and storms away, furious and embarrassed. 
           Peshet raps urgently on the closet door over the MOANS.

                                 PESHET
                        My lady, your parents...

           INT. THE TABLINUM PARLOUR - LATER

           Small, lavish, open at both ends-- curtains drawn at one,
           flower gardens spill from the opposite.  Cassiopeia rests
           on a settee.  Kepheus paces.  Andromeda stands aghast.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        What do you mean a treaty marriage?!

                        You dare protest on the heels of

                        She's joking.  Please be joking.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        And why not?  First of all, I am not
                        in love.  I'm too young.  And I'm
                        too young to be a wife.  I'm an
                        eighteen year old Princessa of Joppa. 
                        I shouldn't have to worry about
                        ceremonies or politics.  I should be

                        still have the taste buds for it. 
                        I'm saying I'm happy now.  Does that

                        I'm sorry.  But this is bigger than
                        your amusement.  This marriage means
                        peace between Gods and Man.  The
                        suitor is a demigod prince who-

           EXT. SAILING DHOW - AFTERNOON

           A white sail, swollen with wind, draws the small boat swiftly
           across the sea.  

           The Wilting Girl sits quietly at the stern.  She stares at
           Perseus's back expectantly.  He sits on the prow grappling
           with recent revelations.

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        It's a lot to absorb, I know.  But I
                        can't answer your questions if you
                        don't put them to words...

                                 PERSEUS
                        You've got the wrong man.  I'm no
                        demigod.  A demigod is- I don't know. 
                        But it's something else.

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        You ever lie awake and noticed how
                        when it storms, the thunder syncs to
                        the beat of your heart?

           He doesn't have to answer.  It's written on his face.

                        How long can you hold your breath?

                                 PERSEUS
                        None of that means anything.

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        Look at your arms, Perseus.

           Perseus watches the few bites on his arm heal visibly.

                                 PERSEUS
                        More of your tricks.

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        Is this what you think we do?  Kidnap
                        fishermen to marry princesses?  You
                        are special, Perseus.  Your birth
                        was ordained for this very purpose.

           The Wilting Girl looks up at the sail and squints,
           concentrating.  The wind shifts.  The boat turns slightly. 
           Perseus looks at the billowing sail.

                                 PERSEUS
                        And who is "we" exactly?  What are
                        you?  Are you a demigod too?

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        I'm a Chthonian.

                                 PERSEUS
                        A Chthonian?

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        An Earth Goddess.  We have caste-
                        systems like Man.  Nobility in the
                        Olympians- few but cosmic.  And
                        peasantry in the Chthonians-
                        numberless but local and intimate.

                                 PERSEUS
                        And demigods, where are they on your
                        hierarchy?

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        They aren't.  A demigod is what
                        happens when a God, any God, lays
                        with a mortal woman and --

                                 PERSEUS
                        Don't patronize me.   I was asking--
                        Look, if demigods are so lowly then
                        why do you need me to-- ?

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        No God can wed a Mortal.  It's an
                        anathema.  A demigod may be less
                        than a God, but he's more than a
                        Man.  One foot in Humanity and the
                        other in Divinity.  A symbol of accord
                        between our races.

                                 PERSEUS
                        But why me?  Are the Gods really so
                        chaste that I'm the only bastard
                        child in the world?

                        It's a risky stew.  Too little of
                        one ingredient and you'd be running
                        thru the woods, ripping out dragons
                        throats with your teeth.  Too much
                        of another and your mind would be
                        drifting in space.  There are twelve
                        living demigods.  Seven are
                        languishing in a sanitarium, four
                        got bored and tore off into the wilds
                        of the dark continent, and then
                        there's you.

           Perseus smirks sardonically and shakes his head.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Only a Goddess would reach down and
                        pluck a man from his life like he
                        was just her game piece.

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        Do you miss that life already?  
                                (no reply)
                        I couldn't take the chance you'd
                        refuse.  The stakes are too high.

           She stands.  Perseus looks up.  His jaw drops.  He stands.

           HIS POV 

           A breathtaking view of Joppa- a city in two parts.  

           At sea level, tangled hovels, boats, and docks crowd the
           working-class area- the Lower Wharf.  

           Above, twisting stone stairs climb plunging cliffs to the
           Acropolis with its gleaming villas, temples, statues, and
           colonnaded towers all stacked and hugging the clifftops.

                        Why Joppa?

           EXT. THE AGORA OF JOPPA - AFTERNOON

           Towering, cloven-hooved CYCLOPEAN TRADERS lug wine casks
           one-handed.  SFINXES, bark-skinned DRYADS, angel-winged
           BULL-MEN, and OTHER ESOTERICS mingle.

           Perseus rubbernecks, awestruck as he passes a BLACKSMITH
           who takes a dragon skin from the coals and pounds the white-
           hot scales over a stone mould to fashion armour.  

           The Wilting Girl walks alongside him.

                        the middle of every major shipping
                        lane on the Mezzosea.  Joppa controls
                        the flow of goods, armies, and culture
                        thru the dominions of Man.  Why Joppa?

           They round the corner to the first view of the regal marble
           Basilica.  SERVANTS hang banners and scatter flower petals
           on the steps, decorating for the betrothal.

           EXT. THE TABLINUM PARLOUR - EVENING

           Perseus sits before Kepheus and Cassiopeia in the awkward
           silence of the dim candlelight.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        The attache apprised you of the
                        arrangement, I expect?  The importance
                        was duly conveyed?

           Perseus nods and shifts uncomfortably.  Kepheus paces with
           mounting impatience.

                                 CASSIOPEIA
                        I'm sure she'll be right down.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        Where is she?  You should at least
                        exchange pleasantries with her before
                        tomorrow's ceremony...

                                 PERSEUS
                        Ceremony?  I didn't realize the
                        wedding was so soon--

                                 CASSIOPEIA
                        The wedding comes later.  This is
                        the public announcement and a
                        celebration of the peace.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        I want to be clear.  At the bitter
                        end, I'm a father.  Before I'm a
                        King or a peacemaker.  I didn't wish

                        for her to cut her springtime short
                        and play the pawn in this.  And you're
                        just an outsider.  Be very good to
                        her or I will end you.

           Perseus looks away.  He can't help but chuckle a little.

                                 KEPHEUS (CONT'D)
                        That amusing to you?

                                 PERSEUS
                        I was waylaid.  I agreed to nothing
                        and I'm only abiding this insofar as
                        it solves a bigger problem.

           For a moment, Kepheus glares, furious enough to slug Perseus. 
           A Page enters and hurries to whisper in Kepheus's ear. 
           Kepheus listens, surprised but not shocked.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        Seems our Andromeda has slipped out. 
                        Well, seeing as how you're not yet a
                        Prince, you'll abide a King's request-- 
                        Go fetch my daughter from the
                        barrelhouses won't you?

           EXT. BASILICA - EVENING

           The Wilting Girl comes down the petal-strewn steps.  

           Colour washes from the environs.  CITY SOUNDS deaden.  The
           CITIZENS talk and stroll, oblivious- moving with the crisp,
           choppy look of a battle.  The Wilting Girl's movement remains
           "normal" by comparison, removed. 

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        Zeus?

           An eerie voice replies.  It shifts about, never seeming to
           come from the same place.  And speaks a language at once
           flowing and clipped.  Foreign but almost familiar.

                                 ZEUS  (O.S.)

                        It's only just begun.  Have you
                        forgotten your place in this?

           She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.  A single tear
           runs along her cheek.  She opens her eyes.

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        I- I can't involve myself.  Please.

                        You will, you are, and you have
                        already.  Such is fate.  We spare
                        not ourselves the trials of our future
                        by living only in the present.

           She looks to the Basilica with profound, sad tenderness.

           EXT. STREETS OF JOPPA - NIGHT

           Perseus roams, half purposefully.  He stops where MUSIC
           spills from a rough stucco facade.  Painted letters blaze
           across the dark timber awning-- "PLUTO ORKESTAR"

           EXT. PLUTO ORKESTAR - NIGHT

           A festive, crowded terrace overlooks the wide mirror sea. 
           The last rosy fingers of the downed sun trace furrows of
           violet fading to dark blue and the first twinkling stars.

           A HOUSE BAND stomps out a SWIFT-TEMPO ARPEGGIO on a mandolin,
           a fiddle, balkan bagpipes, and a JANGLING tambourine.

           Bronze lanterns hang from the sailcloth canopy, casting
           sparse oily light on laughing faces, smoke, wine bottles
           cluttering tabletops, clapping hands, and whirling dancers.

           Perseus moves thru dizzying revelry.  He spies someone,
           dancing in the clustered center of attention -- a singular
           dark-haired beauty that can only be Andromeda...

           Arms out, she rolls her hips to the music.  The sheer pleats
           of her gown trail her movements.  The music ends.

           Andromeda laughs and flicks her hair back.  Her sleeve slips
           thoughtlessly off one shoulder.

           She sights Perseus over her bare half-moon shoulder.  Sweat
           glistens.  Damp, dark curls fall before her eyes.  With a
           smirk, she realizes who he must be.

           Andromeda and Perseus lean by the bar, talking.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        You supposed to be half-God?

                        I don't see it.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Look.  Your father just sent me to
                        bring you home.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        I've got a better idea.

                        What's that?

           She takes a gulp of wine and slams the bottle down as the

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Dance with me.

           She moves out into the crowd.  They form a wide circle. 
           Perseus lingers by the bar.

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                        Well?  Come on, trawler-boy!  Don't
                        they dance out on the islands?

           Perseus smirks, shakes his head, and grudgingly joins her
           in the middle of the circle.

           They begin by slowly circling each other, mirroring
           movements, face to face, eyes locked, but no physical
           contact.  The slow tempo, marked by CLACKING cymbals.

           The tempo gradually quickens.  The pair draws near and parts
           again and again, all in the flow of the dance...

           ...Until Perseus catches his arm about her waist.  Andromeda
           looks briefly surprised but rolls with it.

           A salty fandango.  Hand to hips and hand in hand, whirling,
           heels kicking back.  Fast, confident, plucky.

           Perseus spins Andromeda.  She sharply snaps back around to
           lock eyes.  Smirking, defiant of vertigo or exhaustion.

           The music stops.  

           Perseus dips her parallel with the floor.  She holds the
           pose, tense but controlled -- one leg arrow-straight with
           her body and the other hooked round his hamstring.

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                                (teasingly sassy)
                        No...  I don't see it.

           Perseus chuckles.  She leans up to his ear.

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                        Now you can bring me home...

           INT. GUEST CHAMBERS - MORNING

           The atrium outside the open window fills with noises of the
           house waking up.  Laying in bed, Perseus yawns.

                                 PERSEUS
                                (mid-yawn)
                        Androm--

           He opens his eyes and sits up, naked and alone in a bed big
           enough for two.

           Twisted sheets snarl over the skewed bed and spill onto the
           floor where a trail of Perseus's matted, hastily-shed clothes
           cuts the otherwise neat room back to the door.

           A dumbstruck grin crosses his face as the previous night
           comes rushing back to him.  He laughs and shakes his head --
           "How the hell did I end up here with -- ?"

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        The Princessa of Joppa...

           INT. GRAND RECEPTION HALL - EVENING

           Long and hemmed by columns and niches with statues.  Every
           square of the marble floor, packed with REVELERS.

           SYLPHS, subtle creatures of incense smoke, perform under
           the dais, whirling and sinuating to GALLOPING DRUMS.

           Perseus moves thru the crowd, late to the party, decked out
           in a white tunic and polished ceremonial armour.  A hand
           lands on his shoulder.  He turns and recognizes Amoun.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Master Amoun!

           CONTINUED:

                                 AMOUN
                        My boy!  Good to see you!

                                 PERSEUS
                        You're-- what?  Advisor to the King,
                        is it?

                                 AMOUN
                        Magi Strategos...

                                 PERSEUS
                        Provincial tutor to Magi Strategos--
                        not a bad step up!  

                                 AMOUN
                        And the teacher becomes the--  well--
                        the greater teacher, I suppose.  And
                        how are you, my boy?

                                 PERSEUS
                        Treading water.  It's a lot to absorb. 
                        But this-- what were the odds I'd
                        chance on you here?

                                 AMOUN
                                (brushing it off)
                        Right.  Right.

                                 PERSEUS
                        I'll find you after?

           Amoun nods and salutes with his wine cup as Perseus moves
           towards the dais where Kepheus and Cassiopeia sit.  

           Andromeda motions from an apse to the side of the dais. 
           Perseus climbs the steps to take his place beside her.  

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Just smile tranquilly and look over
                        the crowd...  You're late.

                                 PERSEUS
                        It's a complicated vestment.  
                                (beat)
                        So... last night--

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Oh, I meant to thank you for seeing
                        me home.  I was so flushed with wine
                        I'm embarrassed to admit I can't
                        recall a tenth of the evening.

           Andromeda briefly meets his befuddled gape with a quick,
           impishly playful wink -- "That's our story, get it?" Perseus
           half-smiles and turns to the crowd.

           HIS POV 

           The Wilting Girl watches from the back of the hall, set
           apart by her spectral pale beauty.  

           She makes eye contact and quickly turns, letting her flaxen
           curls hide her face.  She chews her fingernail.

           BACK TO SCENE 

           Perseus narrows his eyes warily.  The DRUMS stop.

                                 CASSIOPEIA (V.O.)
                        I just want to say a few words.

           INT. GRAND RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Cassiopeia stands front-and-center of the dais with a wine
           cup.  She's a little tipsy but not dead drunk.

                                 CASSIOPEIA
                        This betrothal is more than a
                        celebration.  This betrothal is hope. 
                        And it's peace.  For the first time
                        in over half a century.  That is a
                        truly honorable mandate.
                                (takes a drink)
                        And not one my daughter adopted
                        lightly, believe me.

           Nervous laughter at her apparent joke.

                                 CASSIOPEIA (CONT'D)
                                (dewy-eyed)
                        This betrothal is my daughter growing
                        into a fine young woman.  I'm so
                        proud of her.  Look at her.  Isn't
                        she beautiful? 

           Andromeda rolls her eyes.  Cassiopeia raises her glass.

                                 CASSIOPEIA (CONT'D)
                        More beautiful than all the women of
                        Joppa.  More beautiful than the
                        Terraced Gardens.  More beautiful
                        than the turquoise ocean and its
                        sublime Goddess Tiamat herself. 
                        Look upon the beauty of Humanity-- a
                        beauty even the Goddess envies.

           The crowd falls quiet, a little uneasy from the invocation. 
           Even Andromeda looks wary.  Cassiopeia seems oblivious.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CASSIOPEIA (CONT'D)
                                (blotting tears)
                        I'm sorry.  I'm pretty muddled so I
                        may not sound as poetic as I-

           She stops herself.  A shiver and a look of sudden dread. 
           Gooseflesh prickles the nape of her neck.  

           The room darkens.  The torch-flames turn black. 

           The crowd's restive breaths show like plumes in winter.  

           The statues lining the hall shut their eyes.

           The doors to the hall burst open.

           TIAMAT the Deep walks down the aisle. 

           Her liquid cloak stitched from the oily murk of the
           bottomless sea.  Its folds sound like SURGING TIDES.  Not
           dark, but ultraviolet light flares from under her hood.

           Tiamat steps onto the dais before Cassiopeia.  Shaking,
           Cassiopeia gets to her knees.

                                 TIAMAT
                        You stand before the masses and dare
                        put that frail suckling on a pedestal
                        above the timeless Deep.  You've
                        blasphemed powers past understanding. 
                        You are a braying goat before the
                        unfathomable.  And you will be
                        slaughtered.

           She tears off her cloak which scatters to a fine mist.  

           The Goddess stands naked.  Every inch of skin smolders with
           the frigid bioluminescence of a deep sea creature.  Swirling
           fins in lieu of hair.  Sublime and terrifying.

           Everyone looks away.  But Cassiopeia's too close.  Stricken,
           her eyes wide.  Color drains from her face.  White creeps
           up the roots of her hair.

                                 TIAMAT (CONT'D)
                        Look on the raw body of a Creator of
                        Universes and know your fault.  You'll
                        not blink.  Tell me now, mortal, how
                        bright your preening urchin shines.

           Cassiopeia's strained eyes well with stinging tears.  Tiamat
           addresses the hall without averting her terrible glare from
           the Queen.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        People of Joppa, hear me.  For this
                        boastful creature's sacrilege, I
                        will loose the Leviathan on you.

           The crowd shudders at her mention of "Leviathan." 
           Cassiopeia's body begs to buckle under.  Her eyes flutter
           and roll back, but Tiamat snaps her back to consciousness.

                                 TIAMAT (CONT'D)
                        I'm not finished.  Hold your gaze.
                                (to the people)
                        For thirty days, Joppa shall suffer
                        the scorn of the Leviathan.  And on
                        the final day, what's left of you
                        will be wiped from the earth... 
                        Unless you sacrifice that body so
                        boldly measured against the cosmic-
                        your darling Princessa.

           Andromeda gasps.  Peshet comforts her.

           Past mortal stamina, blood-tears trill from Cassiopeia's
           eyes, but her stare stays frozen by Tiamat's will.

           No one in the hall can bear to look for so long.  No one
           except for Perseus.

                                 TIAMAT (CONT'D)
                        This is my will, Joppa.  Desolation
                        or sacrifice.  Choose your penance.

           Clouds of black sea-ink swirl and swallow Tiamat.  The
           bloated cloud implodes and Tiamat is gone.

           In a flash, the room returns to its prior state.  Cassiopeia
           crashes, palsied and white-haired.  Kepheus and Royal Aides
           rush to her. 

           EXT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT

           Monkfish in the dark with their "lantern" orbs shining on
           their thistly teeth.  They swim above the gray floor over
           undulating tube worms like a meadow of fleshy red tongues.  

           Something spooks them.  The monkfish scatter into the black. 
           The tube worms vanish into their mud tubes.

           A soft, eerie glow swells in the dark- Tiamat.  The Goddess
           glides over the sea bottom.  She stops and raises her palm. 
           The silt swirls and ripples.

           Vast primordial bones rise from the clouds of ocean mud. 
           Gaping jaws.  Cavernous ribcage.  All organizing themselves
           at Tiamat's behest.  Growing muscle and connective tissue.  

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tiamat snaps her fingers.  

           And even she shades her eyes from the blinding flash of
           green light that envelops the bones.  The beast's throbbing
           roar drives an ultrasonic shockwave across the silt.

           EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - NIGHT

           The sea bulges.  And explodes a tower of roiling steam.  An
           apocalytptic surge unrolls from the epicenter and thunders
           for the shores of Joppa.

           EXT. JOPPA'S LOWER WHARF - NIGHT

           Docks and shanties under the cliffs.  Dark.  Asleep. 

           A FISHERMAN tosses his nets from his boat to the dock.  He
           turns to throw the last net and finds the dock rising out
           of reach.  Rather, the water level under his boat, falling.

           The sea pulls away from LOVERS in the shallows.  Exposed, a
           Sfinx Girl SHRIEKS and retreats in one direction as the
           water retreats in the other.  Her Boyfriend watches.  

           Stirred by the girl's scream, RESIDENTS of the Wharf come
           out of their hovels and join the boy on the shore.

           Befuddled, they watch the sea draw back from rocks, shells,
           and rotting wrecks.  A deep RUMBLE shakes the ground at
           their feet.  A few Residents back away, uneasy.

           Most stand, mesmerized by the darkening horizon that seems
           to climb.  Higher and higher.  Eclipsing even the full moon
           which now shines thru the green-blue wall of water.

           By the time they realize it's a colossal wave, it has already
           begun to break and fall upon them.

           The torrent of churning white foam rips thru the crowd and
           splinters the docks.

           It surges thru the streets, pulverizes houses, and dashes
           Residents into the sheer rock and plunging stone stairs as
           it finally crashes against the cliffs.

           INT. ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Cassiopeia lies blank and vapid with wide glassy eyes.  A
           NURSE wipes the drool collected on Cassiopeia's drooping
           lip as Kepheus worries at the window.

           A LOW DRONE grows loud and louder.  It swallows all sound. 
           A deep, EARTH-SHAKING BELLOW like some cosmic crocodile.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           At its peak, the room shudders from the ultrasonic shockwave. 
           Brief but violent.  All furniture lurches.  Dust jumps from
           the seams in the stone floor.  

           Then...  Silence.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        The Leviathan wakes...

           EXT. ANDROMEDA'S BALCONY - NIGHT

           Andromeda stands at the rail, looking out.  She watches as
           PEOPLE scramble and SHOUT thru the streets, all running
           from the seaside of the city.

           She spots Perseus moving in the opposite direction.

           INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ANTE ROOM - NIGHT

           Perseus moves thru the dark, following the sound of urgent
           voices speaking in hushed tones.

                                 AMOUN (O.S.)
                        ...Leviathan- First dweller of the
                        deep.  Hewn by Tiamat from the dark
                        blood of the earth... 

           Perseus follows the sound to the lone pool of dim lamplight
           oozing from the entrance to the Ante Room.  He backs against
           the wall and listens...

           INT. ANTE ROOM - NIGHT

           A somber council of VICEROYS and MINISTERS gathered before
           Kepheus-- who listens with figertips steepled between his
           closed eyes as Amoun reads from a scroll.

                                 AMOUN
                        "...All beasts of the sea are but
                        shadows of his aspects.  Iron is as
                        straw to him, brass as rotten wood,
                        fire as--"
                                (rolling the scroll)
                        All nothing we didn't know as
                        schoolboys: it's colossal, rapacious,
                        and nigh indestructible.

           A grim silence.  All eyes turn to Kepheus for his reaction. 
           The King places his palms flat on the table.  His eyes,
           bloodshot.  His face, exhausted.  He breathes deep.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        There's only one thing to be done...

                                 AMOUN
                        Majesty, you can't be considering-- 
                        We have thirty days to respond.  We
                        should not rush to--

                                 KEPHEUS
                        Yes, thirty days, just long enough
                        to toy with us!  You think it'll get
                        easier to sacrifice my girl?!  After
                        a month of whatever plagues are in
                        store?!  You think I can gamble the
                        whole city for one extra month with
                        my ill-fated daughter?!

           No one presumes to respond.  Kepheus stands and faces the
           frescoed wall, his hands clasped firmly behind his back.

                                 KEPHEUS (CONT'D)
                        She's already dead.  Just like her
                        mother...  Make the preparations.

           Incensed, Perseus suddenly bursts into the Ante Room.

                                 PERSEUS
                        No!  Coward!  You can't!  She doesn't
                        deserve this fate!

                                 KEPHEUS
                        What is this?!

                                 PERSEUS
                        How can you give in?!  We are Man
                        and we are finished bowing to the
                        Gods! You have a month to find
                        Leviathan's weakness...

                                 KEPHEUS
                        I could have a year and it would
                        still be a cruel joke!  I defy you
                        to find anyone in Joppa mad enough
                        to pursue such a hopeless quest!

           Perseus swallows hard and sets his jaw.

                                 PERSEUS
                        I will.  I'll do it.  

           Amoun looks up, barely able to conceal a swell of pride for
           his former student.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        If there's a trick to slaying
                        Leviathan, I'll find it.  If I fail,
                        the losses will be great, yes.  But
                        at least you can face your daughter
                        for the next thirty days and yourself

                        for every day after.  But if I
                        prevail...  The city and its Princessa
                        are saved and the War is over.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        You're just a --

                                 PERSEUS
                        I don't know what I am...  But I was
                        vital enough to be stolen here, so
                        maybe some benefit of the doubt isn't
                        ill-suited!

                                 KEPHEUS
                        Amoun?

                                 AMOUN
                        He is the one foretold to bring
                        peace...

                                 KEPHEUS
                        And you've heard this Leviathan is
                        indestructible?

                                 PERSEUS
                        I don't believe it is.  Do you?

                                 AMOUN
                        He could lead an expedition... 
                        Majesty, we could seek the counsel
                        of the Norn Sisters of Skolothia. 
                        Powerful oracles who know much of
                        Gods' hidden ways.  If Leviathan can
                        be slain, they'd know how...

           Kepheus approaches Perseus and studies him carefully.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        You really believe you can do this?

                                 PERSEUS
                        Majesty... I was born to do this.

           The thunderous sound of GALLOPING HOOVES... 

                                 AMOUN (V.O.)
                        You won't be alone, Perseus.  Your
                        labour will be bolstered by the full
                        brunt of Joppa's resources...

           EXT. THE STEPPES - DAY

           Horse HOOVES BEAT the short blue grass.  Two hard riders
           dash across the stark, endless plain.

                        Tamburlane.  Father and son monster
                        hunters from out of the steppes of
                        the Far East.  The Kingdom of the
                        Iron Horde.

           MONGKE (father) and TAMBURLANE (son), surly nail-eating
           Mongol warriors with plates of boiled leather armour.

           Their hair and fu manchus braided with talons and fangs
           whip like black flames on the wind as they ride to Joppa.

           INT. PRAETORIUM ARMORY - DAY

           Rows of gleaming helmets, swords, shields.

                        Your escort, a special detachment of
                        the elite Praetorian Guard.

           The Praetorian Guard (eight in all), commanded by the square-
           jawed old soldier- DRACO, select their arms and strap on
           their armour and belts.

           KOSMO (Draco's lieutenant), ABAS, ICOS, THAD, BOREAS, KRIKOR,
           and POLLUC round out the two-fisted lot.

           INT. TRIBUNAL CHAMBERS - DAY

           Cheops stands at the center of a semicircular room in
           manacles before an ARCHON who sits at a marble lectern.

                        We've even retained an embedded
                        rhapsode, tasked with documenting
                        the expedition for posterity.

                                 ARCHON
                        Time served and an allotted interval
                        of civil service.  Dictum.

           The Archon STRIKES a granite pestle on his lectern.

           INT. ANTE ROOM - NIGHT

           Amoun sweeps clear the central table and unrolls a map. 
           His finger traces the dotted route.

                                 AMOUN
                        We take the Via Dahlia North until
                        it hits into Disputed Territories. 
                        Then, we'll liaise with Commander

           Amoun takes a step back from the maps and crosses his arms
           in approval.  Perseus stares, tense.

                                 PERSEUS
                        We go to the oracles.  They tell us
                        Leviathan's weakness.  We come back
                        before the month is out and we-- 
                        I...  I slay the Leviathan.

           EXT. JOPPA CITY GATE - DAY

           The expedition assembles at the big cedar doors.

           Amoun and Draco look over a map.  The Praetorians linger.

           Mongke and Tamburlane organize their gear.  The outsiders-
           indigestible, hard-bitten professional monster killers who
           speak only their language and not a word of english.

           Perseus talks to Cheops.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Civil service?  What was the charge?

                                 CHEOPS
                        Indecency.  I'd forgotten a bit of
                        the Promethiad.  And some stuffy old
                        dotards took offense at my rescript. 
                        Gods forbid we spice the yarn with a
                        pinch of carnal intrigue.  As if my
                        brilliant improvisation wasn't an
                        improvement.

                                 PERSEUS
                        And how's that?

                                 CHEOPS
                                (schoolboy glee)
                        Well, Pandora's bathing and Jove's
                        peeping from underwater, right? 
                        When he gets very aroused.  So he
                        turns himself into a strapping sea-
                        mule with a colossal priapus- 

           He indicates with outstretched hands, Perseus stops him.  

           Draco interrupts, back-slapping Perseus and squeezing his
           shoulder.  Draco chews on the end of a reed, a facetious
           twinkle very slightly colours his stolid soldier's mug.

                        I'm just trying to matter.

                        Good for you, son.  I'm Commander
                        Draco and those are my Praetorians--

           Perseus looks to a cluster of hardened soldiers.  They look
           Perseus over, make knowing eye-contact with Draco, and
           chuckle before turning to talk amongst themselves.

                                 DRACO (CONT'D)
                        And son if you need help with
                        anything, don't hesitate to ask.

           Draco moves on to muster his soldiers.  Perseus spies the
           Wilting Girl lingering among the retinue.  He finds Amoun
           without taking his eyes off the Wilting Girl.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Amoun, the Goddess won't be joining

                        Who?  The Chthonian?  She offered
                        and I'm not of the inclination to
                        turn away a resource of her powers.

                                 PERSEUS
                        She didn't leave me with the rosiest
                        of first impressions is all.

                                 AMOUN
                        Loosen the snare on her.  She was
                        only doing her job.

           The Wilting Girl looks up.  She didn't hear them.  But she
           knows what they've been talking about.

                                 AMOUN (CONT'D)
                        Everyone!  Let's get moving!

           The heavy cedar doors to the outside world swing open.  The
           expedition musters and leaves the city walls.

           EXT. THE EDGE OF SPACE

           Tiamat floats two-hundred miles above terra firma, the
           Mezzosea and peninsula of Illyria sprawls across the soft,
           glowing curvature of the earth below.

           She draws lazy circles with her finger, as if stirring tea. 
           A massive vortex of storm clouds follows her motions, winding
           itself around a tight "eye."

           Set the Void approaches.

                        The demigod and his retinue are

                        seek the frailty of my Leviathan.

                        To plainly thwart them would betray

                        draw the ire of the other Olympians.

                        the road to Skolothia is hazardous. 
                        I'd be entertained by your account
                        of any "accidents."

                        I understand.

           Set dissipates in a cloud of dust particles that whirl streak
           back to earth, a fine drizzle of light.

           Tiamat smirks as she resumes stirring the storm clouds
           tighter and tighter.  Bigger and bigger.  Engulfing Joppa.

           EXT. JOPPA'S ACROPOLIS - DAY

           A torrential deluge batters the high city of the clifftops. 
           White water streams thru the sloped streets and alleys and
           cascades down the cliffs as new waterfalls.

           INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - DAY

           A doorless arch to her balcony provides an outside view.  
           A jagged web of lightning crackles thru the menacing clouds. 
           Rain pounds the tiles of the balcony. 

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Just inside, in a room painted with lush frescoes and
           furnished with all the trappings of a king's only daughter,
           Peshet keeps a very bored Andromeda company. 

           Andromeda mopes over to the balcony and cranes her neck to
           take stock of the gliding torch-lights from the guards.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        He's stepped up the guard rotations?

                                 PESHET
                        I believe so...

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        This ennui is just crushing...

                                 PESHET
                        We'll wait it out.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Peshet, you and I...  We're mates,
                        yes?  We're comrades in mischief.

                                 PESHET
                        My Lady, no...  Don't do this...

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        I can't just sit in here, Peshet!

                                 PESHET
                        I don't think you understand the
                        gravity of the situation.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        No?  Tell me where your outlook would
                        differ...  In thirty days, life, as
                        you know it, is ending.  Either by
                        the knot of a hastily arranged
                        marriage or by the wrath of a Goddess. 
                        And you have no sway in it.  For one
                        month, do you really sit, politely
                        waiting for the verdict?  Or do you
                        raise almighty Hades like it's the
                        last month of your life?

                                 PESHET
                        You can't sneak out...

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Peshet--

                                 PESHET
                        I would have to stop you, my Lady. 
                        It's too dangerous.

           Andromeda turns away and superficially busies herself.

                                 PESHET
                        I'm sorry, my Lady, but I --

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        I understand, Peshet.  Don't worry.

                                 PESHET
                        You're not going to sneak out?

           EXT. THE VIA DAHLIA - AFTERNOON

           The road weaves thru fertile terraced vineyards... 

           SUPERIMPOSE: The Via Dahlia, Outbound from Joppa...  
           28 Days Remaining...

           A crumbling, limestone triumphal arch.  Time-worn letters
           on the arcing bricks read: "VIA DAHLIA."

                                 DRACO
                        Alright men.  We make camp here for
                        the night.  

           The expedition stops.  The Praetorians set up camp.

                                 DRACO (CONT'D)
                        And don't steal the farmer's grapes.

           Vidalia keeps an eye halfway on Perseus.

           He sits nearby on a broken pillar, looks over the rolling
           vineyards to Joppa's skyline, still barely visible behind
           the curtains of rain from a distant storm.

           She looks away just as he turns and sees her sitting there.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Lo, you, over here.

           She ignores him.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                                (louder)
                        Oi!

           Still no acknowledgement.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        Chthonian!

           He tosses a pebble to her feet.  She looks up.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        I can feel you inspecting me from
                        the corner of your eye.  Makes me
                        nervous.

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        I apologize.

                                 PERSEUS
                        What am I supposed to call you anyway? 
                        You have a name mere mortals are
                        allowed to say?

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        I don't have a name.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Who do your worshipers pray to?

                                 WILTING GIRL
                        I can't remember.

                                 PERSEUS
                        What sort of goddess forgets her 
                        own name?  Goddess of Fugues?  Goddess
                        of Amnesia perhaps?

           The Wilting Girl humbly takes the beating in silence,
           suddenly leaving Perseus a bit self-conscious of his cruelty.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        Well I have to call you something...

           He looks around.  He sees the triumphal arch and the words-

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        What about... "Via Dahlia?"  Or...
                        "Vidalia?"  What about "Vidalia?"

           She whips about with an angry frown...

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        Alright, maybe that's not-

           ...but instantly softens when she sees his candor.

                                 VIDALIA
                        No.  No, I was afraid you were
                        mocking...  "Vidalia" is... nice.

           EXT. THE VIA DAHLIA - LATER

           Ever the loner, Perseus broods restlessly at the periphery
           of the group.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Mongke and Tamburlane emerge from the woods with armfuls of
           timber and kindling.  They dump it in the fire pit.

           Draco glances up from striking his flintstone on the blade
           of his dagger.  He examines the pit.

                                 DRACO
                        A little more yet.

           Mongke and Tamburlane just stare at him, unreadable.  Either
           not comprehending or annoyed by the order.

                                 DRACO (CONT'D)
                        It has to last all night.

                                 PERSEUS
                                (interjecting)
                        I'll find some more.

           He grabs a gladius sword and hacks into the woods.

           EXT. VIA DAHLIA WOODS - AFTERNOON

           Perseus hacks low-hanging branches as he climbs thru the
           dense rocky wood.

           Not paying attention, he slashes at a trunk.  TING.  The
           steel sparks on the "trunk." Perseus pulls away the vines
           to find not a trunk but a stone column.

           He notices mossy steps cut into the limestone rise.  Overcome
           with curiosity, he climbs the steps.

           He crests the top to find an overgrown building.

           EXT. DILAPIDATED THERMAE - AFTERNOON

           The ruins of a public bath.  Roof, long stripped away.  A
           rectangular pool under sky, cloistered by a peristyle.  

           Vines wrap the columns and crumbling sculpted supports. 
           Blue-violet water lilies float on the forgotten pool. 

           Perseus enters and pauses at the water's edge, taken by
           this pocket of derelict beauty.

           He pans his eyes over the scene and finally sees Vidalia
           standing on the cornerwise rim, her back to the water.  

           He opens his mouth to catch her attention but...

           She loosens her bandeau, slips it over her head, and off.

           Perseus freezes.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She hooks her thumbs under her belt and slides the feathered
           linen strips of her skirt to the stone floor.  Naked and
           still oblivious, she begins to turn around.

           Perseus quickly crouches behind a sculpted support.  He
           peers thru the leafy vines that snarl the sculpture.

           The space between leaves offers a tantalizingly broken view
           of her body as she dips her toes in the water.  She dives
           in with a sleek SPLASH.

                                 PERSEUS
                                (whispering to himself)
                        Rein yourself in, Perseus.  Just
                        turn around and walk away.

           He doesn't.  He locks onto the pool, unblinking...

           Vidalia surfaces and throws her hair back to shake off an
           exquisite arch of water.

           She drifts on her back and looks sadly into the sky.

           Perseus fixates on the sadness in her eyes.  It worries his
           brow and alters the tenor of this whole stolen vigil.

           The first raindrops peck sparse concentric ripples.

           Then the sky opens up.  A minor outgrowth of the Joppa storm. 
           The cloudburst pelts the pool.

           Vidalia floats on her back, her contours tease the roused
           surface.  The water spikes and bounces in the downpour. 
           She closes her eyes and cracks her lips to taste the rain.

           A tentative smile moves over her serene face.

           Perseus's HEART POUNDS in his ears as he watches.  A flash
           of lightning.

           KRA-KOOM!- the thunder hits on his heartbeat uncannily.

           Even Vidalia seems instantly clued to his presence.  She
           quickly looks over her shoulder.  She huddles in the water.

           Perseus sinks unseen into the shadows of the peristyle.

           Vidalia cedes and swims back to her clothes.

           Safely out of sight, Perseus rests his back against a wall
           and catches his breath.  His face flushes with brio and a
           premonition of a new dilemma.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        Pull it together...
           EXT. THE VIA DAHLIA - NIGHT

           A wet sheen from the departed rain glistens over everything
           in the ochre light of the campfire.  Vidalia rests in the
           dark bough of a tree.  

           The Praetorians laugh and cook meat over the cinders.  Mongke
           and Tamburlane have the biggest slabs and, in their language,
           unsubtly mock the soldiers' girlish appetites.

           Perseus nearby- his raw, skinned rabbit laid aside.  He
           putters with his extra firewood- a sharp stick and two Y-
           branches.  He idly smoothes the cleft in one of the Y's.

           Cheops tunes the fret of his bouzouki and strums.

                                 CHEOPS
                        A fright story, eh?  Well which one? 
                        The Abduction of Persephone?

           Perseus cleaves a slot down the end of his sharp stick.  He
           leaves his dagger wedged and lashes it with strips of bark.

                                 PERSEUS
                        You know the Gorgoneion?

           Cheops looks up from his bouzouki.  Everyone falls silent. 
           Only CRICKETS.  The soldiers shift, suddenly nervous.  

           Mongke and Tamburlane cock their heads, riveted.  Chewing
           on a blade of grass, Amoun shakes his head and scoffs.

                                 CHEOPS
                        The Rape of Medusa...  Of course... 
                        What?  I look like an amateur?

                                 KOSMO
                        Rhapsode, I'll give you a fifty obols
                        not to recite that black verse. 
                        You'll bring the sky down on us.

                                 CHEOPS
                        What's wrong, soldier?  Afraid of a
                        story?  It's the Illumined Age. 
                        Superstition belongs in the past.

           He plucks a GHOSTLY, STARK AURA on his bouzouki.

                        Medusa was a tender young woman once-
                        a rare mortal creature born with
                        beauty to tempt even the Gods.  And
                        it would prove her undoing.  For one
                        night, on the road home, she caught
                        the eye of Set the Void, God of
                        Deserts and Entropy.

                        A hungry breath prickled her neck
                        and her blood ran like ice.

           - A wind chills her.  She turns, quick.  She drops the
           pitcher and runs.

           - The shattered pitcher.  Broken shards of an etched woman
           carrying water, painted in ochre.  A shadow passes swiftly
           over the pieces, in pursuit of Medusa.

                        prey hiding in Tiamat's Temple.

           - A thickly columned hypostyle hall in a temple of Tiamat. 
           A hooded SET crouches low in the shadows enfolding something
           obscured by his windswept red cloak.

                        He held her to the stones.  And she
                        fathomed with revelatory horror the
                        heartless passion of a God.

           - The cloak ripples as shapes push thru the flowing spectral
           folds- reaching fingers, a screaming face.

                        Left despoiled and broken in the
                        shadow of Tiamat's altar, she prayed
                        for comfort and pleaded for courage. 

           - Her bloody fingernails dig into the stone as she drags
           herself across the floor, shivering and broken.

                        But the Deep regarded Medusa as a
                        used-up object of euphoria; a soiled
                        passion-doll or a drained hookah. 
                        The prayers of such a frail and filthy
                        instrument angered Tiamat.

           - A nearby idol of Tiamat chiseled from black crystal opens
           her searing eyes, throwing a long shadow of Medusa down the
           hypostyle.

                        So the Goddess responded with an
                        unthinkable reckoning, twisting Medusa
                        into a loathsome new thing.

           - That contorting shadow tells the process of transformation. 
           Legs cross and twist and snap until joints turn pulpy and
           vague and become a single slithering tail.

                        would petrify flesh to look upon.

           - In the crackling light from the idol, the shadow yanks
           her hair out in handfuls.  Snake heads peck and wriggle
           from her skull like hatchlings from a leathery egg.

                        beyond the frozen Tethys Sea.  There,
                        she dwells still.

           - A scorching and frigid land of cracked volcanic glass and
           veins of magma.  Thru the silently clashing elements of
           rippling heat and swirling snowfall, a 'Pitched Temple'-
           foundation sunken crooked into a dried lavaflow.

                        reptilian instinct.  And one raw
                        shrieking memory of pure hate...  

           - The shadows between the temple's broken pillars- a
           woman/serpent-shaped darkness crawls and slithers.  It looks
           up.  Glowing eyes.  And a vicious HISSING SCREAM-

                        dead stone casts adorning her Pitched
                        Temple...

           Grave silence.  

           Mongke misreads it and lets loose a sidesplitting GUFFAW. 
           Tamburlane nudges his dad and shoots him a look- "you've
           mistaken the genre."  Mongke abruptly clears his throat.

                                 AMOUN
                                (scoffing)
                        Just the sight of her turns you to
                        stone, is that about right?

                        look is literally petrifying.

           Amoun shakes his head.  Draco realizes his dinner remains
           on the fire, a casualty of his preoccupation with the story. 
           He removes the meat- charred and hardened by the heat.

           Perseus gathers his scraps of wood and his rabbit.  He plants
           each Y upright on the sides of the fire, skewers the rabbit,
           and fixes the sharp stick across the Y's.

           He cranks the spit with the hilt of his lashed dagger, evenly
           roasting the rabbit.  Draco balks with an "aren't you clever"
           look.  Perseus smirks right back- "I am."

           INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Peshet enters carrying a tray and a bowl of stew.

                                 PESHET
                        My Lady, I have your--

           She stops dead in her tracks.  Her cat eyes dart around the
           empty chambers.  Her pupils shrink to shocked slits.

                                 PESHET (CONT'D)
                        No...

           She drops the tray and runs out.

           EXT. PLUTO ORKESTAR - NIGHT

           Andromeda stands alone on the empty, ravaged terrace.  The
           plaintive, whistling wind tugs at her drab shawl.

           The sailcloth canopy hangs in shredded, tatters.  Andromeda's
           sandals CRUNCH shards of broken wine bottles that litter
           the floor as she steps with mounting gloom.

           She moves past the broken, upturned tables and chairs to
           the edge of the terrace.

           She looks out over the black ocean and catches CROWD SOUNDS
           on the wind, wafting up from the Lower Wharf...

           EXT. JOPPA'S LOWER WHARF - NIGHT

           Andromeda navigates the steep, winding, narrow stairs and
           roads choked with debris, decay, and traumatized survivors
           of the tsunamis.

           Andromeda watches as the LONG-HAIRED SFINX GIRL weeps and
           mumbles as she drags her boyfriend's broken corpse by the
           arms across the cobblestone.

                                 SFINX GIRL
                        I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm-

           A feeble OLD MAN leans on a cane as he wanders confused
           amidst the rubble of his house and bodies of his family.

           Andromeda calls out to him, her voice weak and uncertain.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Sir...

                        Sir, do you-- ?

           She stops, surprised when the Old Man looks suddenly up.

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                        Do you need any help?

           The Old Man narrows his eyes at her, conjuring the whole
           thought from his mind.  He raises a bony finger.

                                 OLD MAN
                        I know you...  I know you!

           Andromeda shakes her head and slowly backs away.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.  I
                        was just-- I was trying to help.

                                 OLD MAN
                        I know you!  You're the one she wants! 
                        You're the reason for this!

           Andromeda draws her shawl tight.  She turns and bolts away
           before the Old Man calls any more attention to her.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT'D)

           Peshet searches the ruined Wharf for Andromeda.  

           But the devastation abruptly swerves her shocked attention.

           A spotted LEOPARD SFINX TODDLER tries in vain to nurse at
           his dead MOTHER's bosom.

           Too much for her, Peshet holds her mouth, trembling as tears
           spill down her cheeks.  A human boy, an ALLEY URCHIN suddenly
           taps her shoulder.

                        Appalled?  Take action...

           He hands her a scrap of papyrus and quickly moves along. 
           She faintly hears him say something similar to someone else. 
           She looks down at the papyrus and reads...

           "the Taverna Charybdis - Become the Cataracts"

           INT. TAVERNA CHARYBDIS - NIGHT

           The PROPRIETOR leads her down a short, narrow hall and raps
           on the heavy wooden door.

           A slot opens.  The Proprietor takes the papyrus from Peshet
           and passes it thru the opening.

           The slot closes.  BOLTS SLIDE.  CHAINS RATTLE.  The door
           swings open.  Peshet cautiously enters the smoke and noise.

           INT. BACKROOM OF TAVERNA CHARYBDIS - NIGHT

           She finds a crowded cloak-&-dagger rally in progress.

           A standard hangs at the head of the chamber- a sheet crossed
           by a pattern of rolling whorls suggesting waves breaking on
           the ocean- deep blue on white.

           A man shouts to the hot-blooded crowd from the rostrum.  We
           may recognize him as Fantasos, the evangelist briefly
           glimpsed on the streets at the start.  

           Here he bellows not about religion but revolution.  To a
           far more alert audience at that.

                                 FANTASOS
                        Devastation.  Ruin.  And does he
                        care?  No!  The only thing Kepheus
                        cares about is the Princessa- An
                        epicure, rank and rotten to core! 
                        She's just another up-and-coming
                        ruler who won't give a bilge about
                        the strife of Joppa's Lower Wharf.

           Peshet moves thru the crowd.

                                 FANTASOS (CONT'D)
                        Last night, we lost homes, trades,
                        families to the wave.  And where are
                        our leaders?  Cloistered away on the
                        high ground, that's where!

           Peshet looks at the people around her.  Angry applause. 
           Fists shaking in the air.

                        here believes Kepheus has dug the
                        trench at the water's edge?

           Furious cries of "NO" from the crowd.  Maybe it's the sting
           of Andromeda's spite, maybe sympathy for the people, but
           Peshet finds herself replying along with them.

                                 FANTASOS (CONT'D)
                        No!  He's dug it at his daughter's
                        chamber door!  I say let's show
                        Kepheus we're not disposable.  We're
                        more than just the bricks in his
                        bulwark!  We're an angry torrent!  A
                        surging cataract!  And we will tremble
                        the walls of his Basilica to the
                        very foundation!

           The small room explodes with approval.  The energy overcomes
           Peshet.  She shouts and raises her fist too.

                                 FANTASOS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        "Peshet" is it?  It must be fate
                        that you are here tonight...

           EXT. BEHIND THE TAVERNA CHARYBDIS - NIGHT

           A dank alley.  Peshet talks with Fantasos as he locks up.

                                 FANTASOS
                        ...You work in the inner corridors
                        of the Basilica and you could be
                        indispensable to our cause...

           He sighs and thinks.  He finally leans close to Peshet and
           speaks- hushed, measured, and with great import.

                                 FANTASOS (CONT'D)
                        The question is-- what are you willing
                        to do to help?

           Peshet draws a deep breath and doesn't answer right away.  

           INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Peshet moves in a fatigued daze.  She cracks Andromeda's
           door and peers in...

           INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Dark.  Lamps doused.  Peshet's eyes adjust.

           She sees a modest lump under the sheets and tendrils of
           black hair splayed across the white pillows.  She breathes
           a sigh of relief and quietly shuts the door.

           But Andromeda is not asleep.  She lays motionless in bed. 
           Eyes open, preoccupied and frightened.

           EXT. CEDAR FOREST - AFTERNOON

           The huge trunks of oldgrowth cedars shoot up and mushroom
           into a broad canopy of fir branches, eclipsing all but the
           most modest streaks of sun from the mossy stones below.

           SUPERIMPOSE: The Cedar Forest of the Illyrian Border... 
           24 Days Remaining...

           There, HUMBABA slumbers.  A dinosaurian dragon.  Leathery
           hide- scales and spines- sagging.  Short arms.  Strong,
           three-taloned legs.  Eyes in the shadows of duel horns.

           It's ribcage rises and falls.  A wind stirs the shrubs and
           leaves around it.

           Suddenly, Set is there.  He soothingly strokes the sleeping
           monster's head.  His hand turns partially transparent.

           With that spectral hand, Set reaches inside Humbaba's skull. 
           The animal goes stiff.  Its leg twitches.

                                 SET
                        Listen, creature.  Let my instructions
                        be seared to your humble mind as
                        natural law.  Listen.

           Its eyes shoot open.  Its pupils shrink to pinpoints.

                                 SET (CONT'D)
                        You're starving.  Your gut says you'll
                        soon perish.  And no earthly meat
                        will still that ache.  You hunger
                        for the flesh of a demigod...

           EXT. CEDAR FOREST ROAD - AFTERNOON

           Nearby, the expedition rests in the midst of a break.  Not
           present, Perseus, Draco, Icos, and Boreas.

           EXT. CEDAR FOREST CLEARING - AFTERNOON

           A heard of PEGASSI graze, but none the white winged horse. 
           These Pegassi brandish the motley colours of wild mustangs-
           piebald, roan, gray, dappled- all with matching wings.

           Perseus, Draco, Boreas and Icos crouch in a thicket.

                        a Pegasus.

                                 ICOS
                        Didn't Bellerofonte tame a Pegasus?

                                 BOREAS
                        Yes, Icos, I believe you're right. 
                        And he was a demigod too...

                                 DRACO
                        I'm just not wild about explaining
                        to Amoun how we got our boy here
                        bucked from a thousand feet.

           Boreas and Draco burst into hushed laughter.

                                 PERSEUS
                        What's so funny?

                                 DRACO
                        A thousand feet, Commander?  He's
                        not even getting on its back.

           Perseus squints defiantly at them.  He pushes out of the
           underbrush and purposefully marches towards the Pegassi.

           The Pegassi prick up their ears at the intruder.  Perseus
           shoots a "watch this" look over his shoulder and confidently
           approaches a dappled gray and black Pegasus.

           He holds up his palms.  The Pegasus WHINNIES and skittishly
           backs away.  But Perseus keeps coming for it.

           And it keeps backing up, increasingly agitated.  It threshes
           its big wings at Perseus, smacking him with gusts.

           When Perseus still continues to advance, the Pegasus rears
           up, flaps its wings and leaps clear over Perseus's head.

           It lands behind Perseus before he can turn, bucks its hind
           legs, and kicks Perseus face first into the dirt.

           Perseus rolls over and spits sod from his mouth.  He looks
           over to Draco, Boreas, and Icos laughing in the bushes.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Humbaba storms from the thicket.  Perseus clambers back.

           The Pegassi take flight.  The Humbaba lunges and grabs one
           in his compact, bulldoggish muzzle, rips the wings in a fit
           of bloody feathers, and swallows the rest whole.

           Humbaba turns his thickset head to face Perseus and the
           others- his jagged toothy chops bloody and slavering. 

                                 DRACO (CONT'D)
                        Icos- fetch the beast slayers.  Boreas-
                        flank me.  Perseus- get out of here.

           Icos bolts.  Draco and Boreas plant their feet and draw
           their swords.  Perseus sees this and does the same.

                                 DRACO (CONT'D)
                        I thought I told you to run, boy.

                                 PERSEUS
                        You going to chase me, old man?

                                 DRACO
                        Alright, just stay at my back.

           The monster looms over them.

                                 PERSEUS
                        What is it?

           EXT. CEDAR FOREST ROAD - AFTERNOON

           The rest of the expedition already look wide-eyed into the
           woods, hearing the echoing predatory ROARS.  Icos bursts
           from the tree line, out of breath.

                                 ICOS
                        It's a Humbaba...  Perseus, Draco,
                        Boreas- all still out there.  They
                        need the monster hunters.

           Mongke and Tamburlane, already rushing into the woods. 
           Vidalia follows.

           EXT. CEDAR FOREST CLEARING - AFTERNOON

           The reinforcements arrive just in time to see Humbaba pin
           Boreas with its hind talons.  It leans down, swiftly rips
           the soldier's head off, and swallows the ragged morsel.

                                 DRACO
                        Boreas!

                                 VIDALIA
                        Commander!  What happened?

                                 DRACO
                        Perseus was trying to climb on a
                        wild Pegasus and- 

           She shoots Perseus a reproaching look over her shoulder.

                                 DRACO (CONT'D)
                        The thing just came out of nowhere.

           Vidalia spins her shepherd's sling and pitches lead sling-
           bullets, her aim sharp and speed fierce.  The glinting
           streaks punch clean thru the monster's body.

           Tamburlane unwraps a gun, or gonne rather- a tube of iron,
           cast in the shape of an open-mouthed lion, a shoulder-mounted
           cannon, an ancient bazooka.

           He shoulders the gonne.  Mongke loads a cannonball, stuffs
           the muzzle, and backs away.  Tamburlane lights the fuse.

           KA-BOOM!  The iron lion belches a spume of smoke, throwing
           a slash of fire and metal that slams into and bounces off
           the Humbaba's hide.

           The Humbaba staggers, steps forward, chomps down on Mongke,
           and swallows.  Tamburlane doesn't seem moved.

                                 PERSEUS
                        How can it take such a beating?

                                 VIDALIA
                        Something planted a cruel delusion
                        in its mind.  It's healthy but it
                        thinks its starving.

           The Humbaba's eyes bulge with surprise.  A saber ruptures
           up thru its nose.  Its jaws prize open from inside...

           Mongke lifts the roof of the beast's mouth with his saber.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        It's a powerful curse.  I can't
                        reverse it.  But if the monster's
                        hungry, I can feed it.

           Vidalia raises her arms and shuts her eyes.  A growing
           cyclone of CAWING ravens descends from the sky in the
           hundreds.  The Humbaba ROARS.

           The ravens dive straight into its mouth.  A constant stream
           of mad black birds throwing themselves desperately into its
           jaws, scrambling and squeezing down its throat.

           The Humbaba panics and tries to shake them away but they
           keep forcing themselves in.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           It throws its head back in a desperate effort to swallow
           the choking swarm.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        Now!  The belly!  Slash the belly!

           Mongke runs, lunges, and sweeps his blade up Humbaba's
           exposed belly.  Steaming purple entrails spill over Mongke
           and across the ground.  Humbaba crashes to the ground.

           In the dusty aftermath, crows liberated from Humbaba's gut
           shake the viscera off their feathers and take flight.

           EXT. THE CEDAR FOREST - AFTERNOON

           Vidalia storms back to the road.  Perseus catches up.

                                 PERSEUS
                        What was that look for?  That look
                        when Draco told you I was trying to
                        mount a Pegasus?

                                 VIDALIA
                        What do you think?

                                 PERSEUS
                        I didn't beckon the Humbaba.

                                 VIDALIA
                        That's not the point at all.

                                 PERSEUS
                        What is?

                                 VIDALIA
                        Next time you have a bad idea, try
                        not to be so human about it.

                                 PERSEUS
                        I am half God too, you know...

                                 VIDALIA
                        Right, that's not the hotheaded half. 
                        That's not the sophomoric, head-in-
                        the-clouds, arbitrarily overbold,
                        tries-to-ride-a-pegasus half.

                                 PERSEUS
                        You are a Goddess.  Of course you're
                        aloof to the Spirit of Man.

           Vidalia stops, turns, and confronts Perseus dead-on.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                 VIDALIA
                        Oh yes, just another tyrannical
                        Goddess, denying you that uniquely
                        human privilege of destroying
                        yourself.  How little I must care
                        for the Spirit of Man.

           She whirls around and leaves Perseus in her dust.

           EXT. PHRYGANA SCRUBLAND - NIGHT

           Perseus sits by the dimly blazing campfire on the moonlit
           thorny scrub.  He reaches in his satchel for an astrolabe-
           a geared device slightly larger than a pocketwatch.

           On its face, a dial, date meter, and rotating zodiac wheel-
           Helios the sun, Selene the moon, and unfamiliar symbols-
           Pandora, Luxifer, Pyroeis, Isis, and Chronos.

           Perseus holds it to the sky, turns the dial until the moon
           and another symbol line with the real moon and a nearby
           star.  The date rolls to Elfabolion 10th, Ano 3110.

                        Can't sleep?

           Perseus turns.  Amoun approaches from behind.

                        What clever craftsmanship...

           Amoun hands him back the astrolabe.

                        Amoun...  You knew about me, didn't

           Amoun doesn't say anything for a moment.

           A MERMAID BELLY DANCER gyrates in a big glass cauldron in a
           market stall.  Her fish scales scintillate thru the tinted
           glass.  A voice calls thru the crowded market.

           A YOUNG ANDROMEDA (aged 8) walks alongside a YOUNG PESHET
           (aged 16/17) past narrow stalls packed with fish, clams,
           prawn.  Peshet moves down a row of watery barrels.

                                 YOUNG ANDROMEDA
                        What are you looking for?

                                 YOUNG PESHET
                        Dinner.

           Andromeda curls her tiny fingers over the lip of the barrel
           and stands tip-toe to peek inside...

           Packed full of squirming, sliding octopi in just a little
           mucky dark water. 

                                 YOUNG ANDROMEDA
                        They're alive!

                                 YOUNG PESHET
                        Your father wanted fresh octopus.

                                 YOUNG ANDROMEDA
                        You can't eat them!  Look!  They're
                        just trapped.  They can't get away!

                                 YOUNG PESHET
                        Nobody will miss them, my lady. 
                        They're slimy and slithering.  It's
                        disgusting.

                                 YOUNG ANDROMEDA
                        They're just trying to get away!

                                 YOUNG PESHET
                        How are you the only little girl who
                        isn't disgusted by live octopus?

           Andromeda bunches her tiny fists and tightens her jaw as
           she glares up at Peshet.

                                 YOUNG ANDROMEDA
                        Peshet, if you take one octopus, I
                        will scream and scream all the way
                        to the Basilica.  I will scream that
                        a murderer is abducting the
                        Princessa...

                                 YOUNG PESHET
                        Oh, very well, my lady.  No octopus
                        tonight.

           Peshet takes Andromeda's hand.  They walk away.

                                 YOUNG PESHET (CONT'D)
                        Why do you care so much?

                                 YOUNG ANDROMEDA
                        Someone has to.  They're just all
                        trapped in that barrel.

                                 YOUNG PESHET
                        Such a brave little girl...  Such a
                        mighty compassion... 

           Andromeda eyes Peshet.  She looks down at Andromeda... 
           It's Tiamat...

                                 TIAMAT
                        A worthy sacrifice...

           Andromeda (suddenly at her present age) yanks her hand away
           and opens her mouth to scream but only air bubbles come
           out.  The whole market is under water.

           The sailcloth awnings billow to the slow fluid currents. 
           All the dead fish in the stalls and on the lines come alive
           and swarm around.  Tiamat drifts close to Andromeda.

                        shall come for you in the night. 
                        And feed you to Leviathan.  Your
                        compassion bids you to succumb.  You
                        would not fight it.  You cannot fight
                        it.  Your future is merciful
                        desolation.  Irrevocable...

           A huge shadow darkens the alley.  Andromeda and Tiamat look
           up.  A monstrous silhouette swims overhead.

                                 TIAMAT (CONT'D)
                        The Leviathan...  It hungers...

           INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT - PRESENT

           Andromeda wakes with a start, drenched in a cold sweat as
           if she truly had just surfaced from the sea.  She gasps to
           catch her breath, still terrified.

           EXT. ROAD IN THE SIROQUE MOUNTAINS - DAY

           SUPERIMPOSE: The Siroque Mountains, Disputed Territory... 
           19 Days Remaining...

           The expedition moves thru barren, jagged mountain passes. 
           A dry, rocky desert of gouged and frayed sierras.

                                 CHEOPS
                        This all seems a little much, no?  A
                        city held hostage and a hero's quest. 
                        Because- What?-  the Queen insulted
                        Tiamat's hair?

                                 KOSMO
                        What do you expect, rhapsode?  They're
                        Gods and they went to war to make
                        sure everyone knew it.

                                 AMOUN
                        And Tiamat, as a Goddess of War, has
                        absolutely no use for the peace she's
                        obstructing.

                                 VIDALIA
                        There is more to her plan than is
                        visible.  What is war if not
                        subterfuge?  

           As they've been talking, Perseus lingers on a rise, eying a
           distant shelf of rock thru the pass.

           Curious, Amoun stops and looks in the same direction.  He
           sees glimpses of cloaked figures behind boulders.

                        Djinn Raiders.  Look sharp.  They're
                        godly zealots and they fight like
                        Hades is keeping count.

                        Commander Kalibos' Skirmishers have
                        been fighting them thru these
                        mountains for years.  It's his own
                        personal war.  I'm talking about an
                        élite force trained to fight behind
                        the lines.  A fierce pack of men. 
                        Kalibos -- It'll be good to see the
                        old wolf again.

                                 CHEOPS
                        How "fierce?"

                                 DRACO
                        Well the rest of us warhorses call
                        them the "God-Slayers" so...  I'm
                        not ashamed to say I'll be relieved
                        to be behind their bulwarks.

           EXT. VALLEY - DAY

           The expedition moves into a wide desert valley thru drifting
           fetid yellow dust.  A flower peppers the scrub of the valley
           floor.  Small but loud magenta blooms.

                                 VIDALIA
                                (a pang of foreboding)
                        It's the Alkali Lotus...  

           About to ask her what she means, he stops when he notices
           her attention snagged by something ahead.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        What is it?

           They all see it shimmering on the path ahead thru the
           rippling desert heat- tents and streaming flags.

                                 DRACO
                        An army bivouac...

                        And they're flying Joppa's colours... 
                        It's Kalibos.

           EXT. RUN-DOWN BIVOUAC - DAY

           Abandoned.  Tattered tents and sun-bleached bones.  The
           breeze blows uneasily thru the ragged camp.

           Perseus hears something.  He follows the sound to a tent.

           INT. TENT - CONTINUOUS

           A cauldron BUBBLING over a fresh fire.  Perseus looks inside. 
           Alkali Lotus blossoms bob on the boiling broth.  Uncertain,
           but uneasy, he backs away and goes outside.

           EXT. RUN-DOWN BIVOUAC - CONTINUOUS

           Perseus leaves the tent talking.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Something's not right.

           He notices everyone standing perfectly tense and still. 
           And slowly, it dawns on Perseus why...

           Dark figures hiding all around.  Shadows perched atop rocks
           and flickering eyes in dark tents.  The soldiers never left
           the camp.  They became something.

           They look like human soldiers from the flashes of old armour,
           scuffed and dented.  But a closer look reveals- creatures,
           altered humans.  LOTOPHAGI.

           A buzzard-taloned hand draws back a tent flap and the
           electric-blue and flame-red face of a mandrill peers out.

           A gorilla face looms behind a rock.  Boar tusks curl and
           rupture his cheeks.

           Ahead, a foot plants in the dust- not quite human, more
           chimp-like, with toes more like fingers.  The companion
           foot.  Strangely- completely different- a cloven hoof.

           KALIBOS - apish face, black eyes, a pair of twisting kudu
           antelope horns jut from his scalp.  He still wears battered
           armour, clinging to the little in him that's still human.

           As he approaches the tense expedition, Draco recognizes
           something in the malformed face.

                                 DRACO
                        Kalibos?

           Kalibos speaks in a rough, deeply animalistic voice.

                                 KALIBOS
                        You know me...  But I does not know
                        you...

           Draco swallows hard to retain his composure.  He salutes.

                        Guard!  Stand down, Commander!  

           Kalibos backs tentatively away, still squinting at Draco
           with suspicion.  He doesn't return the salute.

                                 DRACO (CONT'D)
                        Commander...  What happened here?

           The jittery Kalibos moves erratically.  He alternately comes
           close to sniff and backs away as he finds the words.

                                 KALIBOS
                        Always losing.  Tired of war.  So we
                        ate lotus.  We all ate lotus.

           Kalibos circles them like a jackal.

                        Lotus gave euphoria in battle. Made
                        blood taste sweet.  So we ate more. 
                        More.

                        Lotophagi.  We should leave...

           Kalibos snarls and circles them faster, penning them.

                                 KALIBOS
                        You cannot trick it.  It smells
                        something on you.  Oozing out your
                        pores.  Soaking your cloth.  A tang
                        what burns its nostrils.  

           Gradually the other Lotophagi begin to clear their shadowy
           hiding places.  Kalibos stops pacing.

                                 KALIBOS (CONT'D)
                        You have the stink of Gods on you. 
                        The enemy.  We war with Gods.  We
                        rape Gods.  We eat Gods.

           Draco makes for the hilt of his sword.

           The Lotophagi attack, swift and brutal.  The rabid bestial
           zombies quickly fill the bivouac.  Long arms thrash and
           effortlessly rip Praetorians like a frenzied pod of baboons.

           Mongke and Tamburlane BLAST the swarm with handgonnes-
           smaller versions of the gonne, iron barrels on wooden stocks
           with a flash pan ignited by a sparkler match.

           Cheops and Perseus are the first there.  Amoun tosses an
           arc of the black sand around them.

           The ring of sand ignites and throws up a mystical glowing
           barrier like a bubble of molten glass or rippling amber. 
           Amoun shouts to Draco and Kosmo, still fighting.

                                 AMOUN (CONT'D)
                        Come on!  You can pass thru!

           Draco bolts for the barrier.  A Lotophagi crashes into Kosmo
           and twists his head almost clean off.  Draco slides thru
           the barrier with a splash as it quickly reseals behind him.

           The tide of HOWLING and SHRIEKING Lotophagi claw and hammer
           at the barrier to no avail.

                        It's impregnable to inhumans.

                        Impregnable to inhumans...

           He sees Vidalia, still out there, alone, flinging sling-
           bullets as she tries to fight her way to the barrier.

                        I can't.

                                 PERSEUS

                        No!  She's already dead to us!

           Kalibos grabs Vidalia by the hair and drags her to the top
           of an outcrop of boulders.  He snarls and screams his
           intentions to the other Lotophagi- This one's his. 

           Vidalia fights to escape, but Kalibos grabs her by the head
           and presses her face against the rock.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 KALIBOS
                        You are not of the Gods, are you? 
                        You are a God!  Frail and lame. 
                        Fallen behind the herd.  Perfect.

           He hungrily rips her leather bandeau.  Perseus, helpless to
           watch, turns to Amoun.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Take this barrier down or I will.

                                 AMOUN
                        You can't.  You're inhuman as well.

           On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia's white flesh, his
           fingers trembling with giddy, mad, anticipation. 

                                 KALIBOS
                        So soft, pretty.  Going to split you
                        open.  Split you like a ripe peach.

           In the bubble, Perseus draws his gladius.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Cheops, get on your knees.

           Perseus pushes Cheops to his knees and plants a foot on the
           rhapsode's back.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        You boys better prepare to defend
                        yourselves.

           And with that, Perseus ducks his head under his forearms
           and leaps up... He shatters thru the barrier.

                                 DRACO
                        I didn't know that was possible...

                                 AMOUN
                        It's not...

           But they have less than a moment to be stunned as the equally
           stunned Lotophagi come to their senses.

                                 DRACO
                        Men to arms!

           Perseus scrambles swiftly over the thick multitude of
           berserker Lotophagi.  He jostles over their packed heads
           and backs as they reach to pull him down into the delirium.

           He bolts up the side of the boulder and sacks Kalibos off
           Vidalia.  Kalibos rolls and flips onto his feet.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Perseus swings his gladius.  Kalibos catches the blade in
           his slavering jaws and rips it from Perseus's hands, flinging
           it out of reach.  Bloody spittle flies from his split tongue.

           Kalibos leaps and pins Perseus.  He opens his jaws and pulls
           his lips back from long white fangs.  He sinks his teeth
           into Perseus's shoulder.

           Suddenly, Vidalia cracks Kalibos in the back of the skull
           with a big jagged rock.  

           Kalibos leaps up.  He whirls clumsily to face Vidalia.  He
           careens towards her.  Perseus sees the back of his head,
           concave and splattered from the rock.

           The monster staggers and reaches blindly for the Goddess.

           Perseus kicks the dazed Kalibos off the boulders.  The beast
           CRUNCHES and ricochets off the lower rocks.  He pinwheels
           thru the air akimbo and slams into the dust.

           Perseus trips, his legs rubbery.  Vidalia catches his arm
           under shoulder and braces him.

                                 VIDALIA
                        It's okay.  Sshh.  You're okay.

           She looks at the deep, wide puncture wounds from Kalibos's
           bite and the blood still welling up.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        He really sunk in...

           A THUNDEROUS sound surges in the distance.  Perseus walks
           to the precipice of the boulders and looks down...

           Down to where Draco, Amoun, and the others hack and fend
           off the Lotophagi.  But the NOISE comes from elsewhere.

           SCORPIOCHS, rhino-sized scorpions, stampede down the ridge.

           They lay into the Lotophagi, they skewering and guillotine
           the the beast-men with huge pincers.  

           Perseus spots something else riding atop the glistening
           black carapaces of the Scorpiochs, DJINN RAIDERS.

           Flowing black silk and tightly wrapped veils cover all save
           for their blazing blue eyes.  They whirl sabers and cut
           down Lotophagi.  The beast-men flee on all fours.

           The last thing Perseus sees- the Djinn Raiders atop their
           Scorpiochs surround the expedition.  Closing in.

                                 PERSEUS
                        They're in trouble...  Vidalia...  

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Perseus's balance wobbles.  He reaches up and grabs the
           bite from Kalibos.  Finally, he blacks out.

           INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Andromeda sits before a mirror, carefully lining her eyes
           with a coal pencil.  Peshet stands by the door.

                                 PESHET
                        I couldn't find you.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Well, I was right here the whole
                        time, so...

           Lightning followed by a very close CRACK OF THUNDER. 
           Andromeda jerks and pokes her eye.  She covers her eye and
           slams down the eyeliner pencil.

                                 PESHET
                        Why are you putting that on?  You
                        aren't planning on sneaking out again?

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        No.  I just needed to feel --

           She sighs gives up on the eyeliner, moistens a rag from her
           pitcher, and wipes it off.  She pours herself a cup of water
           from the pitcher.

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                        I can look after myself, you know. 
                        I don't need you to --

           Lightning flash.  Loud thunder CRACK.  She jolts and spills
           her water on the floor.

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                        Gods!  Can I get five quiet minutes?!
                                (resuming)
                        I don't need you to protect me.

                                 PESHET
                        You don't get the danger you're in. 
                        That's what I've been trying--

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Stop it.

                                 PESHET
                        You don't understand how severe--

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Peshet...

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 PESHET
                        You saw what happened to your mother. 
                        A God wants you dead.

           Bright flash.  BOOM.  Andromeda jumps.  Furious, she grabs
           a water pitcher and hurls it.  The pitcher shatters on the
           wall by Peshet's head.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Stop saying that!

           Andromeda sits back down and composes herself like the
           outburst didn't happen.

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                        I'm not...  I'm not in any danger. 
                        This is just one of those things.

           Peshet slowly stands back up.

                                 PESHET
                        I won't let anything happen to you. 
                        You know that right?  You know I'd
                        die first, right?

           Andromeda buries her face.  Her shoulders spasm.

                                 PESHET (CONT'D)
                        Please don't cry...

           Peshet nears.  Andromeda turns.  Genuine tears stream down
           her cheeks, but she hides under feigned laughter.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Peshet, what a wretched cliche. 
                        "I'd die for you..."  What?  Are we
                        living in a stage tragedy now?

           Embarrassed and hurt, Peshet lowers her head.

                                 PESHET
                        May I be dismissed, my lady?

           Andromeda can't keep up the ruse, she covers her mouth and
           turns.  Still faking laughter, she waves Peshet away.

           Peshet curtsies and hurries out on the brink of tears.  As
           soon as she's gone, Andromeda uncovers her mouth.  She's
           not smiling.  She wipes her eyes.

           Another flash and CRACK of lightning.

           Andromeda rushes to bed and pulls the sheets over her head
           like a scared child.  She weeps.  Mortified.

           CRACK.  She covers her ears and shuts her eyes tight.
           EXT. DJINN CARAVAN - NIGHT

           A string of lights snakes thru the dark mountains.

           Each light- a lantern hanging from a Scorpioch's tail
           stinger.  Most carry only a Djinn rider, but some hoist
           palanquins- small box/rooms slung between two poles.  

           The Scorpioch's carry the palanquins in pairs- front and
           back- carrying either end of the poles in their pinchers.

           The surviving expedition members ride on the Scorpioch backs
           alongside the Djinn. 

           INT. PALANQUIN - NIGHT

           The small, portable room jostles with the caravan.  Oil
           lamps rock, flicker, and cast a shaky light.

           Perseus lies sprawled on a rug, unconscious.  Vidalia rings
           a cool, wet rag and places it on his brow.

           She removes the dressing of the bite wound at his shoulder. 
           A fat, swollen canker.  Black "lotus roots" spiderweb from
           the puncture holes, spreading thru his veins.

                                 VIDALIA
                        I don't know if it's turning you
                        into Lotus compost or into one of
                        them.  Either way...

           She smiles warmly and runs her fingers thru his hair.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        You shouldn't have tried to save me. 
                        That's the sort of stunt I was talking
                        about.  Anyway.  Thank you.  Thank
                        you for having stupid ideas.
                                (a novel thought)
                        You're really going to be a hero
                        aren't you?

           She kisses his forehead.  She sighs deep and sits back.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        I hope so.  I'm getting too weak to
                        do spells more than once.

           Vidalia holds her palm above the floor and mutters a quick
           incantation.  Threads of electricity dance between her hand
           and the floor.

           Something sprouts.  A small shoot buds.  And quickly, it
           balloons into a bulbous cluster of fat pods- like a cross
           between a mushroom and a cactus.  Vidalia plucks a pod.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She squeezes out the pod's salve and warms it between her
           palms before spreading it on Perseus's wound.

           The infection under the wound bulges, seeming to come
           "alive."  The bulge squirms deeper into Perseus. 

           Perseus instantly shoots up and grabs his chest.  Digging
           his fingers in.  Vidalia holds him down.

           Perseus gags.  His face turns blue.  He opens his mouth.  A
           viper wriggles its way from Perseus's throat.

           The snake slithers away, a fat lump in its stomach- it ate
           the infection.  Vidalia smoothes Perseus's hair.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        It's gone now.  You're okay.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Where...  Where are we?  The Djinn-

                                 VIDALIA
                        The Djinn helped us.  We're in their
                        caravan.  Their Shaikh Suleiman seems
                        to have some interest in you.  They
                        volunteered to take us to the
                        Skolothian border.
                                (beat)
                        Don't worry about it.  Just sleep.

           He does.

           EXT. RUN-DOWN BIVOUAC - MORNING

           The pack of Lotophagi walk on their hooves and knuckles as
           they chew on the bones of the slain Praetorians.

           One spots an Alkali Lotus in the sand.  He hungrily scuttles.

           The wind shifts.  The petals blacken and curl.  The
           Lotophagus looks up.  The other Lotophagi sniff the air.

           Their hair grays.  Their skin wrinkles.  They age years in
           minutes.  They keel over, clutching their chests.  Their
           bodies rot.  Scarab beetles swarm over them.

           Set glides over, following the trail of the expedition,
           uncaring of the side effects of his presence.  

           A sharp swathe of desiccation and death stretches in his
           wake back to the horizon.
           EXT. VILLAGE IN SKOLOTHIA - AFTERNOON

           Cooler, wetter terrain.  Pines, fog, and mountains.  The
           road cuts thru a quiet village of stucco and thatch.

           SUPERIMPOSE: The Frontier of Skolothia... 
           15 Days Remaining...

           The expedition walks.  Perseus, Vidalia, Amoun, Draco, Thad,
           Abas, Icos, Mongke, Tamburlane, and a new addition- SHAIKH
           SULEIMAN, a veiled Djinn priest.

           They notice scars of war on the village, ruptured walls
           covered by curtains and canvas and scorched thatch.  They
           hear and see doors and shutters CREAK shut as they pass.

                                 DRACO
                        The Skolothian Theater was a brutal
                        one.  In the end, the Gods' Legions
                        didn't sack Skolothia, but they
                        certainly battered her.

           Perseus hurries to catch up with Vidalia.  She smiles. 
           Perseus searches for words.

                                 PERSEUS
                        So, back there in the mountains...  

                                 VIDALIA
                        You shouldn't have risked your life
                        to save me.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Yes I know.  Reckless.  How very
                        human of me.  How perfectly--

                                 VIDALIA
                        I'm dying.

           Perseus quickly shuts up.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        There is no one alive who speaks my
                        former name and so it was forgotten
                        to me.  I have no worshipers and I
                        am slowly fading...  You shouldn't
                        risk your life for me.  I'll be gone
                        soon anyway.

           Perseus walks in silence.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Right...  Except I feel like I'd do
                        it again...

           They exchange smiles.  Warm.  Deeply grateful.  And something
           less than platonic.  Amoun notices.

                                (low, re: Shaikh)
                        So I thought they were just going to
                        take us to Skolothia.

                                 VIDALIA
                        I suppose the Shaikh just wanted to
                        come along.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Did I imagine this or did you say he
                        seemed to have some sort of interest
                        in me in particular.

                                 VIDALIA
                        You're the reason they intervened.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Why?

                                 VIDALIA
                        I don't know.  Why don't you ask?

                                 PERSEUS
                        I thought they didn't speak.

                                 VIDALIA
                                (smiles)
                        They don't have mouths.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Alright then.

           The expedition rounds a curve in the road.  There, dead
           ahead, rising high from hills and fog- a series of sheer
           granite pinnacles crowned in pines.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        Amoun.  What is that?

                                 AMOUN
                        Our destination.  The Pillar of
                        Moirai.  Lair of the Norn Sisters.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Will the Norns give us any trouble?

                                 AMOUN
                        No.  They owe me.  In the war they
                        broke ranks and augured for the
                        Skolothians in return for infant
                        sacrifice.  It was Tiamat who struck
                        them blind for the treachery.  So
                        when they came to me for help, I
                        fashioned them one artificial eye,
                        thru which they could channel their
                        Second Sight.

           Amoun turns to the rest of the expedition.

                                 AMOUN (CONT'D)
                        We'll rest.  Wait for dark to ascend
                        the Pillar.  The Norns awake only in
                        the blackest hours.

           EXT. CAMP IN SKOLOTHIA - NIGHT

           The whole expedition sleeps.  Perseus slumbers under a
           flysheet tent.  Drizzle PECKS the canvas.  WHISPERS.  Perhaps
           another language but indistinct.

           Nearby, Shaikh Suleiman kneels, thumbing prayer beads.  He
           slowly stands and pulls a gleaming bronze sickle from the
           folds in his cloak.  WHISPERS.

           He walks carefully towards the sleeping Perseus with the
           hooked blade at his side.  WHISPERS- more frenetic.

           Still asleep, Perseus squirms.  The Shaikh crouches and
           lifts his sickle.  WHISPERS.  Perseus jolts awake.

           To find the Shaikh kneeling right before him.  Head bowed. 
           Bronze sickle blade resting in his outstretched palms.

           The WHISPERS continue, pervasive and indistinct, but Perseus
           appears to comprehend them.

                                 PERSEUS
                        I hear you.  How can I hear you? 
                        You don't have a mouth.

                                 SHAIKH SULEIMAN (V.O.)

                                 PERSEUS
                        A what?  A prayer?  Are you- Are you
                        praying to me?  Why?     
                                (the sickle)
                        An offering...  

                                 SHAIKH SULEIMAN (V.O.)

                        I don't understand.

                        Ae'zti ke ishir'arkah, méne daeva.

                                 PERSEUS
                        You're a High Priest of... of my
                        father?  Who is he?  Who is my father?

           CONTINUED:

           The Shaikh looks up.  The gap in his headdress bares scaled
           black and white skin of charred wood, and eyes like slots
           in a hollow body- a furnace of licking blue flames.

                                 SHAIKH SULEIMAN (V.O.)
                        Tuj patír esti hó theos kosmosr.  Hó
                        Zeus Patír.  Zeus...  Zeus...

           Perseus's eyes widen as he listens.  He studies the sickle
           in the Shaikh's palms.  Perseus takes the sickle carefully.  

                                 PERSEUS
                        Thank you, Shaikh.

           The Shaikh bows.  He leaves Perseus to contemplate.

           EXT. MOIRAI PILLAR - NIGHT

           The expedition ascends the sheer rock pinnacle via a series
           of narrow rain-slick stairs and GROANING rope ladders.

           EXT. SUMMIT OF MOIRAI PILLAR - NIGHT

           The expedition enters a round henge of free-standing
           monoliths and a slab altar in the clustered pines and low
           fog.  A stone age pagan sanctuary.

           White bird feculence spatters and smears the monoliths. 
           Fat pellets of regurgitated food matter litter the ground-
           packed with cloth and tiny human baby skulls and ribcages.

                                 CHEOPS
                        They eat... babies?

                                 AMOUN
                        They're very old.  Tender food and
                        whatnot.  Let me do the talking.

           A soft, stealthy flap of wings, the SCRAPING of gnarled
           talons on stone, and suddenly the Norn Sisters perch atop
           the scattered monoliths-

           URD, VERDANDI, and SKULD- Strix, that is, human-sized owls
           with the gray feather-hemmed faces of old crones.  

           Eyeless save for one artificial Eye which they share- tiny
           copper cogs, apertures, and lenses enclosed in a polished
           sphere of intricate etched crystal.

           They toss the Eye between them and pop it into their empty
           sockets to take turns at scrutinizing the expedition.

                                 URD
                        Amoun...  So nice to see you again.

                        This isn't a social call.  I've come
                        to seek your counsel on-

                                 VERDANDI
                        You want to know about Leviathan.

                                 URD
                        I'm afraid you've wasted a journey.

                                 AMOUN
                        Is there nothing that can stop it?

           The Norns let the query hang.  Skuld glides across the henge,
           from one perch to another.

                                 AMOUN (CONT'D)
                        Well?  Don't play games.  You owe me
                        this answer at least.

                                 URD
                        Don't presume to tell us what we may
                        or may not owe you, human.

           Watching the trio toss the Eye (the only thing they see)
           back and forth across the henge, Perseus makes his move...

           He jumps the slab altar and catches the Eye midair.  He
           rushes to the edge of the pinnacle and holds the Eye out.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Tell us what we want to know.  Or I
                        drop the Eye.

           The Norns flap their wings and puff up their feathers.

                                 VERDANDI
                        Amoun!  Calm him!  He's a madman!

                                 PERSEUS
                        He's a demigod.  Now, are you going
                        to help us or do I play clumsy with
                        your delicate little toy?

                                 URD
                        We can't tell you what you want.  We
                        can't betray Tiamat again.

                                 SKULD
                        For a second offense, she would
                        destroy us!

                                 PERSEUS
                        Very well.  You'll go on living...
                        As blind as she made you...

                        Tell me first.  If I like the answer,
                        you get your Eye.

                                 VERDANDI
                        We need the Eye to see the answer!

                        You're lying!  You know the answer

                        Leviathan can be destroyed...

                        But it has only one weakness.

                                 PERSEUS
                        What is it?

           The Norns say nothing for a moment, but ultimately they
           have no choice.

                                 URD
                        The stare of Medusa...

           The answer hangs in the silence of the stunned expedition.

                        They're lying, Perseus.

           Perseus watches the Norns, carefully weighing the revelation.

           He throws back the Eye.  Verdandi catches it and pops it in
           her eye socket.

                                 AMOUN (CONT'D)
                                (not satisfied)
                        There's no such thing as Medusa.  Is
                        there?

                                 PERSEUS
                                (to the Norns)
                        And Medusa?  How can she be slain?

                                 VERDANDI
                        With extraordinary cunning and
                        unimaginable luck.

           Skuld glides and alights on a crossbeam of a monolithic
           doorframe bracing an opening in a sagging earthen mound.

                        You may find such a tool.

           Perseus stares into the black entrance to the mound.

                        Perseus, I'd strongly recommend not
                        going in there.

                                 VERDANDI
                        Customarily, you'd do right to heed
                        such a warning, boy.  But we've
                        already invited the ire of Tiamat
                        with this intimation.

                                 SKULD
                        We may as well reap the balance of
                        the whore's gratuitous vengeance.

                                 PERSEUS
                        I need a light.

           The Shaikh grabs a fallen branch and holds it near his eyes
           until the end catches fire.  He passes it to Perseus.

           Perseus starts towards the entrance.

           INT. THE NORNS' CACHE - NIGHT

           Perseus presses thru cobwebs and hanging roots.  The narrow
           passage opens up to a cavity.

           The torchlight shines over haphazard piles of armour, swords,
           bones, and broken clockwork inventions.

           Perseus carefully looks over the room, not sure what he
           should be looking for, but his sharp eyes work for it.

           A round edge protruding from the heaps of junk catches his
           attention.  He grabs it and heaves it up- 

           A shield.  Bronze, tarnished, and dinged.  Not instantly
           impressive.  He looks it over in the light, still unsure.

           But slowly he tightens his lips and nods.  He straps the
           shield to his back and leaves with it.

           EXT. CAMP IN SKOLOTHIA - NIGHT

           At the campfire, Draco and Amoun plot the next move.  Perseus
           and Vidalia listen nearby.  Perseus idly works to wipe some
           of the tarnish from his shield.

                        We can marshal more men.  Better
                        armaments.  And then--

                        --then return to Tartaros to claim
                        the head of Medusa.  

                                 PERSEUS
                        It took us half the month to get
                        here!  We can't go back, disembark
                        for an even more remote destination,
                        and hope to get back in time to make
                        any difference!  It is madness!

                                 DRACO
                        Madness is sending anything less
                        than an army after that nightmare!

           All eyes lock on Perseus- Draco annoyed to be contradicted,
           Amoun twinkling with a glimmer of pride, Vidalia concerned.

                                 PERSEUS
                        The road may lead into the jaws of
                        Hades and we may be unready for what
                        waits for us.  But that's what makes
                        it important.  I never expected this
                        to be easy.

                                 DRACO
                        Perseus, we can't slay Medusa.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Then go home, Draco.  I'll do it.

                                 DRACO
                        Like you rode that Pegasus.

                        bearing down on Joppa and we know
                        how to stop it.  

                                 PERSEUS
                        We're not going back without the
                        head of Medusa.

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           A fleet of ships stocked with armoured CREWMEN rises and
           falls on hundred foot mountains of water.  The storm rages.

           EXT. DECK OF LEAD SHIP - NIGHT

           The FIRST MATE shouts to the stalwart CAPTAIN.

                                 FIRST MATE
                        Captain, the swells!

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Joppa's under siege!  King Kepheus
                        needs the provisions!

           Nearby, something huge breaches the surface.

           The Captain squints thru the dark sheets of rain...  And
           sees a tail coming down thru the haze like a falling tower.

           With a BOOMING CLAP, the entire fleet vanishes under the
           massive tail cleaving the water into walls of spume.

           UNDERWATER

           hundreds of drowning Crewmen tug at their armour as they
           sink deeper and deeper.

           The dark Leviathan reels around them, spewing rolling clouds
           of ink like an octopus.

           The ink-thunderhead crackles with jagged bursts of green
           lightning.  It billows over the drowning Crewmen.  Their
           skeletons flicker, agonizing, gnarling, changing.

           EXT. JOPPA'S LOWER WHARF - NIGHT

           Rain pounds the bedraggled heaps of debris, the makeshift
           shelters of torn sails and planks, and the water choked
           with driftwood and rotting corpses.

           From the water, a hand reaches- inhuman, oily and seaweed-
           coloured.  Five suckered-tentacles, aligned like fingers,
           grip the top of a splintered pylon stump.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Creatures loom from the surf, formerly the Crewmen now
           altered CETOS- humanoid but ambiguously molluscan with
           unctuous feelers and frills, sacs bloating and deflating.

           The Cetos climb from the brine in total, predatory silence. 
           The horde of low, muculent creatures crawls up walls, lurks
           down alleys, and fans thru the Wharf.

           EXT. TOPPLED HOUSE - NIGHT

           A JUNKMAN with a cart full of finds forages thru the debris. 
           He sees something twinkling in the heap in front of him. 
           He approaches.

           On closer inspection, he sees the twinkling thing as a
           glistening black eye.  It blinks.

           The heap floods with colour, scintillates and clarifies-
           not a heap of garbage at all but a camouflaged Ceto.

           The Junkman tries to run.  But the Ceto spits its tongue, a
           barbed venomous harpoon, lightning quick.  The Junkman
           freezes, instantly.  Paralyzed.

           The Cetos opens its mouth... opens its whole skull- pink
           and bristling with teeth.  Flaring and peeling open to the
           very back of its tooth-lined gullet.

           It draws the twitching helpless Junkman in with its harpoon-
           tongue.  It enfolds the Junkman's head with its throat,
           mouth, and skull.  Slowly, it works the living meal down.

           EXT. PLANK HOVEL - NIGHT

           A prowling Ceto finds a notch in the planks.  It slowly
           works its man-sized pulpy body thru the fist-sized hole
           with the POPPING of folded cartilage.

           INT. PLANK HOVEL - CONTINUOUS

           The Ceto bulges, distends, and POPS slowly and grotesquely
           back into shape as it emerges from the notch.  It slinks
           across the floor to a SLEEPING LITTLE GIRL.

           EXT. JOPPA'S LOWER WHARF - NIGHT

           The Little Girl's CLIPPED SCREAM fractures the night.  Soon,
           more and more screams follow from across the Wharf.
           EXT. BASILICA BALCONY - NIGHT

           Kepheus stands by the rail.  Rain falls and threads of smoke
           rise from the massive tent town in the piazza.  

           Voices- frequent, angry, and disorganized- SHOUT CURSES at
           the Basilica.

           Peshet comes out on the balcony.

                                 PESHET
                        You sent for me, Majesty?

                                (without turning)
                        Peshet.  Do you sympathize with
                        Humanity?  

                                 PESHET
                        Sir?  The Sfinxes are neutral.

                        Do you sympathize with humanity?

                        Oh yes, Majesty.  Very much.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        Do you think we'll weather the storm?  

                                 PESHET
                        I hope so, Majesty.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        Do you think my daughter has what it
                        takes to clean it all up?  Do you
                        think she'll make a good ruler?

                                 PESHET
                                (lowers her eyes)
                        She's...  She's very tenacious...
                        and...

                                 KEPHEUS
                        Me neither...  But she's my daughter. 
                        She's my only daughter...

                                 PESHET
                        Yes, Majesty.

                        The relief fleet is lost and now
                        there's accounts of monsters coming
                        out of the sea in droves to stalk
                        the Lower Wharf.  And still there's
                        no word from the expedition.  I fear
                        a day is swiftly coming when I'll no

                                (facing Peshet)
                        I remember first seeing you with
                        Andromeda.  She was a newborn and
                        you still had your cub-spots.  But
                        you cradled her so tenderly and sang
                        so soft.  You remember that?

                                 PESHET
                                (a soft smile)
                        Yes, Majesty, I do.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        Peshet, if they finally come for the
                        Princessa...  It falls on you to
                        keep her safe.  You're her last
                        safeguard.  Understand?

           With a secret pang, Peshet takes a deep breath, and nods.

           EXT. JETTY-AT-WORLD'S-END - DAY

           A bleak shore.  Icy rocks under a slate sky.  A boulder
           jetty juts into the cold pewter sea and fades into the fog. 
           Chunks and sheets of ice bob on the lapping waves.

           SUPERIMPOSE: Jetty-at-World's-End on the Tethys Sea...

           The expedition waits on the frigid beach.  Draco finds
           Perseus sitting on a boulder, examining the shield he got
           from the Norns.  Cheops sits nearby.

                                 DRACO
                        That was the best thing you could
                        find in the cache?

                                 PERSEUS
                        I don't know.

                                 DRACO
                                (shaking his head)
                        You know, it's her eyes that get
                        you.  Not her talons.

           He gives Perseus a well-intentioned but patronizing slap on
           the back and starts away.

                        It's dead weight.  It'll slow you
                        down.  You should toss it into the
                        sea before we board the ferry.

           CONTINUED:

           Perseus thoughtfully examines the shield.  He returns it to
           his back.  Pulling one of the straps over his shoulder, he
           catches sight of Vidalia.

                                 CHEOPS
                        Perseus, can I ask you a question
                        they'll ask me a thousand times-  
                                (beat)
                        Why?

           Perseus watches as Vidalia touches her sparse leather
           clothes.  The leather regenerates and reworks itself into a
           long thick wool pelt.  She wraps herself tight and sits.

                                 PERSEUS
                                (still on Vidalia)
                        I've always been drawn to lost causes. 
                        It's the romantic in me.

                                 CHEOPS
                        How is this a lost cause?

                        I said how's this a lost cause?

                                 PERSEUS
                        They are Gods.  I don't worship them. 
                        I don't pray to them.  And I believe
                        they should be defied to the last
                        breath of mankind.  But in the end,
                        they are Gods.  How can it be possible
                        to win a fight against the ones who
                        make the rules?

                                 CHEOPS
                        Possible?  It's been done.  You hear
                        of the Titans?

                                 PERSEUS
                        You mean like Atlas, Hyperion,
                        Prometheus...

                                 CHEOPS
                        Creators of the Gods.  Gods to the
                        Gods, as it were.  Yes, even Zeus
                        said his vespers just like us.  Until
                        Zeus grew up, grew restless, and led
                        an uprising against the twelve Titans. 
                        Know how that ended?  The Gods slew
                        their Titan creators, is how.  And
                        took their place in Olympos.  The

                        And anyway...  How do you win a fight
                        against the ones who make the rules? 
                        You ignore the rules.

           A distinct series of noises drifts from the fog.  SNAPPING
           ice.  Oars SLOSHING water.

           A shadow darkens the fog.  A tall ice-cutting trireme, a
           three-tiered galley, resolves.  It's oars move with uncanny
           precision and synchronicity as it eases next to the jetty.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Is that?

                                 AMOUN
                        Charon's ferry.

           EXT. THE TETHYS SEA - DAY

           The prow of the trireme cuts the ice sheets.  Rows of oars
           slice the ice with a mechanical rhythm like the legs of a
           millipede, pulling the boat thru at an arrow's pace. 

           INT. BELOW DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Sweltering, dark, and loud.  SHUDDERING pipes.  HISSING
           steam.  RUMBLING gears and pinions.

           CHARON, a grizzled old explorer who never went home, shovels
           coal into the furnace and slams the hatch.  

           He walks past rows of benches and his "crew"- mechanical
           oarsmen of tarnished brass, clockwork automata powered by
           the boiler.  Rowing, tireless. 

           Charon dons heavy furs before climbing out onto the- 

           EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Caked in an icy slick.  The men huddle around meager coal
           stoves in a gray mist, slashed by flecks of snow.

           No one speaks.  Just the STACCATO RHYTHM of the oars, the
           GROANING of the hull, and the deep SNAPPING of the ice.
           INT. HOLD - DAY

           Cluttered with barrels and bundles of rope.  Perseus wears
           a blindfold and holds a fighting stance as he slowly turns. 
           Vidalia, not blindfolded, circles him.  

           Both have rags around their knuckles to dull the hits.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Don't go easy on me...

                                 VIDALIA
                        I'm not.

           She delivers a hit to the lower back.  He winces.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Changed my mind.  You can go a little
                        easy on me.

                                 VIDALIA
                        I don't think so.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Well can I take off the blindfold?

                                 VIDALIA
                        Want to be part of Medusa's decor?

                                 PERSEUS
                        I was kidding.

                                 VIDALIA
                        I know.

           She tries to punch his stomach.  He blocks.  She sweeps his
           legs out from under him.  He falls on his ass.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        She's got a tail.  She's going to
                        try things like that.

                                 PERSEUS
                                (a joke)
                        Yeah.  Should've seen that coming.

           He climbs back up and resumes the defensive position.

                                 VIDALIA
                        Just forget your eyes.  Forget you
                        ever had eyes.  Sense your prey. 
                        Hear my muscles coil before the
                        pounce.  Taste my sweat in the air. 
                        Feel my hunger in your own gut. 
                        Ask, "How will she feed it?  What's
                        her next move?"

                        I can't see the world like that.  I
                        can't do those things.

                                 VIDALIA
                        You really can, Perseus.  You're the
                        son of a God.  You can do those things
                        and quite a bit more.  Focus.

           He turns slowly.  She circles him.  Gradually, he syncs to
           her orbit, holding face to face.

                                 PERSEUS
                        There you are.  It's like you think
                        a room is silent until someone points
                        out the wind.  Then the wind is all
                        you hear.

                                 VIDALIA
                        Exactly...  Now try an attack.

                                 PERSEUS
                                (brow furrows)
                        Wait...

           She goes for the strike.  He dodges, moves behind, and
           gingerly locks her neck.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        You are going easy on me.  You're
                        afraid of hurting me...

           A brief rush of surprise in her eyes.  She hides it.

                                 VIDALIA
                        Is that so?

           She escapes the hold by flipping him on his back.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Yeah...  Yeah, I think it is.

           He sweeps her legs.  She falls on him.  He rolls and pins
           her.  She looks up, anxious, worried.  Her chest rises and
           falls quickly, but silently.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        What was it?  I touched an idea you
                        thought was buried.  A tightness in
                        your chest.  A feeling like- falling. 
                        Vidalia, what's wrong?  What are you
                        afraid will-

           She covers his mouth with a deep, tender kiss.  He dissolves
           into it.  They roll together, she on top.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She pulls back and stands up.  She quickly turns away and
           touches her mouth, surprised at herself.

                                (takes off blind)
                        Vidalia.  Wait.  Where are you- ?

                                 VIDALIA
                        You're ready to hunt.  You read me
                        like a book, Perseus.  You're ready.

           EXT. UPPER DECK - AFTERNOON

           Cheops stands at the deck rail, looking over the fog-choked
           ocean of ice.  He warms his shoulders.  Perseus approaches,
           slow and troubled.  He leans on the rail.

                                 CHEOPS
                        Preparing for this madness?

                                 PERSEUS
                        What?  Oh.  Yes.  Yes, I was--
                                (touching his lips)
                        Just now something happened...  Can
                        I ask you-- You're a rhapsode so
                        maybe you can tell me--

           He stops himself and stares out into the fog.

                                 CHEOPS
                        What?

                                 PERSEUS
                        Nothing.  It was nothing.  Forget I
                        asked.

                                 CHEOPS
                        Tell you...
                                (smirks knowingly)
                        ...about certain rhapsodic pursuits?

           Perseus looks up.

                                 CHEOPS (CONT'D)
                        Yes, I recognize that look.  They
                        always ask the poet, don't they,
                        about affairs of the heart...
                                (beat)
                        Look, that's not my poetry.  For
                        what it's worth, I say-- Our time on
                        the stage is so brief.  We have the
                        crowd's short attention but for a
                        flickering moment and we exit to
                        dust and regrets.  I say if, in that
                        moment, you didn't speak and act
                        from the heart...

                        up there?

           Perseus sighs and shakes his head, not satisfied.

                                 PERSEUS
                        My heart?  I act from my heart and

                        grip into the pit of fire and ruin.

           Cheops laughs.

                        Something amusing?

                        That -- what you said -- it's really
                        the only excuse I ever hear.  But... 
                        It's your moment.  Do as you please.

           EXT. SHORES OF TARTAROS - AFTERNOON

           A stark landscape of cracked volcanic glass.  Falling snow
           melts in the glowing heat from open lava fissures.  Lava
           rolls into the sea, boiling up HISSING veils of steam.

           SUPERIMPOSE: Tartaros... 
           11 Days Remaining...

           The expedition walks down Charon's flimsy gangplank and
           sets foot on the harsh ground.

           EXT. TARTAROS - EVENING

           The expedition navigates the terrain of black glass, ruptured
           and buckled.  A glowing lava vent here or there.  Silence
           save for the CRUNCH of the ground.

           In the distance, darksome ruins.  A scraggy column facade,
           tilted, leaning, half-sunk into the dried lava-flow.

                                 CHEOPS
                        Is that it?

                        The Pitched Temple of Tartaros. 
                        That's where she is.

                                 DRACO
                        Then those must be her guards.

           He points to a ridge and a pair of strapping Centaurs.

           NESSUS and IXION, two Centaur huns with blood-painted barrel
           chests and big clydesdale bodies.  Their eyelids pierced
           shut with crisscrossing snake fangs.

                                 VIDALIA
                        Their eyes are stitched shut.

                                 CHEOPS
                        Makes sense.

           Suddenly, Nessus and Ixion stand and face the expedition.

                                 AMOUN
                        Did they hear us?

           The Centaurs slide down the ridge and launch into a gallop.

                                 PERSEUS
                        I think they see us.

                                 AMOUN
                        Nonsense, they can't see anything.

           They charge at the expedition, raising crude spiky mace of
           scrap iron.  Their hooves shake the ground.  

                                 VIDALIA
                                (loading her sling)
                        Then that's one spectacular sense of
                        smell because they're coming right
                        at us.

           As they advance, their true size slowly becomes clear- eight
           feet?  Ten?  Thirteen?  

                                 AMOUN
                        Perseus, Draco- go take down the
                        Medusa.  We've got the Centaurs.

                                 CHEOPS
                        We do?

           Perseus and Draco make a run for the temple.

           Vidalia spins her sling.  The Shaikh draws his saber.  Mongke
           and Tamburlane load their handgonnes.  And the three
           Praetorians- Thad, Abas, and Icos ready their swords.

           Nessus and Ixion arrive towering fifteen feet tall.

                                 CHEOPS (CONT'D)
                        Is it too late to swap with the Medusa
                        team?

           The Centaurs swing their maces.
           EXT. PITCHED TEMPLE - EVENING

           Perseus and Draco tie blindfolds and catch their breath on
           the steps.  Perseus tightens his shield to his forearm.

                                 DRACO
                        You scared?

                                 PERSEUS
                        Of what?

                                 DRACO
                        Good boy.  Now stay close and I'll
                        steer us thru this.

           They feel their way into the shadows of the temple.

           INT. PITCHED TEMPLE - EVENING

           Dark and slanted.  Broken by cascades of cold sky light
           from caved in portions of the roof.  Toppled pillars and
           walls.  Stone debris everywhere.

           Draco and Perseus pick their way blindly thru the mess. 
           Perseus steps over what he believes to be a pile of rubble-

           A cringing petrified corpse, knotted and porous flesh,
           fingers curled excruciating, real human teeth still jutting
           from the twisted stone hole of a screaming mouth.

           Everywhere.  Bodies of men locked in cowering moments of
           pure soul-stripping horror.  Looking as if flash-fried in
           searing ash.  Hollow eye sockets.  Skull-toothed screams.

           Wind-scoured silence.  A silhouette- MEDUSA...  

           A head of writhing hair atop the sharp lank shoulders of a
           woman's torso, crawling, savage, on her knuckles, and
           dragging, waist-down, the slinking tail of a rattlesnake. 

           She lurks thru pools of shade and light, baring charcoal
           scales head-to-tail shedding in dry flaking tatters.  And
           hair of snakes- cobras, taipans, coral, adders- HISSING. 
           Striking one another.  Striking Medusa herself.

           She flinches stiffly from the constant bites but skulks
           ahead, stolid and cold, towards her prey.  Her forked tongue,
           purple-black, tastes the air.

           EXT. TARTAROS - EVENING

           Ixion's spiked mace wallops two Praetorians in one blow,
           snagging them on the spikes.  The centaur flings the flailing
           bodies into an open lava vent.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Nessus goes for Amoun.  Amoun reaches into a bag of sand
           and throws a handful at Nessus.  The sand becomes a hail of
           steely barbed flechettes in midair.

           The barbed hail lashes the centaur's flesh.  Nessus recoils
           and resumes his advance, undaunted, skin twinkling with
           countless steel splinters.  

           Tamburlane rolls between and unloads his handgonne in the
           Centaur's heart- or rather where it would be in a human. 
           The slug punches clean thru his chest and knocks him back.

           Nessus touches the bleeding hole in his chest.  Then angrily
           grabs Tamburlane by the throat and hurls him away.

           The Shaikh jumps into the fray with his reeling saber.  He
           gets in a few choice slashes on Nessus.  

           The centaur raises his mace.  The Shaikh lets his saber
           fall and lodge in the ground.  He bows his head.

           Nessus swings his mace and shatters Shaikh Suleiman's head
           like a clay pot.  

           His insides spill as blue fire from his neck, spiraling up
           and out as the hollow corpse collapses.  The blue-hot fire
           flares towards Nessus and consumes him like napalm.  

           Nessus shakes and bucks wildly.  Tamburlane takes the
           opportunity to BLAST a well-aimed slug thru Nessus's skull.

           The burning centaur crumples, dead.  The blue fire slips
           loose from the dead creature and dissolves into the air.

           INT. PITCHED TEMPLE - EVENING

           Both Perseus and Draco on opposite sides of the room, dare
           not make a sound.  They turn slowly, weapons ready.

           Medusa stealthily circles Draco.  He listens to the RASP of
           scales on stone.

                                 DRACO
                        I hear her, Perseus.  

           She coils and surrounds Draco without touching him.  

                                 DRACO (CONT'D)
                        She's over here.  I've got her.

           Her torso safely behind him, she lures her tail in front. 
           She RATTLES it.

           Draco spins and slices the air towards the sound.  The RATTLE
           stops suddenly.  A relieved smile on Draco's face.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Medusa reaches and gingerly tugs the loose end in back of
           Draco's blindfold, pulling the knot out.

           The blindfold flutters to the ground.

           Draco sees just the tail before him.  Startled and not
           thinking, he instinctively looks behind.

                                 PERSEUS
                                (sensing her strategy)
                        Draco don't- !

           Draco sees Medusa.  His eyes widen.  Muscles lock.  

           His flesh scorches, shriveling close to his bones.  Hardening
           to scabrous pumice-stone.  

           Anything soft- blood, internal organs, hair, eyes- boils
           away as hot sulfurous gas spewing from his mouth and pores.

           Medusa seems to get a high from the vapors.  She succumbs
           to a brief but euphoric shudder.  She eyes Perseus, hungry.

           EXT. TARTAROS - EVENING

           Ixion tramples the last of the Praetorians.

           Cheops charges in and plunges his sword between Ixion's
           horse-ribs.  His sword sticks.

           Furious, Ixion swings his mace.  Cheops grabs the hilt of
           his stuck sword and draws his knees up.  He finally yanks
           his sword free and falls flat on his ass.

           Ixion brings his mace up to smash Cheops...  Suddenly, a
           blitz of sling-bullets cuts the air.  The lead bolts PING
           off Ixion's club and slit his flesh.

           He forgets Cheops and rampages for Vidalia and her sling. 
           He raises his mace high and slams it down, just as Vidalia
           deftly rolls out of the way.

           The mace-hit caves a thin sheet of rock above a lava tube. 
           Ixion's hooves scramble and slide.

           Mongke seals it.  He throws a snare.  Its sinkers and chains
           cartwheel thru the air. 

           It snags Ixion's ankles and wraps his legs together.  Ixion
           slides into the lava tube.

           Suddenly, his hand grabs the ledge.  He heaves himself out-
           what's left of him.  His horse-half severed and swallowed
           by the rushing lava.  

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           His humanoid torso terminates in burning flesh and a segment
           of spinal column that glows like molten iron.  He drags
           himself towards Vidalia.

           She kicks his face, over and over, until he finally slides
           back into the lava.

           INT. PITCHED TEMPLE - EVENING

           Perseus shakes and breathes hard, losing it.  His HEART
           POUNDS.  He jerks at the slightest sounds.  He holds his
           shield close.

           At first, Medusa doesn't seem to be anywhere around him. 
           Perseus gradually steps back.  

           Until he bumps into a column.  He jolts with fear, but
           quickly steadies himself.

           On the column above, Medusa clings, her snake body coiled
           tight around the top.  She slowly crawls down towards the
           base of the column.  Towards Perseus. 

           Yet Perseus insists on keeping his back flush against the
           column- a false security blanket.

           Above, Medusa reaches slowly for his blindfold with the
           meticulous patience of a snake.

           She pulls the knot out.  The blindfold falls.  Perseus
           instantly lowers his head and squeezes his eyes closed.

           He slashes the air in front of him.  He rakes the sickle
           back to one side.  Nothing.  He sweeps the other side. 
           Nothing.  Where is she?

           Perseus reins in his panicked breath.  He listens and thinks. 
           His brow furrows with dawning clarity.  

           He cracks his eyes and peers down into the basin of his
           shield.  His darting eyes find a patch of polished bronze.

           Above, unseen, Medusa nears.  Her hair of snakes tenses and
           focuses on Perseus.  They coil for the strike, to startle
           him into turning about.

           Perseus angles the shield to reflect behind.  No Medusa. 
           He tilts the shield to see above.  He watches the scrap of
           scenery glide over the slash of burnished metal.

           Sky.  

           Ceiling.  

           Movement.  Poised snakes.  Cold eyes.  There.  

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He shuts his eyes and windmills his sickle in a vertical
           arc.  Medusa's talons quickly deflect.

           The sickle flies from his grip and spins across the floor.

           Perseus scrambles, searching for it on his hands and knees,
           eyes closed.  As Medusa slithers down from the column and
           drags herself towards Perseus.

           Perseus fingers paw the ground, nowhere near the sickle. 
           He has to open his eyes.  

           He instantly spots the sickle.  He grabs it.

           His eyes dart to the bowl of his shield and the menacing
           shadow that grows in the reflection.

           He shuts his eyes and wheels around to cut again.  A soft F-
           THMMP as the blade slices thru something...

           A fractional silence.  Perseus holds his breath.  His eyes
           dart again to the reflection-- the shadow still looms.

           But suddenly, Medusa's head THUDS and rolls on the ground.

           The headless reflection topples over, dead.

           Perseus laughs with relief.

           EXT. TARTAROS - EVENING

           In the aftermath of the battle, the survivors (Vidalia,
           Amoun, Cheops, Mongke, and Tamburlane) breath exhausted
           sighs and take silent stock of their losses.

                                 VIDALIA
                        How long do we give Perseus before-

                                 CHEOPS
                                (pointing to the temple)
                        Look...

           They all turn, jaws-dropped.  Perseus shuffles, weak-kneed,
           down the temple steps.  In one hand, his blood spattered
           sickle.  In the other, a dripping sack.

           INT. BASILICA CUPOLA - NIGHT

           A small widow's walk at the highest point on the Basilica.  

           The wide view reveals the Basilica's multi-storeyed
           colonnades and staggered terraces descending to the piazza,
           the buildings and streets of the Acropolis, and beyond.

           Kepheus focuses on the "beyond" thru a long, mounted
           spyglass.  His Consul of War at his side.

           SPYGLASS POV

           Bonfires rage outside the city walls.  Blurred silhouettes
           pass in front of the flames...  Minotaurs march.  Centaur
           regiments gallop.  

           And bigger things...  Living things that don't fit in the
           spyglass' view.  Ranks of siege towers roll into line.

           Movement everywhere.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 KEPHEUS
                                (looking thru eyepiece)
                        Like hyenas come to pick our bones. 
                        I had no idea the armies of Tiamat
                        were so great in number.

                                 CONSUL OF WAR
                        Set too, we think.  Contingents of
                        Nephilim Giants and Anubites, steadily
                        coming ashore from the Witchloams to
                        augment Tiamat's Centaur and Minotaur
                        legions.

           Kepheus pulls back from the eyepiece and meets his CONSUL
           OF WAR with worried eyes.  He looks out into the distance.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        If we could ignite the Sun-Lenses. 
                        Open the apertures wide and scour
                        their ranks with shafts of fire. 
                        Roasting them where they sit.

                                 CONSUL OF WAR
                        There's no sunlight to harness.

                                 KEPHEUS
                        I know, I was only--
                                (beat)
                        This damnable storm.  Closing in. 
                        Suffocating us by sky, by sea, and
                        by land.  How many--

                        I thought it was seven... at least.

                        We've more tricks yet.  The engineers

                        You'll have to, Consul.  Because
                        I've grown rather attached to this
                        notion of "hope."

           INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Andromeda eats plump grapes from a silver dish.  Peshet
           plays a SOMBER TUNE on the lyre.  Distant CRIES and SHOUTS
           in the streets outside.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Can you play something a little more
                        airy?  Not so melancholy.

           Peshet thinks.  She plucks out a sweeter tune.

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                        Something- I'm sorry- something more
                        brisk.  More mercurial.

           Peshet plays a bit faster.  Andromeda taps her toes lightly. 
           She sways her hips as if not thinking about it.  Still,
           WAILING from out in the city starts to leak in.

           Peshet stops playing and slams the lyre down.

                        Can you really be so self-absorbed
                        that you don't hear what's happening
                        out there or are you just heartless?

           Peshet storms out and slams the door.  She softens a bit

           far-off sound of a GONG.  Peshet reluctantly leaves.

           The pained SHOUTS and WAILING outside continue to bleed in. 
           Andromeda snaps.  She storms out onto

           THE BALCONY

           and screams with red-faced fury at the city.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Silence!  What are you screaming

                        Do you want me to die for you?!

           Her anger melts to sadness.  Tears fall down her cheeks.

           She collapses to the floor.

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                        I wish I wasn't so scared...

           EXT. BEHIND THE TAVERNA CHARYBDIS - NIGHT

           Peshet wears a shawl as she meets Fantasos in the alley.

                                 FANTASOS
                        One night soon, a gong will ring
                        three times.  When you hear it, unlock
                        the back gate.  Then go to the
                        Princess's chambers...

           Fantasos hands Peshet a dagger.

                                 FANTASOS (CONT'D)
                        ...And bring us Andromeda, dead or
                        alive, to be offered to Leviathan.

                                 PESHET
                        What about Perseus and the--?

                                 FANTASOS
                        Our sands are out in four days.  And
                        if he returns on the fifth, I wonder
                        what he'll find in place of Joppa. 
                        Charred ruins or just a black abyss? 
                        Or he could already be dead, and
                        never return at all.

           Peshet just stares at the dagger, hands trembling.

                                 FANTASOS (CONT'D)
                        What choice is there?

           EXT. OLIVE GROVE - DAY

           A deep and narrow walled path unrolls over the pastoral
           orchard hills.

           SUPERIMPOSE: Somewhere in the Hills of Illyria... 
           3 Days Remaining...

           The expedition once fourteen strong now carved to six-
           Perseus, Vidalia, Amoun, Cheops, Mongke, and Tamburlane.

           They arrive at a milestone, drained.  

                                 AMOUN
                        Perseus...  Let's stop for the night.

                                 PERSEUS
                        We have little more than three days...

                                 AMOUN
                        We've been running as straight and
                        swift as an arrow for the past week,
                        often quitting the clear roads in
                        favour of the more direct routes. 
                        You need rest or they'll be nothing
                        left of you to face Leviathan.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Perseus begrudgingly hears him.  He stops and reads the
           ancient words carved into the milestone-

           "the Polis of JOVE PATER : { XI stadia S. }"

           Cheops sees it too.

                                 CHEOPS
                        What's eleven stadia to the South? 
                        Never heard of "Jove Pater."

                                 VIDALIA
                        It's another name for Zeus.

                                 AMOUN
                        It's an ancient milestone.  From a
                        time when cities were named for their
                        patron deities.

           As Amoun explains, Perseus notices, in leaning on the
           monolith, how his palm casually covers the letters "-TER."
           He brings his other have to cover the "-VE."

                                 AMOUN (CONT'D)
                        You see, Cheops, "the Polis of Jove
                        Pater" is the ancient name of-

                                 PERSEUS
                        Joppa...

           Perseus stares intently at the partially covered milestone
           which now reads under his hands-

           "the Polis of JO-- PA--- : { XI stadia S. }"

                                 AMOUN
                        Right, it was once the most sacred
                        sight in the worship of Jove.

                                 PERSEUS
                        I know what Tiamat's doing...

           Everyone looks up expectantly.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        Tiamat has been gorged on decades of
                        bloodshed.  Now the Gods want peace
                        and she must make her move.  She's
                        holding the city of Zeus hostage. 
                        Striking terror in its citizens. 
                        Compelling them to make a human
                        sacrifice.  Is there a more potent
                        offering?  She's forging Joppa into
                        her new church.

                                 VIDALIA
                                (gets it)
                        And with the sacrifice to Leviathan,
                        the ancient abode of Zeus becomes
                        the new abode of Tiamat, granting
                        her final sway to supplant him as
                        the new God of Gods.

                                 PERSEUS
                        That's her plan.  Overthrow Zeus by
                        seizing his "home"...  Before his
                        son can stop her.

           A beat as the casually dropped revelation sinks in.

                                 CHEOPS
                        Wait, what did he just say?

                                 VIDALIA
                        How did you know?

                                 PERSEUS
                        The Shaikh was a priest of Zeus.  I
                        heard his prayers in my head.

           Vidalia draws his eyes with a look of great import.

                                 VIDALIA
                        Tiamat can't ascend Olympos, Perseus. 
                        It would be catastrophic.  The War
                        would last forever.  She'd feast on
                        the prayers of her subjects and the
                        blood of her enemies.  There'd be no
                        defying the Gods again.  The War
                        Goddess must not be allowed to rule
                        the Gods.

                                 AMOUN
                        Perseus will never let it happen. 
                        Let's rest here tonight, shall we? 
                        Tomorrow, we reach Joppa.

           Perseus holds her eye contact in silence.  His eyes suddenly
           full of regret and conflict.  Amoun glances between the two
           with awareness and severity.

                                 AMOUN (CONT'D)
                        You won't let it will you, Perseus?

           Perseus holds on Vidalia.  She creases her brow at him. 
           Concerned.  Pained.  Imploring.

                                 PERSEUS
                        No, Amoun.  No I won't.
           EXT. OLIVE GROVE - EVENING

           The fat red sun dips down to the olive-forested hills.

                                 VIDALIA (V.O.)
                        I don't remember the tribe that prayed
                        to me... 

           EXT. OLIVE GROVE - NIGHT

           Vidalia and Perseus traipse side by side down the path
           between unkempt rows of knurled olive boughs.

                                 VIDALIA
                        I remember I loved them.  I brought
                        rain to their fields.  Sheltered
                        them from the harsh world.  Because
                        I was sure it would break them. 
                        They seemed so fragile and beautiful. 
                        I underestimated them.
                                (shaking her head)
                        When I saw you emerge from the temple
                        with Medusa's head, I knew I
                        underestimated them.  Beautiful,
                        yes.  But not fragile.  Resilient. 
                        Bold.  Surprising.  I saw a Man do
                        an impossible thing.  Vanquish the
                        last living Nightmare.

           Perseus doesn't respond right away.  They walk in silence.

                                 PERSEUS
                        I was mad with fear.  I could barely
                        think.  It was no heroic feat.  I
                        just didn't want to die.

                                 VIDALIA
                        But so many Men had died, trying to
                        do that very thing.

           Perseus looks away, unconvinced.

                                 PERSEUS
                        I'm no hero.  A hero believes.  A
                        hero has something to fight for,
                        something more than fear- a purpose. 
                        My heart needed this.  This Labour. 
                        But now it feels so-

           He looks up and sees Vidalia transfixed by the dark grove.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        What is it?

           She hurries to the base of an ancient, gnarled tree.  She
           probes.  She carefully places her foot in a tangle of small
           shrubs.  And then descends into the ground.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Perseus cocks an eyebrow, a bit baffled.

                                 VIDALIA (O.S.)
                        Come here!

           Perseus approaches and pulls back the shrubs to find a small
           opening in the cleft of the tree's twisted roots.

           INT. SHRINE IN THE SEDGE - NIGHT

           Perseus drops into a dark, but cozy earthen den, walled by
           roots and old timber supports.  Vidalia stands motionless
           before a bare altar.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Are you okay?

                                 VIDALIA
                        This is- This is my church.

                                 PERSEUS
                        What?

                                 VIDALIA
                        This is where I was born to the world. 
                        Where they prayed to me.

                                 PERSEUS
                        I thought you didn't remember.

                                 VIDALIA
                        I don't.  But you know your home
                        when you see it.

           She sees a clay tablet on the altar with illegible fragments
           of letters- remains of a word gouged away long ago.  Vidalia
           runs her fingers along the scoring.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        In the early days of the war, rangers
                        fanned thru the hills.  They drafted
                        the men and boys from the rural
                        tribes.  And stamped out whatever
                        traces of religion they came across. 
                        No matter how apparently innocuous. 
                        My name would've been carved here.

           She turns from the tablet.  She looks around and presses
           her hands lovingly to the dirt walls.

                                 PERSEUS
                        How long do you have left?

                                 VIDALIA
                        I don't know.

                                 PERSEUS
                        How will it-?

                                 VIDALIA
                        I will simply vanish.  It won't be
                        theatrical tragedy or blood-and-
                        thunder.  It will happen quick and
                        quiet like a dream evaporating at
                        dawn.  No one will notice the moment. 
                        Because it will be when no one's
                        thinking of me.

           Perseus approaches the altar.  He kneels by the clay name-
           tablet and pulls the dagger from his sandal-straps.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 PERSEUS
                        What does it look like?

           He starts to scratch a "V" on the tablet.  Vidalia's curious
           face wrenches with anguish when it dawns on her.  She
           squeezes her tearful eyes closed to find restraint.

                                 VIDALIA
                        It doesn't work like that.  I'm
                        terminal.  Faded past the point of
                        remedy.  Nothing can save me.

                                 PERSEUS
                                (standing, determined)
                        No, you're wrong!  Is there no amount
                        of devotion that would be enough?! 
                        No compassion?!  Gods, Vidalia, no
                        amount of love?  Love!  Does it not
                        buy at least a day?!
                                (closer, softening)
                        I won't believe it doesn't.

                                 VIDALIA
                                (shaking her head)
                        Why did you have to give me a name?

           They kiss.  Tongue-tips press, cautious, still foreign. 
           But with a mounting alacrity that quickens their breath and
           opens their lips.  Until Vidalia pulls back.

           Perseus exhales and reluctantly starts to pull away.  Vidalia
           tightens her grip on his arm.

           A soft collision of bodies, mouths, and hands.

           Vidalia pulls at the cords and bonds on Perseus's armour.

           His shirt of leather scales RATTLES to the ground.

           She draws up his wool tunic, over his head, and off.

           He paws at the elaborate straps and ties at the back of her
           bandeau.  She stops him.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        Mmmf...
                                (breaks away)
                        Hold on.

           She grazes the hem with her fingertips.  The leather
           untangles, restyles, and enfolds her in a thick wool pelt.

           Perseus cradles and kisses her neck.  He slides the pelt
           off her shoulders, pecking the skin of her collar.  She
           lets it fall to her hands and tosses it to the ground.  

           Perseus pulls her bare body close to his own.

           She tenderly pushes, motioning him down to the unfurled
           pelt.  He lays on his back.  She falls on top and covers
           his mouth with a kiss.

           He runs his fingers thru her washed-out flaxen curls,
           trailing fine wakes of gold.  A frail involuntary SIGH. 
           The wilted blossoms in her crown slowly open with colour.

           Tree roots twist and curl from the dirt wall.  They tangle
           and braid to form a natural canopy over the lovers.

           Between the gaps, flushed skin, sliding hands, panting ribs,
           tense legs, all moving in slow fluid accord.

           EXT. OLIVE GROVE - NIGHT

           The ancient tree above the shrine.  Its bough GROANS, POPS,
           and stretches.  The leafy canopy reaches and expands in all
           directions.  It grows slowly but palpably.

           INT. SHRINE IN THE SEDGE - NIGHT

           Perseus and Vidalia rest on the pelt.  He, on his back. 
           She, diagonal, chest pressed to his, hands folded under her
           cheek.  Sweat cools on their skin.

           They listen to the night sounds- the CHIRRUPS of a
           nightingale and the plaintive COOS of an owl.  They lay
           there awake, silent, and still

                                 PERSEUS
                        When you vanish, I'll find you.

                                 VIDALIA
                        There won't be anything to find.

                                 VIDALIA
                        That's impossible.

                                 PERSEUS
                        I thought you'd leave some room to
                        be surprised when it comes to Man.

                                 VIDALIA
                        Why?  Why would you try?

                                 PERSEUS
                        Because I'm the hero.

                        But I'm not your Princessa.

           No reply from Perseus.  Vidalia props her chin on her folded
           hands to face him.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        I want to give you something.

           Perseus looks at her, inquisitive.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        A spell.  It's nothing.  A small
                        spell.  I could use it one last time
                        and forget it forever or I could
                        pass it on.  I'm not going to need
                        it but you might.  At the very least,
                        you'd appreciate it.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Don't start giving away your secrets

                        Please, Perseus.  I want you to have
                        something of me.  Just let me give
                        you this slight bit of magic.

           He frowns, still unsettled by the gloomy implication, but
           he sees in her face what it means to her.

                                 PERSEUS
                        How will I know how to use it?

                                 VIDALIA
                        I'll write it on your instinct. 
                        When the time comes, you'll know...

           He silently considers.

           He does.  And so does she.  She takes his head tenderly in
           her hands and presses her forehead to his.  

           She delicately slips her fingers into his mind as a tear
           runs down her cheek.

           PERSEUS'S VISION - ESSENTIA OF VIDALIA'S SPELL

           - A white lid opens to a black eye.  Reflected in the eye-
           white clouds roll and stream over a crisp blue sky.

           INT. PITCHED TEMPLE - NIGHT

           Tiamat and Set stand over the beheaded body of Medusa.  The
           baby snakes and beetles nesting in the corpse come and go
           by way of her neatly sliced neck.

                                 SET
                        This is a point of divergence.  Fate
                        has already begun to shift.  Subtly. 
                        This sends uncertain ripples into
                        the future.

                        They were not even to reach Medusa. 
                        How did he take her head?

                                 SET
                        He's bending the path.  Moving off
                        the board.  Sidestepping the rules.

                                 TIAMAT
                        Very well.  Then we shall break the
                        rules.  The time has come to make
                        your presence known.

                                 SET
                        Are you asking me to directly involve
                        myself.

                                 TIAMAT
                        If he vanquishes Leviathan, our coup
                        ends.  And so do we.  Oh yes, Set.

           INT. SHRINE IN THE SEDGE - MORNING

           Perseus sleeps, nestled in the folded-over pelt.  He draws
           in a sudden, long breath and cracks his eyes.  He opens
           them wide when he finds he's alone in the pelt.

           He presses his hand into the furry wool, feeling for warmth. 
           He sits up quick and looks from side to side.  

                                 PERSEUS
                        Vidalia?  Vidalia!

           He peels back the close canopy of roots and peers out into
           the shrine.  Amoun leans on the altar, arms crossed.

                                 AMOUN
                        I see now I've allowed this
                        infatuation to progress too far.

           Perseus pulls his tunic on.  He tears out of the roots.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Where's Vidalia? 

                                 AMOUN
                        I did nothing to your Chthonian.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Where is she?  Did she- ?  Vidalia!  

           Vidalia descends the ladder into the shrine.

                                 VIDALIA
                        Perseus?  Was that you?  I just left
                        to pick olives but they weren't ripe
                        so I had to settle for-

           She turns and nearly jumps out of her skin to see Amoun. 
           She spills an armful of raspberries.  Her eyes dart to
           Perseus.  He can't hide his relief.

                                 AMOUN
                        I hope you've got it out of your
                        systems.  Now, stonewall it.
                                (to Vidalia)
                        And you.  You should know better. 
                        He's engaged to a Princessa.

                        You're not serious.  That's the easy
                        part.  That's the reward.  The fabled
                        beauty of Illyria and you were born
                        to share her bed.  And in so doing

                        you save the world just by showing
                        up.  It's the happy ending to the

                        No Amoun.  It always sounded like a
                        good story to me.  But I can't be in
                        it.  I found a better ending.

                                 AMOUN
                        You selfish fool.  The people of
                        Joppa.  The end of the war.  Mankind's
                        very existence.  You would risk it
                        all for what?  Love for a fading
                        Goddess?

           A hot desert breeze blows traces of sand into the den. 
           Vidalia's spilt raspberries turn brown and shrivel.

           Amoun grabs his chest and drops to his knees.  Even Perseus
           and Vidalia crumple in agony.

           Sand swirls and coalesces into the God Set.

           Amoun tries to mumble a spell.  Set softly touches his chest. 
           Amoun bloats and splits open.  Scarabs pour out.

           Perseus plants his feet and readies for a fight.

           Set moves next for Vidalia.  She backs into a wall.  Set
           grabs her neck and hoists her up, strangling her.  

           Perseus throws a punch...  But Set easily catches it in his
           free hand.  He holds Perseus's fist.  The veins stand taut
           and Perseus doubles over, paralyzed by the dead touch.

           The pale Vidalia fades more.  Her pink lips and green eyes
           turn grey.  Last whispers of gold drain from her flaxen
           hair as Set chokes her, one-handed, bored.

           Perseus's eyes burn.  He clusters the fingers of his free
           hand into a fist.  He reels back and clocks Set with an ear-
           splitting CRACK OF THUNDER.

           Set drops Vidalia and staggers back, perplexed and aghast. 
           Beams of light shoot from his split lip.

           The hairs on his forearm bristle with a crackling charge as
           Perseus lifts Set by the collar.

                        knows her plan and tell her to sit
                        down and watch me stop her.  And if

           Set dissolves into a cloud of sand and slithers out on the
           wind.  Perseus rushes to Vidalia's aid.

                        blood of an Olympian.  How'd you-

           He takes her head in his hands.  They hold each other on
           the dirt floor.

           EXT. WOODED RIDGE - EVENING

           The wearied survivors, Perseus, Vidalia, Cheops, Mongke,
           and Tamburlane crest a wooded hill.

           Vidalia appears more colourless after Set's attack than
           we've yet seen her- almost completely black and white from
           head to toe.

           They all clear the woods and find themselves on a shelf
           that slopes sharply into a wide, flat basin.  The rain-lashed
           walls of Joppa's acropolis rise in the distance.

           SUPERIMPOSE:  The Eve of the 30th Day...

           But what stops them dead is the limitless inhuman army that
           fills the plain, right up to the city walls.

           CENTAURS, woolly MINOTAURS, the capering jackal- and hyena-
           man figures of ANUBITES.

           NEPHILIM rise over the hordes with their elephant, rhino,
           or hippo heads atop wide leathery humanoid shoulders.  They
           tow a city of siege towers towards Joppa's wall.

                        will win.

           Perseus turns to look Vidalia in the eye.

                        I can't leave you, Vidalia.

                        Mankind could grow to become.  In
                        what they should grow to become.  

                                 PERSEUS
                        What's that?

                                 VIDALIA
                        You.

           Perseus doesn't know how to reply.

                                 VIDALIA (CONT'D)
                        Look, Perseus.  Look.

           He turns again to look out over the plain of invaders.

                                 VIDALIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        They don't deserve to end.  Show
                        them what you showed me.  Show them
                        the impossible.

           Perseus slowly nods as he shades his eyes towards Joppa.

                                 PERSEUS
                        Alright.  I'll finish this...  But--

           He turns.  Vidalia is gone.  

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        Vidalia?  Where--?

           He scans back and forth.  Up and down.  Nothing.  

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        No.  Not now.  Please not now.

           We pull back as he ransacks the underbrush.  He dives into
           the wood, searching.  But it's too late.  She's gone.

           INT. BACKROOM OF THE TAVERNA CHARYBDIS - NIGHT

           The true leadership of the Cataracts Resistance gathered in
           the dark around a fire pit.  Six men in robes and hoods.  

           They sit on the floor, rocking in trance-like ecstasy.  The
           room throbs with their MUTTERING SUSURRATION.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 FANTASOS
                        We invoke thee.

           Fantasos throws a handful of leaves on the coals.  Thick
           hallucinogenic smoke balloons up.

                                 FANTASOS (CONT'D)
                        We wait this night to hear and obey.

           Fantasos steps onto the rostrum and pulls the Cataracts
           standard back from a sunken alcove...  

                                 FANTASOS (CONT'D)
                        We desire only your Will.  To hasten
                        your Ascension.  We await to be
                        devoured by you- distilled and
                        absorbed into the sum of your
                        perfection.  Holy of holies.  Goddess
                        of Gods.  Tiamat the Deep.

           Incense burns. A marble idol of Tiamat hangs over a bronze
           tripod and cauldron filled with oil-black water.

                                 TIAMAT (O.S.)
                        My followers...

           Fantasos looks around and realizes the voice comes from the
           cauldron.  In the reflection and only in the reflection on
           the mirror-flat surface of the water, the idol moves.

           It regards Fantasos and reaches for the cauldron's lip. 
           Fingers rise from the liquid and curl around the rim.  It
           climbs up, rising from the water as the real Tiamat.

           The viscous black water clings to her shape in a film,
           forming into a dark gown as she ascends.

           She floats above the rostrum and surveys her followers. 
           Quiet.  Still.  Their heads bowed.  None dare to look.

                                 TIAMAT (CONT'D)
                        My devoted apostles, you've done
                        well.

           She leans down and whispers to Fantasos.

                                 TIAMAT (CONT'D)
                        You've sown the seeds of revolt. 
                        Now comes the harvest.  My holy armies
                        stand ready at the gates.  Now is
                        the final rite of consecration.  

           She runs her fingers sensually thru his hair and gently,
           spectrally reaches into his brain.

                        Offer your Princessa to Leviathan in
                        exaltation of the Deep.  The hour of
                        sacrifice has arrived.

           INT. ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           A GONG sounds once in the night.  Kepheus sleeps soundly on
           a divan by Cassiopeia's bed.

           INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           A GONG sounds again.  On her balcony, Andromeda looks out
           into the wet, tortured city night.

           EXT. BASILICA BACK GATE - NIGHT

           The GONG sounds once more.  Peshet stealthily pulls back
           the lock bolts.  She props the heavy gate ajar.  

           She takes one last hard look at that open gate.

           Then looks down at the dagger in her palm.  She closes her
           fist around the hilt and hurries inside.

           INT. PERISTYLE - NIGHT

           Inside the Basilica, three hooded, CLOAKED REBELS glide
           thru the shadows, brandishing daggers of their own.

           INT. ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Peshet enters, dagger at her back.  No sign of Andromeda.

                                 PESHET
                        My Lady?  Andromeda?

           She looks out on

           ANDROMEDA'S BALCONY

           and gasps.  The dagger CLATTERS on the floor tiles. 
           Andromeda turns at the sound.  She stands on the baluster,
           about to jump.  Her face, streaked with tears.

           Peshet forgets her mission and rushes to Andromeda's aid.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        Peshet, stop!  I know what I'm
                        doing...

                        My Lady-

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        You're right.  I've just been-
                                (whispering)
                        -worthless.  Just worthless.

                                 PESHET
                        I didn't mean any of that, my Lady. 
                        It was cruel.  Just give me your
                        hand.  Andromeda, please.  Please.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        My people are suffering.  Because of
                        me.  And if I can end their pain... 
                        Maybe dying is the most important
                        thing I'll ever do.

                                 PESHET
                        I've never...  I've never heard you
                        call them "my people" before.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        I was afraid, Peshet.  Afraid of
                        understanding that the fate of so
                        much could pivot on me.  
                                (inhaling strength)
                        I'm not afraid any more.  I must
                        make it right...  I'm sorry for being
                        such a-  I'm sorry, my Peshet... 
                        Goodbye.

           She takes one step back.  And falls.

           Peshet grabs her wrist.  

                                 PESHET
                        You'll not die, my Lady.  I won't
                        let it happen.  I'll keep you safe.

           She pulls Andromeda up.  She embraces her tight on the
           balcony floor as the Princessa weeps softly.

                                 PESHET (CONT'D)
                        Today, you're only Princessa.  One
                        day your people will need a Queen
                        who's not afraid to die for them.

           Peshet glimpses the dagger where she dropped it.  

                                 PESHET (CONT'D)
                        Oh, Gods...  What have I done?

           She urgently helps Andromeda to her feet.

           CONTINUED:

                        We have to get you out of here right
                        now.  We have to hide you.

           EXT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ANDROMEDA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Peshet leads Andromeda out.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        What about my father?

           A voice answers from the darkness behind them.

                                 VOICE
                        Your father is dead.  

           The three Cloaked Rebels step into the light from Andromeda's
           door.  The voice pulls his hood down.  Agenor, the scullion
           boy.  He wipes his bloody dagger on his cloak.

                                 AGENOR
                        Peshet, hand over the Princessa. 
                        She's coming with us now.

           Peshet bares her teeth.  She stands between the Cloaked
           Rebels, plants her feet, and unsheathes her lioness claws.  

                                 PESHET
                                (snarls)
                        Come and take her!

           Agenor and the Cloaked Rebels rush Peshet.

           She fights all three with nimble, feline agility.  She dodges
           and darts.  She leaps over them.

           In a single move, she rakes the gut of one, instantly
           eviscerating him, and high-kicks the other behind her,
           slashing his face with the claws on her lioness feet.

           In that instant, Agenor sinks his blade into her exposed
           ribs.  She totters and coughs, deep, wet, and bloody.

           She clutches her collapsed lung.  She gurgles and hacks for
           air.  Agenor just laughs at her.  

           She falls against the wall and starts to slide towards the
           floor, coughing and gulping, leaving a slick trail of blood
           down the wall.  The Rebels advance towards Andromeda.

           Peshet explodes up.  Sweeps her claws.  One last stand.

           But the energy she spends and the air she gasps for don't
           balance.  It gets the best of her.  A slip-up.  She takes a
           thrust of steel in the spine.  

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She turns and lurches for Andromeda.  Her leg muscles fail
           and she pitches to her knees.

           Her tearful eyes meet Andromeda's with deep regret.  She
           wheezes her words with blood frothing on her lips.

                                 PESHET (CONT'D)
                        Andromeda...  Run...  Please run...

           Agenor yanks Peshet's head back by her hair and slides his
           blade across her throat.

           M.O.S.  Andromeda opens her mouth and wails.

           Agenor drops Peshet in a quickly spreading pool of blood. 
           He and the surviving Rebel drag Andromeda away.

           She kicks and struggles.  She reaches forlorn towards
           Peshet's body as she falls into the dark.

           EXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - MORNING

           Grey, stormy.  ONLOOKERS gathered silent in the dismal rain. 
           A granite platform on the cliff's edge with a big iron winch. 
           Fantasos waits there next to a bronze gong.

           Agenor and the Cloaked Rebels drag Andromeda in her soggy
           nightgown, barefoot thru the mud and the people.  She looks
           over the faces of the Onlookers.

           Most have the look of humble, working-class folk- weary
           eyes and resigned expressions.  Not spiteful or relieved. 
           Not happy with the conclusion.  But what can be done?

           Agenor pulls her to the platform.  He shoves her to her
           knees.  Fantasos passes Agenor a quill, thick black ink
           dripping from its barbed point.

           She flinches as Agenor rips the back of her gown.  He smiles
           coldly and with the sharp quill gouges symbols into her
           back- baroque, meticulous, and excruciating.

           Agenor finishes the ceremonial symbols and stands her up. 
           Her tight, white-knuckled fists, shaking with anger, pain,
           and fear hold up her ripped nightgown, heavy with rain.  

           Fantasos inspects Agenor's symbols.  The raindrops streak
           the loose ink down Andromeda's back.  Fantasos nods.

           Agenor pulls her to the winch on the windswept edge hundreds
           of feet above the raging sea.

                                 AGENOR
                                (pushing her)
                        Lie down.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He binds her with heavy ankle and wrist cuffs.  He
           crisscrosses iron chains from knees to shoulders.

           Agenor cranks the winch.  The winch-chain pulls taut and
           lifts Andromeda off the ground by her ankles.  

           She straightens her neck to look straight down the sheer
           cliff wall and the churning waves that await her.

                                 FANTASOS
                        O Leviathan, firstborn of the Deep,
                        please accept our mortal offering of
                        flesh and blood for the exaltation
                        of your Cosmic Mother.  And may it
                        sate your hunger for a thousand years.

           Agenor pulls Andromeda, dangling there upside down, and
           flashes his cruel smile.

           She spits in his eye.

           Agenor laughs.  He wipes his eye and lets go of Andromeda. 
           He lets her dangle helplessly.

           One of the Cloaked Rebels strikes the GONG.

           GONG.

           GONG.

           Silence.  All look out to sea.  Waiting.

           The wind softly rocks Andromeda on her CREAKING chain.  But
           she holds her wide eyes on sea.

           Out on the sea, a bulge of water swells and plows ahead.

           The Onlookers watch in awed, terrified silence.

           Andromeda's throat trembles and tightens as her eyes follow
           the advancing bulge of water to the base of the cliffs.

           The LEVIATHAN breaches the surface... 

           Colossal, it surges up the full three hundred foot cliffs,
           still with only a fraction of its total length exposed.

           A prehistoric master-mold from which a Creator cast all
           creatures in the deep- crustacean carapace, croc scutes,
           clawed flippers, bristling swimmerets.  Jaws lined with
           rows of crooked teeth chocked tight... 

           Jaws hurtling up towards Andromeda.  They open, big as the
           earth herself opening up- BELLOWING from a hooked black
           squid-beak at the back of its gullet.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           At the apex of its jump, it snaps those jaws shut with a
           booming CRACK LIKE THUNDER...

           Just millimeters from Andromeda's dangling head- actually
           catching a few stray strands of hair before it falls back.

           It's vast shadow circles in the water below.

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

           The Esoteric legions of Tiamat and Set move into action.

           They draw their weapons and begin to rush the city, BELLOWING
           and ROARING savage battle cries in the thousands.  

           Waves of monsters roll across the plain to break on the
           walls of Joppa.

           INT. TALOS ARMORY - DAY

           Ranks of fifteen-foot clockwork Talos soldiers stand under
           scaffolds.  Metallic muscles and corinthian helmets shine.

           On their backs, open panels reveals rows of keyholes with
           labels like "hip," "shoulder," "logic," "hostility,"
           "pneuma," and "energeia" among many many others.

           OPERATORS with chains of the matched keys run up the
           scaffolds and hustle to wind-up each keyhole plug.

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

           The Talos march from the city gates.  Their actions ratchet
           and spring mechanically.  Legions of Human HOPLITE (infantry)
           soldiers stream out between the Talos legs.

           With their spears and swords the Hoplites slam into ranks
           of Centaurs, Minotaurs, and the snarling Anubite packs.  A
           frenzy of skewering steel and throat-ripping teeth.

           The Talos make directly for the big threats.  They splinter
           thru the siege towers.  They assault the Nephilim giants,
           the leathery mud-painted barbarians with elephantine heads.

           The Talos lift their battle axes with a slow CLICK-CLICK-
           CLICK... Then- WHAAAM- the spring releases with the force
           to chop off a Nephilim's head in a single blow. 

           Here and there on the battlefield, the Nephilim prove
           sometimes too quick- charging and twisting thru the metal
           Talos with their tusks, horns, and teeth.  Battle is met.
           EXT. SOLAR COLLECTOR - DAY

           On a central roof, OPERATORS man a room-sized concave lens
           of numerous finely polished glass panels.  It sits atop an
           array of hand cranks and gears.

                                 FIRST OPERATOR
                        Try it.

                                 SECOND OPERATOR
                        But the clouds...

                                 FIRST OPERATOR
                        Just try it!

           The Operators work the cranks.  The gears turn and CLACK. 
           The dish slowly tilts.

           EXT. CITY WALLS - CONTINUOUS

           A network of prisms, mirrors, and segments of angular brass
           tubing line the tops of the walls.

           The web directs flickering beams of light from the collector
           to...

           EXT. SUN LENS TURRETS - CONTINUOUS

           Where GUNNERS man massive arrays of stacked magnifying lenses
           on adjustable platforms.

           The Gunners twist open the bronze apertures of the lenses. 
           No use.  Not enough sunlight.

           EXT. WOODED RIDGE - DAY

           Cheops, Mongke, and Tamburlane look past the clashing armies
           to the distant skyline of Joppa.  

           They hear the far off GONG GONG GONG.

                                 CHEOPS
                        It can only mean the sacrifice has
                        begun.

           Detached, Perseus gets his things together.  He stands and
           starts off in the opposite direction.

           Mongke shouts something in his native language.  The general
           idea is clear- "What?  Where are you going?" Discouraged,
           Cheops too provokes Perseus as he walks away.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        Giving up, is that it?  Your lady is
                        gone and now, after all this, there
                        are just some things too big to-

           Perseus stops at the tree line as something comes to him.

                                 PERSEUS
                        I'm not giving up...  Not on Vidalia
                        and not on Man...

           PERSEUS'S VISION - ESSENTIA OF VIDALIA'S SPELL 

           - The white eyelid opens to the streaming clouds and blue
           sky reflected on the dark eye.

                                                               QUICK CUT:

           - The white wings beat the air.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Perseus smiles and starts to laugh.  He gets it.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        You don't understand, rhapsode.  She
                        was right.  They need to see something
                        they once believed impossible.

           He turns to the wood.  He lowers his head and raises his
           palms.  He concentrates.

           A wave of wind RUSTLES out from him thru the underbrush and
           the trees, fanning out thru the woods.

           The vein on Perseus's temple tightens from sustained focus.

           The wave of wind bounces back to him, RUSTLING, growing to
           a HOWL.  The wind converges on him and abruptly ceases.

           He looks up to the sky and waits.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        Something like this...

           The majestic wingspan of a pure, white Pegasus WHOOSHES
           over the treetops.  The Pegasus banks, descends and lands.

           Its powerful hooves plow billows of dust as it slides to a
           stop right in front of Perseus.

           Cheops, Mongke, and Tamburlane just gawk dumbly as the un-
           tameable animal bows and flattens its wide wings to the
           ground, beckoning Perseus to climb on.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Perseus straddles the animal's back.  The Pegasus stands
           and flexes its wings.  Perseus rides up to Cheops.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        Rhapsode, when you tell this story,
                        don't you dare say it was the God-
                        half.

           He spurs the Pegasus on.  It stretches its wings and launches
           off the ridge with astounding power.  It leaves swirling
           vortexes of dust in the wake of its wide wings.

           Cheops, Mongke, and Tamburlane watch Perseus drive the
           soaring animal high into the sky.

                                 CHEOPS
                        There's the Mankind I know.

           Perseus and Pegasus sail high above the battle, to Joppa.

           Tamburlane gives Cheops a sword and slaps him on the back. 
           The pair don't wait.  They slide down the slope, rushing to
           the raging battle, eager for monsters to kill.

           Cheops raises his eyebrows at the battle, skittish.  He
           looks to the Pegasus in the sky.  He tightens his jaw.

                                 CHEOPS (CONT'D)
                        Right then.  We fight.

           He boldly slides down to join Mongke and Tamburlane.

           EXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - DAY

           CLICK-CLACK-CLICK-CLACK.  The chain lowers Andromeda upside-
           down, to the sea.  She looks straight down at the water.

           Not content to be left to her fate, Andromeda swings her
           chain as the Leviathan lets its eyes break the surface below,
           watching and circling anxiously.

           Andromeda swings back and forth until she builds enough
           momentum to reach up and grasp the links above her ankles.

           She pulls herself up and climbs the very chain she dangles
           from, leaving a slack sweep drooping under her.

           The skyscraping Leviathan hurdles up.  It opens its jaws.

           And SNAPS down on the drooping slack of chain.

           It slides back down, clutching the section of chain between
           Andromeda and the winch tight in its jaws.  The Princessa's
           grip slips and she careens down with it.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           On the cliffside platform, the spool spins, wildly unreeling
           the chain.  It catches tight.  And rips the whole winch out
           of the marble.

           A shadow glides over the Onlookers.  

           They turn one by one from the sea and look up.  They gasp. 
           They point up towards

           THE SKY 

           as the stark white Pegasus cuts thru the dismal rain with
           Perseus on its back.

           Perseus looks down, and dives from Pegasus.  He plunges
           after the falling chain end.

           He catches it.  And rides it hundreds of feet down.

           Down into the sea...

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

           KA-BOOM!  Mongke and Tamburlane's shoulder-mounted gonne
           hurls a round at the rhino Nephilim that looms over them.  

           The shot knocks its shoulder out with a CRACK.  The Nephilim
           stumbles and slams into a siege tower.  Both the giant and
           the tower crush a patrol of Minotaurs.

           Cheops nimbly hacks away at a pack of barking Anubite
           warriors.  Too many.  He runs.  The pack stays on him weaving
           thru the chaotic battlefield.

           He leads them right under the thundering hooves of a quartet
           of Centaurs, just barely squeezing thru himself.

           One of the Centaurs stops, turns, and sees him.  It gallops
           right for Cheops.  Cheops quickly ducks and hacks one of
           the beasts legs out from under it.

           Mongke and Tamburlane have been having immense fun bringing
           down giants with their cannon.  But now, three bear down-
           two elephantine and one hippo Nephilim.

           The pair dumps what's left of their gonne-powder into the
           big shoulder-mounted cannon.  They quickly upturn it, plant
           the muzzle firmly in the mud, and light the fuse.

           The whole cannon shoots up like an rocket.  It smacks the
           hippo Nephilim upside the chin, SNAPPING his neck.  

           The improvised missile explodes in a shower of twisted iron
           shrapnel that shreds the other two giants.
           EXT. UNDERSEA - DAY

           The Leviathan hurtles towards the continental shelf. 
           Andromeda flails, tiny and trifling, bound to the chain
           towed in the vast monster's jaws.

           Far behind, Perseus holds doggedly to the other end of the
           chain as the water ROARS around him.

           The Leviathan comes to the edge of the shelf and dives
           spiraling into the dark blue.

           In the darker water, the Leviathan stops.  It furiously
           shakes and whips the chain.

           A link snaps.  Andromeda plummets, weighted by her shackles. 
           She struggles.

           Perseus dives after her.

           But drops the sack with Medusa's head.

           He looks back and forth.  Andromeda.  The sack.  Both
           shrinking into the dark.  

           He chooses the sack.  And dives.

           Above, the Leviathan shakes the winch like a rag doll. 
           Until it realizes it's lost the tiny morsel.  It spots
           Andromeda.  It swoops down after her.

           Andromeda, exhausted, cheeks puffed up with air, passes
           out.  Her eyes flutter and roll.  Her neck falls slack. 
           Tiny bubbles of air leak from her lips and nose. 

           The Leviathan swims up next to her.  It takes a close look,
           its eye as big as Andromeda's entire body.  It circles her. 
           It savors the anticipation.  No rush.

           Perseus chases the falling sack deeper and deeper.  His
           face, tense, straining to contain the urge to breathe.

           Below, the wreck of sunken whaler rests in the silt overgrown
           with corral.

           The sack falls into view.  The twine catches on a harpoon
           barb on the sunken whaler.  Perseus grabs the sack.  He has
           a quick idea- he takes the harpoon and kicks up.

           The Leviathan opens its cavernous jaws before Andromeda.

           Perseus "charges" his fist.  Lightning CRACKLES and boils
           the water around his hand.  He swims for Leviathan's tail.

           He grabs the thick hide.  And plunges the harpoon in...

           Just as the Leviathan inhales the unconscious Andromeda.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Perseus grabs the iron harpoon with his crackling fist.  

           Contact- an electric flash-point flares on the harpoon.  A
           convulsion shoots up the Leviathan's spine.

           Startled, it spits Andromeda out.

           Still jittering, it curls its tail to get a better look at
           the nuisance.  It looms mountainous over Perseus as it draws
           him close.  It locks its cold angry gaze on him.

           Perseus shuts his eyes.  He yanks out Medusa's head.

           The dead eyes ignite channels of boiling energy to the
           Leviathan's own eyes.

           The hair-snakes spring to life and strike Perseus's forearm. 
           Perseus grits his teeth and holds it steady.

           Churning, hellish gasses billow from the SCREAMING Leviathan. 
           The gases overtake everything in darkness.

           EXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - DAY

           The Onlookers gather with bated breath on the precipice.

           They all stare out over the sea.

           EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY

           The ocean roils and glows with a fiery light.  

           CHOOM.  A tower of energy explodes from the sea.  It
           punctures the storm clouds and strips them away from horizon
           to horizon.  Nothing but blue sky.

           The water stills.  The sea calms.  No sign of Perseus or
           Andromeda.  A painfully long silence.

           Suddenly, Perseus surfaces with Andromeda in his arms. 
           They both gasp and cough.  Andromeda makes eye contact.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                                (still catching breath)
                        Right...  Now I think I see it...

           Perseus laughs.

           EXT. CLIFFS OF JOPPA - DAY

           The Onlookers burst into applause and tears.
           EXT. SOLAR COLLECTOR - DAY

           Operators hurriedly spin the cranks.

           CLACK-CLACK-CLACK- The dish tilts to face the new sun.

           The glass basin flares with light.

           EXT. CITY WALLS - CONTINUOUS

           The light shoots thru channels and prisms in a growing web
           that finally connects with...

           EXT. SUN LENS TURRETS - CONTINUOUS

           One by one, the GUNNERS swing their massive lenses onto the
           battlefield and twist open the bronze apertures.

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

           The tide quickly turns as support fire rains on the battle. 
           Shafts of focused light rake the enemy ranks.  Siege towers
           ripple and burst into flames.

           Fighters like the Anubites quickly crumple and incinerate
           in the searing channels of heat.

           Even the hard-skinned Nephilim begin to blacken and smoke.

           Chaotic retreat spreads across the dwindling enemy ranks.

           Mongke and Tamburlane roar and lift their swords high. 
           Cheops smiles wide and joins them in the sentiment.

           EXT. BASILICA - DAY

           SUPERIMPOSE:  "The Next Day..."

           The Queen Andromeda stands in a dense crowd of CITIZENS on
           the steps.  Mongke and Tamburlane hold the crowd back.  

           Everyone.  Everyone talks to Andromeda at once and she
           listens.  As Cheops, at her side, furiously transcribes.

                                 ANDROMEDA
                        What?  No, there are plenty of funds
                        in the royal treasury.  You'll get
                        whatever-
                                (someone else)
                        No, miss, listen.  Miss, we'll take
                        care of you.  We won't abandon-
                                (to everyone)
                        Listen.  This is important.  We will
                        not rebuild this city!

           CONTINUED:

           Silence slowly spreads thru the crowd.  Andromeda looks
           over them.

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                        We won't rebuild this city.

           Scared faces suddenly look terrified.

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                        We're going to build a new city.

           Hope moves over the crowd.

                                 ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
                        A whole city.  For all of us.  And
                        we're going to do it together.  I
                        know you're tired and you're afraid
                        and you're worried we don't have
                        what it takes.  We do.  I promise
                        you, we do.  Because something
                        impossible happened on this ground. 
                        Man beat the Gods and all of you saw
                        it happen.  The Gods wanted me dead
                        and I stand before you in the flesh... 
                        We can do so much more than we
                        believe.  We're more important than
                        we know and it's nothing to fear. 
                        May the Gods strike me down if I'm
                        wrong!

           Dread silence.  Everyone waits for something bad to happen. 
           Nothing does.  Only wind.  Lonely hands CLAPPING break the
           silence.  Then another.  Then a flood of CHEERS.

           Cheops pokes his head up looks around.

                                 CHEOPS
                        Wasn't Perseus just here?

           Perseus watches unseen, hiding literally outside human
           perception- a smooth colourful figure in the choppy,
           monochromatic crowd.  (We saw Vidalia go "here" once...)

           He listens to the strangely echoing sounds of Andromeda's
           speech and the crowd's approval.  He smiles to himself-
           "They're going to be fine."  He turns and parts.

           He stops cold.  He sees ZEUS the Prime, God of Gods. 
           Luxuriant furs and armour.  He gleams and crackles like a
           storm.  Visible only to Perseus and vice versa.

                                 ZEUS
                        My son...

                                 PERSEUS
                        Father...

           CONTINUED:

                                 ZEUS
                        You have a wedding to attend.

                                 PERSEUS
                        I slew Leviathan.  That's the end of
                        it.  I'm not marrying Andromeda.

                                 ZEUS
                        You would condemn Man, your own
                        people, to this grueling War that's
                        already caused so much devastation?

                                 PERSEUS
                        I don't have a people.  My heart
                        belongs to Vidalia.  I won't live a
                        lie to pacify Mankind for you.  I
                        won't be a pawn of the Gods.

                                 ZEUS
                        Even the Gods are subject to the
                        tides of fate.

                                 PERSEUS
                        But maybe Man isn't.  Perhaps Man
                        has a power unmatched by the Gods. 
                        Free will.  What if it makes them
                        immune to fate?  Maybe Man makes his
                        own fate and the Gods simply can't
                        see into that future.  I've felt a
                        courage in my heart strong enough to
                        defy the Gods.  I know which half of
                        me it comes from.

           Perseus climbs on the back of his Pegasus.

                                 PERSEUS (CONT'D)
                        You say I was made for it, but who's
                        idea was I?  Who wanted the treaty? 
                        I think you want peace not because
                        you're scared for them.  I think
                        you're scared of them.  They don't
                        need me.

                                 ZEUS
                        And what will you do with yourself?

                                 PERSEUS
                        I'm going to find Vidalia.

                                 ZEUS
                        My son...  That's impossible.

                                 PERSEUS
                        You know what my problem is? 
                        "Impossible" just doesn't have the
                        teeth it did yesterday.

           Perseus smiles at his father.  He spurs the Pegasus and
           launches into the sky, soaring away.

                        Every Age has its heroes.  Heroes to
                        venerate.  Heroes to lionize.  Ours
                        bore a new hero.  Here was a hero to
                        become.  A hero to embody...

           EXT. JOPPA'S LOWER WHARF - DAY

           Reconstructed.  Idyllic cottages shine with fresh whitewash. 
           Bright flowers and greenery spill from open windows.  The
           sun sparkles on the piercing blue sea.

                        He lifted us from darkness to show
                        it could be done.  For his greatest
                        power was not among those bestowed
                        by the Gods, but a power that sleeps
                        within the hearts of us all...

           Young SPHINX CUBS play in the lovely cobbled street.  They
           toss a ball to each other.  One Cub misses the catch and
           scampers after the rolling ball.

           She slides into someone rounding the corner.  The Cub looks
           up, wide-eyed at-

           Queen Andromeda- matured, strong, regal but not lavish. 
           She smiles warmly at the Cub, hands her the errant ball,
           and scratches behind her ears.  The Cub squints and purrs.

           As the WHARF RESIDENTS notice Andromeda and her ATTENDANTS,
           they drop to one knee.  She motions for them to stand up.

           The Residents eagerly surround her and kiss her hand.  She
           gracefully indulges each in friendly conversation as she
           strolls thru the Wharf.

           EXT. TILE MOSAIC FLOOR - DAY

           From the prologue- the mosaic man with the spyglass, looking
           up at the stars.  A pattern of stars within that painted
           sky slowly glows brighter than the others.

                                 CHEOPS (V.O.)
                        Thus is the might of Perseus.  Thus
                        is the might of all Mankind.

           We push in on that glowing constellation- an outline
           clarifies around it- a Pegasus, wings unfurled, and its
           stalwart rider, Perseus.
