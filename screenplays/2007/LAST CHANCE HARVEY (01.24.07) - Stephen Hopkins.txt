                                      (1/24/07)

          Process
          311 Church St
          2nd fl
          NYC 10013
           Open on a sepia toned drawing of a battle hardened soldier 
           raising an American flag on a war torn hillock. The image is 
           printed on a ceramic plate.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Now this can be ordered in a 
                        variety of sizes, including a 20” 
                        oval serving platter. 
                             (beat)
                        So you’d have a complete set.

           Pull back to reveal HARVEY, mid-late 60’s, kneeling at the 
           feet of an elderly Hispanic woman. The woman sits motionless 
           in a large plastic covered armchair, staring at the plate. 
           Silence. 

           Harvey glances around the slightly dishevelled room. His eyes 
           land on a framed portrait of a young man in military dress 
           uniform. The photo sits proudly on a lace doily on a dresser 
           in the corner. Next to it, an open door leads to a small 
           kitchen. Inside, a young woman feeds a baby. Her eyes 
           momentarily lock onto Harvey’s. She stares at him. Unsettled, 
           Harvey looks away.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        How much?

           Harvey looks back at the old woman.

                                 HARVEY
                        For the set?

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Yes.

           Harvey glances down at his opened case, filled with an array 
           of similar samples. Beat. He looks up.

                                 HARVEY
                        It’s very expensive.
                             (beat)
                        Perhaps, you should just buy one 
                        for now and slowly collect.

           EXT. HOUSE / QUEENS - NEW YORK - DAY

           The front door closes, as Harvey, carrying his suitcase, 
           comes out of a small suburban house. As he makes his way down 
           some steps towards a slightly ‘beat-up’ car parked below, his 
           phone rings.  

                                 HARVEY
                        Marvin?
                                 MARVIN (O.S.)
                        How’d you do?

                                 HARVEY
                        Nothing doing. Not a great lead.

                                 MARVIN (O.S.)
                        What you mean ‘not a great lead’?! 
                        That’s the best fuckin’ lead i’ve 
                        had all day. And i gave it to you - 
                        you fuckin’ asshole! 
                             (beat)
                        The woman’s got three kids serving 
                        for Christ’s sake - two of them in 
                        Iraq. What more do you need?

           With the phone cradled in the crook of his neck, Harvey opens 
           the door to his car and gets in.

           INT. CAR - DAY

                                 HARVEY
                        I don’t know what to tell you - she 
                        wasn’t buying.
                             (beat)
                        She couldn’t afford it.

                                 MARVIN (O.S.)
                        Nobody can afford it Harvey - 
                        that’s the fuckin’ point. But we’re 
                        here to show people that they have 
                        to afford it - they have to find a 
                        fuckin’ way. It’s a matter of 
                        patriotism.

                                 HARVEY
                        I know how to sell Marvin.

                                 MARVIN (O.S.)
                        No Harvey, you fuckin’ don’t. You 
                        fuckin’ used to know how to sell - 
                        but you fuckin’ don’t anymore. 
                        You’re all washed up - you fuckin’ 
                        idiot! You fuckin’ useless bastard!

           Harvey looks at his watch, as the berating continues. He 
           seems unperturbed by the constant stream of abuse - as though 
           it were a daily occurrence.

                                 HARVEY
                        Marv, I gotta go. I gotta get to 
                        the airport. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        I got the show when i get back. 
                        I’ll make up the numbers then. You 
                        know I always do well there.

                                 MARVIN
                        You better fuckin do Harvey. I’m 
                        tellin you, I ain’t got room to 
                        keep carrying you. Fuckin off to 
                        London...

                                 HARVEY
                        I’m back Saturday night - the 
                        show’s Sunday. It’ll be Hot 
                        cakes...
                             (beat)
                        It always is.

                                 MARVIN
                        I’m getting sick of your promises 
                        Harvey. It’s your last fuckin 
                        chance. I got a smart team of young 
                        men and then i got you.

                                 HARVEY
                        Yeah Marv, but people don’t like to 
                        buy from children.

                                 MARVIN
                        Fuck you Harvey.
                             (beat)
                        Last chance.

           The line goes dead.  Harvey closes his phone and sighs. He 
           rubs his chest, then reaching into his jacket pocket, pulls 
           out a jar of pills. Popping open the lid - he pours a couple 
           into his hand and swallows them. He starts the engine.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                    LAST CHANCE HARVEY

           Sound of interior airborne plane. The seat-belt ‘ping’ 
           chimes. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PLANE - NIGHT

           Harvey, seated in a crowded economy cabin, looks down from 
           the now extinguished seat-belt light. He looks a little hot. 
           Reaching up to turn on the air, he knocks his tray - knocking 
           his drink into his lap.
                                 HARVEY
                        Fuck!

           An attractive middle-aged woman, seated next to him, looks 
           over.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                             (to a passing Stewardess)
                        Miss? I’m sorry. I’ve spilt my 
                        drink.

                                 STEWARDESS
                        I’ll get you some napkins.

                                 HARVEY
                             (to his neighbour)
                        Why’s it always me?

           The woman, perhaps wary of the length of the flight, smiles  
           noncommittally. The Stewardess returns.

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Shall i take that?

                                 HARVEY
                        Thanks... And could i get another?

                                 STEWARDESS
                        A whiskey, wasn’t it?

                                 HARVEY
                        Yes. ‘Jamesons’, no ice.

           The Stewardess heads off. Harvey mops himself up. He places  
           the small mass of wet towels on his tray and sighs. Glancing 
           out the window, he then turns to the woman.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        A holiday?

           The woman looks over.

                                 WOMAN
                        No. Business.

           Harvey nods.

                                 WOMAN (CONT'D)
                             (feeling obliged)
                        Yourself?

                                 HARVEY
                        My daughter’s getting married.
                                 WOMAN
                        Congratulations.

                                 HARVEY
                             (smiles)
                        Thank you.
                             (beat)
                        She’s marrying an American. But for 
                        some reason we’ve all got to go 
                        over to London. 
                             (smiling)
                        I told her we had a perfectly good 
                        wedding system here. 
                             (beat/expecting more of a 
                              response)
                        They both work there, you see.

           The woman smiles again, then looks up as the Stewardess 
           returns with Harvey’s drink.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Thank you.

           Harvey is about to continue speaking when the woman 
           interrupts.

                                 WOMAN
                        I’m really sorry but i have a 
                        meeting in the morning and i must 
                        try and get some sleep.

                                 HARVEY
                        No... Of course. I’m sorry.

                                 WOMAN
                        It’s just, i’ll be useless - unless 
                        i get some sleep.

                                 HARVEY
                        Sure.

           The woman covers herself in a blanket and turns out her 
           light, turning herself away from Harvey. 

           We hold on Harvey from a distance, spotlit in a sea of 
           darkness. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           Sound of a commercial London Radio Station. A ‘phone-in’ 
           competition takes place. A phone rings in the foreground.

                                                               FADE IN:
           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

           Open on a phone lying on a kitchen counter, next to a radio. 
           A hands reaches in and picks up the phone.

                                 KATE
                        Mum?

           KATE, mid 40’s, dressed in a green uniform, cradles the phone 
           in the crook of her neck, while she slides on her pump shoes.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        No, i haven’t left yet.

           INT. SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Kate’s mum, MAGGIE, a Brenda Blethyn type, stands peering out 
           of her back window.

                                 MAGGIE
                        He’s at it again.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

                                 KATE
                             (putting on her coat)
                        Who? At what?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 

                                 MAGGIE
                        The neighbour. Barbecuing or 
                        something.

           We see her POV of her neighbour busying himself in his back 
           garden. Smoke rises from a small garden shed.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I heard he’s from Poland.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

                                 KATE
                        So maybe Polish people like to 
                        barbecue a lot.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Kate, its 8 o’clock in the morning. 
                        Who barbecues at 8? 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

                                 KATE
                             (looking at her watch)
                        Mum, i’ve got to get going. I’ll be 
                        late. I’ll call you later. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Kate’s mum sighs and turns away from the window. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Of course. Don’t worry about me. 
                        I’ll be Ok. 
                             (beat)
                        Have you got that date thing 
                        tonight? 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

                                 KATE
                        I don’t know, maybe. Bye Mum.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 

                                 MAGGIE
                        ‘Time and tide’, Kate, as your 
                        father liked to say.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

                                 KATE
                        Was that from his terrace in the 
                        South of France?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Kate’s mum looks hurt.
           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

           Kate winces.

                                 KATE
                        I’m sorry. That was mean.
                             (beat)
                        Mum?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes?

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                             (takes a breath)
                        Look, I’ll call you later. I love 
                        you. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Fine.

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                        Bye.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

           Kate hangs up and sighs. Picking up her bag, she exits the 
           compact kitchen.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Kate’s mum, looking a little ‘put out’ puts down the phone. 
           She turns back to the window. POV: The Neighbour enters his  
           smoking shed and closes the door.

           EXT. HIGHT ST - DAY 

           A busy High St. Kate moves amongst the throng boarding a bus.

           INT. BUS - DAY 

           Close up on Kate’s face gently swaying. She stands reading a 
           paperback, oblivious to the crowded bus around her. 
           EXT. PADDINGTON STATION - DAY 

           Kate gets off the bus and heads into the station.

           INT. TRAIN - DAY 

           Kate sits reading on a speeding train.

           INT. HEATHROW AIRPORT / TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY 

           The Heathrow Express comes into the station. Kate disembarks.

           INT. TERMINAL 3 / BOOTH - DAY 

           Kate arrives at a booth. A sign reads: ‘Office of National 
           Statistics’. A West Indian woman, dressed in the same green 
           uniform, stands waiting. She holds a newspaper, folded open 
           at the crossword.

                                 KATE
                        Aggie.

                                 AGGIE
                        Morning darling.

           Kate goes behind the counter and turns on a light. As the 
           booth illuminates, Kate unlocks a door behind and goes in. 
           Without looking up from her crossword, Aggie follows. 

           INT. OFFICE OF NATIONAL STATISTICS / LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Kate places her bag in a locker and takes out a pair of 
           heels. Sitting down to put them on, Aggie enters.

                                 AGGIE
                        Four across. A filmy layer on the 
                        surface of a liquid? 

           Kate thinks for a beat.

                                 KATE
                        Scum.

           Aggie giggles to herself and writes it in. Kate stands just 
           as another co-worker hurries in.

                                 OONAGH
                        Sorry. Sorry. 
           She kisses Kate on the cheek and opens her locker. 

                                 OONAGH (CONT'D)
                        Thank God you’re my boss.

           Without looking up, Aggie ‘tuts’ and shakes her head. Oonagh 
           decides to ignore.

                                 OONAGH (CONT'D)
                        Are we still on for tonight? Matt’s 
                        definitely bringing Simon.

                                 KATE
                        No.

                                 OONAGH
                        Please.

                                 KATE
                        Only if you guys swear you won’t 
                        leave if it’s not going well.

                                 OONAGH
                        No way.

                                 KATE
                        Promise?

                                 OONAGH 
                        Promise.

                                 AGGIE
                        Seven down. Another word for 
                        ‘souvenir’?

           Kate thinks for a beat.

                                 KATE
                        Memento.

           Aggie laughs and scribbles it in. Oonagh rolls her eyes. 

                                 OONAGH
                        Aggie, why do you bother? You get 
                        Kate to give you all the answers.

           Aggie ‘tuts’ again and waves Oonagh away. Kate hands Oonagh a 
           clip-board and the two of them head out.
           INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - DAY 

           As luggage spews out, a dishevelled Harvey looks on. He sees 
           his case and awkwardly pulling it from the belt, heads off, 
           wheeling it behind him.

           INT. ARRIVALS HALL - DAY

           Kate, clip-board in hand, approaches an oncoming Harvey.

                                 KATE
                        Sir, if i could just bother you for 
                        one moment.

                                 HARVEY
                        I’m in kind of a hurry.

                                 KATE
                        It won’t take a second.

                                 HARVEY
                        I’m sorry.

           Harvey bustles past. Kate is momentarily stumped, before 
           turning to Oonagh and making a face. Kate returns her 
           attention to the sea of arrivals.

           EXT. TERMINAL 3 - DAY 

           A Taxi pulls away from the Terminal.

           INT. TAXI - DAY 

           Harvey sits in the back with his phone to his ear. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Hi pumpkin. It’s your Dad. I’ve 
                        made it one piece. I’m in a Taxi on 
                        my way to the Hotel. I guess i’ll 
                        see you all there. Can’t wait. Love 
                        you.

           Harvey hangs up. He dials another number.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Hi, it’s Harvey, Harvey Shine here. 
                        Just ringing to confirm my usual 
                        spot for the Armory show. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Perhaps Jim could give me a call 
                        back when he gets a chance. Thanks.

           Harvey hangs up and looks out the window. Cranes loom on the 
           horizon.

           EXT. HOTEL - DAY 

           The Taxi pulls into the forecourt of a slightly scruffy West 
           London Hotel. Harvey gets out and pays the driver.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 

           Harvey approaches the front desk.

                                 HARVEY
                        Hi. I’m with the wedding party. 
                        There should be a room for me. 
                        Harvey Shine.

           The Concierge taps into his computer.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Yes. I have a double room for you.

                                 HARVEY
                        Good. Has everyone else checked in?

                                 CONCIERGE
                        I’m not sure, sir. 

                                 HARVEY
                        My daughter. Susan Shine. Or maybe 
                        she’s already going by Wright. 
                        Susan Wright.

           The Concierge taps some more.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        No, sir. No one of that name.

                                 HARVEY
                        Do you have a Mrs Pearce?

           More tapping.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        No, sir. 

           The Concierge looks at Harvey. Beat. Harvey shrugs.
                                 HARVEY
                        I’ll go up.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY 

           Harvey enters the room. He places his case on the bed, takes 
           off his jacket and goes to the window. 

           A roller blind is pulled down. Harvey tugs on the cord, to no 
           avail at first. Then suddenly it whips up, causing Harvey to 
           duck backwards as the flailing cord almost takes his eye out. 

           Warily, Harvey steps forward and looks down at the busy 
           street below. He goes to open the window but it is stuck. He 
           tries again - but it won’t budge. 

           He looks around the room, then up at the now fully contracted 
           blind. Tentatively he reaches up and pulls the cord to lower 
           the blind a little. It slowly starts to unravel and 
           unravel...and unravel, until it hits the bottom of the window 
           sill with a gentle thud. Harvey stands in darkness. 

           He stares at the toggle, then suddenly reaches forward and 
           tugs it, leaping back, as again the blind flies up, snapping 
           to a stop at the top.

           To his relief, Harvey’s phone rings. He hurries over to the 
           bed to retrieve it.

                                 HARVEY
                        Hello?
                             (beat)
                        Pumpkin! Hi darling. Yes, I’m here. 
                        Where are you - where is everyone?
                             (listens/Harvey’s face 
                              drops a little)
                        Oh...I see. No, I didn’t realise. I 
                        thought the plan was for everyone 
                        to stay together.

           Noticeably dejected, Harvey sits down on the bed.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        No its...fine. I just wasn’t sure.
                             (beat)
                        So your mother has rented a house 
                        for you all.
                             (beat)
                        I see. No, no, don’t be silly. I’m 
                        a big boy. It’s fine. 

           Harvey looks around the bland room.
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Home from home. 
                             (beat)
                        Yes, I’ve got the address. So, I’ll 
                        see you there.
                             (beat)
                        I love you too, pumpkin. Bye.

           Harvey hangs up.

           EXT. STREET - EVENING

           Kate, dressed for the evening, hurries along a street. Her 
           phone rings.

                                 KATE
                        Mum?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Kate’s mum stands not far from her back window. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        What are you wearing?

           EXT. STREET - EVENING

                                 KATE
                        They’re completely in again, 
                        haven’t you heard?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

                                 MAGGIE
                             (lifting back the curtain)
                        Oh, you’re just being silly.
           POV: A now bare chested Neighbour at work in his garden. 
           Smoke rising from his shed.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Now don’t be nervous. Just be 
                        yourself.

           EXT. STREET - EVENING

                                 KATE
                             (smiling)
                        Ok, mum. Thanks for the advice. 
                        I’ll call you later, Ok?
                             (beat)
                        I love you too.

           Kate hangs up and crosses a busy road.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Kate’s mum continues to spy. POV: The Neighbour bends down 
           out of sight. On rising again, he sees Maggie at the window 
           and waves. Maggie flinches, before dropping the curtain. 

           INT. PUB - EVENING

           Kate comes through the door. Oonagh sits on her own at a 
           booth. Kate joins her. 

                                 KATE
                        Sorry i’m late. 

                                 OONAGH
                        Don’t tell me...

           Oonagh makes the gesture of a telephone.

                                 KATE 
                        She’s worrying about her new 
                        neighbour. Says he barbecues a lot.

                                 OONAGH
                        Very suspicious.

                                 KATE
                             (smiles)
                        I know.
                                 OONAGH 
                        I got you the same as me. 
                             (off Kate’s gaze)
                        They’re at the bar. He seems very 
                        nice.

           Just then two guys approach from the bar. 

                                 MATT
                        Hey Kate. 

                                 KATE
                        Hi Matt.

           Matt embraces Kate, then turns to his friend.

                                 MATT
                        Kate, this is Simon. 

                                 SIMON
                        Hi.

           Simon shakes Kate’s hand. Kate blushes ever so slightly.

                                 KATE
                        Hi.
                             (beat)
                        You work with Matt?

                                 SIMON
                        Yes. If you can call it work.

                                 KATE
                             (laughs a little too 
                              eagerly)
                        Right.

           Awkward pause.

                                 OONAGH
                        Come on, i’m feeling small down 
                        here. Sit!

           They all sit down.

           INT. SHOWER - DAY

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY 

           Harvey shaves.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY 

           Harvey puts on a cream linen jacket, that matches a pair of 
           slacks. He looks at himself in a full length mirror. He looks 
           good. There is a knock at the door. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Room service.

           Harvey opens the door.

                                 HARVEY
                        Just over by the bed.

           A young African man wheels in a trolley with a pot of tea and 
           some biscuits.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Thank you.

           Harvey tips the man and closes the door.

           He sits down on the bed and pours some tea. Just then his 
           phone rings again. He turns and reaches for it but knocks the 
           trolley and the tea onto himself.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Fuck!

           He grabs a tea towel and dabs his trousers.

           INT. PUB - NIGHT

           From a distance, across a crowded Friday night bar, we watch 
           our gang chat. It seems to be going well. Laughter hangs in 
           the air.

           INT. BEDROOM - EVENING 

           Harvey stands in front of a mirror. Dressed in the same cream 
           jacket - but now sporting a pair of dark trousers. He looks 
           like a bad lounge act.
           EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A cab pulls up in front of a posh looking restaurant. Harvey 
           gets out and pays the driver. The cab pulls away and Harvey 
           turns towards the restaurant. 

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Harvey enters. Three young men stand to one side, chatting 
           animatedly. On seeing Harvey, one of them looks up.

                                 SCOTT
                        Harvey.

                                 HARVEY
                        Scott.

                                 SCOTT
                        You made it.

                                 HARVEY
                        Yes.

           Scott turns to his friends.

                                 SCOTT
                        This is Susan’s father, Harvey. 
                        Harvey Shine.

                        Harvey, this is my best man, Josh 
                        Hillman and Pete Turner.

                                 HARVEY
                        Hi.

                                 FRIENDS
                        Hi.

                                 SCOTT
                        How are you Harvey? 
                             (glancing at Harvey’s 
                              attire)
                        Its great to see you.

                                 HARVEY
                        Good thanks. Great.
                             (sensing his gaze)
                        How are you holding up?
                                 SCOTT
                        Great.
                             (turning to his friends)
                        Can’t wait to marry your daughter, 
                        really.

           Laughter.

                                 HARVEY
                        No... 
                             (beat)
                        Is she..?

                                 SCOTT
                        She’s through there. She’ll be 
                        thrilled you’re here. I’ll go and 
                        find her.

           Just then Harvey’s phone rings.

                                 HARVEY
                        Sorry. 

           Harvey turns away and answers. 

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Hello. Yes...
                             (beat)
                        No, no that’s not right. Jim knows 
                        the stall I get. Just get him to 
                        call me.
                             (getting flustered)
                        Have you told him its Harvey. 
                             (beat)
                        I don’t give a damn. Do you know 
                        how long i’ve been coming to this 
                        show? Just...
                             (suddenly conscious of 
                              Scott’s friends standing 
                              nearby)
                        Just get him to call me, Ok?

           Harvey hangs up. And putting on his ‘positive’ face turns 
           back to Scott’s friends.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Sorry.

                                 PETE 
                        Sounds profitable.

                                 HARVEY
                        It can be.

                        Yes.

                                 HARVEY
                        Oil futures, right?

           They nod.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Well, I’m sure that’s pretty 
                        profitable too.

           The guys smile a little too readily.

                                 JOSH
                        It can be.

           Harvey tries to smile back.

                                 HARVEY
                        Well, i’d better find my daughter.

                                 PETE
                        Absolutely. Good to meet you, 
                        Harvey. See you in there.
           As Harvey moves off into the adjacent room, the guys watch 
           him go.

           INT. PUB / HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Kate and Oonagh wait in line for the bathroom.

                                 OONAGH
                        So?

                                 KATE
                        He seems nice.

                                 OONAGH
                        Nice? Nice like good. Or nice like 
                        dull.

                                 KATE
                        Nice like how old is he?

           Oonagh smiles.

                                 OONAGH
                        Old enough. Your age...ish.

                                 KATE
                        He can’t be, he’s looks like a 
                        baby.

                                 OONAGH
                        Alright, my age. But Matt says he’s 
                        very mature.

                                 KATE
                        Oh right. Did Matt offer that up -
                        or was that in response to you two 
                        discussing my rapidly approaching 
                        barrenness.

                                 OONAGH
                        Kate?

           Just then Kate’s phone rings.

                        Don’t answer it.

                                 KATE
                        I have to. She’s on her own.
                             (beat)
                        She gets lonely.

                        Just tell her you’re busy. 

           Kate nods and indicates that the loo is free. Oonagh goes in, 
           as Kate answers her phone.

                                 KATE
                        Mum?

           INT. DINING ROOM / RESTAURANT - DAY 

           Harvey enters the room. He sees his daughter, standing off to 
           one side, with Scott, talking to some friends. She looks 
           beautiful. He takes a moment to just watch her. As she turns 
           in slight slow motion, she smiles on seeing her father and 
           joins him.

                                 SUSAN
                        Hi Dad.

                        Thank you. 

           Slightly awkward pause.

                                 HARVEY
                        Give us a hug then.

           They embrace. Beat. Off Susan’s look...

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        I know, I look ridiculous.

                                 SUSAN
                        No. You look...

                                 HARVEY
                        Like a bad lounge act.

           Susan smiles at her Father. Beat.

                        I spilt something on my trousers.

                        I’ve been doing that a lot 
                        recently.
           Harvey looks over at Scott in the distance, sharing a laugh 
           with his buddies. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Dad?

                                 HARVEY
                        Long way to come to see two 
                        American kids get married.

           Susan looks at her father, a little irked.

                                 SUSAN
                        Sorry for the inconvenience, Dad.

           Harvey looks at his daughter.

                                 HARVEY
                        Sorry Pumpkin.

           Beat.

                        Have you seen mum yet?

                                 HARVEY
                        No. They’re here?

                        Yes. They’re over by our table.

           Harvey looks over.

                        I’ll be good.

           Just then, they are approached by Scott guiding some friends 
           over to say hello. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Look who i’ve got!

           Susan’s girlfriends shriek with delight as they approach. 
           Susan turns to greet them.

                                 HARVEY 
                        I’ll speak to you later pumpkin. 
                        You enjoy your friends.
           As Susan greets her friends, Harvey retreats. 

           INT. PUB - NIGHT

           Kate rejoins the others. Oonagh and Matt are standing. Matt 
           has his jacket on.

                                 OONAGH
                             (to Kate)
                        We’ve gotta go. Problem at home. 
                        Baby-sitter just rang. Nothing 
                        serious.
                             (beat)
                        But you guys stay.

           Kate makes eyes at Oonagh, who shrugs innocently. Oonagh goes 
           to kiss Kate, while Matt says goodbye to Simon.

                                 OONAGH (CONT'D)
                             (under breath)
                        Enjoy yourself - you miserable cow. 
                        And turn off that phone.
                             (beat)
                        Are you working tomorrow?

                                 KATE
                        Yes.

                                 OONAGH
                        I don’t know why you always give 
                        yourself Saturdays? 
                             (beat)
                        I’ll see you Monday.

           Oonagh kisses Kate and heads off with Matt, leaving Kate 
           standing slightly awkwardly next to a seated Simon.

                                 SIMON
                        Looks like we’ve been set up.

                                 KATE
                        Yes.
                             (beat)
                        Sorry.

                                 SIMON
                        No. It’s not your fault. I mean i’m 
                        fine with it. I mean, I’m happy to 
                        meet new people.

                                 KATE
                        Yes, me too.
                                 SIMON
                        Why don’t you sit down?

                                 KATE
                        Yes.

           Kate sits down.

                                 SIMON
                        So you work with Oonagh?

                                 KATE
                        Yes.
                             (beat)
                        Sorry, I’m saying ‘yes’ a lot.

                                 SIMON
                        Yes. 
                             (smiles)
                        You are.

           They share a smile. 

                                 SIMON (CONT'D)
                        Do you want another drink?

                                 KATE
                        Sure. I can get them.

                                 SIMON
                        No, it’s fine. What do you fancy?

                                 KATE
                        I’ll have another white wine. 
                        Anything dry.

           Simon heads off to the bar. Kate watches him go. She allows 
           herself a smile.

           INT. RESTAURANT/BAR AREA - NIGHT

           Harvey stands at the bar and downs a whiskey. Picking up 
           another glass, he turns away, and with drink in hand, 
           approaches a group of people standing around a table. As he 
           nears, a distinguished older man with a healthy main of white 
           hair sees him and momentarily touches the arm of the woman 
           standing next to him. She turns around to see Harvey 
           approaching.

                                 JEAN
                        Harvey. 
                                 HARVEY
                        Jean.

           Harvey turns his gaze to the white haired man and nods.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Brian. 

                                 BRIAN
                        Harvey. Good to see you.

           There is a palpable sense of tension in the air.

                                 HARVEY
                             (deliberately only 
                              directed to Jean)
                        So our baby girl is really getting 
                        married. Who would’ve thought?

                                 JEAN
                        Yes.

                                 BRIAN
                        Harvey you remember the Watsons. 
                        Barry and Jill. 

           Harvey turns to a couple, standing nearby.

                                 HARVEY
                             (slight sarcastic tone)
                        Of course I do. Hell, its been a 
                        while. I guess, not since Jean and 
                        I split up. 

                                 JILL
                        Hi Harvey. You look well. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Thank you, Jill. You’re looking 
                        well too. Both of you. I guess you 
                        guys stayed in touch with Jean.

                                 BRIAN
                        Barry and I work together now.

                                 HARVEY
                        No kidding? Insurance?

                                 BARRY
                        No, got out of that game.

                        Real Estate. That’s great.
                             (beat)
                        That’s really great. 

           Awkward silence.

                                 BRIAN
                        Well i think we should sit. I know 
                        Susan wanted us all seated before 
                        they joined us.

                                 HARVEY
                        Sure. Good idea.

           Everyone begins to takes their assigned seats. Harvey is on 
           the inside close to the middle. It’s a bit tight and involves 
           people getting up to make way. Harvey gets to his seat and is 
           just about to sit when his phone rings. Brian and Jean share 
           a look. Taking it out of his pocket Harvey looks at the 
           incoming number.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Sorry, I have to take this.
                             (picks up)
                        Can you hold a minute?

           Harvey makes his way back along the table, causing people to 
           stand again.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. Sorry.

           Harvey walks away from the table.

           INT. PUB - NIGHT

           Kate sits waiting. Simon has finally been served and turns 
           from the bar with drinks in hand. As he does a young woman, 
           standing with a small party of two other girls and a guy, 
           greets him. Kate looks on. It’s obvious from Simon’s reaction 
           that they know each other well. Just then Kate’s phone rings 
           again. She looks at the number and thinks about ignoring it, 
           but in the end, reluctantly picks up.

                                 KATE
                        Mum. You’ve got to stop calling. 
                             (beat)
                        What? I can’t hear. Hold on.

           Kate gets up and moves towards the back-room.
           INT. RESTAURANT FOYER - NIGHT

           Harvey stands on the phone.

                                 HARVEY
                        I’m not interested in the third 
                        aisle on the left. I told you, get 
                        me Jim and he’ll tell you.
                             (beat)
                        You’ve spoken to him? And he said?
                             (beat)
                        Just get him to call me, Ok.

           Harvey hangs up. His phone immediately rings again.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        I know what you’re gonna say 
                        Marvin. Trust me i’m working on it. 
                        Ok. Yes. I will.

           Harvey hangs up again. 

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Harvey returns to the table. Everyone is seated. He notices 
           his name place has been moved to the end. 

                                 HARVEY 
                             (smiling/to Jean)
                        Did you move me darling?

                                 JEAN
                        No, Harvey. I didn’t touch it.

                                 SUSAN
                        Dad. I moved you. I thought it 
                        might be easier in case you needed 
                        to get out.

                                 HARVEY
                        Ok, sweetheart.

           Harvey takes the last remaining seat. Brian stands.

                                 BRIAN
                        Shall we have a quick toast to get 
                        things going?

                                 HARVEY
                        Brian, if you don’t mind. I’d like 
                        to do that.
           Silence. 

                                 BRIAN
                        Sure.
                             (beat)
                        Absolutely.

           Harvey stands. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Um...Susan, Scott...

           Just then Harvey’s phone rings.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Sorry.

           Harvey scrambles to turn it off.

                                 JEAN
                        Oh, for Christ’s sake.

                                 HARVEY 
                        It’s off. It’s off now. Sorry.
                             (flustered)
                        Um, where was I? To Susan and 
                        Scott... A great couple. 
                             (beat)
                        Cheers.

           Momentary silence.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Cheers.

           Harvey sits.

                                 SUSAN
                        Let’s eat.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Yes...

           Everyone tucks in. Harvey sits slightly blushing at the end 
           of the table, knowing he’s blown it.

           INT. PUB - NIGHT

           Kate hangs up and returns to the main room, to find that 
           Simon has been joined at their table by the young group. Kate 
           bolsters herself before returning to the table. 
                                 KATE
                        Hi.

                                 SIMON
                        Hey. Kate.
                             (beat)
                        Sorry, i bumped into these guys and 
                        couldn’t shake them. 
                             (turning to his friends)
                        Everyone this is Kate.

           Kate holds up her hand, before blushing a little.

                                 KATE
                        Hi.

                        Hi.

           Kate sits down. 

                                 MELISSA
                        Sorry, I hope we’re not barging in 
                        on your evening. 

           Kate shakes her head.

                                 MELISSA (CONT'D)
                        Simon was quite insistent. How do 
                        you guys know each other, anyway?

           Kate glances at Simon.

                                 KATE
                        We don’t really. We just met.

           Melissa looks at Simon and grins.

                                 MELISSA
                        A blind date?

                                 SIMON
                        No.
                             (beat)
                        We met through friends.

                                 MELISSA
                        I see. I think we should leave you 
                        guys alone.
                                 KATE
                             (a little too abruptly)
                        No. 
                             (beat)
                        Don’t. Stay. It’s fine. 

           Slightly awkward pause, broken by Andrew.

                                 ANDREW
                        Hey does anyone know the cricket 
                        score?

                                 SIMON
                        England were all out by tea, when i 
                        last checked.

                                 ANDREW
                        Bloody hell. 

                                 GWEN
                        Cricket. Don’t get it.

                                 MELISSA
                        What? Men in white. Oh, I do.

           Kate looks on as the girls laugh.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Harvey sits at the end of the table, looking on, as everyone 
           talks animatedly around him. He eats his food and drinks 
           plenty of wine. Up near the middle Scott shares a joke with 
           Brian. Just then Susan, who has been talking to the best man, 
           turns and catches Harvey’s eye. He smiles at her and raises a 
           glass. Susan smiles back before returning her attention back 
           to her neighbour. 

           INT. PUB BOOTH - NIGHT

           Kate sits among the group. She too seems to be detached from 
           the proceedings. 

                                 GWEN
                        I heard that they did it in her 
                        bedroom, while she was away. 

                                 SIMON
                        It was her flat?
                                 GWEN
                        Yep. He has his own, but was 
                        basically living at hers.

                                 ANDREW
                        Ouch.

                                 MELISSA
                        That is evil.

           As the conversation continues in this vein, Kate glances at 
           Simon. He seems more at ease in this company.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The meal is drawing to a close. People have gotten up and are 
           circulating around the table and nearby. 

           INT. BAR AREA - NIGHT

           Harvey stands at the bar. He downs another drink. Jean 
           approaches.

                                 JEAN
                        Go easy Harvey.

           Beat. 

                                 HARVEY
                             (getting quite loaded)
                        Why, Jean? Are you worried i’m 
                        going to embarrass you again?

                                 JEAN
                        No Harvey, I’m worried you’re going 
                        to embarrass yourself. And more 
                        importantly Susan. This weekend’s 
                        just about her and Scott. Nothing 
                        else.

                                 HARVEY
                        Oh, you’re good Jean. You’re really 
                        good. You’ve always known how to 
                        make me feel shit, haven’t you?
                             (beat)
                        You’ve always been so good at that.

                                 JEAN
                        Go home Harvey. Go to bed and see 
                        your daughter get married tomorrow.
           Jean walks away. Harvey stands at the bar. Susan comes into 
           the room. She approaches.

                                 SUSAN
                        Hi Dad.

                                 HARVEY
                        Hey Pumpkin.

                                 SUSAN
                        Are you alright?

                                 HARVEY
                             (upbeat)
                        Yeah. I’m great. How are you doing? 
                        Enjoying yourself?

                                 SUSAN
                        Yeah. 

           Beat. 

                                 HARVEY
                        He seems a good guy, Scott. You’ll 
                        be alright.

                                 SUSAN
                        Yeah, he is.
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry, I haven’t had much time 
                        to talk to you.

                                 HARVEY 
                        No Sweetheart, it’s your weekend. 
                        It’s no problem. You just enjoy 
                        yourself.

           Beat.

                                 SUSAN
                        How’s work going?

                                 HARVEY
                        Great.
                             (beat)
                        Well, not great, but not terrible.
                             (beat)
                        I’m really sorry about having to 
                        leave early. It’s just one of those 
                        stupid things - bad timing. I just 
                        can’t get out of it, right now. But 
                        I’ll be there at the ceremony, at 
                        the really important bit. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        I’ll be there to give you away. 
                             (beat)
                        And then I’m sure Brian or your 
                        mother will talk at the reception. 
                        You know me, I’ve never been very 
                        good at speech...

                                 SUSAN
                             (interrupting)
                        Dad.
                             (beat)
                        Listen, i’ve been thinking. 
                             (beat)
                        Brian has been a really big part of 
                        my life now for some time. And...
                             (beat)
                        And i’m going to ask him to give me 
                        away tomorrow. 

           Silence.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry...

           The colour drains from Harvey’s ruddy face.

                                 HARVEY
                        But P-Pumpkin...

                                 SUSAN
                        Dad, i haven’t seen you in, what 
                        five years.

                                 HARVEY
                        That’s not true.

                                 SUSAN
                        Dad, it is. Maybe a quick coffee 
                        here, or a telephone call there but 
                        no, you haven’t been part of my 
                        life. And Brian has.

           Beat.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        You having to leave early this 
                        weekend. I don’t know, it just 
                        seems typical.
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry Dad, but it’s what i’ve 
                        decided.

           Harvey momentarily turns away from his daughter, to compose 
           himself, before turning back.
                                 HARVEY
                        Ok. Sure.
                             (beat)
                        I understand, Pumpkin.

           Harvey leans in and kisses his daughter on the forehead.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        You go and be with your friends. Go 
                        and enjoy yourself.
                             (pulls out his phone)
                        I gotta make some stupid calls. You 
                        know. Go and enjoy yourself, 
                        Sweetheart. I’ll see you tomorrow.

           Susan reluctantly walks away as Harvey lifts the phone to his 
           ear. We hold on his face. With Susan gone he lowers the 
           phone. He looks frightened. 

           INT. MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Harvey enters the rest-room and heads to a bank of basins. He 
           turns on a tap and bends down - drinking profusely. He 
           splashes his face then rises and begins to dry it with some 
           paper towels. 

                                 HARVEY
                        You fuckin’ asshole!

           Harvey suddenly bends over as though he’d been punched hard 
           in the stomach. He rises, red in the face, holding his nose, 
           desperately trying to hold it in. But he can’t - Harvey sobs 
           huge heaving muffled cries... 

           Just then, someone enters. Head down, Harvey lunges for the 
           door and exits.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Harvey stumbles out of the restaurant and into a waiting cab. 
           The cab pulls away.

           INT. PUB - NIGHT

           Kate sits surrounded by laughter. Simon’s attention is firmly 
           fixed on his friends. Kate’s humiliation is magnified as we 
           slowly move into her face. 

                                 KATE
                        Sorry.
           Kate gets up and walks away. Everyone momentarily stops 
           chatting and looks to Simon, who shrugs.

           INT. LADIES - NIGHT

           Kate enters a cubicle. She sits down to have a pee. We hold 
           on her sad face. She suddenly grimaces, before holding firm. 
           But not before a tear has been expelled and rolls down her 
           cheek. She swats it away.

           INT. TAXI - NIGHT

           We hold on Harvey’s sad face as it gently bobs in the back of 
           a moving cab.

           EXT. PUB - NIGHT

           Kate exits the pub, just as a cab pulls up. As Harvey exits 
           one side, Kate gets into the other, as the cab pulls away 
           again.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                                               FADE IN:

           INT. REGISTRY OFFICE - DAY

           Bride and Groom stand at the head of the room, saying their 
           vows. Harvey stands near the back, looking on. As the 
           ceremony is concluded the audience spontaneously burst into 
           applause. Harvey looks around the room, then back at his 
           daughter, as she smiles giddily at her husband. Harvey slips 
           out the door.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Carrying his case, Harvey hails a Taxi and gets in.

           INT. TERMINAL 3 - DAY

           Kate, back in green, stands next to an elderly couple asking 
           them questions about their travel arrangements.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The Taxi comes a stop in ‘classic’ mid-day London traffic.
           INT. TAXI - DAY

           Harvey glances at his watch, then out at the mass of cars in 
           front of them. His phone rings. He picks up.

                                 HARVEY
                        Marvin?
                             (beat)
                        I’m on my way now. No, I never 
                        heard back. 
                             (beat)
                        Don’t worry, I get in around six, 
                        so i’ll go straight there and sort 
                        it out.
                             (beat)
                        Marvin, i could do this show with a 
                        stall in the Men’s room. What? 
                        Marvin i’m losing you...

           The line goes dead. Harvey puts his phone away. He glances 
           out the window again as the Taxi crawls forward, before again 
           coming to a stop. Harvey leans forward.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Is there another way we could try?

           The driver, looking a little irked, glances at Harvey in his 
           mirror.

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                        It’s going to be bad everywhere. 
                        Your president’s in town. It’s 
                        causing chaos.

           Harvey rubs his neck and glances again at his watch. 

           INT. CANTEEN - DAY

           Kate eats her lunch, while reading a book. Her phone suddenly 
           rings. She sighs quietly before slowly picking it up.

                                 KATE
                        Mum?

           EXT. HEATHROW / TERMINAL 3 - DAY

           A Taxi pulls up. Harvey gets out, pays the driver and hurries 
           into the Terminal. 
           INT. TERMINAL 3 - DAY

           Harvey enters into the usual mayhem. He makes his way over to 
           the ‘Departure Board’ and scans it for his flight. He runs to 
           the American Airlines counter. A long queue snakes away from 
           it. He hurries to the front, where a Steward is attending to 
           another passenger.

                                 HARVEY
                        I’m sorry but, I’m on the 4.30 to 
                        JFK. 

                                 WAITING PASSENGER
                        Hey pal, we’re all in hurry.

                                 HARVEY
                        Just hand luggage, can i go 
                        straight to the gate?

                                 STEWARD
                        Sir, I’m dealing with a passenger, 
                        you’ll have to wait.

                                 HARVEY
                        Please. I’ve gotta make that 
                        flight.

                                 STEWARD
                        Sir, everyone has to check in here. 
                        You’ll have to wait.

           Harvey stands by anxiously. He sees another Steward 
           momentarily free, and hurries to her. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Miss, i’m on the 4.30 to JFK. Can 
                        you check me in? 

                                 STEWARD
                        I’m afraid that flight’s now 
                        closed. 

                                 HARVEY
                        But it’s not yet 4! I just have 
                        hand luggage. It doesn’t take off 
                        for another 40 minutes. 

                                 STEWARD 
                        I’m sorry sir, but regulations say 
                        we have to close the gate 45 
                        minutes prior to departure.
                                 HARVEY
                        But i just have hand luggage. 
                        Please. I’ve got to get on that 
                        flight.

                                 STEWARD
                        I’m sorry sir, there’s nothing i 
                        can do.

           Harvey looks around.

                                 HARVEY
                        When’s the next flight?

                                 STEWARD
                        There’s one at 8.30. But i’m pretty 
                        sure that’s full. I can put you on 
                        stand-by, but i doubt you’ll get 
                        on.
                             (beat)
                        The earliest i can get you on for 
                        sure, is tomorrow morning, 10.30.

                                 HARVEY
                             (shouts)
                        Jesus!

           People look over.

                                 STEWARD
                        Sir, i’m sorry, but you have to 
                        stay calm.

                                 HARVEY
                        Stay calm?

                                 STEWARD
                        Yes, sir.

           Harvey looks about him.

           INT. TERMINAL - DAY 

           Close up on Harvey’s face as he holds his phone to his ear.

                                 HARVEY
                        Marvin, it’s Harvey. 
                             (beat)
                        Listen, there’s been a mess up - 
                        I’m not going to get back in time. 
                        I need Frank to set up for me. He 
                        knows where everything is. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        I’ll be back around lunchtime and i 
                        can take over.
                             (beat)
                        I’ll - I’ll call again later.

           Harvey hangs up. Long beat. Suddenly his phone rings.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Marvin?

           Silence.

                                 MARVIN
                        Don’t bother coming back, Harvey.

                                 HARVEY
                        Marvin. It’s out of my hands. The 
                        traffic in London is cra...

                                 MARVIN
                        The fuckin’ traffic. Harvey, it’s 
                        over. You’re washed up. I’m sorry, 
                        but i don’t need you anymore.

                                 HARVEY
                        Don’t do this Marvin.

                                 MARVIN
                        Fuck you, Harvey.

           The line goes dead. We hold on Harvey’s face.

           INT. BOOTH - EARLY EVENING

           Kate turns off the lights and closes up the booth.

           INT. TERMINAL 3 / BAR - EARLY EVENING

           Kate sits at the bar, drinking a glass of wine and reading 
           her book. She glances up as a man enters. Harvey takes a seat 
           at the bar.

                                 HARVEY
                        Jamesons, no ice.

           The Barman serves Harvey. Harvey immediately downs it.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Another. 
                             (beat)
                        Please. 
           The Barman refills his glass. Again Harvey knocks it back. 
           Kate glances up from her book. 

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Another, please.

           The Barman glances at Harvey.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        What? 

                                 BAR MAN
                        Sorry.

           Harvey reaches for the now full glass. But knocks it, 
           spilling it into his lap.

                                 HARVEY
                        Fuck!

           Kate looks up again, along with the few other patrons in the 
           bar. Harvey registers their gaze.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. Vulgar American alert.

           Kate smiles, before returning to her book. Harvey dabs his 
           trousers with some napkins.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                             (to himself)
                        I know, we don’t raise our voices 
                        in this country. It’s not done.

           Harvey puts the sodden napkins down onto the bar. He looks at 
           himself in the mirror behind the bar and rubs his chest. He 
           sighs and glances around the room. He sees Kate and 
           recognizes her. 

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                             (to Kate)
                        I’m sorry.

           Kate looks up. Beat.

                                 KATE
                        For what?

                                 HARVEY
                        For yesterday. I was rude. You 
                        tried to ask me some questions. 

           Kate nods.
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        You were just trying to do your job 
                        and I was rude.

                                 KATE
                        I don’t really remember, but i’m 
                        sure you were. Most people are.

           Kate returns to her book. Beat.

                                 HARVEY
                        Good book?

           Kate looks up.

                                 KATE
                        It probably would be, if i could 
                        finish it.

                                 HARVEY
                             (holds up his hands)
                        I’m sorry. I get it.

           Beat. Harvey downs another shot. Kate looks up again.

                                 KATE
                        That’ll help.

                                 HARVEY
                             (looks over)
                        Sorry?

                                 KATE
                        I said, that’ll help.

           Beat. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Believe me, it will.

                                 KATE
                        Right.

           Beat.

                                 HARVEY
                        I reckon it’ll help as much as 
                        trashy novel and a glass of 
                        chardonnay.

           Beat.
                                 KATE
                        O-kay.

           Kate gets up and leaves. Harvey winces. He throws some money 
           onto the bar and hurries after her.

           INT. TERMINAL - EARLY EVENING

           Harvey catches up with Kate, who walks along briskly. 

                                 HARVEY
                             (walking & talking)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 KATE
                             (walking & talking)
                        What? Go away and stop apologizing.

                                 HARVEY
                             (walking & talking)
                        It’s just that i’ve had a really 
                        shitty day.

                                 KATE
                             (walking & talking)
                        Join the club.

                                 HARVEY
                             (walking & talking)
                        No. I mean really shitty.

           Kate finally comes to a stop and looks at this funny short 
           man.

                                 KATE
                        How shitty?

           Beat. Harvey catches his breath.

                                 HARVEY
                             (comes out in a torrent)
                        I missed my flight. I lost my job. 
                        And my daughter who got married in 
                        London today asked her step father 
                        rather than me to give her away.

           Kate looks at Harvey sympathetically for a moment.

                                 KATE
                        Not bad.
                             (beat)
                        But what can I do for you?
           Harvey looks away then back.

                                 HARVEY
                        Let me make it up to you. 
                             (beat)
                        Let me buy you dinner.

           Kate momentarily taken aback, blushes.

                                 KATE
                        That’s very sweet of you, but... I 
                        don’t know you. And... you don’t 
                        know me.

                                 HARVEY
                        Exactly. That’s why we should have 
                        dinner.

           Beat. Kate looks at this short man.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                             (pointing behind him)
                        There’s a little place, I know, 
                        over there.

           Kate looks over.

                                 KATE
                        Chez Gerard?

                                 HARVEY
                        I hear its not bad, as long as you 
                        avoid the fish.

           Kate can’t help but smile. Just then, her phone rings. 

                                 KATE
                        Sorry.

           She takes her phone out and looks at the incoming number. She 
           is about to answer, when she stops herself. She thinks for a 
           moment, before putting the phone back.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Ok.
                             (beat)
                        Why not?

           Harvey smiles. We watch from a distance as they head towards 
           Chez Gerard.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Kate’s mum pulls the phone away from her ear, perplexed by 
           the lack of response. Her eyes wander to the window. Drawing 
           back the curtain, she looks out. POV: The Neighbour, now 
           sporting a white apron, busies himself as usual. He suddenly 
           bends down and heaves what would best be described as a body 
           bag onto his shoulder. As he stumbles under the weight, he 
           carries it into the shed. Kate’s mum turns away ashen.

           INT. CHEZ GERARD / BOOTH - EVENING

           Harvey and Kate sit opposite each other in a booth. Muzak 
           plays in the background. They are the sole patrons of Chez 
           Gerard. The sudden realization that they don’t actually know 
           each other seems to have dawned on the proceedings. Harvey 
           suddenly holds out his hand.

                                 HARVEY
                        I’m Harvey, by the way.

                                 KATE
                             (takes it)
                        Kate.

           Awkward pause, broken by the arrival of the waiter with some 
           menus. 

                                 WAITER
                        Can I get you guys something to 
                        drink?

                                 KATE
                        I’ll have a glass of wine. White.
                             (looks pointedly at 
                              Harvey)
                        A Chardonnay, if you have?

                                 WAITER
                        Sure.

           The waiter turns to Harvey.

                                 HARVEY
                             (glances at Kate and 
                              smiles)
                        I’ll have the same.

                                 WAITER
                        I’ll get those and then be right 
                        back to take your order.
           The waiter heads off. Another slightly awkward pause. Kate 
           picks up a menu.

                                 KATE 
                        So why aren’t you at the wedding?

           Harvey, momentarily taken aback by the directness of Kate’s 
           question, is about to answer, when the sound of a vacuum 
           cleaner erupts. Harvey and Kate look over to see a cleaner 
           vacuuming the floor nearby.

                                 HARVEY
                        I knew something was missing. 
                        That’s better. 

           Kate smiles.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                             (almost shouting over the 
                              din)
                        Long story, but i had to get back 
                        for a work thing. 

                                 KATE
                             (over the din)
                        A work thing. For the job you just 
                        lost?

           Beat.

                                 HARVEY
                             (over din)
                        Yes.

                                 KATE 
                             (over din)
                        I see.
                             (beat)
                        So, this job you lost. You liked 
                        it?

                                 HARVEY
                             (over din)
                        Yes.
                             (beat)
                        No. But its what i do - did.

                                 KATE
                             (over din)
                        Which is - was?
                                 HARVEY
                             (shouts)
                        Commemorative paraphernalia.

           The vacuuming stops. They both look over, then back. Kate 
           looks at Harvey quizzically.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        I basically sell plates. 
                        Commemorating things - sporting 
                        triumphs, weddings...wars, you name 
                        it.

                                 KATE
                        Wars?

                                 HARVEY
                        They’re our biggest seller.

                                 KATE
                        Right. So business is good right 
                        now?

                                 HARVEY
                        Well, no. People like to buy plates 
                        commemorating successful wars. Wars 
                        that are won. The 1st Gulf War was 
                        a bonanza for us. But right now, 
                        nobody wants a mistake on their 
                        wall.

                                 KATE
                        I see.
                             (beat)
                        Sequels - never as profitable as 
                        the first.

                                 HARVEY
                             (smiles)
                        No.
                             (beat)
                        Do you enjoy what you do?

                                 KATE
                        Taking surveys?
                             (beat)
                        I ask people questions, so some guy 
                        in Twickenham can work out what 
                        we’re all most likely to buy each 
                        other come Christmas.
                             (beat)
                        No. But as you said its what i do.
           Harvey smiles at Kate. 

                                 HARVEY
                        You don’t mince your words, do you?

           The vacuuming starts up again.

                                 KATE
                             (over din)
                        Should I?

                                 HARVEY
                             (over din)
                        No. It’s good. You’re very direct.

           Kate smiles.

                                 KATE
                        You think i’m uptight.

                                 HARVEY
                        Did i say that?

                                 KATE
                        No. But it’s what you think.

                                 HARVEY
                        How do you know what i’m thinking.

                                 KATE
                        It’s obvious.

           Beat.

                                 HARVEY
                        Well...Ok, maybe i think you could 
                        relax a little.

                                 KATE
                        See.

                                 HARVEY
                        No, no. But I like it. 
                             (vacuuming stops)
                        A lot.

           Kate looks away.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        It’s a relief to find someone in 
                        this country who actually says what 
                        they feel.
                                 KATE
                        Oh, haven’t you heard, we’re a 
                        nation changed. Ever since Diana, 
                        we’ve opened up, let it all out. 
                             (beat)
                        You guys showed us the way. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Just as we’re trying to adopt your 
                        stiff upper lip.

           Kate smiles.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        What is a stiff upper lip, anyway?

           Harvey tries to physicalize it.

                                 KATE
                        No, i think, it’s more this.

           Kate stretches her top lip.

                                 HARVEY 
                        I see. 
                             (copies her)
                        How’s that?

                                 KATE
                             (top lip stretched)
                        Getting there.

           As they sit there grimacing, the waiter arrives with their 
           drinks and looks on bemused.

                                 WAITER
                        Are you ready to order?

                                 HARVEY
                        Um, I think.

                                 KATE
                             (smiling)
                        Sure.

           From a distance we watch them order.

                                                               FADE TO:

           In a montage we watch Harvey and Kate eat, talk, and laugh. 

                                                               FADE TO:
           EXT. CHEZ GERARD - EVENING

           Harvey and Kate exit the restaurant. They stand opposite each 
           other in the quietening Terminal. 

                                 KATE
                        Thank you. I... I really enjoyed 
                        that.

                                 HARVEY
                        Yes. So did I.

           Slightly awkward pause. Kate glances at her watch.

                                 KATE 
                        I should probably get home before i 
                        have to be back here again.

                                 HARVEY
                        Sure.

                                 KATE 
                        I take the Heathrow Express. What 
                        about you? 

           Harvey hadn’t really thought.

                                 HARVEY 
                        I don’t know. I guess i’ll stay in 
                        a Hotel near here. My flight’s in 
                        the morning.

           Beat.

                                 KATE
                        Well...it’s been a 
                        pleasure...Harvey Shine.

                                 HARVEY
                        Yes. Yes it has.

           They shake hands, smiling. Just then Kate’s phone rings 
           again. 

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        There’s your phone again.

                                 KATE
                        Yes.
                             (beat)
                        Sorry. I’d better go.
           Kate turns and leaves. Harvey watches her go.

           INT. TERMINAL / HOTEL PHONE BANK - EVENING

           Harvey picks up a hotel phone.

                                 HARVEY
                        I’d like a room please.
                             (beat)
                        One night.

           INT. HEATHROW EXPRESS PLATFORM - EVENING

           Kate waits on the platform as a train glides into the 
           station. She boards with the rest of the weary travellers.

           INT. TRAIN - EVENING

           Kate stands in a crowded middle section. The doors slide 
           closed. Then open again. A mild commotion ensues down the 
           other end of the carriage as somebody squeezes aboard at the 
           last.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sorry. Excuse me.

           Kate looks up to see Harvey making his way down the crowded 
           carriage. 

                                 HARVEY 
                        Sorry.

           People reluctantly make way for Harvey and his case. He 
           finally arrives next to Kate as the train jolts forward. 

           Momentarily losing his balance, Harvey steadies himself on a 
           businessman’s shoulder. Kate leans forward to help, as the 
           businessman turns slightly irritated.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Sorry.
                             (turning to Kate)
                        Hi.
                             (a little sheepish)
                        I thought i might as well stay in 
                        town. More fun than a hotel next to 
                        a runway, right?

           Kate nods. Harvey smiles a little smile as the train speeds 
           off.
           EXT. TRACK - EVENING

           The train speeds past on its way into London.

           INT. TRAIN - EVENING 

           Harvey and Kate stand next to each other, gently swaying, in 
           the crowded carriage. The businessman standing next to 
           Harvey, talks loudly on his phone about his day’s conquest. 
           Harvey and Kate share a look. In a Keatonesque performance, 
           Harvey, keeping his body rigid, slowly leans further and 
           further away from the man, making Kate smile.

           INT. PADDINGTON STATION - EVENING

           The train pulls into the station. We watch as Harvey and Kate 
           alight with the crowd.

           EXT. PADDINGTON STATION - EVENING

           They come to a stop outside. It’s still light. One of those 
           endless summer evenings.

                                 KATE
                        Well, this is where i get my bus.  
                        Taxi’s are over there. They’ll take 
                        you to wherever you need to go.

           Harvey looks towards the Taxi rank. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I guess it’s goodbye again.

                                 HARVEY
                        Yes.
                             (beat/looks up at the 
                              evening sky)
                        You don’t want to walk with me a 
                        little, do you?
                             (beat)
                        To be honest, the idea of sitting 
                        in my hotel ro...

                                 KATE
                        I-I should really get home.

                                 HARVEY
                        Sure.
           Kate thinks for a moment. She looks behind her and then back.

                                 KATE
                        Oh, bugger it.

                                 HARVEY
                        Bugger it?
                             (beat)
                        You would?

           Kate smiles.

                                 KATE
                        Why not?

           EXT. LONDON STREETS - EVENING

           Montage: Accompanied by a wonderfully romantic little ditty, 
           we watch from a distance as Harvey and Kate navigate the 
           buzzing streets of central London. It is a beautiful summer’s 
           evening and the streets are alive and well.

           Harvey drops his suitcase off at the same hotel he was 
           staying in before.

           As they wander through the city, foreign students mingle, 
           policemen chat, and office workers linger. London is at its 
           best.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING 

           Kate’s mum sits skimming restlessly through a magazine. 
           Tossing the magazine down, she stands and ‘oh so casually’ 
           wanders over to the window again. Sighing, she gently lifts 
           back the curtain. POV: The shed sits smoking. No sign of the 
           Neighbour. Then, suddenly the door to the shed flies open and 
           out steps the Neighbour carrying what looks like a chain-saw. 
           With the back of his free hand he wipes his brow. Blood  
           trickles down his face. Maggie has seen enough!

           EXT. SOUTH BANK - DUSK

           The sky glows the palest of orange as daylight refuses to 
           depart. Magic hour! Harvey and Kate walk and talk along the 
           South Bank. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Yours is a beautiful city, Kate.

           Kate looks at Harvey a moment, then smiles.
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 KATE
                        Its just a funny way of saying it. 
                        Quite old fashioned.

                                 HARVEY
                        Really?

                                 KATE
                        But i like it.
                             (beat)
                        Yours is glorious country, 
                        Honeychurch.

           Harvey looks at Kate quizzically.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        It’s a line from a movie. ‘Room 
                        with a View’.

           Harvey shakes his head.

                                 HARVEY
                        I’m afraid i’m not much of a movie 
                        buff. 
                             (beat)
                        Too fidgety, I guess.

           Kate looks at Harvey.

                                 KATE
                        We’re quite different, you and I, 
                        aren’t we? I mean, not very 
                        similar.

                                 HARVEY
                        Is that bad?

                                 KATE
                             (beat/thinks about it)
                        No. 

           Just then Kate’s phone rings again.

                                 HARVEY
                        Both our phones ring a lot. We have 
                        that in common.

                                 KATE
                             (smiles)
                        Ah.
           They come to a stop as Kate takes out her phone and looks at 
           the handset display.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. I should probably take this.

           Harvey nods.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Mum?
                             (beat)
                        I’ve been busy.
                             (beat)
                        No, I’m out. Yes with someone. No 
                        someone else. 
                             (beat)
                        Yes.
                             (looks at Harvey)
                        ...a man.

           Harvey smiles. We hear Maggie’s warble continue as Kate 
           listens. Beat.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        You did, did you? 
                             (beat)
                        An actual body.

           Harvey looks at Kate. Kate shakes her head. Maggie continues.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Mum. Listen. I’ll come over 
                        tomorrow and we can check it out 
                        together. 
                             (beat)
                        I have to go now. Just get an early 
                        night and i’ll see you tomorrow.
                             (beat)
                        I love you too.

           Kate hangs up.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. 
                             (beat)
                        My mother.

                                 HARVEY
                        She worries about you?

                                 KATE
                        And herself. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)

                        She’s convinced she’s living next 
                        to Poland’s answer to Ted Bundy.

                                 HARVEY
                        I see.

           They start walking again.

                                 KATE
                        She means well. She’s just had a 
                        tough run.
                             (long beat)
                        My Father buggered off to the South 
                        of France with his secretary. Then 
                        mum got cancer about four years 
                        ago. She’s fully recovered now. But 
                        won’t admit it.
                             (beat)
                        She’s basically bored. And my 
                        continued ‘situation’ as she calls 
                        it, being single, is her major 
                        distraction. Her pastime if you 
                        will.

                                 HARVEY
                        I see.

                                 KATE
                        Yes, my rotting eggs are her raison 
                        d'être.
                             (beat/turns to Harvey)
                        Sorry.

                                 HARVEY
                        No. 

                                 KATE
                        I talk too much. 

                                 HARVEY
                        No. I like it.

                                 KATE
                        Do you? 

                                 HARVEY
                        Yes. 

           Kate stops a moment and looks at Harvey. 

                                 KATE
                        Hmm...

           They carry on walking. 
           INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Maggie, very tentatively, lifts her curtain again. No sign of 
           the ‘Killer’. Suddenly the doorbell rings. 

           INT. HALLWAY - EVENING

           As Maggie, slowly approaches the front door, the doorbell 
           rings again. She slowly leans in and peers through the peep-
           hole. POV: The Neighbour looms large. He holds in his arms a 
           large ‘something’ wrapped in paper.

           Maggie pulls her head away. Beat. She looks again. POV: The 
           Neighbour bends down out of sight and then rises again, 
           turning to leave. Maggie watches him go.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - EVENING

           The door slowly opens. Maggie looks around then notices the 
           ‘thing’ wrapped in paper on the ground. She quickly picks it 
           up and takes it inside.

           EXT. SOUTH BANK - DUSK

           Harvey and Kate walk under Waterloo bridge past the second 
           hand bookstalls. A man plays a saxophone melancholically.

                                 KATE 
                        Do you ever wish you could try a 
                        different life? 
                             (beat)
                        Just for a day. Just to see what it 
                        would be like.

                                 HARVEY
                        What would it be?

                                 KATE
                        Sorry?

                                 HARVEY
                        The life you would try.

                                 KATE
                             (looks down at her 
                              uniform)
                        Well, no green, that’s for sure.

           Harvey smiles.
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                             (beat/thinks)
                        It would take place in Spain. A 
                        little house inland.

                                 HARVEY
                        And what would you do there?

                                 KATE
                        Oh...I don’t know...
                             (tentative)
                        I’ve...

           Kate stops herself.

                                 HARVEY
                        What?

                                 KATE
                        No, it’s silly.

                                 HARVEY
                        What is it?

                                 KATE
                        Well, I’ve always had a desire to 
                        write a book. Not the great novel. 
                        Just a bloody good holiday read.
                             (beat)
                        I think i’ve got that somewhere in 
                        me.

                                 HARVEY
                        Ok. So this house in Spain would 
                        have a little cabana looking out 
                        over the plains for you to write 
                        in.

                                 KATE
                             (smiling)
                        Yes. 

                                 HARVEY
                        And a little stream running by, to 
                        bathe in.

                                 KATE
                             (smiling)
                        Sure.

                                 HARVEY

                        guests.

           Kate smiles.

                                 KATE
                        Sure, you can visit Harvey Shine.

           They share a smile before coming to a stop opposite a ‘Human 
           Statue’ street performer. The performer is sprayed from head 
           to toe in silver paint and dressed in a rather shabby looking 
           robot’s costume. The statue tries his hardest to stay still 
           but can’t help but rock back and forth. To be honest he looks 
           sozzled. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                             (whispers)
                        I think he’s drunk.

                                 HARVEY
                        I think you’re right.

           The small audience that had gathered, walk on. The statue 
           finally gives up dejected and slumps down on his box. As he 
           steps down he looses his balance and falls. Harvey and Kate 
           come to his assistance. Helping him up, they sit him down on 
           his stool. Harvey gives him a fiver and a supportive pat on 
           the back. The statue nods his head in thanks.

           INT. KITCHEN - EVENING 

           The large ‘thing’ wrapped in paper sits on a kitchen table. 
           Maggie stands nearby with a glass of wine in hand, warily 
           staring at it. 

           She puts down her wine and tentatively reaches forward and 
           slowly unwraps the paper. 

           Barely daring to look, her worst fears are realised when she 
           reveals what looks like a chunk of dried flesh. She turns 
           away in horror.

           EXT. SOUTH BANK - EVENING

           Harvey and Kate come to a stop by some railings over-looking 
           the river. 

                                 KATE
                             (looking back at the 
                              statue)
                        Poor bugger doesn’t stand a chance.
                                 HARVEY
                        No, if there’s one profession you 
                        need to sober in, it’s his.

           Kate smiles at Harvey.

                                 KATE
                        That was sweet of you.

           Harvey shrugs. Kate looks out over the Thames. The street 
           lamps reflect off the water as darkness finally descends.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        What happened Harvey?
                             (beat)
                        Between you and your daughter?

           Beat. Harvey shakes his head.

                                 HARVEY
                        I don’t know.
                             (beat)
                        Somewhere along the way i lost her. 
                        I lost my family.
                             (beat)
                        I just woke up one morning and 
                        realised i didn’t belong.

           Beat.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        I’d always had this mean little 
                        feeling in my stomach, that they 
                        were a bit embarrassed by me.  
                             (beat)
                        If you saw them now, with Brian, 
                        Susan’s step-father. You’d see, 
                        they make more sense. They look 
                        right together.

           Beat. Harvey looks out over the Thames.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        I’ve not been a great father.

           Kate looks at Harvey’s sad profile. Beat. She thinks for a 
           moment.

                                 KATE
                        The reception. It’s still going on?
                                 HARVEY
                             (looks at his watch)
                        I guess.

                                 KATE
                        Where?

           Harvey looks up.

                                 HARVEY
                        The Dorchester. Why?

           Kate looks at Harvey.

                                 KATE
                        You must go!

                                 HARVEY
                        What?

                                 KATE
                        What the hell are you doing here? 
                        You must go!

           Harvey shakes his head.

                                 HARVEY 
                        She doesn’t need me.

                                 KATE
                        Stop feeling so sorry for yourself. 
                        She’s your daughter, you’re her 
                        father. Go!

           Harvey shakes his head again. Kate is not about to give up.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Harvey, if you don’t, you’ll regret 
                        it for the rest of your life.
                             (beat)
                        And i won’t forgive you either.

           Harvey looks at Kate. Beat.

                                 HARVEY
                        Only if you come with me.

                                 KATE
                        What?

                                 HARVEY
                        Please, come with me. As...as my 
                        friend.
           Kate momentarily blushes, then shakes her head.

                                 KATE
                        Harvey, firstly, i’m not about to 
                        go to anyone’s wedding dressed in 
                        green. Secondly it’s not right.

                                 HARVEY
                        We’ll find you a dress. If we find 
                        you a dress, will you come?

                                 KATE
                        No.

                                 HARVEY
                        Please.

                                 KATE
                        Where are you going to find a dress 
                        at...
                             (looks at her watch)
                        ...quarter to nine on a Saturday 
                        night?

                                 HARVEY
                        Trust me, Harvey Shine will fix it.

           EXT. REGENT’S STREET - NIGHT

           Music/Montage: Harvey enthusiastically knocks on the windows 
           of various stores - pleading with security guards and the 
           like to open up. Finally a woman doing a stock take in a 
           store smiles and agrees to let them in. Kate shakes her head 
           apologetically to the woman. Montage continues as Kate tries 
           on a variety of dresses, while Harvey sits on a sofa 
           watching. Quite a crowd of cleaners,security guards and stock-
           takers have joined him, by the time Kate finally steps out in 
           a stunning gown - looking gorgeous. Everyone agrees that’s 
           the one. Kate blushes, but can’t help but smile.

           EXT. DORCHESTER - NIGHT

           A Taxi pulls up and out step Harvey and Kate. Kate looks 
           fantastic on Harvey’s arm as they walk up the front steps.

           INT. WEDDING RECEPTION - NIGHT

           A reception is in full swing. 
           INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

           The doors close behind Harvey and Kate as they enter an 
           elevator.

           INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Harvey and Kate stand side by side in silence. They both 
           smile a little anxiously - almost like teenagers. Harvey 
           reaches over and gently takes Kate’s hand. 

           INT. RECEPTION FLOOR / HALLWAY - NIGHT

           There is a loud ‘ping’ as the elevator doors open onto a 
           hallway. Harvey and Kate step forward. Down the hall, through 
           some double doors we hear the familiar din of a buzzing 
           reception. Harvey momentarily falters.

                                 KATE 
                        Come on.

           Kate encourages Harvey forward.

           INT. RECEPTION - NIGHT

           The doors open and Harvey and Kate enter. Heads turn. Jean 
           looks up and sees Harvey with Kate. She shakes her head. 
           Susan sees Harvey and gets up. She joins him.

                                 HARVEY
                        Hey.

                                 SUSAN
                        Hi.

                                 HARVEY
                        I didn’t go.

                                 SUSAN
                        I’m glad.

           Off Susan’s look, Harvey turns to Kate.

                                 HARVEY
                        This is Kate. A... friend.
                                 KATE
                             (sheepish)
                        Hi. Congratulations. You look 
                        fantastic.

                                 SUSAN
                        Thank you.

           Slightly awkward pause.

                                 KATE
                        I’m really sorry to gate-crash. 
                        You’re father sort of insisted.

                                 SUSAN 
                        No, it’s fine. I’m sure...
                             (looks around)
                        ...there’s room.

           Susan looks back at the full top table.

                                 HARVEY
                        You get back. Don’t worry about us, 
                        we’ll find a place.

                                 KATE
                        Yes...

                                 SUSAN
                        No. 
                             (stops a passing waiter)
                        Could you find them a seat please.

                                 WAITER
                        Sure.

           The Master of Ceremonies stands and clinks his glass for 
           attention.

                                 SUSAN
                        I’d better go.

                                 M.OF C.
                        And now for the best man’s speech. 
                        Except we seem to be missing the 
                        bride.
                             (laughter)
                        Oh, no, here she is.

           Susan heads back and resumes her seat at top table. The best 
           man takes the mic...
                                 BEST MAN
                        Scott. What can i say...

           INT. RECEPTION / BACK TABLES

           The waiter leads Harvey and Kate to a table.

                                 WAITER
                        I’m afraid this is the only place 
                        left.

           The waiter shows them to a few empty seats at the children’s 
           table. 

                                 HARVEY
                        That’s fine.

           Harvey and Kate take their seats. The kids stare at them.

                                 KATE
                        Hi.

           A brace clad, large girl in a white frilly dress speaks.

                                 LARGE GIRL
                        Are you Uncle Harvey?

                                 HARVEY
                        Yes. I guess.

                                 KID
                        I’ve heard about you.

                                 HARVEY
                        Oh. 
                             (beat)
                        You’re not Miriam’s kid are you?

                                 LARGE GIRL
                        Yes.

                                 HARVEY
                        Wow...You’ve...got big. I mean 
                        grown up.

                                 LARGE GIRL
                        I’m fourteen.

                                 HARVEY
                        Wow.
           Kate feels someone’s eyes on her and turns to her left to 
           find a smartly dressed young boy of about eight, staring up 
           at her with his mouth open. Kate nods her head. 

                                 KATE
                        Hello

           The boy remains silent, keeping his gormless gaze fixed on 
           Kate. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                             (turning back to Harvey)
                        Looks like i got a real chatter to 
                        my left.

           Harvey smiles. 

           INT. RECEPTION / TOP TABLE - NIGHT

                                 BEST MAN
                        So without further ado, I’d like to 
                        propose a toast to Susan for making 
                        my friend Scott complete.

           The audience whoop and clap. Scott gives his best man a hug. 
           The MC stands...

                                 M.C.
                        And now ladies and Gentlemen. It is 
                        the turn of the Father of the Bride 
                        to say a few words. And tonight 
                        that task will be carried out by 
                        the very charming and distinguished 
                        Brian. 

           More clapping as Brian stands. Kate glances at Harvey, who 
           blushes. 

                                 BRIAN
                        Well, that’s quite some speech 
                        Josh. Quite something to follow. 
                        But I shall try...

           Harvey suddenly stands and clears his throat. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Um... Excuse me...

           Nobody really hears. He picks up his glass and a spoon and 
           begins to tap it. People stir and turn to Harvey. Brian comes 
           to a stop. Jean looks on furious. Silence.
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Sorry Brian... Sorry to interrupt.

           Everyone stares at Harvey. Silence.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        But you see i can’t just sit hear 
                        and watch somebody else give my 
                        baby girl away. Susan’s my daughter 
                        and i’m her father. Not the best 
                        but her father all the same...

           A waiter brings Harvey a microphone.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Thanks.

           It’s arrival slightly throws him. 

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Um... I should have prepared 
                        something but... I guess it reminds 
                        me of a joke...

           Harvey continually knocks the mic against his chest, causing 
           terrible feedback.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. Um...

           Then Harvey drops the mic. Jean stands up. 

                                 JEAN
                        For God’s sake Harvey, don’t make a 
                        scene.

           Silence. Harvey stares out at the party. They all stare back 
           at him. He glances down at Kate who smiles back. Harvey lifts 
           the microphone up off the table and raises it to his lips.

                                 HARVEY
                        No Jean. I want to make a scene. 
                        You know. I’m tired of being 
                        embarrassed. 
                             (beat)
                        If we can’t make a scene on the day 
                        of our daughter’s wedding, then 
                        when can we? I want to make a 
                        scene. I want to shout! I wanna 
                        tell the world how lucky it is to 
                        have our Suzie in it!
                                 SOMEONE IN THE CROWD
                        Yeah!

                                 HARVEY
                        I wanna tell Scott, how damn lucky 
                        he is!

                                 UNCLE FRED
                        Hear, hear!

           People start to clap.

                                 HARVEY
                             (smiling)
                        And also if he ever hurts her, i 
                        know people in London.

           Laughter.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Seriously though. Scott, i swear 
                        you have found in Susan a bright 
                        and passionate person. And a loyal 
                        friend.

                                 CONGREGATION
                        Hear, hear!

                                 HARVEY
                             (beat)
                        And i can see from the way she 
                        looks at you. From the way she is 
                        with you, that she is... happy. And 
                        i thank you and welcome you to the 
                        family.
                             (beat)
                        So please everyone, please join me 
                        in a toast. To Susan and Scott. 

                                 CONGREGATION
                        Susan and Scott!

           Everyone claps loudly. Susan shares a gentle smile with her 
           Father. Harvey sits and looks at Kate anxiously. Kate smiles 
           and nods. 

                                 KATE
                        Well done.

                                 HARVEY
                        Really?
           She indicates to the rest of the table. Harvey turns to their 
           now animated young neighbours, who all sit clapping.

           INT. RECEPTION / BANDSTAND - NIGHT

                                 M.C.
                        And now the Bride and Groom shall 
                        have the first dance. 

           The band strike up as Susan and Scott take to the dance 
           floor. They dance a slow dance. Harvey and Kate sit watching. 

           The song comes to an end...

                                 M.C. (CONT'D)
                        And now the Father of the Bride and 
                        the Bride shall dance.

           Kate encourages Harvey up. He joins Susan and Scott on the 
           dance-floor. Harvey and Scott shake hands before Harvey leads 
           Susan into a dance. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Thanks for coming Dad.

           Beat.

                                 HARVEY
                        Thank you for having me.

           Kate looks on, as Harvey dances happily with his daughter. 
           Feeling something, she turns to find the eight year old’s 
           head slumped against her shoulder as he sleeps soundly. Kate 
           smiles at her lot.

           Back on the dance-floor, Harvey encourages Brian to take over 
           the dance with Susan. Harvey turns away and is joined by 
           Uncle Fred and gang. They all chat animatedly. Uncle Fred 
           pushes Harvey into a dance with his wife. A ‘Boogie’ strikes 
           up.

           Kate looks on as Harvey dances and reunites with his extended 
           family. She sees the delight in his face. She looks around at 
           all the happy faces. It’s time perhaps to let the family 
           celebrate alone. 

           Extricating herself from the sleeping boy, she pushes two 
           chairs together and makes a bed for him. Covering him in a 
           jacket, she glances back at the dance-floor before turning to 
           leave.
           Back on the dance-floor, a ‘Boogie’ is in full swing. Harvey 
           caught up in the fun, energetically swings Aunt Maddie 
           around. He suddenly catches himself and turns to his table to 
           look for Kate, but finds it empty save for a row of dozing 
           children.

           Harvey makes his excuses and turns away, looking for Kate 
           amongst the crowded room.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Kate retrieves her coat and makes her way down the hall 
           towards the bank of elevators.

           INT. RECEPTION - NIGHT

           Harvey hurries to the exit.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           On turning into the hall, he sees Kate standing in the 
           distance. Just then, she steps forward and out of sight. 
           Harvey runs.

           INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Kate stands in the empty elevator, waiting for the doors to 
           close. Just as they do, they are stopped and open again to 
           reveal Harvey standing there, slightly out of breath.

                                 HARVEY
                        You’re leaving?

                                 KATE
                        Yes.

           Beat.

                                 HARVEY
                        What about our dance?

           As the doors threaten to close again, Harvey stops them and 
           holds out his hand. The faintest of smiles crosses Kate‘s 
           face. Kate takes Harvey’s hand and steps out of the elevator.

           They stand slightly awkwardly opposite each other. In the 
           background a slow song strikes up. The music is softened but 
           audible. 
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        May I?

                                 KATE
                        Why not?

           Harvey tentatively leads Kate into a slow dance. They dance 
           in the hallway. Both are a little rusty.

                                 HARVEY 
                        Sorry. It’s been a while.

                                 KATE
                        Yes. For me too.

           They share a smile. Beat.

                                 HARVEY 
                        Why did you leave?

                                 KATE
                        Because you looked happy.

           Harvey looks quizzically at Kate.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        You should be with your family, 
                        Harvey.

                                 HARVEY
                        But I want to be with you. 
                             (beat)
                        You make me happy.

           Kate can’t help but blush and looks away.

                                 KATE
                        Oi, Harvey. You’re gonna make a 
                        grown woman silly.

           The song comes to an end. In the background we hear clapping 
           and cheering. A funky number starts up. Harvey takes Kate’s 
           hand.

                                 HARVEY
                             (excited)
                        Come, I want you to meet people. I 
                        want them to meet you.

           Harvey leads a slightly reluctant Kate back down the hall 
           towards the reception.
           INT. RECEPTION - NIGHT

           The band let rip on a funky tune. The congregation fill the 
           dance-floor. Harvey leads Kate back into the room and heads 
           straight for the dance-floor. As they pass relatives along 
           the way, Harvey introduces them to Kate. Much hugging and 
           kissing ensues.

           Harvey and Kate dance a boogie. Uncle Fred and Aunt Maddie 
           join them. Uncle Fred steals Kate from Harvey and twirls her 
           off.

           MONTAGE: Fun and Frolics on the dance-floor. Harvey is at the 
           center of it all. He initiates a Jewish chair dance. A Congo 
           line. Russian dancing! Kate’s face says it all - she’s having 
           a ball. The sleeping kid, sleeps.

           INT. RECEPTION / BANDSTAND - NIGHT

           Close up on the M.C.

                                 M.C.
                        Ladies and Gentlemen. The bride and 
                        groom are about to leave. Please 
                        join me outside to send them off in 
                        style.

           EXT. HOTEL STEPS - NIGHT

           Harvey and Kate join the rest of the congregation outside on 
           the steps of the hotel. Harvey looks on as his daughter and 
           son-in-law head to an awaiting car. Susan stops and throws 
           the bouquet behind her. It is caught by Aunt Maddie, who in 
           turn throws it and it is caught by Harvey’s ‘all grown up’ 
           niece. She blushes profusely revealing an impressive set of 
           braces on her teenage teeth.

           Susan kisses her mother and Brian goodbye. And is about to 
           get into the car when she stops and hurries over to Harvey.

                                 SUSAN
                        Bye Dad.

                                 HARVEY
                        Bye pumpk... Bye Susan.

           She hugs him tightly. Pulling away she turns to Kate.

                                 SUSAN
                        Be kind to him.
           Kate nods as Susan turns to leave.

                                 HARVEY
                             (to Kate)
                        Sorry.

           Kate smiles. As the car pulls away, everyone cheers. Harvey 
           looks on. His eyes momentarily lock onto his ex-wife’s. They 
           share a conciliatory look. As Harvey watches his daughter’s 
           car disappear down the street, Kate looks at him. He turns 
           back. Beat.

                                 KATE
                        You Ok?

                                 HARVEY
                        Yes. Yes, I am.

           Beat. Harvey looks around.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        You wanna get out of here?

                                 KATE
                        Sure.

           EXT. WEST END STREET - NIGHT

           Harvey and Kate walk. The streets are quiet. There is already 
           a hint of dawn in the sky. Rubbish trucks manoeuvre.

           EXT. HYDE PARK - DAWN

           They turn into Hyde Park and take a seat on a bench 
           overlooking the boating pond. The sky lightens.

                                 KATE
                        I don’t think I’ve stayed up all 
                        night since I was a student.

           They stare out over the pond. Silence. Harvey looks at Kate 
           for a beat.

                                 HARVEY
                        You look sad. Why?

           Kate looks back at Harvey and tries to read him. She looks 
           down at her lap, then up, out over the pond.
                                 KATE
                        Oh, I don’t know. My uniform’s 
                        green?

           The sun begins to creep above the horizon. Harvey and Kate 
           look out over the still water. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I was pregnant once. 
                             (beat)
                        I had an abortion. Didn’t give it a 
                        moment’s thought.
                             (beat)
                        That’s what smart girls did. 

           Beat. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I do sometimes wonder what they’d 
                        be like today.
                             (beat)
                        Whether they’d be smart. Funny. 
                        Serious.
                             (beat)
                        I don’t know, it’s silly.

           Harvey looks at Kate in the morning light. Kate blushes and 
           looks away.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I don’t know why i just told you 
                        that.

                                 HARVEY
                        No. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m glad.

           Harvey looks away, then back.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Meet me here, tomorrow. 

                                 KATE
                        What?

                                 HARVEY
                        Exactly here on this bench. At 
                        noon.

           Kate smiles, determinedly trying to keep it light.
                                 KATE
                        What about your flight, Harvey?

                                 HARVEY
                        I don’t want to leave.
                             (beat/excited)
                        I wanna be with you.

           Kate’s blush deepens, she looks away and laughs.

                                 KATE
                        Shut up, Harvey.

                                 HARVEY
                        It’s true.

           Kate glances at Harvey, trying see the truth in his eyes.

                                 KATE
                        You say that now, but wait until 
                        tomorrow.

                                 HARVEY
                        Today is tomorrow.

                                 KATE 
                        Harvey we know nothing about each 
                        other. You’re...

                                 HARVEY
                        Old?

                                 KATE
                        A bit older, yes. 
                             (beat)
                        I can be mean. Really mean.

                                 HARVEY
                        So can I.

           Kate can’t help smile. Beat. She glances towards the street. 

                                 KATE 
                             (standing)
                        I should be going.

                                 HARVEY 
                        I know enough to know, i’ll be 
                        here. Waiting, on this bench.

           Kate looks at Harvey, then again towards the street.
                                 KATE
                        Sure, Harvey.

                                 HARVEY
                        Noon. I mean it.

                                 KATE
                        There’s my bus.

                                 HARVEY
                        I’ll be here.

           Kate smiles a little smile. She suddenly believes him.

                                 KATE
                        Ok.

           She steps backwards.

                                 HARVEY
                        Wait.

           Harvey gets up and joins her. They look at each other. Harvey 
           suddenly leans in and kisses Kate.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                             (pulling away/can’t help 
                              smiling)
                        Sorry.

           Kate smiles.

                                 KATE
                        Harvey Shine.

                                 HARVEY
                        Give me something until tomorrow.

           Kate reaches for her purse and pulls out a photo. She gives 
           it to Harvey. 

                                 KATE
                        I gotta go.

           She turns and leaves, running to catch the bus.

           Harvey stands holding the photo. He looks down. It is a faded 
           photo of toothy young girl, no older than eleven. Harvey 
           looks up and smiles.
           INT. BUS - EARLY MORNING

           Kate takes a seat on the top deck of a bus. Taking a moment 
           to catch her breath, she looks out the window. Turning back, 
           she allows herself a smile...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. LONDON STREET - EARLY MORNING

           Harvey, with a croissant lodged in his mouth and a cup of 
           coffee in hand, buys a morning paper. He turns and crosses 
           the road, skipping up the steps of his hotel.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EARLY MORNING

           Harvey enters, and waving to a slightly bemused concierge, 
           heads to the bank of elevators.

                                 HARVEY
                        Morning.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        I’m afraid they’re both out of 
                        order.

           Harvey glances at the sign, then over to the stairwell.

                                 HARVEY
                        I guess i’ll walk, then.

           INT. STAIRWELL - MORNING

           Harvey, a man, seemingly impatient to start a ‘new life’, 
           positively runs up the steps. Surprised at first by his 
           agility, he begins to slow. He stops to catch his breath. 
           Suddenly his spare hand clasps the bannister tight. Close up 
           on Harvey’s face, confused, then frightened. We watch as the 
           cup of coffee hits the ground, splattering down the 
           stairwell...

           EXT. LONDON STREET - MORNING

           Close up on a flashing siren. An ambulance careens through 
           the early morning streets.

           INT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

           Harvey is rushed through on a trolley.

           EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY 

           Kate, dressed in a colourful skirt, with a skip in her step, 
           walks through the bustling mid-day streets of London. She 
           stops off and buys a bag of cherries from a ‘Fruit & Veg’ 
           vendor.

           INT. HOSPITAL / RECOVERY ROOM - DAY 

           A white clad figure slowly comes into focus. Harvey wakes. 
           Disorientated, he looks around the sparse room. A nurse 
           busies herself nearby. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Where am I?

           The nurse looks over.

                                 NURSE
                        Ah, we’re awake.
                             (speaking loudly)
                        You’re in a Hospital, Mr Shine. The 
                        Doctor will be here shortly.

                                 HARVEY
                        A hospital?

           Harvey looks around. He begins to remember the previous day’s 
           events.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        What time is it?

           The nurse looks up from her chart.
                                 NURSE
                        Sorry?

                                 HARVEY
                        What’s the time?

                                 NURSE
                             (glancing up at a clock on 
                              the wall)
                        Just coming up to noon. Lunch-time 
                        soon. I’m sure you’re hungry.

                                 HARVEY
                        I have to go. I have to be 
                        somewhere.

           Harvey tries to rise, but finds himself attached to various 
           tubes and such. The nurse hurries over.

                                 NURSE
                        Hey mister, you’re not going 
                        anywhere. 

                                 HARVEY
                        I have to!

           Harvey struggles to untangle himself.  

                                 NURSE
                        Sir, you’ve just had a heart 
                        attack!

           On hearing those words, Harvey stops and slumps back onto the 
           bed.

                                 HARVEY
                        A heart attack?

           Just then a Doctor comes through the door, holding a 
           clipboard.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mr Shine, you’re back with us.
                             (off Harvey’s lack of 
                              response)
                        I’m Dr. Beitler.  
                             (beat)
                        Your a very lucky man, Mr Shine.

                        You suffered a heart attack.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        Mild enough this time to not cause 
                        any lasting damage. But definitely 
                        a warning shot, i’d say.

           Harvey sits in a daze.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        Now I want you to stay with us for 
                        a couple of days - just to make 
                        sure, everything’s fine. And then 
                        we need to have a talk about some 
                        longer term adjustments to your 
                        life-style.

           EXT. HYDE PARK / BOATING POND - DAY 

           Kate sits waiting on the same bench they had sat on earlier. 
           Some kids roller-blade nearby. She self-consciously smooths a 
           fold in her skirt, then looks at her watch. Beat. She looks 
           down at the brown paper bag of cherries. Suddenly a resigned 
           smile flashes across her face - she’s been here before – 
           nothing new.

           Kate gets up and leaves. We watch her walk away.

           INT. HOSPITAL / HALLWAY - DAY 

           Brian waits outside Harvey’s room. Through the window, we see 
           Jean sitting at Harvey’s bedside. A nurse passes Brian and 
           enters the room. We see Jean get up and touch Harvey’s hand, 
           before turning to leave. 

           INT. HARVEY’S ROOM - DAY 

           Harvey sits up in bed, as the nurse busies herself around 
           him. Through the window, he watches as Jean and Brian leave. 
           Beat. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Nurse. Could you pass me my jacket?

           The nurse hands Harvey his jacket. Harvey feels inside his 
           pocket, pulling out the photo Kate gave him. He looks at the 
           faded image. Beat.

                                 NURSE
                        Is that your daughter?
           Harvey looks up. 

                                 HARVEY
                        No.

           As the nurse fills in a chart at the end of the bed, Harvey 
           observes her. She must be roughly Kate’s age.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Can i ask you a question?

           The nurse looks up.

                                 NURSE
                        Sure.

                                 HARVEY
                        Would you say i’m...
                             (beat)
                        ...too old for you?

           The nurse, slightly taken aback, smiles.

                                 NURSE
                        Are you trying to chat me up?

                                 HARVEY
                        No, no... I was just wondering.

           The nurse observes Harvey a moment.

                                 NURSE
                        Well, to be honest, you seem like a 
                        very nice man, but yes, I would 
                        say, you were a little old for me.

           Beat.

                                 HARVEY
                        Yeah.

           Harvey looks out the window.

                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        Thank you.

           The nurse looks on, slightly bemused.

           Close up on Kate’s face gently swaying. She stands reading a 
           paperback, oblivious to the crowded bus around her.

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MORNING

           Harvey, dressed, with his case at his feet, stands, lost in 
           thought, next to a reception desk in the Hospital lobby.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mr Shine?
                             (beat)
                        Mr Shine?

           Harvey looks down at the receptionist.

                                 HARVEY
                        Sorry.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Can you sign here, please?

           Harvey signs a form.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
                        And here. 
                             (Harvey signs)
                        And here.
                             (signs)
                        And there.
                             (signs)
                        And that’s it. You’re free to go.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

           Harvey, carrying his case, exits the Hospital and gets into 
           an awaiting Taxi.

           EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING 

           Kate alights with the throng.

           INT. TAXI - MORNING

           Harvey sits in the back of a Taxi. He gazes out at the 
           vibrant city starting its day.
           EXT. TERMINAL 3 - MORNING

           The Taxi pulls up. Harvey gets out and pays the driver. He 
           heads inside the Terminal.

           INT. CHECK-IN COUNTER - MORNING

           Harvey, having checked in, turns away from the counter, 
           tucking his ticket into his jacket. He scans the ‘Departure’ 
           board. Looking down, he pauses for a beat, before heading 
           off.

           INT. O.N.S. / BOOTH - MORNING

           Aggie mans the desk. She stares down at her crossword. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me?

           Aggie reluctantly looks up.

                                 AGGIE
                        Yes?

           Harvey stands there.

                                 HARVEY
                        I was wondering if... Kate was 
                        here?

           Aggie eyes Harvey suspiciously.

                                 AGGIE
                        Who wants to know?

                                 HARVEY
                        A... friend.

           Beat.

                                 AGGIE
                        She don’t work here no more. She 
                        left. She tryin’ something new.

           Harvey takes in the news. He looks around then back.

                                 HARVEY
                        Thank you.

           He is about to leave, when...
                                 AGGIE
                        You from America?

                                 HARVEY
                        Yes.

                                 AGGIE
                        What’s American for Aubergine?

           Beat.

                                 HARVEY
                        Eggplant.

           Aggie giggles to herself as she scribbles it in. Harvey turns 
           and leaves.

           EXT. CIVIC BUILDING - MORNING.

           Kate walks up the steps of a building.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MORNING

           Through a glass panel, we see Kate seated opposite an 
           official looking woman, in the midst of what looks like an 
           interview.

           INT. PASSPORT CONTROL / DEPARTURES - MORNING

           Harvey stands in line for passport control. In the distance, 
           he sees a woman dressed in a green uniform, with her back to 
           him. The woman could almost be Kate from behind. She holds a 
           clipboard and asks a young couple questions. As she finishes 
           the interview, she turns and reveals herself not to be Kate.

                                 PASSPORT OFFICER
                        Sir, your passport, please.

           Harvey turns back and hands in his passport. 

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 

           The Interviewer finishes filling in a form. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Well that all seems good. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)
                        To be totally frank we’re quite 
                        keen on people who are not going to 
                        run off immediately and have kids.

                                 KATE
                        Well, that would be me.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Yes.
                             (looks at Kate a beat)
                        Well, we’ll be contacting 
                        successful applicants over the next 
                        couple of days.

           Just then Kate’s phone rings. 

                                 KATE 
                        Sorry.

           As Kate rummages through her bag, looking for her phone, the 
           Interviewer looks on a slightly disapprovingly.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Do you need to get that?

                                 KATE 
                        No, it’s...fine. I’ll just turn it 
                        off.

           Kate finally finds her phone as it rings off.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Sorry.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        No, that’s fine. 
                             (standing)
                        Well, we’re pretty much done here.

           As Kate stands, her phone starts to ring again.

                                 KATE
                        I’m really sorry.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                             (obviously irritated)
                        No, that’s absolutely fine. You get 
                        that. We’re all done.

           The Interviewer opens the door, almost shepherding Kate out.

                                 INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)
                        We’ll be in touch. Thanks for 
                        coming.
           With Kate’s phone still ringing, the door closes. Beat. Kate 
           stares at the phone, then answers.

                                 KATE
                        Mum?

           As Maggie warbles down the end of the phone, Kate walks away 
           listening.

           EXT. CIVIC BUILDING - DAY

           Still listening, Kate exits the building and stands at the 
           top of the steps.

                                 KATE 
                             (placating)
                        Mum, listen, don’t worry, I’ll...

           She suddenly stops herself. Long beat. Silence save for the 
           sound of Maggie’s warble.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Mum. Stop.
                             (beat)
                        Stop talking.
                             (suddenly)
                        Shut up!

           People passing, look over. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Maggie looks shocked.

           EXT. CIVIC BUILDING - DAY 

                                 KATE
                             (turns away)
                        Mum, I love you. And i’ll always be 
                        here for you. 

           Kate’s mum tries to start up again.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                             (firm)
                        No. Listen.

           Silence.
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        But you’ve got to leave me alone 
                        for a while. You’re still young, 
                        mum. You can still have your own 
                        life. And you’ve gotta let me have 
                        mine.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Silence. Maggie holds the phone.

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                        Bye mum.

           Kate hangs up. Maggie stands still as her daughter’s words 
           sink in. 

           EXT. CIVIC BUILDING - DAY

           Kate takes a breath. Then ever so slowly a little smile 
           breaks, as she makes her way down the steps.

           INT. PLANE - DAY 

           Harvey takes his seat on a crowded plane. Around him, people 
           busy themselves stowing their hand luggage away. Just then 
           his phone rings. He picks up.

                                 HARVEY
                        Hello?

                                 MARVIN
                        Harvey?
                             (beat)
                        Don’t say anything. I’ll probably 
                        regret this, but I want you back. 
                        I’m already missing you, you son of 
                        a bitch. 
                             (beat)
                        Maybe I was a bit harsh.

           Harvey sits, staring ahead.

                                 MARVIN (CONT'D)
                        Harvey?

           Harvey takes a breath.

                                 HARVEY
                        That’s good of you Marvin.
                                 MARVIN
                             (interrupting)
                        Yeah, yeah. I know i’m a softy. 
                        Just get your ass back here, huh.

                                 HARVEY
                             (interrupting)
                        But I wouldn’t work for you again, 
                        even if you were the last boss on 
                        earth. 

                                 MARVIN
                        What?

           Beat.

                                 HARVEY
                        I quit.

                                 MARVIN 
                        Fuck you, Harvey. You need this 
                        job. You fuckin’ ass-hole.

           Harvey sighs.

                                 HARVEY
                        You’re wrong, Marvin. I don’t. 

                                 MARVIN
                        What you gonna live on Harvey, huh? 
                        Welfare? You ain’t got no fuckin’ 
                        pension. 

                                 HARVEY
                        Well Marvin, you see, I have a 
                        little something saved up. 

                                 MARVIN
                        Saved up. Fuck you, Harvey.

                                 HARVEY
                        Saved up, in fact, for this very 
                        moment. You see i’ve been putting a 
                        little something away, Marvin - 
                        just a little, for forty odd years 
                        now. Just so, when this day came, i 
                        could turn to you or some other 
                        schmuck like you and say - ‘No, 
                        Marvin. Fuck you.’

           And with that, Harvey hangs up. Beat. A smile slowly breaks 
           across his face.
           Harvey looks around him. He looks up the aisle and sees the 
           door to the aircraft still open...

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 

           Kate walks along in a daze. A plane flies low overhead. She 
           looks up as it disappears into the West...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           A doorbell chimes.

                                                               FADE IN:

           POV through a peep-hole: A globe-like Maggie stands waiting. 

           INT. SUBURBAN HALLWAY - DAY

           The Neighbour pulls his head away and opens the door on 
           Maggie, holding a large smoked ham.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (nervous)
                        Hi.

                             (heavy accent)
                        Hello.

           Beat.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        I just wanted to say... Thank 
                        you...for the ham.

           Beat.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        And... sorry for taking so long to 
                        say... Thank you.

                                 NEIGHBOUR
                        No. You’re welcome. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s smoked?

                                 NEIGHBOUR
                        Yes.
                             (beat)
                        Please. Come in.
                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh no. I can’t. I shouldn’t. I have 
                        to...

                                 NEIGHBOUR
                        Please.

           Maggie shakes her head and then stops herself. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well, perhaps...Perhaps you could 
                        just show me how to cut it.

                                 NEIGHBOUR
                             (smiles)
                        Absolutely. Come.

           Maggie tentatively follows her Neighbour into his house.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. HIGH STREET / BUS STOP - DAY 

           A rainy old day in London. Kate waits for the bus. As the bus 
           pulls in, Kate joins the throng.

           INT. BUS - DAY 

           Kate comes up onto the top deck and takes a seat. The bus 
           begins to pull away, then stops. Kate wipes the foggy window 
           with her hand and looks down at the rain splattered street. 

           As the bus moves off again, somebody climbs up onto the top 
           deck and takes a seat behind Kate.

           Kate sits looking out the window at the familiar scenes 
           below. Suddenly from behind comes a note. Momentarily 
           startled, Kate glances down at it. It reads: ‘Can i answer 
           those questions, now?’

           Kate turns. There sits Harvey. She turns back. Beat.

                                 HARVEY
                        I’m sorry i wasn’t there, Kate.

           Kate remains looking ahead. The longest beat. Then...
                                 KATE
                        Well...
                             (beat)
                        You’re here now.

           She reaches into her bag and pulls out a pen and paper.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                             (keeping her back to him)
                        Name?

                                 HARVEY
                        Harvey. Harvey Shine.

                                 KATE
                        Current address?

           Harvey think for a moment, then...

                                 HARVEY
                        I’m in transition. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m thinking about Spain. Somewhere 
                        in the hills. 
                             (beat)
                        A little place...perhaps... perhaps 
                        with a room to write in.

           Kate blushes. Long beat. Then Harvey gets up and goes and 
           sits next to Kate.

           They sit there, not saying anything. After a while, Kate 
           slowly leans her head onto Harvey’s shoulder. Harvey smiles a 
           little smile.

           From behind, at a distance, we watch, as they sit next to 
           each other, gently bobbing up and down.

           EXT. HIGH STREET - DAY

           As the bus moves off down a rainy London street it passes a 
           billboard advertising a holiday and depicting an idyllic 
           Mediterranean hill-side. We stay with the billboard, slowly 
           moving in, until it engulfs the screen... 

           It suddenly becomes animated, as a Taxi drives passed, 
           driving towards a beautiful little house on a hill. Next to 
           it sits a little shack, that looks like an awfully good place 
           to write...
                                         The End.
