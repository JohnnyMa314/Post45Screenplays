           CREDITS ROLL

           MUSIC:  “COWBOY” by Kid Rock, as we see a SERIES OF SHOTS:

           INT. FRONT DESK/ LOBBY AREA - DAY

           --C.U. on a large, breakfast buffet plastic cereal dispenser 
           being filled with Fruit Loops from an industrial-sized Fruit 
           Loop box.  The cereal slowly piling up, ready to do its job.

           --A plastic sack of orange juice being lowered into a 
           cafeteria-style orange juice dispenser.

           --Fruit being arranged semi-artfully into a large plastic 
           bowl.

           --Various pre-packaged breakfast goodies, (Cinnamon Delites, 
           Pecan Twirlers, Blueberry Blazes...) being lined in rows on a 
           theoretically white table cloth.

           --PULL BACK to reveal MIKE CRANSHAW, late 30’s, cigarette 
           dangling from mouth, hair like a rain forest, nametag crooked 
           and yet a genuine sweetness beneath it all, performing these 
           early-morning chores with the enthusiasm of a dead squirrel.

           EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY

           --Mike on a step ladder in a parking lot of a small, two-
           story L-shaped motel.  He is replacing a stolen letter on the 
           motel’s welcome sign, in this case the “B” in the phrase: 
           “FREE HBO”

           INT. FRONT DESK/ LOBBY AREA - DAY

           --Mike, cigarette in mouth, smiles pleasantly as he gestures 
           several motel guests from the front the desk area toward the 
           complimentary continental breakfast spread.

           INT. BACK ROOM OFF THE LOBBY - MOTEL - DAY

           --Mike, shirt off, in a room behind the front desk area, 
           struggling with a chin-up on a bar he’s jammed into a 
           doorway, all the while keeping an eye on Regis and Kelly, 
           which plays on an old TV.

           --MUSIC FADES as he completes his 5th chin-up and calls it a 
           morning.  As Regis drones on, his mother, TRISH CRANSHAW, 
           early 60’s, chipper and vital, sticks her head in from the 
           lobby.

           CONTINUED:

                                 TRISH
                        Mike, did you ever call the ice machine 
                        guy?

                                 MIKE
                        ...I forgot.

                                 TRISH
                        Mike, do me a favor and call the ice 
                        machine fellow before we go completely 
                        ice-less.

                                 MIKE
                        OK, Ma.

           Mike puts his shirt on as he heads for the lobby.

           INT. FRONT DESK/LOBBY AREA - DAY

           Mike and Trish make room for each other behind the small 
           front desk, Mike finding a phone book.

                                 MIKE
                        How’re you feeling today?

                                 TRISH
                        Feeling great today, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Good.
                        (flipping pages)
                        Where’s Dad?

                                 TRISH
                        Crossword.

           Mike glances over to a small, closed door that says RESTROOM. 
           From the breakfast area, a BUSINESSMAN, 40’s, enters, placing 
           his key on the desk--

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        Checking out of 202.

                                 TRISH
                        (perfect motel demeanor)
                        And how was your stay, Mr. Edmonds?

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        Fine, thanks.

                                 TRISH
                        Heading back east?

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        No, I gotta head over to Vegas then up to 
                        Salt Lake.

                                 TRISH
                        If it’s not one thing, it’s another.

           Mike, as is his habit, completely ignores this conversation.

           INT. MIKE’S CAR - DAY

           Mike drives his beat-up 2-door Buick along a commercial strip 
           that could be anywhere in America.  He pulls into the parking 
           lot of “FLAGSTAFF FOO-YUNG, $5.95 ALL-U-CAN-EAT”

           INT. FLAGSTAFF FOO-YUNG - DAY

           Mike at a darkened corner table reading National Geographic, 
           mouthful of Lo Mein.  A waitress starts to clear his plate--

                                 MIKE
                        (polite)
                        I’m not quite finished yet.

           She smiles, he smiles, he chews...he reads.

           EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Mike’s car pulls back into the lot.  As he parks and gets out 
           he looks through the glass door into the lobby and sees a 
           woman checking in.  He pauses, perhaps interested by her 
           hair, which is long and well-groomed, and possibly the only 
           thing he can really see of her.

           INT. FRONT DESK/LOBBY AREA - DAY

           Mike enters from the lot, the small “entrance bell” sounding.  
           Trish smiles to him from behind the desk, as he subtly 
           attempts to check out the WOMAN checking in.  She is mid-
           30’s, pretty but all-business, in a pants-suit that seems to 
           match her emotionally-curt personality.

                                 WOMAN
                        One night, preferably something on the 
                        upper level.

                                 TRISH
                        Smoking?--non-smok--

                                 WOMAN
                        Non-smoking.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Mike slips behind the desk as if urgently looking for 
           something, at the same time sneaking a glance at her face.  
           She ignores him, which causes him to lose confidence and 
           retreat to the back room.

           INT. MIKE’S APARTMENT/ROOM - DAY

           Mike sits in his one-room apartment, which is pretty much a 
           showroom for dysfunction:  clothes everywhere, a couple Van 
           Halen posters on the wall, 3 stand-up ashtrays, a CASIO 
           KEYBOARD a record player...  He sits on a recliner, smoking, 
           reading National Geographic in silence.  After a moment--

                                 JERRY (O.S.)
                        Mike!
                        (pause)
                        MIKE!!

           Mike looks up, then stands and goes to the window.  His POV 
           on the motel parking lot below, where his Dad, JERRY 
           CRANSHAW, is looking up.  To say that Jerry, early 60’s, is 
           on the quiet, stoic side would be the understatement of the 
           decade.  Mike opens his window-- 

           (We can see from this angle that the last two rooms at the 
           end of the motel’s “L” have been converted into Mike’s living 
           quarters)

                                 JERRY (cont'd)
                        Need you to sweep the pool.

           Blank look from Mike...and then:

                                 MIKE
                        Why?

                                 JERRY
                        Too much crud.

                                 MIKE
                        Isn’t it Marissa’s job?

                                 JERRY
                        She’s got extra rooms today.

           Mike absorbs this a moment...then closes his window.

           EXT. MOTEL POOL - DAY

           Mike, broom in hand, stands by the motel pool, essentially a 
           large bathtub covered with a dirt-strewn green tarp.  He 
           stares at it...and finally begins sweeping.  He might as well 
           be doing it in his sleep.
           INT. FRONT DESK/LOBBY AREA - NIGHT

           Mike behind the desk as his parents prepare to go home for 
           the night, his mom chatty, his dad silent.

                                 TRISH
                        110’s called twice to complain that 111’s 
                        making too much noise.

                                 MIKE
                        What kind of noise?

                                 TRISH
                        Not that kind, Mike, get your mind out of 
                        the gutter.  Apparently 111’s got some 
                        sort of grinder in there.

                                 MIKE
                        I thought you said to get my mind out of 
                        the gutter.

                                 TRISH
                        That’s disgusting, Michael.

                                 MIKE
                        You’re the one who said it.

                                 JERRY
                        Don’t be gross, Mike.

           Mike nods, obeying his Dad.

                                 TRISH
                        And get some sleep, you look tired.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not tired.

                                 TRISH
                        You look tired.

                                 MIKE
                        You’re the one who’s sick, Ma’.

                                 TRISH
                        Oh that’s a nice thing to say.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry.

           He gives her a kiss on the cheek--

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        I love you.

                                 TRISH
                        I love you, too.

                                 MIKE
                        ‘Night, Dad.

           Jerry nods stoically and he and Trish head out the front 
           door, leaving Mike alone behind the desk.  He watches them 
           get in their car, then retreats to the back room.

           INT. BACK ROOM OFF THE LOBBY - MOTEL - NIGHT

           Mike enters, lighting a cigarette, grabbing a Cinnamon Delite 
           from the supply area and flipping on the tube but muting it.  
           He plops on a couch, opens the Delite, contemplates a back 
           issue of National Geographic, but decides against it.  So he 
           just sits, chewing, staring at nothing.  This is his life.

           After a moment he remote controls through some channels, 
           arriving at Adult Movies On Demand.  He shuffles through the 
           choices, the exotic and imaginative titles and all that they 
           suggest.  But he hesitates before selecting...his thoughts 
           elsewhere.  He closes his eyes, perhaps willing himself 
           through a difficult decision...

           And in a decisive gesture, he switches off the TV, stands and 
           walks to the supply area, digging beneath cereal boxes, 
           napkins, fruit boxes and orange juice bags...until he digs 
           out a dusty bottle of cheap wine.  He looks at it...and 
           perhaps nods a little, determinately, to himself.

           INT. ROOM 221 - THE MOTEL - NIGHT

           The woman who checked in earlier, SUE CLEMMONS, works a 
           laptop at a small desk.  Her suit jacket is off but she’s 
           otherwise still pretty buttoned up, sipping bottled water and 
           looking dour.  Headline News plays silently on the TV.  This 
           is a woman who has acquaintances but not friends.  After a 
           moment there is a quiet KNOCK on the door.  Sue looks up, 
           perplexed or perhaps just annoyed. 

                                 SUE
                        Who is it?

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Management.

                                 SUE
                        What?

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        Management.
                        (pause)
                        Welcome gift.

           Sue now is annoyed.  She goes to the door and opens it to 
           Mike, who stands there, his hair relatively combed, a 
           wrinkled but respectable oxford shirt, sweat on his upper lip 
           and the no-longer dusty bottle of wine in his hand.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        Hi.

                                 SUE
                        Hi.

                                 MIKE
                        I have your complimentary welcome gift.
                        (pause)
                        Wine.
                        (pause)
                        On the house.

           She looks at him, taking in the oddness, then glances at the 
           wine...and reaches for it.  Mike gestures to his nametag.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        Mike.  I’m with management.

                                 SUE
                        Nice to meet you, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        (nervous)
                        My pleasure.  Where would you like it?

                                 SUE
                        Umm, I can just take it.

                                 MIKE
                        ...OK.

           He hands her the wine.  Beat.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        Would you like me to open it?
                        (pause)
                        Sometimes guests don’t have screws.  
                        Corkscrews.

           She looks around, thinking.

                                 SUE
                        Ah--sure, why not.

           Mike gingerly steps in, making sure to leave the door open in 
           a gesture of trustworthiness.  He places the wine on the 
           dresser, pulls a corkscrew from his back pocket and proceeds 
           to open the wine.  He works silently...but then, re: the TV:

                                 MIKE
                        Anything interesting tonight?

                                 SUE
                        I haven’t really been paying attention.

                                 MIKE
                        I know the feeling.
                        (beat)
                        There should be cups in the bathroom.

           She looks at him...but unsure what else to do, she ducks into 
           the bathroom and emerges with a plastic-covered plastic cup.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        Completely sanitary.

                                 SUE
                        Good.

                                 MIKE
                        Shall I?

           As Mike offers to pour her a cup, we might sense that he’s 
           occasionally tried this ploy with other women, but never with 
           any success.  He’s basically making it up as he goes.  But 
           Sue is too caught off guard to really object.

                                 SUE
                        Sure.

           He pours, then stands back to watch.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s a very good year.

           She smiles, takes a sip, nods in tentative agreement.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        ...Sometimes guests invite me to join 
                        them for a taste.

                                 SUE
                        ...Is that right?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.  Not always, but...often.
                        (she just looks at him)
                        There should be another cup in the 
                        bathroom.

                                 SUE
                        I actually have to get back to work.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh.
                        (pause)
                        What do you do?

                                 SUE
                        I sell paintings.

                                 MIKE
                        Really?  I love paintings.  What kind?

                                 SUE
                        Like that.

           She is pointing to a generic wall-hanging of hounds chasing a 
           fox.

                                 MIKE
                        Wow.  So you sell them to, like--?

                                 SUE
                        Companies, offices.  Hotels.

                                 MIKE
                        Nice.  So you’re in town doing that?
                        (she just nods)
                        For just tonight?

                                 SUE
                        I have presentations tomorrow, then fly 
                        out the next morning.

                                 MIKE
                        What’s the name of your company?  That 
                        you work for?

                                 SUE
                        I’m not really interested in this, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m just asking because I’ve been trying 
                        to convince my parents to buy some new 
                        art for this place.

           She takes this in, on its several levels...then hands him a 
           business card.

                                 SUE
                        It’s called Corporate Bliss.

                                 MIKE
                        (off the card)
                        Nice.  Maryland, huh?

                                 SUE
                        Yep.

                                 MIKE
                        Never been there.
                        (oause)
                        “Maryland Is For Lovers.”  Bumper 
                        sticker.

                                 SUE
                        Actually, Virginia is for lovers.
                        (pause)
                        Maryland is for crabs.

           Caught off guard, he then tries to recover.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh.  Right.

                                 SUE
                        (toward the door)
                        OK, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        So I should get back to work.

           She nods as she ushers him toward the door, but not before he 
           catches a glimpse of her open laptop.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        Solitaire.  Good game.

                                 SUE
                        Yes.

           He also notes her open suitcase on the bed:  Fanatically 
           folded clothes, pristinely organized transparent toiletry 
           bag...  At the door, he turns back, slightly more confidant.

                                 MIKE
                        So I’ll be in the office until 11, then 
                        up in my apartment but reachable by front-
                        door buzzer from then on.

                                 MIKE
                        In case you need a solitaire partner.

           She smiles and gently closes the door--

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        OK then, have a great night.

           EXT. MOTEL STAIRS - NIGHT

           Mike descends down the outdoor stairs in the crook of the L, 
           relatively satisfied with how that went.  When he reaches the 
           ground floor, he lights up a cigarette and smokes in quiet.

           INT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Mike’s car pulls into the lot and parks.  He quickly gets out 
           and goes around to help his Mom out the passenger side.  Her 
           perkiness is a touch suspect.

                                 TRISH
                        I’m not an invalid, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        No one said you were, Ma’.

           He holds her elbow as she walks toward the lobby, where 
           Jerry, monosyllabic as ever, opens the door to them.

                                 JERRY
                        How’d it go?

                                 TRISH
                        It went fine, Jerry.

           As Mike ushers her through the door, he steals a quick glance 
           up towards room 221, but the curtains are closed.

                                 TRISH (cont'd)

                        You know I love you, right?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

           And she heads inside.

           OMIT

           INT. FRONT DESK/LOBBY AREA - DUSK

           Mike sits at the desk reading National Geographic but keeping 
           an eye on the parking lot out front.  He reads....but his 
           attention is then diverted by the sound of a car door’s slam 
           out front.  He looks up to see Sue exiting a generic rental 
           car and heading for the stairs to the 2nd level.  Mike 
           watches, then checks his watch, then looks toward the back 
           room.  He calls back to his folks.

                                 MIKE 
                        Hey guys, you should go home early 
                        tonight, I can handle things!

                                 JERRY (O.S.)
                        After my show is over!

           Stumped for a moment, Mike thinks hard then heads for the 
           parking lot.

           EXT. MIKE’S CAR - DUSK

           Mike drives along the strip, then pulls into the lot of 
           FLAGSTAFF LIQUORS.

           INT. FLAGSTAFF LIQUORS - DUSK

           Mike studies the champagne choices.  He knows nothing about 
           champagne and is a little baffled by the prices;  to the 
           point where he surreptitiously peels the tag off a cheap 
           sparkling wine and switches it with that of a slightly-less-
           cheap champagne.

           INT. FRONT DESK/LOBBY AREA - NIGHT

           Mike reenters only find Sue at the front desk talking to his 
           Mom.  She is holding the now-empty wine bottle he gave her 
           last night.

                                 SUE
                        --and that’s when I realized that I don’t 
                        think your establishment has any type of 
                        recycling option, much less one for 
                        glassware alone.

                        I apologize for.  It’s something that 
                        we’re working on, but as you may know the 
                        Flagstaff metropolitan area has been a

                        official night manager.

           Mike can’t quite look Sue in the eye, but takes the bottle 
           from her anyway.

                                 SUE
                        Thank you.  It’s nice of you.

           INT. MIKE’S APARTMENT/ROOM - NIGHT

           Mike watches out the window as his parents get in their car 
           and head home for the night.  As they leave, he quickly grabs 
           the bottle of cheap champagne, peels off the extra cheap 
           price tag, gives himself a shot of Binaca Blast and puts on 
           one of his Dad’s old Fedoras.

           INT. ROOM 221 - THE MOTEL - NIGHT

           Sue sits up in bed watching TV and eating a vegetarian wrap.  
           After a moment there is a KNOCK on the door.  This time, she 
           is not entirely surprised.

                                 SUE
                        Isn’t that redundant?

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        I’m just doing my job, ma’am.

           Sue thinks...then stands and opens the door.  Mike, in his 
           fedora, holds the champagne and looks unsure of what to say.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        Bottle of champagne.

                                 SUE
                        Why?

                                 MIKE
                        We give it to our guests when they stay 
                        for two nights.

                                 SUE
                        That’s quite a good deal.  Did you and 
                        your mom come up with that on your own?

                                 MIKE
                        (no comeback)
                        ...Would you like me to open it for you?

                                 SUE
                        You don’t need a corkscrew to open 
                        champagne, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        I know, but...the fat cork can get kinda 
                        tricky sometimes.

                                 SUE
                        I’m sure it can.

                                 MIKE
                        ...So should I?

                                 SUE
                        Why not.

           He unwraps the foil as she retrieves bathroom cups;  she 
           comes back just as he POPS THE CORK.  It overflows a little 
           as he waits for her to unwrap the two cups;  he then pours.

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        (once they’re set)
                        So you gonna make a toast, Mike?

                                 MIKE
                        Sure.
                        (pause)
                        You’re Sue, right?

                                 SUE
                        Yeah.

                                 MIKE
                        I read it on the credit card imprint.

                                 SUE
                        Good to know.

                                 MIKE
                        Here’s to, um...people being happy.

                                 SUE
                        Are you happy?

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 MIKE
                        Absolutely.

           She just looks at him, too easy a target.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        Are you?

                                 SUE
                        (pause)
                        I’m happier than you, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        You think?

                                 SUE
                        I’m pretty sure.

                                 MIKE
                        ...You’re probably right.

           They clink cups and sip.  Mike looks for an upbeat.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        So how were your presentations today?

                                 SUE
                        Average.

           They stand in silence, slowly sipping.

                                 MIKE
                        (shy)
                        You have a great butt.
                        (she just looks at him)
                        I noticed it the moment you checked in.

                                 SUE
                        ...Thank you.

                                 MIKE
                        I hope that isn’t...

                                 SUE
                        No.  I mean...yes, but...

                                 MIKE
                        (genuine)
                        Thank you.

                                 SUE
                        You do this a lot, Mike?

           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 MIKE
                        No.

                                 SUE
                        Sometimes?

                                 MIKE
                        Very rarely.

                                 SUE
                        Does it work?

                                 MIKE
                        ...Never.

                                 SUE
                        What would constitute having it work?

                                 MIKE
                        Ah...I dunno;  you know...

                                 SUE
                        Us having sex?

                                 MIKE
                        (squeamish)
                        Umm...

                                 SUE
                        You getting to touch my ass?

                                 MIKE
                        That would...Yeah, I’d consider that--

                                 SUE
                        OK.  You can touch my ass but then you 
                        have to leave.

           Mike tries to discern whether she’s messing with him, 
           watching as she puts her champagne down, then sort of leans 
           with both palms onto the dresser, thus slightly exposing her 
           butt.  Mike looks at her, wondering if it’s a trap.

                                 MIKE
                        Are you serious?

                                 SUE
                        Yeah.  Touch it and go.  Touch and go, 
                        Mike.

           Slowly, he puts his champagne down, and gently, very lightly 
           cups her right buttock with his right hand.  He leaves it 
           there;  all is still.  Beat.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

                                 MIKE
                        So you’re from Maryland?

                                 SUE
                        Yeah.

                                 MIKE
                        Which part?

                                 SUE
                        Columbia.  What about you?

                                 MIKE
                        Here.  Flagstaff.
                        (pause)
                        It’s nice.  It’s very warm.

           They stand in silence.....and then:

                                 SUE
                        OK, Mike, I got an early plane tomorrow.

                                 MIKE
                        OK.

           She opens the door and shows him out.

                                 SUE
                        Bye now.

                                 MIKE
                        Bye.

           INT. BREAKFAST AREA - MOTEL - DAY

           The next morning and Mike is overseeing the complimentary 
           continental breakfast spread, at which 5 or 6 sleepy-looking 
           guests pick.  After a moment, Sue enters ready for business 
           in her pants-suit, her hair just-washed and pulled tight.  
           She heads for the coffee urn, disdainfully surveying the pre-
           packaged treats.

           Mike shyly slides over and, seeing that she’s got a to-go 
           cup, offers her a lid.

                                 MIKE
                        Hi, Sue.

                                 SUE
                        Hi.

           She’s not giving him much to work with.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MIKE
                        I was wondering if I could snag your cell 
                        phone number, or email or something, 
                        before you leave.

                                 SUE
                        (a look, and then:)
                        I don’t think so, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Why not?

                                 SUE
                        Not my style.

                                 MIKE
                        But we...you know, I touched your butt.

                                 SUE
                        I know, Mike, and it was nice, but I 
                        think that’s all she wrote.

           Mike stands there, shocked, as she heads for the door.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

           Mike, having sought refuge, stands by a dryer breathing deep, 
           pissed, bummed, confused.  The machines WHIRL LOUDLY.  After 
           several moments he looks up and sees Sue standing at the 
           door, holding the handle of her rolling suitcase.  She 
           watches him, then closes the door behind her and approaches.  
           He waits.  She is inches away, watching him, then she cups 
           her hands on his face and kisses him.  It ends;  she pulls 
           back, considering...and then she kisses him again.  This time 
           it is passionate, deep, generous and needy;  and it lasts, 
           soon becoming a tangle of hands and arms and legs seeking 
           legs.  Soon both their shirts are off, with both sets of 
           pants heading south.  It’s sloppy, chaotic and ultimately 
           kinda hot...sex as a contact sport full of uncoordinated lust 
           and deep emotional needs--all on the edge of a dryer.

           EXT. LAUNDRY ROOM - PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER

           The laundry room door opens onto the lot and Mike and Sue 
           exit, both showing the signs of their frivolity but trying 
           not to.  Standing right next to the door is Jerry, smoking 
           his morning cigarette.  Mike almost has a heart attack, as 
           Sue rolls her suitcase to the rental car, places it in the 
           trunk and opens the driver’s side door.  She attempts to give 
           Jerry a smooth smile.

                                 SUE
                        Thanks for the wonderful hospitality.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JERRY
                        You all checked out?

                                 SUE
                        Yeah, I did it with your wife.  Earlier.

           Jerry looks at her, then at Mike, who also forces a smile.

                                 MIKE
                        Come back and see us sometime.

                                 SUE
                        It all depends on work.

                                 MIKE
                        Right.

           She gets in the car and starts it up.  Mike just stares, 
           unable to believe she’s about to disappear from his life.  As 
           Sue’s car pulls out of the lot, she gives a little wave and a 
           honk...and then she’s gone.  Jerry turns to Mike.

                                 JERRY
                        What was that about?

                                 MIKE
                        (covering emotion)
                        What was what about?
                        (Jerry stares suspiciously)
                        She sells motel paintings.

           Jerry watches him, maybe throwing a glance towards the 
           laundry room as well, then stubs his cigarette and walks--

                                 JERRY
                        Whatever you say, Mike.

           Mike stays, looking at the empty road that Sue’s car just 
           drove away on.  It could almost make him cry.  And then:

                                 TRISH (O.S.)
                        Mike, the heat’s out in 118!

           INT. MIKE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Mike drives, listening to Van Halen.  He pulls into the lot 
           of a building on which a sign reads:  FLAGSTAFF KARATE.
           INT. FLAGSTAFF KARATE STUDIO - FLOOR - NIGHT

           Mike, in robe with yellow belt, stands among nine students, 
           all practicing their mae geri snap kick in front of a wall 
           mirror as a high-pitched instructor, sort of a Ritchie 
           Cunningham with a goatee, shouts at them to find their chi.  
           Mike, who is not particularly flexible or agile, is 
           nonetheless working out his anger and sadness with 
           significant chopping and kicking efforts.

           INT. FLAGSTAFF KARATE STUDIO - CORNER - NIGHT

           Behind a partition designating the men’s changing area, Mike 
           puts on street clothes next to a tall, lanky 24-year-old 
           computer expert named JED.  They both wear tighty-whitey’s.

                        Mike, brew tonight?

                                 MIKE
                        Not tonight, Jed.

                                 JED
                        Why not, you said last week we’d blow it 
                        out this week.

                                 MIKE
                        I know--

                                 JED
                        So what’s the deal?--I want us to puke.

                                 MIKE
                        Why?

                                 JED
                        ‘Cause I like puking, it’s like karate, 
                        it’s fucking cathartic.

                                 MIKE
                        I know, man, but I got some thinking to 
                        do tonight.

                                 JED
                        About what?

                                 MIKE
                        ...Gotta figure out what it’s all about.
           INT. MIKE’S APARTMENT/ROOM - NIGHT

           Mike looks out his window to the parking lot below:  Nothing 
           going on, a slow night at the motel.  He turns back into his 
           room and takes a swig out of a just-purchased bottle of Jack 
           Daniels.  He goes to his boom-box and cranks the volume on 
           the song already playing, so that we’re suddenly overwhelmed 
           and revved by the inspiring sounds of DEEPER SHADE OF SOUL, 
           by Urban Dance Squad.

           Mike allows the music to lead him to his closet, where he 
           unearths an old shoe box, from which he then digs out a 
           minutely folded, ancient-looking dollar bill.  He sits and 
           unfolds the bill until we glimpse its contents:  Some rather 
           grayish cocaine.  Mike smells it, winces; then tastes it to 
           see if its age has made it toxic;  it probably is but he’s 
           willing to risk it all, so he then tries snorting it straight 
           from the bill, which only partially works (he must lick off 
           the excess from his upper lip and chin).  He then uses a key 
           to scoop and snort more from the bill.  He is psyching 
           himself up, there is fury and passion to his recklessness. 

           He goes to an already-opened Yellow Pages and dials a number 
           from it on his phone, switching it to speaker mode.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (O.S.)
                        Thank you for calling Cheap Tickets, your 
                        call is important to us and will be 
                        answered in the order in which it was 
                        received.

           Mike takes this in stride, finding a long straw, which he 
           inserts into the Jack Daniels  bottle and takes long sips as 
           he makes his way to his chest of clothes, where he pulls a 
           wad of cash from a pile of underwear.  He’s already counted 
           it but he’s gonna count again to make sure.  He does this 
           quickly, mumbling to himself, then pockets the cash, glances 
           at the phone, glances at the Jack, then drum beats his head--

                                 MIKE
                        C’MON MIKE, NOW OR NEVER YOU FUCKING 
                        PUSSY, NOW OR NEVER!!!

           Mike hurtles himself at the phone, speaking at it before he 
           has the chance to change his mind--

                                 MIKE
                        Yes hi I’d like to book a one-way cash 
                        ticket from Phoenix to Baltimore for as

           Mike, eating a Taco Bell burrito, walking up to a small, two-
           story building in the middle of a perfectly suburban office 
           park.  He looks at the nameplates on the building’s facade, 
           one of which says, CORPORATE BLISS.  He enters--

           Walls adorned with many paintings of foxes and hounds.  Mike 
           approaches a 20-something blond RECEPTIONIST.

                                 MIKE
                        Hi, I’m here to see, ah, Sue Clemmons.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Is she expecting you?

                                 MIKE
                        I left a couple messages.

                        Regarding Sue.  Telling her I’m in town.
                        (pause)
                        I’m an old friend.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I see.

           As the receptionist starts to pick up the phone, Sue emerges 
           from within the office area, wearing her coat and accompanied 
           by two COLLEAGUES.  She sees Mike and her expression goes 
           from casual to shock to annoyance rather quickly, although 
           there’s possibly a glimmer of pleasure hidden in there as 
           well.

                                 SUE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MIKE
                        I was wondering if we could talk.

                                 SUE
                        Why are you here?

                                 MIKE
                        I called.  Twice.  Did you get the--?

                                 SUE
                        (to her colleagues)
                        Sorry about this.  You guys go ahead.

           “Awkward.”

                                 COLLEAGUE
                        You sure, Sue?

                                 SUE
                        Yeah, no problem, go.

           They look at Mike with some concern, then leave.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        You all right, Sue?

                                 SUE
                        I’m fine.

                        This is completely inappropriate.

                        It’s like a violation.

                                 MIKE

                        Well you did, OK?  You are.  You’re 
                        violating my personal space and you’re 
                        violating my personal life.  I’ve got 
                        half a mind to call the police.

                                 MIKE
                        Please don’t do that.

                        It’s five o’clock.

                                 SUE
                        I know.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - DUSK

           Sue, Mike and six women in their 20’s play an intense, no-
           nonsense game of indoor soccer.  The women are great, Sue is 
           pretty good and Mike, playing in his brown work shoes and 
           borrowed (tight) Umbro shorts, sucks air, tries his damndest 
           and is exhilarated just to be there.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - BLEACHERS - LATER

           Mike sits alone, sweating, alive, sucking on a cigarette.  
           After a moment Sue approaches to sip from her Gatorade.

                                 MIKE
                        This is great, you do it every week?

                                 SUE
                        Yeah.

                                 MIKE
                        You’re really good.

                                 SUE

                        met.

           They both look at her left leg, which has a large birthmark 
           in a strange, unidentifiable shape.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        It looks like a heart.

                                 SUE
                        No it doesn’t.

                        It was more than just an ass-touch.

           She’s forced to concede this.

                                 SUE
                        You still can’t stay.

                        I’ve got things to do.

                        I do a lot of stuff.  It may not be 
                        “interesting,” but I do it.

                                 MIKE
                        Like what?  Do you go out with friends?

                                 SUE
                        I don’t have friends, Mike.

                        ...OK.  So what do you do?

                                 SUE 
                        I pass out vouchers.  See that girl over 
                        there?  She works for Burger King.

                                 MIKE
                        OK.

                                 SUE
                        And she gives me vouchers every week.  
                        Which I pass out.

           Mike looks over to where one of the 20-something’s juggles a 
           ball with her feet.  He looks back at Sue...utterly honest:

                        you.  Ever.  And I’ll leave tomorrow if 
                        you want.  I promise.

           Sue looks at him, his genuine sweetness undeniable...and 
           seems a little less annoyed.

           INT. SUE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Sue drives, Mike in the passenger seat.

                                 MIKE
                        Is this a--?

                                 SUE
                        Prius.
                        (pause)
                        I also give away 30 percent of my yearly 
                        income.

           He nods as she pulls to a side street near Baltimore’s train 
           station.  She gets out;  Mike follows.  

           EXT. HEATING GRATE - TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

           Sue approaches a small enclave of HOMELESS MEN lying across a 
           heat grate.  A voice calls out warily.

                                 HOMELESS VOICE
                        Sue’s here.

           The homeless men all sit up, not in unison but close.  Sue is 
           not the warm, beloved Mother Teresa type, but she does her 
           thing and she does it well.

                                 SUE
                        Whoppers?

           Several men raise their hands and she hands them Burger King 
           Whopper vouchers.

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        Chicken Tenders?

           Several other men raise, and she hands out more.

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        The new Veggie burger?  Supposed to be 
                        very good.
                        (no hands go up)

                        C’mon you guys, it’s the only thing 
                        that’s not gonna cause an immediate heart 
                        attack.

           One guy raises his hand and she dispenses.

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        Mike?

           Mike, still in his tight Umbros, now dutifully hands out 
           Gatorades leftover from practice.  The homeless men nod their 
           thanks.

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        OK then.

                                 HOMELESS VOICE
                        Thanks, Sue.

           She turns and leaves.  Mike follows.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - SUE’S CONDO - NIGHT

           Sue and Mike get out of her car in front of a line of 
           recently-built suburban “townhouses” in what is essentially, 
           if not technically, a gated condo complex.  Both are nervous 
           as they approach her entrance.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s nice.

                                 SUE
                        Thanks.  Been here two years.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SUE’S CONDO - NIGHT

           They enter;  Sue turns on a light and we see a fairly small 
           one-bedroom unit, the wall-to-wall carpet fastidiously 
           vacuumed, the kitchen area immaculate, trinkets and framed 
           photos arranged perfectly on a side table.  It’s nice but 
           she’s about 10 years shy of being a spinster.  She turns to 
           him:

                                 SUE
                        I’m too tired to make love.

                                 MIKE
                        OK.  Me too.  The soccer wore me out.
                        (pause; light)
                        You want me to touch your butt?

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SUE
                        No.
                        (small smile)
                        I only do that when I’m travelling.

           She turns on a light switch.

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        (re: the light source)
                        Compact florescent.
                        (he nods)
                        Yoga nook.

           She is pointing to some pillows arranged near a window.

                                 MIKE
                        (again nodding)
                        ...So do you have relatives around here?

                                 SUE
                        My Mom.  Over in Laurel.

           She sees Mike glance at a photo of an older woman wearing 
           nylon and a plastic smile.

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        Her name’s Mary.  She’s a freak.

                                 MIKE
                        What does she do?

                                 SUE
                        Sells insurance to deaf people.

                                 MIKE 
                        ...Who else do you hang out with?

                                 SUE
                        I’m busy, Mike, I work.

                                 MIKE
                        Right.

                                 SUE
                        (not cold, just rational:)
                        You can sleep on the couch.

                                 MIKE 
                        (summoning courage)
                        I was wondering if I...could sleep in 
                        your bed but promise not to touch you.

           INT. BEDROOM - SUE’S CONDO - DAY

           Mike and Sue lie side-by-side beneath covers.  Mike is awake, 
           watching Sue sleep.  Sun shines in through a window.  After a 
           moment he spots some breath mints on the bedside table.  He 
           furtively pops one, then leans over and kisses Sue forehead.  
           He looks at her for a reaction;  there is none.  He then 
           leans and kisses her cheek;  still nothing.  And now her 
           lips, very gently.  Far from a smooth operator, he’s making 
           it up as he goes along.  He kisses her lips again.  And 
           then....her lips reciprocate.  She’s kissing him back, eyes 
           still closed, and yet we realize she’s awake, consenting and 
           they’re on their way to making love.

           INT. BREAKFAST NOOK - SUE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Sue and Mike sit side-by-side sipping orange juice and 
           nibbling very dark, German spelt bread.  Beat.

                                 SUE
                        So is your return ticket all set?

                                 MIKE
                        ...I don’t actually have one.

                                 SUE
                        (incredulity)
                        You don’t have a return ticket?

                                 MIKE
                        I bought a one-way.

                                 SUE
                        Why?

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know.

                                 SUE
                        That’s unacceptable, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        I know--

                                 SUE
                        You need to buy one--

                        (pause)
                        I don’t have enough money.

                                 SUE

                                 MIKE
                        I only had enough for a one-way.  I 
                        thought I would just...go for it.

                                 SUE
                        With me?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.  It was a far-flung notion.

                                 SUE
                        It was a fucking stupid notion.

                                 MIKE
                        I guess.

                                 SUE
                        I’ll lend you money.

                        (pause)
                        Would you first consider taking the 
                        morning off?  From work?

                                 SUE
                        No.

                                 MIKE
                        We can hang out.  Then I’ll leave.  I 
                        swear to God.  If I don’t you can mace 
                        me.

                                 SUE
                        You’re fucking insane--

                        We’ll go to the zoo or something.  It’ll

                        Jango.  He’s a punk.  Ex-punk.

                        Oh.  So do you still hang out with him?

                                 SUE 
                        He moved away.  Last month.

                                 MIKE
                        Did he want you to go with him?

           EXT. BUMPER CARS - AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY

           Sue and Mike squushed into a bumper-car, going nuts at a 
           relatively empty bumper-car arena, the only other drivers 
           being disenchanted high school drop-outs, with whom they are 
           having a riotous time.

           As the ride ends, Sue turns to him breathlessly and he 
           engulfs her with a protective, laughing hug.

           INT. AMUSEMENT PARK - GROUNDS - DAY

           Sue and Mike stroll through the empty amusement park sipping 
           milk shakes.  The conversation takes time to pick up.

                        (she looks at him like he’s an

                        Like things that you’re scared of.

                                 SUE
                        I don’t have fears, Mike.

                        I have no desire to parachute.

                                 MIKE
                        It scares you?

                        Immensely.

                        (pause)
                        How about kids?

                                 SUE
                        What about them?

                                 MIKE
                        Do you want ‘em?
                        (no answer)
                        Sue?

                                 SUE
                        ...Yes.

                                 MIKE
                        Me to.  I think.

           They walk;  she stops, turns to him:

                                 SUE 
                        Why are you even here, Mike?  I mean, do 
                        you think you, like, ”like” me or 
                        something?

                                 MIKE
                        Yes.

                                 SUE
                        Why?

                                 MIKE
                        You have style.

                                 SUE
                        No I don’t.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah you do.

                                 SUE
                        You’re wrong--

                                 MIKE
                        You give away 30 percent of your income.

                                 SUE
                        You would too if you made more.

                        (pause)
                        You’re also incredibly sweet.  Beneath...

                        Beneath what?

                        Beneath the part of you that’s not.

           She looks at him.  Beat.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        Is your Dad still around?

                                 SUE
                        Why do you ask?

                                 MIKE
                        ‘Cause you only mentioned your mom.

                                 SUE
                        ...He lives on an ashram in northern

                                 MIKE
                        Is he, like...a hippie?

                                 SUE
                        I guess before I was born.  But it’s a 
                        fine line between that and a self-
                        obsessed dick.

                                 MIKE
                        Meaning what, he was---?

                                 SUE
                        Mellow to the point of apathy.  Hands-off 
                        to the point of...

                                 MIKE
                        Absence?

                                 SUE
                        Yeah.

           She looks him in the eye;  then looks away.

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        You should catch your bus.

           EXT. BUS STATION - BALTIMORE - DAY

           Mike and Sue stand by the bus.  He’s about to get in.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll pay you back for the ticket.

                                 SUE
                        Don’t worry about it.

                                 MIKE
                        Do you think I’ll ever see you again?

                                 SUE
                        No.
                        (he is speechless)
                        We’re not right for each other, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        But--

                                 SUE
                        You live two-thousand miles away.
                        (pause)
                        With your parents.  At a motel.

                                 MIKE
                        You’re being a jerk.

                                 BUS DRIVER (O.S.)
                        OK, buddy, all aboard.

           Mike looks to the driver, who sits in the idling bus.  Mike 
           and Sue regard each other.  She speaks very quietly:

                                 SUE
                        I wouldn’t be good for you anyway.

                                 MIKE
                        Why not?

                                 SUE
                        I’m not good with people.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s not true--

                                 SUE
                        Yeah it is--

                        No--those homeless guys love you.
                        (no answer)
                        And what about the ex-punk guy?  And what 
                        about me?

                                 SUE
                        I think, Mike...
                        (pause)
                        ...that you better get on.

           She offers her hand, not meanly, but rather because it’s all 
           she can really do.  He shakes it goodbye, then climbs on 
           board.  She walks down to the window where Mike takes his 
           seat.  They watch each other as the bus engines rev up.  It’s 
           like something out of Casablanca, with Mike close to tears 
           and Sue suppressing emotions with a tight, forced grimace.  
           As the bus pulls away, Mike can barely lift his arm up to 
           wave goodbye through the window.

           Mike’s POV:  Sue standing alone, stoically waving back.

                                                           FADE TO:

           INT. FRONT DESK/LOBBY AREA - MOTEL - DAY

           Mike sits behind the front desk reading Sport Illustrated.  
           After a moment, MARISSA, the 25-year-old Latina motel maid 
           enters carrying a pile of clean towels.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, Marissa.  102’s asked me if you 
                        could do their room by noon.

                                 MARISSA
                        Why?

                                 MIKE
                        Ah, ‘cause they’re coming back then and 
                        they wanna take a nap.

                                 MARISSA
                        (exiting)
                        Whatever you say, Mike.

           Mike, perplexed by her attitude, watches her go.  Then Jerry 
           walks in.  Mike’s eyes follow him as he essentially ignores 
           Mike.  Finally:

                                 MIKE
                        Hi, Dad.

                                 JERRY
                        Hi.

                                 MIKE
                        Everything OK?

                                 JERRY
                        Yep.

                                 MIKE
                        Where’s Ma?

                                 JERRY
                        Hardware store.

                                 MIKE
                        I got an appointment at 3 today.  Just so 
                        you remember I won’t be--

                                 JERRY
                        I got you.

           And with that he’s gone, into the back room.  Mike looks 
           after him, then looks out front to see if the coast is clear.  
           He then looks at his watch, puts down his magazine and 
           determinedly picks up the phone.  He dials and waits...

                                 MIKE
                        Ah, hey, Sue, it’s Mike again, trying not 
                        to call too much but I just wanted to 
                        make sure you got the poem I sent last 
                        week.  The, ah, the sorta elongated haiku 
                        thing.
                        (glancing around nervously)
                        Anyway, you know my home number, or of 
                        course the front desk.  Seriously though, 
                        you should give a call, ‘cause I’m 
                        definitely around.
                        (as Marissa enters--)
                        Anyway...talk to you soon;  I hope.  Bye.

           Marissa walks by, staring at him as he hangs up embarrassed 
           and pissed at himself.  She leaves as Mike’s attention is 
           suddenly diverted by something out in the parking lot:  His 
           POV on his Mom near the entrance to the lot, standing with 
           eyes closed as though trying to regain her balance.  He 
           quickly gets up--

           EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - SAME

           Mike hurries over to where Trish is still trying to regain 
           composure--

           He takes her elbow and ushers her toward the lobby--

                        I’m fine, I just got disoriented--

                        I know it’s OK, it’s just the medicine.

                                 MIKE
                        Next time send me or Dad to the store--

                                 TRISH
                        I wanted the exercise.

                                 MIKE
                        Well then let one of us go with you.

                                 TRISH
                        I’m OK now, let go of me, Mike.

           He lets go, watching as she walks on her own--

                                 TRISH (cont'd)
                        These bushes need to be trimmed.

                        I know, Ma, it’s on my list.

           INT. MIKE’S APARTMENT/ROOM - NIGHT

           Mike at his Casio piano stumbling through the chord 
           progression of Neil Young’s Keep on Rockin’ in the Free 
           World. After a moment he stops, lost in thought, then stands.

           EXT. MOTEL BALCONY/WALKWAY - NIGHT

           Mike, hair combed badly, in a wrinkled Oxford, KNOCKS on the 
           door to room 209.  He’s holding a bottle of wine.

           The door is opened by a 30-SOMETHING WOMAN whose demeanor is 
           perhaps warmer than Sue’s but who is far less willing to 
           tolerate Mike’s oddness.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m Mike, from management, and I have a 
                        complimentary welcome gift for you.

                        What is it?

                                 MIKE
                        Wine.

                        I don’t drink.

                                 MIKE
                        ...Would you like some seltzer?

                                 30-SOMETHING WOMAN
                        No.

                                 MIKE
                        Fruit?

                                 30-SOMETHING WOMAN
                        I’m really very busy.

                                 MIKE
                        (pause)
                        Do you like Neil Young?

                                 30-SOMETHING WOMAN
                        Please leave me alone.

           She slams the door.  Off Mike, alone--
           EXT. MIKE’S CAR - DAY

           Mike’s car pulls up to a small house on a residential street.  
           He parks and gets out, and as he walks up the front path 
           Jerry emerges from the house to meet him.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey.

                                 JERRY
                        Hi.

                                 MIKE
                        How is she?

                                 JERRY
                        I’ve seen her better.

           Mike looks to his Dad for more, but, Jerry being Jerry, there 
           is none.  Beat.

                                 MIKE
                        How’re you doing?

                                 JERRY
                        I’m not the sick one.

                                 MIKE
                        I know, but...

                                 JERRY
                        But what?

                                 MIKE
                        Nothing.

           They stand, staring at the houses across the street.

                                 JERRY
                        You know, I’ve seen my share of people 
                        leave this earth...

                                 MIKE
                        She’s not leaving, Dad.

                                 JERRY
                        (a pause to ignore)
                        I’ve seen my share of folks leave, and 
                        it’s ugly every time, which after a while 
                        ....makes you wonder.

           Pause.  Mike tries to put his hand on Jerry’s shoulder, but 
           Jerry turns and walks back inside.
           INT. BEDROOM - JERRY AND TRISH’S HOUSE - DAY

           Mike stands at his Mom’s bedside.  She is quite weakened but 
           still has the remnants of her vitality. 

                                 MIKE
                        How’re you doin’, Ma?

                                 TRISH
                        Don't pity me, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not.

                                 TRISH
                        Good.

                                 MIKE
                        So does that mean you’re good?

                                 TRISH
                        I’m fine.  Just feeling a little weak.

                                 MIKE
                        You have bone cancer, Mom.

                                 TRISH
                        Everyone’s got bone cancer, Michael.

           He’s not sure how to respond to this one, so he doesn’t.

                                 TRISH (cont'd)
                        How’s the motel?

                                 MIKE
                        It’s fine.

                                 TRISH
                        How’s the weekend looking?

                                 MIKE
                        Pretty good.  There’s a flower convention 
                        downtown, so...

                                 TRISH
                        Good.

                                 MIKE
                        ...You know that appointment I’ve been 
                        doing for the last three Wednesday’s, 
                        that I didn’t wanna tell you about?

                        Hmm hmm.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s piano.  I’m taking piano lessons;  
                        from this kid over at the university.

                                 TRISH
                        (a slow smile)
                        Really?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 TRISH
                        That’s wonderful, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        I like it.

                                 TRISH
                        I bet you’re good at it.

                                 MIKE
                        Not really, but--

                                 TRISH
                        Yes you are.  And if you’re not, you will 
                        be.  Do you practice?

                                 MIKE
                        A bit.  In my room.

                                 TRISH
                        Good.  Good for you.

           He stands by her in silence a moment.

                                 MIKE
                        Is there anything I can get you?

                                 TRISH
                        I’ll take some of those flowers when the 
                        weekend rolls around.

                                 MIKE
                        OK.

                                 TRISH
                        And try an’ cheer your father up.  He’s 
                        not very good with stress.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll try.

           She looks at him lovingly, and pats down a particularly 
           unsettled strand of his hair.

                                 TRISH
                        You’re a good son, Mike.

           EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - DUSK

           Mike stands alone in the lot smoking a cigarette, lost in 
           thought.  After a several moments, a generic rental car pulls 
           in and parks.  Mike looks up as Sue gets out.  She looks at 
           him.  He stares back.

                                 SUE
                        I thought you were gonna quit smoking.

                                 MIKE
                        I did.

                                 SUE
                        But not forever?

                                 MIKE
                        ...What are you doing here?

                                 SUE
                        Work.

           He takes this in as she takes a suitcase from the trunk.

                                 MIKE
                        Did you get my haiku?

                                 SUE
                        The elongated one?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 SUE
                        Yes.

                                 MIKE
                        How come you didn’t call me back?

                                 SUE
                        I’ve been busy.

           She walks up to him, suitcase in tow.

                                 MIKE
                        ...I’m glad you chose to stay here.

                                 SUE
                        Me too.

           She looks at him...and can’t help but smile.  She kisses him 
           softly on the lips, but just once.

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        I’d like a room for the night, please.

           INT. FLAGSTAFF KARATE STUDIO - NIGHT

           Mike and Sue, both in robes, face the mirror amidst the rest 
           of Mike’s perennially desultory karate class.  Mike sneaks a 
           look to her in the mirror, and she actually seems to be 
           enjoying herself, until the moment she sees him looking and 
           acts put upon.  He then catches Jed’s eye, who gives him an 
           enormous thumbs up.

           INT. FLAGSTAFF FOO-YUNG - DAY

           Mike and Sue sit at his corner table enjoying steaming soups.

                                 MIKE
                        So you’re really out here for work?

                                 SUE
                        What, you think I’m lying?

                                 MIKE
                        No.  I mean...it would be nice if you 
                        were, but--

                                 SUE
                        If I were lying?

                                 MIKE
                        No, if you were...here to see me.  Also.

                                 SUE
                        It’s complicated.

                                 MIKE

                        Not really.

                        You should quit.

                        most full service soup kitchen.  In 
                        Stamford, Connecticut.  

                                 MIKE 
                        Wow.

                                 SUE
                        Industrial-sized kitchen, state-of-the-
                        art equipment, multiple housing units 
                        upstairs, recreational facilities in the 
                        basement, 24-hour-a-day medical 
                        assistance, job out-reach, anti-
                        recidivist counselors, psychiatric 
                        counselling, midnight basketball--

                                 MIKE
                        Really good soup.

                                 SUE
                        Yes.  Excellent soup.  First and 
                        foremost.

                                 MIKE
                        Why Stamford?

                                 SUE
                        I was once there on business and I saw 
                        some incredibly poor people and I didn’t 
                        know how to help them.

                                 MIKE
                        ...What about your B.K. vouchers?

                                 SUE
                        I had them but they’re only redeemable in 
                        Maryland.
                        (re: her soup)
                        This is actually quite good.

           He nods;  they both sip.  And then:

                                 MIKE
                        Would you, if I asked you...would you 
                        visit my Mom with me?

           INT. BEDROOM - JERRY AND TRISH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mike and Sue stand at Trish’s bedside.  She is considerably 
           weaker.  Sue holds out a bouquet of flowers.

                                 SUE
                        These are for you.  I guess there’s a big 
                        flower convention coming to town so 
                        stores are really stocking up.

                                 TRISH
                        That’s nice of you.

                                 MIKE
                        Sue flew in from Baltimore just this 
                        afternoon.

                                 SUE
                        I was actually in St. Louis last night.

                                 TRISH
                        What do you do, Sue?

                                 SUE
                        I sell corporate decorative art.

           This elicits an utterly blank stare from Trish.

                                 TRISH
                        (pause)
                        I’ve met you before.

                                 MIKE
                        She actually once stayed at the motel, 
                        Mom.  That’s how we met.

           This time Trish’s stare is mixed with suspicion.

                                 TRISH
                        Oh.
                        (a forced smile)
                        And where are you from.  Originally?

                                 SUE
                        Columbia, Maryland.

                                 MIKE
                        Sue gives away thirty per cent of her 
                        income, Ma’.

                                 TRISH
                        ...Do you come from a good family?

           Mike looks nervously from Trish to Sue.

                                 SUE 
                        Not really.

                                 SUE
                        I don’t know.  You can’t really control 
                        the cookie crumble, can you?

                                 TRISH
                        ...Was there something specifically wrong 
                        with your family?

                        My Dad’s name is Dennis.  He has the 
                        integrity of wet bread.  He once forgot 
                        to pick me up from gymnastics for an 
                        entire night.

                                 TRISH
                        That’s a lot of somersaults.

                                 SUE
                        I didn’t really care.  It doesn’t 
                        “explain” me.  It more just explains 
                        Dennis.

                                 MIKE
                        Tell her about your Mom.

                                 SUE
                        She used to wear sarongs.  Now she wears 
                        nylon.
                        (pause)
                        Your son is funny.  In a good way.

           Trish regards Sue with a long look.  Then:

                                 TRISH 
                        You’re a little odd, no?

                                 SUE
                        I’m actually too normal.

           Trish nods, as if to say, “Keep telling yourself that.”

                                 TRISH 
                        Can you hand me those pills, Mike?

           Mike hands her pills from a bedside table, and she slowly 
           opens and takes one, washing it down with water.  To Sue:

                        moment?

           Sue glances at Mike, who nods apologetically.  Sue leaves.

                                 TRISH
                        I like her.

                                 MIKE
                        Really?

                                 TRISH
                        She’s logical, in an emotionally-
                        annihilated kind of way.  But that’s OK.  
                        Underneath that there’s a heart of.... 

                                 MIKE
                        Gold?

                                 TRISH
                        No, I wouldn’t say gold, but there is a 
                        heart.  Maybe made of leather.  But nice 
                        leather.  High quality, durable, probably 
                        very soft;  over time.

           Mike looks pleased.

                                 TRISH (cont'd)
                        She’ll be good for you when I’m gone.  If 
                        you can keep her.

                                 MIKE
                        Ma’, don’t talk like--

                                 TRISH
                        Stop whining, Michael, I’m on my way out 
                        and we all know it.  Needless to say, 
                        what would make me happy is for you to 
                        find a little something for yourself 
                        before my check-out time, just so I know 
                        it’s not you and your father alone here 
                        walking around like robots.

                                 MIKE
                        Dad’s not a robot, Ma’.

                                 TRISH
                        Sure he is, but I was more talking about 
                        you.  Unless you find something to...lift 
                        yourself out.

                        Of whatever it is you’re stuck in.

                                 TRISH
                        You get it from your father.  That’s what 
                        I’m saying.  It’s his legacy;  handed 
                        down.  He came back from the war...stuck.  
                        Been talkin’ about joining a gym ever 
                        since.  Never has.  But that doesn’t have 
                        to be you.
                        (beat;  Mike has no answer)
                        Give your mother a kiss.

                        Because I want you to.

           Mike leans over and kisses her on the cheek.

                        I know.  But just in case I forget to do

                        It doesn’t matter anyway.

           Mike decides to ignore this as Sue resignedly stares out the

                        I’m just saying, if your Dad was hands-
                        off, then maybe you dated an older punk 
                        guy because he was more...

                        think he’s very...comfortable.  In life.

                                 SUE
                        That’s not a good feeling.

                                 MIKE
                        No.  He was in Vietnam, and my Mom 
                        sometimes says that it really messed him 
                        up, but everybody says that about Vietnam 
                        guys.

                                 SUE
                        Probably ‘cause it’s true.
                        (pause)
                        What kind of stuff did he do over there?

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t really know.  I think he was like 
                        one of those gunners.  In a helicopter.
                        (beat)
                        My mom says he came back without balance.
                        (pause)
                        Maybe it messed us all up.

           Sue nods and looks out the window, as Mike drives in silence, 
           pulling into the motel’s parking lot.

       A59
           INT. FRONT DESK/LOBBY AREA - NIGHT
                                                                 A59

           Mike and Sue enter.  Jerry, who’s been listening to the radio 
           behind the front desk, stands to go.

                                 JERRY
                        You hear?

                                 MIKE
                        Hear what?

                                 JERRY
                        Terrorist bombing in Reykjavik.
           INT. ROOM 221 - THE MOTEL - NIGHT

           Mike and Sue sit up in bed eating from a tub of Breyer’s ice 
           cream and watching TV images of a bombed-out resort hotel in 
           Iceland’s capital.  We catch glimpses of some of the 
           destruction and human suffering, which is brutal.  After 
           several moments, Mike mutes the sound.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s all so messed up.

           Silence a moment, and then:

                                 SUE
                        Whenever I see this kind of stuff, it’s 
                        like I have to remind myself to just 
                        breathe.  Like I literally have to 
                        instruct my heart to request additional 
                        air.  I just tell myself--
                        (doing it, eyes closed)
                        Breath, Sue.  Just keep breathing...

           After several more seconds she slowly opening her eyes...

                                 MIKE
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 SUE
                        Sure.

                                 MIKE
                        Why’d you let me touch your butt that 
                        time?  I mean...why’d you even have the 
                        idea?

                                 SUE
                        (pause)
                        Because normal sex sucks, Mike.  Right?  
                        Not always, but often.  At least for some 
                        of us.  Normal sex sucks.

           Mike absorbs this...then sort of just nods.  Then he gently 
           takes her hand in his... Beat.

                                 MIKE
                        Do you like Neil Young?

                                 SUE
                        (pause)
                        I do, actually.

           He smiles...as they sit, eating ice cream, watching the muted 
           images of destruction on TV...
           INT. FRONT DESK/LOBBY AREA - DAY

           Mike tidies the front desk, having already set up the 
           breakfast area.  After a moment Sue enters from outside, 
           showered, dressed for business, suitcase in tow.  She gives a 
           small smile.

                                 SUE
                        Checking out of 221.

                                 MIKE
                        You’re really leaving?

                                 SUE
                        I have to.

                                 MIKE
                        Can’t do one more night?

                                 SUE
                        I’ve got meetings in Seattle this 
                        afternoon.

                                 MIKE
                        Blow ‘em off.  Stay for awhile.

                                 SUE
                        (not mean, just rational)
                        I don’t understand where you think this 
                        is going, Mike.  Are you thinking I’m 
                        gonna move from Baltimore to live in the 
                        corner double-room of your parents’ 
                        motel?
                        (no answer)
                        Because if you are, I think you should 
                        think again.

           He looks at her, but before he can answer, two 20-something, 
           fat, meathead, DICKS emerge from the breakfast area.

                                 DICK #1
                        We ain’t paying for our room.

                                 MIKE
                        Is there a problem, sir?

                                 DICK #2
                        You all got mice.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry?

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                        You got mice infestation.

                                 MIKE
                        Where?

                                 DICK #2
                        In your rooms.

                                 MIKE
                        You saw a mouse?--

                                 DICK #1
                        Yeah--we saw a mouse plus I saw like 10 
                        mouse poop pellets in the bathroom.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry for the inconvenience, sir--

                                 DICK #2
                        Fuck that, we’re not paying for the room.

           Mike, aware that Sue is watching, tries to stay strong.

                                 MIKE
                        Well I’m sorry but that’s not how our 
                        policy works--

                                 DICK #1
                        We don’t care about your policy, we’re 
                        not paying for your shitty little room.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll tell you what I’ll do, I’ll give you 
                        a voucher for half-price next time you--

                                 DICK #1
                        (in Mike’s face)
                        Fuck you.  Gimme the thing I signed.

                                 MIKE
                        ...No.

                                 DICK #1
                        (grabbing Mike’s shirt)
                        You think I’m messing around?--Gimme the 
                        fucking thing!

                                 SUE
                        Excuse me, this is not how you solve 
                        problems--

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 DICK #2
                        Shut up, bitch, go make some coffee.

           Dick #1, finding this hilarious, slams Mike’s face into the 
           front desk counter--

                                 DICK #1
                        I’m gonna count to three, fucker:  One 
                        Two Three!--

           He reaches for a pile of papers behind the counter and starts 
           going through it, throwing each to the floor until he comes 
           to his room form--

                                 DICK #1 (cont'd)
                        BINGO!

                                 SUE
                        STOP IT!--

           Sue steps forward to intervene but Dick #2 roughly cuts her 
           off with his large, hairy arm.  Mike, blood trickling from 
           his nose, can only watch as Dick #1 gleefully pockets the 
           form and the dicks now head for the door--

                                 DICK #1 
                        Call the fucking exterminator you loser!

           They laughingly head outside.  Mike helplessly watches and 
           Sue goes to the door, yelling as they get into their pick-up.

                                 SUE
                        YOU GUYS ARE ASSHOLES!!

                                 DICK #2
                        THAT’S RIGHT, AND YOU’RE A BITCH WITH 
                        SHITTY CLOTHES!

                                 SUE
                        FUCK YOU!

           But the Dicks simply flip her the bird as they peel out of 
           the lot...   Sue turns back into the lobby.

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        You OK?

                                 MIKE
                        (more embarrassed than hurt)
                        I’m fine.

                                 SUE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 MIKE
                        It happens sometimes.

           He cleans his nose and straightens up the papers...

                                 SUE
                        I’m sorry I’m going.

           He keeps cleaning, not answering, as an elderly couple enters 
           and heads for the breakfast nook.....

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        I’ll stay in better touch this time?

                                 MIKE
                        Whatever you say.

                                 SUE
                        Mike--

                                 MIKE
                        I have to attend to the fruit bowl.
                        (extends his hand formally)
                        It was nice to see you again.

                                 SUE
                        Don’t be like this.

           But Mike stands, hand out, waiting.  She reluctantly shakes 
           and he turns and walks to the breakfast area, leaving her 
           there with her suitcase.  Her POV on Mike tidying the fruit 
           bowl, trying not to bleed on the bananas.  His hair is 
           tousled, his shirt untucked.  She watches...

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        I could love you.

           She’s spoken loud enough that the elderly couple takes 
           notice.  They watch attentively, awaiting his response.

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        Mike?

           He stops with the fruit, blood again trickling from his nose, 
           but still doesn’t answer.  Silence.  After a moment, Sue 
           turns and leaves, suitcase in tow.

                                                           FADE TO:
           INT. FRONT DESK/LOBBY AREA - DAY

           A Latino PRIEST with a thick accent concludes a prayer;  next 
           to him, in the breakfast nook, is a beautifully adorned and 
           petal-strewn table with a large, hand-painted ceramic vase 
           resting atop.  An enormous color photo of Trish, in much more 
           vital and alive times, stands on a nearby easel, as Mike, 
           Jerry, Marissa and a small crowd of other mourners sit on 
           folding chairs, listening, with Mike and Jerry front-center.

                                 PRIEST
                        And just at the moment when someone at my 
                        side says, "There, she is gone!"  There 
                        are other eyes watching her coming, and 
                        other voices ready to take up the glad 
                        shout:  "Here she comes!"
                        (pause)
                        And that is dying.

           Mike dries his eyes a little, as Jerry just stares at the 
           vase, which is now delicately picked up by the priest and 
           gracefully offered to Mike and Jerry.  Jerry remains lost in 
           thought, so Mike accepts.

           EXT. STRETCH OF DIMINISHING DESERT - DAY

           Mike and Jerry, still in their black funeral suits, stand on 
           this stretch of land, with cacti, sand and a not-so-distant 
           row of Port-O-Potties, which border a construction site where 
           a gated community is rapidly going up.  As Mike holds the 
           vase, they silently gaze at the horizon....

                                 MIKE
                        So this is where she wanted?

                                 JERRY
                        (nodding)
                        This used to be all desert.  She’d be 
                        cringing right now if she knew they were 
                        building here, but...I promised her I’d 
                        do it.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s still nice.  The sand and rock.  
                        She’ll become part of the.......earth.

           Jerry nods, then slowly takes a handful of Trish from the 
           vase.  He holds it near his mouth and sort of kisses it, then 
           walks a few steps forward, letting the ash slip from his 
           hands.  Mike places down the vase and does the same.  It is a 
           lovely image, these two grown men, mostly on the inarticulate 
           side, quietly spreading their articulate loved one across the 
           desert floor.

           CONTINUED:

           But after that first handful, they’re not quite sure what to 
           do with the ash remnant on their hands.  Jerry discreetly 
           wipes it on his pants leg.  He then carefully takes from his 
           pocket two delicate-looking necklaces.

                                 JERRY
                        Meant to give these to you earlier.  
                        They’re your mom’s favorite two pieces of 
                        jewelry.  As you know, she was a necklace 
                        woman.

           He hands them to Mike, who lets each one dangle from a hand.

                                 JERRY (cont'd)
                        (re: the first)
                        You ask me, that one’s kinda tacky, but 
                        she loved the hell outta it.  And God 
                        knows it costs a lot.  The other one’s 
                        the one I like.  Happens to be on the 
                        cheaper side, but that’s not why.

                                 MIKE
                        They’re nice.

                                 JERRY
                        I thought you should have ‘em.  Not sure 
                        why, ‘cause I wouldn’t want you to start 
                        wearing ‘em, but...I thought you might 
                        enjoy.

                                 MIKE
                        Thanks, Dad.

           Jerry nods;  beat.

                                 JERRY
                        I also had some guy call me wantin’ to 
                        buy the motel.

                                 MIKE
                        ...To buy our motel?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah.

                                 MIKE
                        ...You gonna do it?

                                 JERRY
                        No.

           Jerry looks at him...

                                 JERRY
                        Might as well keep runnin’ it.
                        (pause)
                        But you can do what you want, Mike.  I 
                        won’t be hurt if you leave.

           Jerry reaches for another handful of ash, then slowly walks 
           away to have a moment on his own.  Mike also takes another 
           handful...but instead decides to put it in his coat pocket.  
           He then just stands, watching Jerry sprinkle Trish onto and 
           into the sand....

           Mike’s car pulls into a parking space and he gets out, no 
           longer in funeral clothes and now wearing the cheaper but 
           nicer of the two necklaces.  He stands, surveying the array 
           of choices before him:  SUBWAY, BLOCKBUSTER, PETCO, 
           STARBUCKS...  His eye also catches two homeless men asleep 
           against the side wall of BEST BUY.  He lingers on them for a 
           moment, then turns and walks toward....JACK’S PAWN SHOP.

           INT. JACK’S PAWN SHOP - DAY

           Mike talks to JACK, a Flagstaffian redneck, who stands behind 
           the counter holding the more expensive necklace.

                                 JACK
                        It ain’t a bad piece a’ stuff.

                                 MIKE
                        It was my mother’s.

                                 JACK
                        Well now let’s not go down the 
                        sentimental road, fella’--

                        How long you been in the pawn business,

                        Oh.  I’m not--

                                 JACK
                        OK then so don’t tell me you ain’t gonna 
                        start cryin’ ‘cause that ain’t nothin’ 
                        but a sure-as-shit sign that someone’s 
                        about to start motherfrickin’ cryin’.

           Mike just stares at him, annoyed...but then he is suddenly 
           forced to suppress a swell of emotion.

                                 JACK (cont'd)
                        You see what the frick I mean!?

                                 MIKE
                        ...How much can you give me?

                                 JACK
                        (scrutinizing the necklace)
                        Well now let’s see...let’s seedy-beety-
                        seedy-see.  Let’s just give this little

                        some pus as opposed to some puss...

           Mike is looking at this guy like the largest loser on earth.

                                 JACK (cont'd)
                        I’ll give you five-hundred bucks.

                                 MIKE

           entrance of the Corporate Bliss headquarters.

           INT. CORPORATE BLISS - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

           Mike enters, looking exhausted, which comes off as psychotic.  
           The receptionist regards him carefully.

                        Hi, I’m here to see Sue please.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Umm, Sue no longer works here.

                                 MIKE

                        Big time.  You can’t work here if you 
                        stink.  It’s my parents’ place, they’re 
                        old school, they fucking hate stinky 
                        people.

                        I might be able to help you.

           Mike, freshly showered, hair slicked back and looking better 
           than we’ve seen him for a while, stands with Al and Al’s 
           parents, BETTY and YU, 70’s.  Betty speaks broken English.

                                 AL
                        He also needs a place to live and I was 
                        thinking we could let him stay in the 
                        basement and maybe, you know, deduct some 
                        rent from his pay.

           Betty says something very quickly in Mandarin.

           Mike and Al dressed in black, crouched behind a bush looking 
           through binoculars at a mini-mansion on a residential street.

                        You see this fence here?--it’s ‘cause he 
                        owns the adjacent lot which he uses to 
                        train the dogs.  He’s also like a fucking 
                        yogurt magnate.  Totally huge in the 
                        yogurt business.  He’s like a yogurt 
                        fucking mogul.

           They both peer over the bush to what indeed appears to be a 
           dog rink, with kennels, old tires and big rubber dummies.

                        I’m not sure I ever satisfied Sue in bed.  
                        I’m not a sexual superman, Al.

                        Look, chicks these days don’t want sexual 
                        supermen, they want, like, hard-workers, 
                        you know?--guys who hustle.  And you look 
                        like a hustler, Mike.  So to speak.  I 
                        mean you came all the way to fucking 
                        Aberdeen, dude, that’s gotta count for 
                        something.
                        (looking through binoculars)
                        Oh shit, he’s got a pool shaped like a 
                        Rottweiler!

           But Mike has suddenly been distracted by something else--

                                 MIKE
                        Al, check it out.

           Al aims the binoculars to where Mike is pointing.  His POV of 
           Sue and JANGO SMITH, early 50’s, an ex-punk:  Dockers, 
           blazer, no tie;  buzz cut, tattoos crawling up his neck from 
           beneath a pressed oxford.  Sue and Jango are getting out of a 
           big, shiny pickup truck and heading toward the front door.  
           Al lowers the binoculars and looks at Mike, who looks like a 
           small, lost child.
           INT. ABERDEEN FOO YUNG RESTAURANT - DAY

           Mike takes fortune cookies from a big cardboard box and 
           places them into a small plastic one.  Al approaches.

                                 AL
                        You come up with a plan yet?

                                 MIKE
                        Not yet.

                                 AL
                        Well I think I got one for you.
                        (pointing to corner table)
                        You see that chick over there?  She was a 
                        porn star in L.A in the late 70’s.

           Mike looks and sees JANET, a woman who might very well be 
           someone’s doting grandmother.

                                 MIKE
                        She’s like 70, Al.

                                 AL
                        I know, but it’s not as though people 
                        forget those type of skills.

                                 MIKE
                        I guess, but--

                                 AL
                        I’ve arranged for you to have some face-
                        time with her, to give you some advice in 
                        order to get Sue back.

           Janet smiles and waves to Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Right now?

                                 AL
                        Yeah, just ten minutes, man, she’s got 
                        phat technique.

           Mike tentatively waves back, and then, with a shove from Al, 
           nervously makes his way over.  He sits across from her.

                                 JANET
                        So Al tells me you wanna fuck better.

                                 MIKE
                        Sort of.  I’m more just nervous about how 
                        to win someone over.

                                 JANET
                        Back in my day, we used to have a trick 
                        called The Cranberry.
                        (Mike waits for more)
                        Basically, it entails clenching a handful 
                        of cranberries between your buttocks, 
                        then standing above your partner and-- 
                        carefully--dropping them one at a time 
                        into his or her mouth, after which you 
                        squat down low and allow the partner to 
                        segue into some good ole oral.  Now, if 
                        you're a man and you get a ball-blow from 
                        someone with ass-moistened cranberries in 
                        their mouth, you’ll reap the reward, 
                        which is that your orgasm will be--as we 
                        called it--an “Asian Sunrise Squirt,” 
                        which can only be compared to the 
                        sensation of skydiving completely naked 
                        into a shimmering Hawaiian waterfall.

           Off Mike, absorbing this last part, and then:

                                 MIKE
                        What if you’re a woman getting oral sex 
                        from someone with cranberry mouth?

                                 JANET
                        With ass-cranberry mouth?

                                 MIKE
                        Yes.

                                 JANET
                        Well, to be honest, that’s really only 
                        good if you have a uterine infection.  
                        The berries sort of clear out the bad 
                        bacteria.

           Al eats an egg roll.  Mike enters.

                                 AL
                        So how did it go?

                                 MIKE
                        It was good.

                                 AL
                        She tell you about the cranberry thing?

                        Yeah.

                        You don’t have a girlfriend.

                        But when I do--first lesson she’ll get.

                        (pause; then, determined:)
                        I think I did get an idea, though.

                                 AL
                        Is it related to the cranberry maneuver?

                                 MIKE
                        Inspired by.  But I’d need a day off and 
                        300-bucks.
                        (Al looks at him)
                        I swear I’d work it off, Al.

                                 AL
                        (pause, then a big smile)
                        That’s a lotta fucking cranberries, dude.

           INT. SMALL AIRPLANE - DAY

           Mike by the door of a small twin propeller chugging along at 
           14-thousand feet.  Next to him is STAN BALL, 36, a 
           testosterone-fueled sky-dive instructor with a touch of new-
           age to boot.  From what we can see of Mike’s face behind the 
           dive suit and goggles, he is doing everything he can to pump 
           himself up--as Stan shouts at him at a high volume.

                                 STAN BALL
                        OK now Mike, you’ve been doin’ a heckuva 
                        job on heading maintenance and canopy 
                        control, but what I need now is for you 
                        to free your so as to have a spiritually 
                        fulfilling religious fucking moment!

                                 MIKE
                        I’m pretty sure I can do it, Stan!

                                 STAN BALL
                        Pretty sure works for poetry and pussy, 
                        Mike, but it’ll tear you a new asshole 
                        when you’re diving!

                                 STAN BALL
                        That’s the Michael I’ve come to know over 
                        8 hours, that’s the Mike!!

           Stan now slides open the plane door and signals for Mike to 
           stand.  The need to shout is now imperative:

                                 STAN BALL (cont'd)
                        I’LL COUNT FROM 10 AND THEN WE’RE GONE--
                        JUST AS DISCUSSED!  I LINE US UP OVER THE 
                        TARGET AND WHEN I SEPARATE IT’S YOUR JOB 
                        TO STAY ALIGNED!  AND MIKE?

                                 MIKE
                        YES?!

                                 STAN BALL
                        I WANT YOU TO FUCKING ENJOY THIS!!

                                 MIKE
                        I WILL.

                                 STAN BALL
                        I DIDN’T HEAR YOU, MIKE!!

                                 MIKE
                        I’LL ENJOY IT.

                        (screaming)
                        I’LL FUCKING ENJOY IT, STAN!!!

           Stan gives him the thumbs up and Mike faces the door;  Stan 
           stands behind, clutching him piggy-back style.  Stan peers 
           out the door, then looks to the pilot, who’s watching the 
           coordinates...finally giving Stan the thumbs-up.

                                 STAN BALL

           Stan and Mike jump, as we get a C.U. on MIKE’S FACE, 
           screaming with a mix of total fear and unadulterated seize-
           the-day abandon, the likes of which we haven’t seen from him.  
           He’s a total fucking animal--

           CAMERA PULLS BACK...AND DOWN, as it follows Stan and Mike’s 
           faces for their 10 more seconds of tandem free-fall, after 
           which Stan maneuvers his body away and we are left with a 
           TIGHT SHOT of Mike’s fear-stricken but completely alive face 
           in free fall...until he pulls the rip cord:

           --and we CUT TO A LONG SHOT of the parachute rippling out and 
           Mike’s body momentarily JERKING UP before transitioning into 
           a graceful and silent fall through the air.

           --CUT TO ANGLE FROM BELOW of Mike falling straight down.

           --CUT TO MIKE’S POV as he looks directly below him to the 
           target:  Jango’s dog-training property;  more directly: 

           --JANGO’S SKY-BLUE, ROTWEILLER-SHAPED GLISTENING POOL.

           EXT. JANGO’S POOL - DAY

           Sue, sunbathing by the pool, reading the latest Maxim...as 
           Mike and his enormous state-of-the-art square parachute land 
           with a deafening THUD and subsequent FLUTTER into the pool, 
           scaring the bejeepers out of Sue, who, not recognizing Mike 
           behind the goggles, SCREAMS. 

           As Mike struggles to untangle himself and not drown and take 
           off his goggles to show her who he is, Jango, in a wife-
           beater and boxers, races out of the house carrying an AIR GUN 
           RIFLE and sprays Mike with up to 30 bee-bee’s.

           Mike topples back and sinks into the pool just as Sue 
           recognizes him, all causing her to SCREAM EVEN MORE.

           She races over to help Mike, who is now struggling to grab 
           onto the pool’s edge--

           Mike on a hospital bed, unconscious.  After a moment he comes 
           to, peering around, trying to figure out where he is.  And 
           then he sees Sue, sitting quietly in the corner, having been 
           there for some time.  She stands.

                        (Jango is speechless)
                        Not everyone’s a punk, J-man.

                                 JANGO
                        Joe Strummer most likely made love to 
                        your mother, Al.  And then wrote a song 
                        about it.

                        Over here is me having just broken a 
                        piano against my forehead.

                                 AL
                        Did it hurt?

                                 JANGO
                        It fucking tickled, Al.

                                 MIKE
                        Who’s this?

                                 JANGO
                        That’s me with Ed McMahon.

                                 AL
                        Did you ever fuck animals?

                                 JANGO
                        Punks don’t do that, Al.  But I did once 
                        spluge into a bull’s eye from 20 feet 
                        away.  For fun.

                        A bull’s eye like a bull’s eye?

                                 JANGO
                        No, just a regular bull’s eye.

                                 MIKE
                        Why were you a punk?

                                 JANGO
                        (honest reflection)
                        Why was I a punk...?
                        (staring into the biosphere)
                        I think initially it was an attempt to 
                        subvert the quest for order that my 
                        father smothered me with as a child.  I 
                        didn’t wanna just rage against the 
                        machine, I wanted to fuck the machine.  
                        But eventually that anger morphed into 
                        the wellspring of what had become a 
                        cohesive world movement, whose goal it 
                        was to align ourselves with certain 
                        entropic forces which we felt were at the 
                        core of the entire fucking universe.

           Mike and Al stare at him.

                                 JANGO (cont'd)
                        Do you guys like Chicken Marsala?
                        (calling toward the kitchen)
                        Sue?!

           Sue appears at the door to the kitchen.

                                 JANGO (cont'd)
                        Are you starving?

                                 SUE
                        I’m OK.

                                 JANGO
                        What do you say I give these guys a quick 
                        dog demo and then I’ll start the Marsala?

                                 SUE
                        ...Sure.

                                 JANGO 
                        (with pride)
                        Sue’s the greatest.

           Off Mike and Al, watching this interaction.
           EXT. DOG RINK - JANGO’S PROPERTY - DUSK

           Mike, in a gigantic Kevlar suit, follows Jango, Al and Sue as 
           they approach a row of kennels.  SOUND OF GROWLING DOGS.

                                 JANGO
                        So I’m a fully licensed trainer but I 
                        essentially just train my own.  SOmetimes 
                        I’ll do one for a friend.

           He opens the door to a kennel--

                                 JANGO (cont'd)
                        Heel!

           He reaches in and leashes up a NASTY-LOOKING ROTTWEILER.

                                 JANGO (cont'd)
                        This here is Bimminy.
                        (totally intense)
                        Come, Bimminy!

           The dog obediently follows him a short way away.

                                 JANGO (cont'd)
                        Sit, Bimminy!

           Bimminy sits; Jango checks Mike’s suit, then paces him off 15 
           yards.

                                 JANGO (cont'd)
                        OK--stand there, and when Bimminy 
                        charges, let him hit you full on, and 
                        then yell stuff like you’re an intruder 
                        about to shit his pants.

           Without awaiting an answer, Jango turns toward the dog, 
           eyeballs it a moment...and then shouts:

                                 JANGO (cont'd)
                        ATTACK!

           Bimminy sprints toward Mike, HURLING itself through the air 
           so that it SLAMS into his body--jettisoning him back.

                                 JANGO (cont'd)
                        ACT LIKE AN INTRUDER, MIKE!

           Mike instinctually, no need to act, starts shouting and 
           screaming, playing the part of a terrified robber--

                                 MIKE
                        AAAHH!!--SHIT!--GET THE FUCK OFF OF ME!!!

           CONTINUED:

           Al watches, dumbfounded, while Sue screams, horrified--

                                 SUE
                        Jango, make it stop!

                                 JANGO
                        Good job, Mikey, doing great, just keep 
                        provoking it!!

           --as the chaos continues...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM - JANGO’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jango, Sue, Mike and Al sit around an elegantly set table 
           sipping wine and eating Chicken Marsala.  CLASSICAL MUSIC.

                                 JANGO
                        Basically, for me, dog-work is a thrill, 
                        an adrenaline rush, if you will, that’s 
                        otherwise hard for me to replicate in the 
                        world of yogurt.

                                 AL
                        Especially now that you’re not a punk.

                                 JANGO
                        (re: his heart)
                        I’m still a punk in here, Al, make no 
                        mistake, but there’s less need to call 
                        myself a punk in a world where the very 
                        notion of punkdom has been commodified 
                        for the mass-market.

                                 AL
                        But why do you sell yogurt?

                                 JANGO
                        Because punks like yogurt, too, Alvin.
                        Excuse me--

           He reaches into his mouth and carefully takes out his two 
           false front teeth, carefully placing them beside his plate.

                                 JANGO (cont'd)
                        Chicken’s the worst.  Gets stuck right in 
                        the crevice here.

           He points to the space between the two fake teeth, where 
           there is indeed a large chunk of chicken.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Silence as they all sip wine and Jango finger-swipes clean 
           the enormous void where his two front teeth once were.  ANGLE 
           on Sue, hiding her embarrassment.  Finishing his gum-swipe, 
           Jango turns to Mike with great sincerity and humility.

                                 JANGO (cont'd)
                        Mike, I’d just like to formally and quite 
                        sincerely apologize to you for the bee-
                        bee gun incident.  I lost my cool.
                        (arm protectively around Sue)
                        I was scared for Sue, scared for the 
                        dogs, scared for the well-being of the 
                        pool, so...I just wanna say I’m sorry.

                                 MIKE
                        Thanks, Jango.

                                 JANGO
                        You accept my apology?

                                 MIKE
                        I do.

                                 JANGO
                        Good.  So how’s the restaurant business?

                                 MIKE
                        It’s good.

                                 JANGO
                        Do you guys serve yogurt at that place?

                                 AL
                        No, but Mike did convince my parents to 
                        give away 25 per cent of the restaurant’s 
                        profits to charity.  I couldn’t believe 
                        they actually agreed.  He tried for 30.

           A big smile spreads over Sue’s face as she sneaks a loving 
           look to Mike, who looks down, embarrassed but happy.

                                 JANGO
                        That’s great.  Maybe you could dovetail 
                        it with Sue’s yogurt fund.  Speaking of 
                        which, who’s up for dessert?  I wanna try 
                        out a new flavor on you guys.

           The others say Sure...as Jango heads for the kitchen.  Mike 
           looks at Sue, trying to discern what she really thinks of 
           this guy. Al, picking up on her blank expression, leans over.

                        Hey Sue, Mike and I are gonna go to the 
                        Cowboy Club after this, if you wanna join 
                        us.  They got great dancing.

           Sue looks at him, then at Mike, then toward the kitchen.

                                 SUE
                        I’ll think about it.

           INT. COWBOY CLUB - NIGHT

           Al and Mike kinda dancing together to honky-tonk music at a 
           near-empty “club”--really just a few tables, a jukebox and 
           two colored lights aimed at a patch of parquet dance floor-- 
           the only other occupant of which is a single woman with huge 
           hair swaying drunkenly by herself.  They yell over the music--

                                 AL
                        --and what I’m trying to say is that 
                        China is not only gonna kick America’s 
                        economic ass, it’s going to invade your 
                        whole fucking country!  I’m talking annex

                        cats better than you treat your own!

                                 AL

                        I’m totally fucking with you.

           Mike smiles and Al insists on receiving a high-five...as he 
           eyeballs the lonely woman swaying on the dance floor.

                                 AL 
                        You think she’s hot?

                        Hi, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        (looking at the door)
                        You didn’t bring Jango, did you?

                                 SUE
                        He got kinda drunk;  so I told him I had 
                        to run an errand.

                                 AL
                        Dance with us, Sue!

           She smiles, hesitating...and then slowly starts to dance to 
           the honky-tonk stylings coming from the jukebox;  Al joins 
           in...and then Mike--until the three of them find a groove, 
           shaking their butts with joy and a certain amount of abandon.

           EXT. ABERDEEN CENTRAL CEMETERY - NIGHT

           Mike and Sue make love next to a headstone on a hill;  the 
           town’s twinkling lights below.  They finish, nicely, then lie 
           on their backs looking up at the stars.  Silence...and then:

                                 SUE
                        Have you been, like, with other women 
                        since the last time we made love?

                                 MIKE
                        No.

                                 SUE
                        I was just curious, because...

                                 MIKE
                        Why?

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SUE
                        Your lovemaking’s more...mature.

                                 MIKE
                        I did get some advice.  From this
                        woman who comes into the restaurant.  She 
                        wanted me to do this cranberry thing but 
                        it’s not really my style.
                        (Sue is staring at him)
                        But she’s the one who told me about that 
                        other thing.

                                 SUE
                        It was nice.

                                 MIKE
                        Thank you.
                        (pause)
                        Sue?

                                 SUE
                        Yeah?

                                 MIKE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 SUE
                        In this cemetery or in Aberdeen?

                                 MIKE
                        Both.

                                 SUE
                        ...I’m not sure.

           Mike suddenly looks down, having noticed something--

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, man--

           Still wearing his suit coat, Mike has discovered that 
           something has fallen out of its pocket.

                                 SUE 
                        What is it?

                                 MIKE
                        It’s...my Mom.  It’s her ashes.

                                 SUE
                        What?

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 MIKE
                        She died.  I forgot to tell you.  And we 
                        cremated her, and...

           He picks up the spilled ash and holds it for her to see.

                                 SUE
                        I’m so sorry, Mike.
                        (beat)
                        Why is she in your pocket?

                                 MIKE
                        I was waiting until I found a special 
                        place to put her.

                                 SUE
                        ...How about here?

                                 MIKE
                        (glancing around)
                        OK.

                                 SUE
                        It’ll be nice.  We’ll bury it and make a 
                        little shrine.

           Sue jolts into action, clearing away brush and leaves, 
           digging a little pit into which Mike now ceremoniously 
           sprinkles the ash, taking off his blazer and turning the 
           pocket inside out to ensure that it all gets out.  They cover 
           the ashes with earth, and then Sue digs through her purse for 
           items with which to enshrine the mound.  She shows Mike--

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        Cowboy Club matches;  Bolivian money;  a 
                        pen from your parents’ motel--
                        (from her hair)
                        --and a beret.

           She carefully arranges these items on the earth and ash.  
           Mike looks at her lovingly, then takes off one of his socks.

                                 MIKE
                        A sock she gave me for my birthday two 
                        years ago.

           They regard the shrine, then sit back, smiling at each other.

                                 SUE
                        It smells so nice here.

                                 MIKE
                        It does.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 SUE
                        I think it’s all the flowers.

                                 AL (O.S.)
                        Hey, are you guys through yet?!

           They look over to see Al, naked, several headstones away, 
           having just finished making sweet love to the lonely swaying 
           woman from the club.

           INT. ABERDEEN FOO YUNG RESTAURANT - DAY

           Mike and Al set tables for the lunch rush.

                                 MIKE
                        I was thinking we should start donating 
                        the leftover lunch buffet food to that 
                        homeless shelter over on Scrantz Avenue.
                        (pause)
                        And using recycled-cardboard take-out 
                        containers.

                                 AL
                        Whatever the fuck you say, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        (beat)
                        Did you know Aberdeen is building the 
                        country’s largest biodiesel fuel plant?

                                 AL
                        ...Cool.

                                 MIKE
                        We should find a way to get in on that.

                                 AL
                        Did you know that when Kurt Cobain was a 
                        kid, he spray painted “God Is Gay” on 
                        that bridge over Monroe Street?

                                 MIKE
                        ...Cool.

           The front door opens and Jango and a 40-something PUNK walk 
           in, followed by two large, snarling GERMAN SHEPHERDS.  The 
           punk walks up to Al and blocks him, as Jango walks straight 
           up to Mike and HEAD-BUTTS him.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        Oww!--

           CONTINUED:

                                 AL
                        Hey!--

           Al starts toward Jango but is quickly restrained by the punk;  
           Jango jumps on Mike and POUNDS HIM WITH HIS FIST in the face--

                                 JANGO
                        I have you over for dinner and serve you 
                        my best fucking wine and that’s what you 
                        go and do?! I oughta fucking destroy you!

           He is wailing on Mike, Al is struggling but unable to break 
           free of the punk and the dogs are BARKING LIKE MANIACS.  
           Finally Jango rises, turns and walks back out the door.

                                 JANET
                        Don’t ever fucking touch her again!

           The punk follows, swiping a bottle of Soy Sauce as he goes.  
           Al rushes to Mike, who is bloody and beaten.

                                 AL
                        Jesus Christ, man, are you all right?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah...

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - ABERDEEN FOO YUNG - NIGHT

           Mike and Al hoist a large electric keyboard onto the back of 
           a tandem-bicycle that’s been rigged with a wooden wagon-
           trailer.  Al plugs the keyboard into a portable generator, 
           which he also attaches to two speakers that sit on the wagon.  
           They’re both dressed in black..

                                 AL
                        So you’re sure you wanna do this?

                                 MIKE
                        Stop asking me.

                                 AL
                        I’m just asking--

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t come if you don’t want.

                                 AL
                        No, dude, I’m with you.

                                 MIKE
                        (re: the piano)
                        It feel secure?

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        If we ride smooth we’re golden.

                                 MIKE
                        OK then.  Let’s do it.

           They mount the bike...and slowly pedal off through the 
           darkened streets of Aberdeen.

           EXT. JANGO’S HOUSE AND PROPERTY - NIGHT

           Mike and Al pull up on the double-bike, parking it on Jango’s 
           front lawn.  Al stays on his seat but Mike dismounts, walks 
           around, steps onto the wagon and sits behind the keyboard, 
           using an amp as stool.  He turns on the power, tests a couple 
           keys, then takes out and attaches a small clip-on microphone, 
           which is also rigged to the amp.  He clears his throat, take 
           a composure moment...and begins playing, his singing at first 
           soft, not quite on par with Neil Young:

                                 MIKE
                        There's colors on the street
                        Red, white and blue
                        People shufflin' their feet
                        People sleepin' in their shoes 

           INT. - JANGO’S DEN - SAME

           SOUND OF SEX PISTOLS.  Sue lies stomach-down on the floor, as 
           Jango sits atop her giving her a “karate chop” massage, which 
           looks more irritating than relaxing.  They both wear 
           headphones plugged into the same bedside I-Pod.  Sue’s eye 
           catches a framed photo of a SNARLING PIT BULL on the wall.

           EXT. JANGO’S HOUSE AND PROPERTY - SAME

           Mike gaining confidence and momentum:

                                 MIKE
                        But there's a warnin' sign on the road 
                        ahead!
                        There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be 
                        better off dead!

           ANGLE on Sue, hearing something, letting her wire slip off:

                                 MIKE (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them!
                        So I try to forget it, any way I can!

           ANGLE on Mike, totally getting into it:

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                        Keep on rockin' in the free world!

           ANGLE on Sue, moved to tears, as Jango remains oblivious--

                                 MIKE (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        Keep on rockin' in the free world!

           ANGLE on Al, furiously drumming on an upside-down bucket--

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        Keep on rockin' in the free world!

           ANGLE on Mike, intensity, passion and abandon in his voice--

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        Keep on rockin' in the free world!

           Bringing it to a climactic, exhilarating, uplifting finish...

           As Jango suddenly looks up, takin out his headphone--

           As Al cheers for Mike--

           As Mike, still with two black eyes and a puffy nose, smiles 
           in satisfaction.  And then, at the top of his lungs:

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        YOUR GIRLFRIEND WAS GREAT IN THE 
                        CEMETERY, YOU FUCKING GERIATRIC FUCKING 
                        EX-PUNK DRUNKARD!!

           At which point he remounts the bike seat and he and Al pedal 
           away as fast as possible.  ANGLE on Sue at her window looking 
           out after them, joined a moment later by a confused Jango...

           INT. KITCHEN - ABERDEEN FOO YUNG - DAY

           Mike--now slightly less bruised and swollen--loosens his bow 
           tie after that afternoon’s particularly hectic lunch rush.  
           He speaks to Betty.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll be back at 4 to do the set-ups.

           Betty nods as Mike makes his way toward a door in the corner--
           INT. BASEMENT - ABERDEEN FOO YUNG - DAY

           Mike slowly descends from the kitchen to his basement 
           apartment, which is small but which he’s managed to make cozy 
           in his Mike sort of way:  a KURT WARNER poster, a GOD’S GREEN 
           EARTH recycling poster, a pile of National Geographic’s, one 
           of which he picks up as he lowers himself down onto a thick 
           mattress on the floor.  But after a moment he’s interrupted 
           from the door at the top of the stairs:

                                 BETTY
                        Mike!  You have visitor!

                                 MIKE
                        Ah--OK.

           A moment later Sue descends the stairs.  Mike sits up as she 
           regards his swollen face with sadness.....  He smiles humbly.

                        You shoulda’ seen it two days ago.
                        (exagerrating)
                        Out to here.

                                 SUE
                        I’m sorry he did that.  It’s my fault.

                                 MIKE 
                        It was worth it.

           She tries to smile, not answering.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        I’ve been leaving you messages.

                                 SUE
                        I know.

                                 MIKE 
                        How did Jango find out about the 
                        cemetery?

                                 SUE
                        I told him.

                                 MIKE
                        Why?

                                 SUE
                        Because the way I’ve been handling 
                        things, with both of you, is unfair.  And 
                        I shouldn’t do it anymore.

                        (Mike is speechless--)
                        We need to talk, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        I know--

                                 SUE
                        I’m marrying Jango.

                                 MIKE
                        ...What?--

                                 SUE
                        And I need you to accept it.

                                 MIKE
                        Why?!

                                 SUE
                        Because I’m at a point in my life where 
                        there are certain things I don’t think 
                        you can help me with.

                                 MIKE
                        Things like what?

                                 SUE
                        Like stability--

                                 MIKE
                        I’m stable!

                                 SUE
                        No you’re not--

                                 MIKE
                        Well I’m not a frickin’ PUNK!

                        This is bullshit--

                                 SUE
                        It doesn’t mean I don’t love you; because 
                        part of me somewhere does, but I’m also a 
                        person who needs a certain kind of love--

                                 MIKE
                        What kind?--

                        The kind that’s not an unguided missile.  
                        You can’t stalk people around the country 
                        just because you’re feeling a lonely.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s not why I stalked you--

                                 SUE
                        So then why--because I have a nice butt?

                        Yes!--

                                 SUE
                        Well that’s not sufficient either;  being 
                        in love isn’t based just on what you 
                        need.  It’s gotta be more selfless.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, like, save everyone in the world 
                        except yourself?  Is that how love works?  
                        Being a martyr?

                                 SUE
                        That’s not what I do--

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah it is.  You’re so busy being 
                        “selfless” that you end up treating 
                        yourself like shit.  Is that what you 
                        mean by “sufficient”?
                        (pissed)
                        You’re the unstable one, Sue.

                        At least I don’t live in a motel.

                                 MIKE
                        No--you live with a rich yogurt dick 
                        who’s obsessed with killer dogs.
                        (she stares at him icily)
                        I mean you think that’s what’s gonna make 
                        you happy?  A gap-toothed ex-punk who 
                        treats you like his puppy?
                        (no answer)
                        Oh but I guess that’s better than living 
                        back east in a sanitized nursing home for 
                        lonely yuppies.

                                 SUE
                        Is that really what you think of me?

                        I’m just saying that I know what you 
                        need.

                                 SUE
                        Which is what?

                                 MIKE
                        To take care of yourself a little.  So 
                        that you’re not miserable.  So that the 
                        people who love you don’t feel like 
                        they’re annoying you.
                        (pause)
                        There’s nothing wrong with a little 
                        selfishness if it at least makes you 
                        happy, Sue, because I’ll tell you what, 
                        even the hungriest, most homeless person 
                        in the world isn’t gonna wanna be cared 
                        for by a miserable, dog-bitten freak.
                        (he goes to her)
                        Just marry me.  Let the world go fuck 
                        itself for like half a second and see 
                        what happens.  Maybe it’ll be all right.

           She looks at him, close to tears but not allowing them....

                                 SUE
                        We’re getting married this Saturday.

                        (his heart cracking)
                        Why?--

                                 SUE
                        Because I’m pregnant.

                        I found out yesterday.

                        Yes.  Which is why I’m getting married.
                        (trying not to lose it)
                        I can’t afford to be selfish on this.

                        (he just looks at her)
                        Jango has that.

                        I’m sorry.

           Mike is broken.  But then, after several moments, the 
           devastation becomes a slow build...to fury:

                                 MIKE 
                        Can you leave now?  Please?
                        (pause)
                        I want you to leave.
                        (eruption:)
                        GET OUT OF MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW, SUE, 
                        FUCKING “SUSAN”--GET OUT!!
                        (she doesn’t move)

                        RIGHT THIS FUCKING FUCKING INSTANT!!!

           She looks at him through her tears, not wanting it to end 
           this way, but he remains steadfast...and so she turns, and 
           slowly walks up the stairs.

           EXT. A HILL - DAY

           Mike and Al stand on this elevated earth overlooking a lake, 
           at the side of which Sue and Jango are having their wedding 
           ceremony.  Mike stoically looks through binoculars:  ANGLE on 
           Jango kissing Sue as a crowd of ex-punk types applauds and 
           another SEX PISTOLS’ tune cranks up in the distance.

                                 AL
                        I wish I had that fucker’s bee-bee gun 
                        right now.

                                 AL
                        They going on a honeymoon?

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t know.

                                 AL
                        Probably waiting ‘til yogurt season’s 
                        over.

           This gets a look from Mike, but not a comment.  He re-raises 
           the binoculars:  His POV on a table gorgeously covered with 
           mini-yogurt cups patiently awaiting the wedding guests...

                        Bummer for the community.

           Mike lowers the binoculars, looks at Al, expressionless, then 
           stares at nothing.  Al puts his arm around his shoulder.

                        You know what she told me the other day?  
                        She said the only reason I love her is 
                        cause I’m lonely.
                        (pause)
                        And that I’m not capable;  of, like, 
                        raising a kid.

                                 AL

                                 MIKE
                        It’s enough to make you wanna be a monk.

                                 AL
                        Or like a Buddhist monk.

                                 AL
                        I know, but--

                                 MIKE
                        I wonder how much it costs.

           They watch the weddin...and then Al turns to him--genuine:

                                 AL
                        I consider you my friend.
                        (no answer)
                        So while I’m in no way encouraging 
                        monkhood, if you ever do need money...I 
                        can get it for you.

                                 MIKE
                        How?

                                 AL
                        By stealing from my parents.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not stealing money from your parents, 
                        Al.

                                 AL
                        You wouldn’t be.  I would.
                        (pause)
                        It’s totally up to you, but if that’s 
                        what you want...I’m here for you.

           Mike thinks for several moments...then looks up at Al:

                                 MIKE
                        (honest, eye-to-eye)
                        You’re the best friend I ever had.

           They hug--genuine and real...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. UNFURNISHED ROOM - DAY

           STRAIGHT SHOT OF MIKE, in total silence, HEAD SHAVED, IN A 
           BRIGHT ORANGE BUDDHIST MONK ROBE sitting on a bed in an 
           otherwise unfurnished room--

           MUSIC FADES IN as we see the following SERIES OF SHOTS:
           INT. GARDEN - TU HIEU BUDDHIST MONASTERY - DAY

           Mike shaking hands with other apprentice-monks as the Tu Hieu 
           Buddhist Monastery in Idaho.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Sue conducting a Power-Point presentation for a room full of 
           yogurt executives, including Jango.  Her pointer on a pie-
           graph above which reads:  “Flo-Gurt Fund’s Quarterly 
           Charitable Distributions.”  Jango smiles at her like she was 
           his daughter;  she tries to smile back.

           INT. UNFURNISHED ROOM - DAY

           Mike, cross-legged on his inch-thick mattress, trying to 
           meditate but opening his eyes in frustration.  He glimpses 
           something out the window.  His POV on a seldom-used 
           volleyball net in the Buddhist Tranquility Garden.

           INT. JANGO’S DEN - DAY

           Sue, cross-legged, eyes closed in meditation.  But it’s not 
           working, and after a moment she opens her eyes, frustrated.  
           And then she glimpses something out the window.

           INT. TU HIEU BUDDHIST MONASTERY - VOLLEYBALL COURT -DAY

           Mike playing 2-on-2 volleyball on the sand pit;  it’s Top Gun 
           meets Ghandi, all sand and sweat and bright orange robes.

           INT. JANGO’S DEN - DAY

           Sue at the den window.  Her POV on Jango in full Kevlar, 
           screaming at the dogs to attack him with more viciousness.

           INT. GARDEN - TU HIEU BUDDHIST MONASTERY -DAY

           Mike, expressionless, sweeping the patio.  He stops to 
           recycle a stray can.

           INT. JANGO’S HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY

           C.U. on Sue, watching, expressionless.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to 
           reveal Jango, next to a crib, holding a DOLL which is being 
           torn from his hands by one of his Rottweilers, which proceeds 
           to rip it apart despite Jango’s efforts to grab it back.

           CROSS-FADE TO--
           EXT. - GARDENS - TU HIEU BUDDHIST MONASTERY - DAY

           Mike walks along an exquisitely tranquil garden full of green 
           and shady sal trees.  With him is TRUC QUOC, 38, a patient 
           Buddhist instructor who runs the apprentice monk program.  He 
           is a calm, gentle, rather Americanized guy.

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        Michael, the progress you’ve made in your 
                        four months here has been remarkable.

                                 MIKE
                        Thank you, Father.

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        And needless to say, your immersion into 
                        the duties of carrot-chopper and broom-
                        chief has been full and complete.

                                 MIKE
                        Thank you.

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        But some worries have arisen.

                                 MIKE
                        Such as what, Father?

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        Well, first of all, you’re not supposed 
                        to call me father.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh.

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        But that’s OK.  I’ll admit I’ve grown 
                        fond of it.
                        (pause)
                        An aspiring Bodhisattva, such as you, 
                        must seek to produce a heart that does 
                        not dwell.

                                 MIKE
                        Of course, Father.

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        Your heart, Michael, if I may say, does 
                        dwell.

                                 MIKE
                        No it doesn’t.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        It does, Michael.  It continues to be 
                        influenced by external conditions.
                        (Mike looks bummed)
                        The goal of Shakyamuni is to cease 
                        suffering, which is caused by earthly 
                        passions.  In order to transcend, you 
                        must relinquish these passions.  And as 
                        hard a worker as you are, I fear you are 
                        not achieving this.
                        (pause)
                        To put it bluntly:  You are stuck; in the 
                        realm of earthly passion.

           Mike is at a complete loss.

                                 TRUC QUOC (cont'd)
                        You also spend too much time playing 
                        volleyball.

                                 MIKE
                        I thought that was permitted, Father.

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        It is, but not for seven hours a day.  
                        Hours that should be spent in meditation.

                                 MIKE
                        But I’m good at it--

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        I know--

                                 MIKE
                        And you encouraged it for stress release.

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        Yes, Mike, but Buddhist monks aren’t 
                        supposed to have seven hours a day worth 
                        of stress.  We’re Buddhist monks.

           Truc Quoc stops and looks Mike straight in the eye:

                                 TRUC QUOC (cont'd)
                        Everyone here likes you;  but I don’t 
                        think that you truly desire an immersion 
                        into the oneness.  I think that what you 
                        actually desire...is individuation.

                                 MIKE
                        ...So what should I do?

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        You need to move on.  To fully become 
                        someone.

                                 MIKE
                        But how?

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        (beat)
                        My parents died when I was five, Mike.  
                        Two months later my uncle and I moved to 
                        America.  I was forced to let go of 
                        everything I knew.  Everything.  To 
                        simply..let go.  In order to move on.
                        (pause)
                        Sometimes in life you must do that.  To 
                        get to the next stage.

                                 MIKE
                        ...Move on?

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        Yes.

           Mike looks around the garden, taking this in.

                                 MIKE
                        Where are you from?

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        Vietnam.  Hau Nghia province.  My parents 
                        were killed in the war.

                                 MIKE
                        By the Americans?

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        Yes.  And  yet look at me.  I moved here.    
                        Life is odd.

                                 MIKE
                        ...I’m sorry.

                                 TRUC QUOC
                        (gentle; honest)
                        It’s not your fault.

           Mike absorbs....

                                 TRUC QUOC (cont'd)
                        Let go, Mike.  Let go and move on.
           EXT. HIGHWAY - ARIZONA - DAY

           Mike walks along the highway, duffel bag slung over his back.

           INT. MIKE’S APARTMENT/ROOM - DAY

           Mike stands at the dusty window of the room he’s lived in for 
           years.  He stares out, lost in thought.

           INT. FRONT DESK/LOBBY AREA - DAY

           Jerry is behind the front desk doing the crossword without 
           much energy.  Mike enters.  Jerry looks up, then back down.

                                 MIKE
                        You want me to make you some lunch?

                                 JERRY
                        I’m all right.

           He works the crossword but Mike doesn’t move on....  Beat.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey Dad, when you were over in Vietnam, 
                        did you ever do any fighting in Hau Nghia 
                        province? 

           Jerry looks up, Vietnam not being a topic they often discuss.

                                 JERRY 
                        ...Yeah.

           Mike nods, but doesn’t say anything.

                                 JERRY (cont'd)
                        Why?

                                 MIKE
                        I met a guy up at the monastery who was 
                        from that area.
                        (beat)
                        Seemed to really have his shit together.

                                 JERRY
                        (beat; then back to the puzzle)
                        Good to hear.

           Silence.  Mike just stands there...  And then:

                                 MIKE
                        Dad I think you should sell this place.

           Jerry again looks up but doesn’t answer.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        You don’t even like it here.  This was 
                        Mom’s thing.

                                 JERRY
                        Why do you say that?

                                 MIKE
                        ‘Cause it’s true.  She loved people, she 
                        loved running things, it made her feel 
                        alive.  But that’s not you, Dad.  You’re, 
                        like, not a people-person.  You should 
                        let it go.  Move on.
                        (pause)
                        Otherwise you’re just gonna rot.

                                 JERRY
                        ....Sell it and do what?

                                 MIKE
                        Anything.  You still got time.  You’d 
                        have money.  Just, you know...move on to 
                        the next stage.

                                 JERRY
                        What do you need, Mike, a loan?

                                 MIKE
                        No.  I just wanted to say.....that this 
                        doesn’t have to be it.
                        (pause)
                        And that I love you.

           Jerry looks at him for a long moment....then slowly takes a 
           look around the lobby, perhaps considering life without it.

           INT. ROOM 221 - THE MOTEL - NIGHT

           Mike enters the darkened room where he first met Sue.  He 
           turns on a light and looks around.  The bed is made, the room 
           is as spotless as it’s gonna get.  Mike looks around, perhaps 
           touching the pillow...the bedspread.  He peaks into the 
           bathroom, his eye catching two plastic-covered cups...

           And then he sits on the bed...and just sits.  He’s not 
           meditating, not depressed, not happy;  just sitting....

           been touched in years.

           Ancient National Geographic’s are jettisoned into an

                        Thanks, Marissa.

           He looks at the return address:  C.U. on “SUE CLEMMONS.”  He 
           opens and starts to read...as we see a SERIES OF SHOTS.

                        Dear Mike, I’m not sure where you are 
                        these days, so who knows when you might 
                        get this.

                        But I wanted to write to say that I’m 
                        sorry we argued the last time we were 
                        together.  I was confused and I took it 
                        out on you.

                        what’s important.

                        Anyway, so I just wanted to say thank 
                        you.  For coming into my life.  Even if 
                        it was only for a little while.

                        I really do hope you’re happy.  You 
                        deserve it.  Goodbye, Mike.  ...Sue.

           Off Mike--lost in thought; and then, maybe, a small, sad 
           smile.

           INT. FLAGSTAFF FOO-YUNG - DAY

           Mike and Jerry sit at Mike’s old table, sipping large bowls 
           of soup in silence.  After a moment:

                                 JERRY
                        So I thought about what you said the 
                        other day.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh yeah?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah.
                        (he sips the soup)
                        I think you had a point.

           He takes another sip of soup, then reaches into his breast 
           pocket and takes out a folded piece of paper.

                                 JERRY (cont'd)
                        That being said, this is yours.

           He hands the paper to Mike, who starts to unfold.

                                 MIKE
                        What is it?

                                 JERRY
                        Deed for the motel.  Signed over to you. 

                                 MIKE
                        What do you mean?

                                 JERRY
                        It’s yours.  You can either keep it or 
                        sell it, it’s up to you.

                                 MIKE
                        Dad, that’s not why I--

                                 JERRY
                        I know, but I don’t need it.  Your mom 
                        was good about that.

                                 MIKE
                        But you can’t just give me the motel.

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah I can.  It’s your birthright.

                                 MIKE
                        (pause)
                        Dad--

                                 JERRY
                        I’ll be fine, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        But what would you do?

                                 JERRY
                        (he sips more soup)
                        I wanna get in shape.  Join a gym.
                        (another sip)
                        Maybe join one ‘a those basketball 
                        leagues.

           Mike just looks at him as he sips more soup.

                                 JERRY (cont'd)
                        What about you?

                                 MIKE
                        ...Not sure.

                                 JERRY
                        Done with the monk stuff?

                                 MIKE 
                        Yeah.  I mean...I‘ll still occasionally 
                        do it, but...not professionally.

                                 JERRY
                        ...What about that girl?

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 MIKE
                        ...Didn’t work out.  I think we weren’t, 
                        you know, meant for each other.

           Jerry looks at him, perhaps for the first time in years, like 
           a father who knows best for his kid.

                                 JERRY
                        I dunno, Mike.  Things change.  In life.

                                 MIKE
                        ...What do you mean?

                                 JERRY
                        You’re not the same guy you were.

           Mike absorbs.  Jerry looks at his soup;  takes a sip...

                                 JERRY (cont'd)
                        Good soup.

           He takes another soup sip...and then C.U on Mike, hearing 
           this last line....then looking down at the deed...

           EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Mike just stands there, looking up at the two-story motel, 
           studying it, deep in thought.

           ANGLE on the motel sign, which now says:  WE ARE CLOSED.  
           THANK YOU FOR YOUR MANY YEARS OF FINE PATRONAGE.

           ANGLE on Mike, still surveying the building, his eyes  
           inspired.  After a moment he sort of nods to himself... 

                                 MIKE
                        You can do this, Mike.

           After a moment he sees Jerry exiting the lobby in rather 
           tight-fitting shorts that seem to date from 1970.  He holds a 
           dusty basketball.  Mike watches as Jerry approaches.....Beat.

                                 JERRY
                        So I’m gonna hit the gym.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh yeah?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah.  They got a senior citizen hoop run 
                        from three to five.
                        (off Mike’s look)
                        I’m borrowing your ball.

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MIKE
                        It’s actually yours.  From way back.

                                 JERRY
                        I know.

                                 MIKE
                        ...Hey Dad?

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah?

                                 MIKE
                        I’m gonna take a little trip.  I’m 
                        thinking I’ll be back in a week.

                                 JERRY
                        ...OK, Mike.

           And with that, Jerry heads for his car.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - LAUREL, MARYLAND - DAY

           Mike walks down the street, his only luggage a backpack.  He 
           comes to a stop in front of a small house with a tidy lawn.  
           He checks the address with what he’s written on his forearm, 
           then starts up the front path.

           He rings the doorbell and waits.  After a moment, MARY 
           CLEMMONS, late 50’s, misguidedly cheery, opens the door.

                                 MIKE
                        Hi, are you Mary Clemmons?

                                 MARY
                        (cautious)
                        Yes.

                                 MIKE
                        Sue’s mom?

                                 MARY
                        ...Yes.

                                 MIKE
                        Hi.  I’m Mike, a friend of Sue’s.  Is she 
                        by any chance here?

                                 MARY 
                        Who are you?

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MIKE
                        Mike.  From management.
                        (she looks at him with 
                         suspicion)
                        You sell insurance to deaf people and you 
                        used to be married to a dick named 
                        Dennis.

           Mary’s eyes grow wide....and then she carefully calls back 
           toward the living room.

                                 MARY
                        Sue!  There’s someone here for you!  He 
                        says he’s Mike!  From management!

           Silence a moment....and then Sue, still pregnant, steps to 
           the door.  She and Mike regard each other intensely.

                                 MARY (cont'd)
                        Do you know him, Sue?

                                 SUE
                        Yes, Mom.  I know him.

                                 MARY
                        (to Mike)
                        I own a gun.

           And with this, she steps out of the way and heads back into 
           the house, as Sue steps out, letting the screen door shut 
           behind her.  They stand together on the stoop.  Beat.

                                 MIKE
                        Hi.

                                 SUE
                        Hi.

                                 MIKE
                        ...How’s your baby?

                                 SUE
                        So far so good.

                                 MIKE 
                        I, ah, got your letter.

                                 SUE
                        I’m glad.  I wasn’t sure.

                                 MIKE
                        I hope it’s OK that I’m here.

           Sue sort of smiles, her way of saying yes.

                                 SUE
                        How did you know where I was?

                                 MIKE
                        It was post-marked Laurel.  I looked up 
                        all the Sue Clemmons.

                                 SUE 
                        ...I’m sorry, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Why?

                                 SUE
                        (quiet)
                        Because I messed up with you.

                                 MIKE
                        No you didn’t--

                                 SUE
                        Yeah I did.
                        (near tears)
                        A lot.

                                 MIKE
                        But you were right.  I wasn’t giving you 
                        what you needed.  I was like a kid.  When 
                        what you needed was...

                                 SUE
                        A man?

                                 MIKE
                        ...Yeah.

                                 SUE
                        (beat)
                        Where did you go?

                                 MIKE
                        Idaho.
                        (pause)
                        To become a monk.

                                 SUE
                        (she nods; and then:)
                        Did you?

                                 MIKE
                        A bit.

                        What’re you gonna do now?

                                 MIKE 
                        With my life?

                                 SUE
                        Yeah.

           ...He takes a piece of paper from his pocket and hands it to 
           her.

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        What is it?

                                 MIKE
                        The deed to the motel.

           She looks up at him;  he takes out another piece of paper.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        And this is my application for nonprofit 
                        status.
                        (pause)
                        It’s a copy.

                                 SUE
                        Why do you need nonprofit status?

                                 MIKE 
                        ‘Cause I’m turning it into a homeless 
                        shelter.
                        (pause)
                        With multiple housing units upstairs.
                        (pause)
                        And midnight basketball.
                        (pause)
                        Or indoor soccer.

                                 SUE
                        ...Are you serious?

                                 MIKE
                        (he nods...)
                        I’ve got the rooms, the beds, the clock 
                        radios...  I have a basketball.
                        (pause)
                        I also called Al;  he says he might come 
                        down and be the cook.

                                 SUE
                        So it’ll be like an Asian-themed--?

                                 MIKE
                        Soup kitchen.  Yeah.

                                 SUE
                        Wow.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ve already bought like 300 pounds of 
                        noodles.  To get us started.

           He takes out a photo and shows it to her.  C.U. On the photo, 
           showing five 60-pound bags of noodles piled in the motel 
           lobby.

           She regards him, in love.  And then...with a small smile:

                                 SUE
                        You know, you don’t have to buy the 
                        noodle.  Once you get approved, they’ll 
                        donate it.

                                 MIKE
                        Who will?

                                 SUE
                        Noodle companies.

                                 MIKE
                        ...Oh.
                        (pause)
                        So maybe I could use your help.

           Beat.  Mike speaks softly:

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        I really love you, Sue.  And I wanna take 
                        care of you.  And whoever that is inside 
                        of you.
                        (pause)
                        I wanna live with you.
                        (pause)
                        I wanna live.

                                 SUE 
                        Me too.

           They smile at the corniness of what they’ve just said...(Mike 
           perhaps even mutters to himself how stupid that must’ve 
           sounded.)  Beat.

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        I wrote you a haiku.  In my head.

                                 MIKE
                        Really?

                                 SUE
                        (she nods, and then:)
                        You wanna hear it?

                                 MIKE
                        Sure.

           She clears her throat, closes her eyes....then speaks shyly.

                                 SUE
                        “Mike, oh Mike, my man
                        Keeps showing up, like UPS
                        Sue, you’re such a bitch”

           She looks up....

                                 SUE (cont'd)
                        It’s elongated, so there’s a little more.

                                 MIKE
                        “My noble risk.  My leap of faith.  He 
                        is, down deep, my love”

           Mike is near tears.  He looks up at her;  so is she.

                                 MIKE (cont'd)
                        ...Breathe, Sue.  Just keep breathing.

           She keeps crying...and tries to breathe:  Deep, slow breaths, 
           slowly regaining some composure......

           She now looks out onto the quiet street before them;  Mike 
           half turns, looking also.  Beat....

                                 SUE 
                        It’s nice, no?

                                 MIKE
                        ...Yeah.

           Beat.  After a moment, Sue very casually lets her hand rest 
           upon Mike’s left buttock, not squeezing, not pulling, just 
           there.  They are side-by-side, her hand on his butt, facing 
           the street, and they just remain there like that, 
           simple......as the--

           CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK, into the street and up...as they 
           just stand, quite still...and the CAMERA RECEDES, UP AND 
           AWAY...as the beginning chords of Neil Young’s Keep on 
           Rockin’ in the Free World FADE IN....

                                                         (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (6)

           --and the CAMERA CONTINUES RECEDING, farther and farther and 
           farther away...until we can barely see them standing there, 
           on this empty residential street in the middle of the state 
           of Maryland, on the east coast of America...

           THE END
