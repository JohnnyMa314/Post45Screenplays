           Darkness.  A soft murmur of trickling water.

           SUPER: “Between the years 1884 and 1885 a series of killings 
           occurred in Austin, Texas astonishing in their brutality and 
           calculation.  There was no precedent: no motive, no 
           connection between the victims, no word to describe this kind 
           of crime - the first recorded serial killings in American 
           history.  This is a true story.” 

           The sound of quick breaths approaching, boots slapping stone.  
           And it becomes clearer where this darkness is...

           INT. SEWERS - NIGHT

           The footsteps come to a halt.  Quiet.  Shine of dull metal. 

           The strike of a match reveals a long COLT REVOLVER in the 
           hand of EDMUND HARRISON (35) - tall and lean, with the 
           glacial eyes of a wolf.

           He leans against the damp brick, eyes darting, and clicks 
           through the cylinder of the pistol, feeding in two bullets.

           He cocks the hammer.  Flicks the match hissing into the water 
           at his feet.  Darkness again.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Moonlight shines from small grates in the ceiling, the only 
           light.

           Edmund creeps through.  Deeper.  

           He pauses, hearing something.  Searches.

           A MAN in a long coat bursts from a recess in the wall beside 
           him.  The gun FIRES as he slams into Edmund, knocking them 
           both into the water.  The pistol spins away.

           Flash of a LONG BLADE.  Edmund ducks, SPARKS fly as it 
           scrapes the brick where his head was.   

           They struggle, tooth and nail.  The man is an animal.  Little 
           can be seen of his face, save the shine of his barred teeth.  
           He drools in anticipation, the knife pressing closer to 
           Edmund’s throat.

           Edmund gets a boot under the man and kicks him away, then 
           scrambles for the fallen pistol.
                                                                  (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)           He spins back with it, and FIRES, just as the man runs into a 
           side tunnel.

           Edmund charges in after him, an animal himself.  

           SIDE TUNNEL

           Edmund races through the darkness.

                                 EDMUND
                        You think you can run!

           BAM - muzzle flash as he fires into the tunnel ahead.

                                 EDMUND
                        You think there’s a place in this 
                        world you can run from me!

           Another shot lights up his face, savage and unhinged.

           INT. DIRTY ROOM - DAY

           SUPER: NEW YORK CITY, 1884

           Stone walls with carved graffiti.  A gob of tobacco juice 
           spatters the dusty floor...  

           Three dire-looking THUGS sit around one side of a small 
           table, glancing at their poker hands.  

           Two of them fold.  The final thug wipes his greasy mustache 
           and tosses a few coins into the pot - now revealed to be only 
           a handful of pennies.

                                 THUG
                        Call.

           He slaps down his cards - two pair.

           At the other end of the table sits Edmund, a surprising 
           counterpoint of style in his crisp black tuxedo.  A wall of 
           IRON BARS behind him.

           This is a JAIL CELL.

           He fans out his hand on the table - three aces.

           The thick body of a POLICEMAN appears at the bars.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Harrison.  You made bail.

                                 EDMUND
                          (to thug)
                        Getting closer there, Bill.

           With a wink, Edmund swipes the pennies into his hand and 
           walks out.

           INT. JAIL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           The DESK ATTENDANT slides Edmund’s pocket possessions to him - 
           a slim bankroll, flask, pocket watch, and a small ivory-
           handled knife.

           DOLAN, the rigid young reporter who sprung him, flips through 
           the New York Times, waiting.  This apparently is nothing new.

                                 DOLAN
                        So the councilman’s affair went 
                        well, then?  So few end in 
                        incarceration.  

           Edmund checks the flask - empty.

                                 EDMUND
                          (glances at newspaper 
                           headline)
                        Turns out my father’s political 
                        exposes don’t go over well with the 
                        exposed.

                                 DOLAN
                          (glances at the cuff of 
                           Edmund’s shirtsleeve)
                        Or maybe next time you should just 
                        leave the aces on the table where 
                        they belong.  

                                 EDMUND
                        Another theory.

                                 DOLAN
                        Well, this reporter has actual 
                        reporting to do.  But speaking of 
                        your father...

           He tosses Edmund a necktie and a comb.

                                 DOLAN
                        The emperor’s been hunting for you - 
                        he requests an audience.

           Dolan walks away.

                                 EDMUND
                        Does he.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Men in dark overcoats and bowler hats bustling through a 
           dusting of snow in front of the NEW YORK TIMES BUILDING.

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES BUILDING, OFFICE - DAY

           A lordly editor sits making pencil edits to an article - 
           JAMES B. HARRISON (65), journalistic integrity in a 
           waistcoat.

           There is a knock on the door and James beckons to enter 
           without looking up.  Edmund, cleaned up, steps in and sits, 
           as though entering a church.

                                 EDMUND
                        You wanted to see me, Father?

                                 JAMES
                          (still making edits)
                        If there is a problem with your 
                        watch, I would be pleased to 
                        furnish you with another.

                                 EDMUND
                        My fault entirely.  Burning the 
                        midnight oil on the zoning 
                        commission piece.

                                 JAMES
                        The time to write and take leave of 
                        your wages at the poker dens.  How 
                        you continue to inspire us all.

           That wounds Edmund, but he takes it with a crooked grin.

                                 JAMES 
                        May I see I it?

                                 EDMUND
                        A few touches to make.  I’ll have 
                        it on your desk by five.
                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)           James finally looks up at his son.  In his eyes - love just 
           under disappointment and pain.  He stands and looks out at 
           the flurries of snow in the window.

                                 JAMES
                        Is that last night’s whiskey I 
                        smell on your breath or this 
                        morning’s?

           Edmund doesn’t answer, staring at a PORTRAIT of a frail-
           looking woman on the wall.

                                 JAMES
                        Self-destruction, Edmund, is the 
                        lowest form of cowardice.

                                 EDMUND
                        May we save today’s lecture until 
                        after lunch.

                                 JAMES
                        No.  No more lectures.

           James tosses a TRAIN TICKET into Edmund’s lap.

                                 JAMES
                        Your train leaves at six.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                          (beat)
                        Excuse me?

                                 JAMES
                        I’m sending you to Texas.  My 
                        friend down at the Austin Statesman 
                        tells me they’ve broken ground on a 
                        new capitol building that is 
                        evidently quite the historic 
                        undertaking.  

                                 EDMUND
                        So have the Statesman wire you a 
                        story.

                                 JAMES
                        The arrangements have been made.

                                 EDMUND
                        For this pablum?  You’re joking.  

           James turns to him with a withering glare.
           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 JAMES
                        Heaven forbid you should learn to 
                        take a thing in this world 
                        seriously.  With the loss of your 
                        mother...

           James chokes up.  Edmund’s eyes fall to the floor like a 
           beaten dog’s.  Something unspoken here.

                                 JAMES
                        I take responsibility for my 
                        failures as a father.  But I have 
                        allowed you to ride my coattails 
                        into negligence and lassitude for 
                        far too long.  Your descent is 
                        beyond my understanding, but 
                        perhaps not my influence.  Now, 
                        son, you will learn to sing for 
                        your supper or go hungry.

           Edmund, silent, stares out at the blur of snow in the window.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Warm lantern light flickers over lace curtains blowing at an 
           open window and young Edmund (8), tucked into bed.  His eyes 
           are full of confusion and worry.

           He watches his MOTHER (the same from the portrait), sitting 
           beside him - a woman of striking but brittle beauty, hair 
           falling from its pins.  A trembling smile and vacant eyes.  
           Her hands work at something (unseen).

                                 MOTHER
                          (singing)
                        ...They say I hang for money.  But 
                        saying so is funny.  I’d hang the 
                        highway robber.  I’d hang the 
                        burgler-jobber--

           The tune comes out like a lullaby, despite its grim lyrics.

                                 MOTHER
                        --I’d hang the noted liar.  I’d 
                        hang the bloated friar--

                                 EDMUND
                        Mother, what’s wrong?

           She pats his leg, eyes still on her work.
                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 MOTHER
                        --Come hang, come haul together.  
                        Come hang for finer weather.  I’d 
                        hang the brutal mother.  I’d hang 
                        her and no other--

           Tears well in Edmund’s eyes.  She stands.

                                 EDMUND
                        Mama, stop.

                                 MOTHER
                        --I’d hang to make things jolly--

           She sits on the windowsill, her work now revealed - a NOOSE 
           around her neck.  Edmund stares helplessly.

                                 MOTHER
                        --I’d hang all wrong and folly.

           She leans back, falling from the window, and a split-second 
           later the rope SNAPS TAUT.  The curtains waft gently.

           INT. AFFLUENT BEDROOM - DAY

           Edmund (adult) starts awake, slouched in a chair.  A 
           nightmare.  

           Beside him on the bed lies an open suitcase with two liquor 
           bottles and little else.  The room is well appointed, but 
           holds a palpable feeling of loneliness.  

           He picks up the train ticket, looks it over, and glances up 
           at the window.   

           A distant TRAIN WHISTLE. 

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           A SCREAM of steam as a massive locomotive comes to a stop 
           beneath a grim, grey sky.

           Edmund steps off with others onto the dusty boards, crisp and 
           cool in a black suit.  

           SUPER: AUSTIN, TEXAS - NEW YEAR’S EVE 

           He lights a thin cigar, and dodges out of the way as a DIRTY 
           MAN AND WOMAN lead a spooked horse from one of the freight 
           cars.
                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                 EDMUND
                        Learn to control your animal.

                                 DIRTY WOMAN
                        The fuck did you say?

                                 EDMUND
                        I wasn’t talking to you.

           He steps away into the throng as his comment sinks in.

                                 BOY (O.S.)
                        You Harrison?

           He turns to find a teenage BOY in front of a CARRIAGE.

                                 BOY
                        Compliments of the mayor.  C’mon.

           EXT. CONGRESS AVENUE - LATER

           Horses with haggard riders clomp along the dirt street - then 
           a bell rings as STREETCAR rides by, startling a couple of 
           them.  Austin: a rowdy western town emerging as a city.  

           Edmund’s carriage rolls through.  The boy sits at the reins, 
           giving him the nickel tour.

                                 BOY 
                        New York Times, huh?  You here to 
                        write about the new capitol 
                        building?

           He jerks his head back at a substantial CONSTRUCTION PROJECT 
           at the end of the avenue.

                                 EDMUND
                        Write’s a strong verb.

                                 BOY
                        Set to be even bigger than the one 
                        in Washington D.C.

                                 EDMUND
                        So I’m told.

                                 BOY
                        180 shops on Congress Avenue, the 
                        University of Texas, Millett’s 
                        Opera House, gas lighting, new 
                        sewer system.  
                                 (MORE)
                                            (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 BOY(cont'd)
                        Why, Mayor Robertson calls Austin 
                        “the Athens of the West.”

           Edmund sips from a flask, eyeing a toothless old Indian in 
           front of a shop drooling tobacco juice.

                                 EDMUND
                        Very cultivated.

           They pass a cross-street of taverns and suspicious-looking 
           salons.

                                 EDMUND
                        What’s this here?

                                 BOY
                        Guy Town.  A carbuncle on the face 
                        of our city, rotten with vice and 
                        iniquity.  Nothing to interest a 
                        gentleman, sir.

           Edmund nods, keenly interested.  

                                 EDMUND
                        Of course.

           They roll on past the 

           WEED FUNERAL PARLOR

           Where a large black man, HENRY BELL (35), stands on the 
           walkway.  He has a powerful frame, but the eyes of a defeated 
           man.

           A black woman, REBECCA RAMEY (33), adjusts his collar, to his 
           discomfort.  There is an icy love between them, but one of 
           siblings, rather than lovers.

                                 HENRY
                        Just gonna get mussed again.

                                 REBECCA
                        You know you ain’t gotta keep doing 
                        this.  Mr. Weed’s offered you some 
                        good work here with us.

                                 HENRY
                        Good money ain’t in good work.

                                 REBECCA
                        You and I both know this ain’t 
                        about any money no more.

           A young girl, MARY RAMEY (11), runs up from the alley.
                                                  (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                 MARY
                        Uncle Henry, you gonna be back 
                        before midnight?  Mama said I can 
                        stay up till midnight tonight.

           Henry takes a knee beside her.

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t think so, honey.  Uncle 
                        Henry’s gotta work late - big 
                        night.  But you ring it in with 
                        your mama.  And I’ll see you in 

           He gives her a playful wink, and stands.  VALENTINE WEED 
           (70), a kindly white man, steps out of the building wiping 
           his hands.  Henry slips on his hat and nods to him.

           With one last glance at Rebecca’s stone face, Henry heads 
           toward the Guy Town street.  

                                 WEED
                        No luck, huh?

           Rebecca takes up a broom and starts to sweep the walkway.

           walk away, head down, through the street.  

           INT. DRISKILL HOTEL - LATER

           Edmund checks in, beneath a massive buffalo head mounted on 
           the wall, as the boy brings in his bags. 

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Pleased to have you, Mr. Harrison.  
                        And how long will you be with us in 
                        Austin?

                                 EDMUND
                        Does your watch have a second hand?

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON (O.S.)
                        His bill is on me, James.

           mustached man, and ALBERT HANCOCK (50) approaching.  
           Robertson shakes Edmund’s hand.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        J.W. Robertson.

                                 EDMUND
                        Mayor.  A pleasure.  Edmund--

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Harrison.  Your father’s name needs 
                        no introduction.

                                 HANCOCK
                          (shakes Edmund’s hand)
                        Nor does his paper.  Albert 
                        Hancock, editor-in-chief - Austin 
                        Statesman.  I’m a great admirer of 
                        your old man.  Hell of a legacy, my 
                        boy.

           These comments cut Edmund, but he holds a placid smile.

                                 EDMUND
                        It appears the rumors of Texas 
                        hospitality are true.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Press is the fuel that feeds the 
                        furnace of a growing city.  
                          (beat)
                        We are at your disposal, sir, and 
                        would love to host you for supper 
                        tomorrow - a new day in the new 
                        year.

           Robertson hands Edmund an ENVELOPE - CASH peeking out.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        For incidentals.

           He holds his hands there on Edmund’s so there is no mistaking 
           - a bribe.  Edmund pockets it.

                                 EDMUND
                        And what a lovely city it is.

           A crowded Guy Town saloon and whorehouse, its patrons getting 
           a jumpstart on holiday revelry.  On the upstairs railing, 
           PROSTITUTES advertise their goods.

           Edmund sits at a table playing poker with four COWBOYS.  He 
           doesn’t seem to be doing well.  The hand is down to him and 
           one of the drunks - lots of cash on the table.

                                 EDMUND
                          (putting in more cash)
                        Call.

           He lays out his cards, nervously tapping his foot - three 
           Jacks.  The cowboy tosses his on top, winks - flush.

                                 DRUNK COWBOY
                        Maybe dice is your game.

           Edmund downs his drink.

                                 EDMUND
                        Gentlemen.  A Happy New Year to 
                        you.
                          (stands)
                        Choke on it.

           He makes his way to the BARTENDER.

                                 EDMUND
                        Another.  

           He notices a woman enter - EULA PHILLIPS (32).  She has a 
           pale, aching beauty.  Their eyes briefly meet as she skirts 
           up the stairs.

           His drink arrives, pulling him back.  Much of the crowd 
           starts to move to a side door and down stairs there.

                                 EDMUND
                          (to bartender)
                        What’s the game?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Fight night.

           Edmund checks Robertson’s envelope - a couple of bills still 
           there.  He slams his drink.
                                                (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)           INT. DUST DEVIL, BACKROOM - LATER

           Muffled howls and stomps of a raucous crowd filter in from 
           outside.  Henry sits shirtless, listening.  

           A WEDDING RING hangs on a chord around his neck.  He watches 
           it swing, catching the lantern light.

           He slips it off into his pocket.  Stands, spits, and cracks 
           his neck, ready.

           INT. DUST DEVIL, BASEMENT - LATER

           Sawdust, sweat.  An audience barking madly around a makeshift 
           boxing ring and the bareknuckle battle inside -- Henry taking 
           a too-easy beating from a big, ugly GERMAN (intercut between 
           ring and spectators).

           Edmund stands in the ringside crush, glancing at the odds 
           board.  He winces as Henry takes one across the jaw.  

                                 EDMUND
                        C’mon, hit the flabby fuck!

           A viper-ish, mustached lawman, MARSHAL GROOMS LEE (45), tin 
           star on his vest, laughs and claps as Henry takes another 
           hit.  

           Henry sees this.  POW!  The German nails him again.

           Henry staggers - and delivers a devastating uppercut.  The 
           German is knocked back.  Henry lays into him.  The crowd 
           HOOTS.  Edmund seizes the man beside him and shakes him in 
           excitement.  Henry is oblivious to everything, all animal 
           fury.  

           Henry is suddenly aware of the pulp of the man’s face, the 
           jeering of the crowd, the SALOON KEEPER staring daggers at 
           him.  

           Henry PANTS.  And pants and pants, waiting for the German to 
           deck him.  

           The German finally delivers the “knock out” punch, SPATTERING 
           Edmund with sweat and blood, and Henry obligingly falls.  

           The wobbly German holds up his arms and nearly collapses as 
           the REF spits with disgust and erases the name “HENRY BELL” 
           from the chalkboard around his neck.

                        Goddamn it.  Every fuckin’ time 
                        with this fella.  No heart.

           Edmund’s empty envelope falls to the floor.  Spectators head 
           for the door.  Edmund lingers, looking at Henry’s bleeding 
           face on the wooden floor boards.  Henry’s defeat.

           INT. DUST DEVIL, BACK HALLWAY - LATER

           The Saloon Keeper has a chat with Henry.

                                 SALOON KEEPER
                        What got into you, you dumb son of 
                        a bitch?  You was one cunt hair 
                        away from flattening that kraut.    

                                 HENRY
                        I’m sorry, sir.  I... overestimated 
                        him.

                                 SALOON KEEPER
                        Well I better not see no more 
                        “overestimation.”  ‘Cause I can get 
                        as good a game outta one of them 
                        corn cob niggers out back.

           Henry nods, eyes on the floor.  Saloon Keeper hands him some 
           cash.

                                 SALOON KEEPER (CONT’D)
                        Now go work the door and earn my 
                        good goddamn graces.

           Saloon Keeper leaves.  Henry looks down at the money.  Blood 
           drips onto it from a cut on his mouth.  He spits and heads 
           into the

           SALOON ROOM

           Past Edmund at the bar, who pulls out a few coins.

                                 EDMUND
                          (to bartender)
                        Bourbon.  The bottle.

           It arrives.  Edmund pours a drink.

                                 EDMUND
                        You believe in New Year’s 
                        resolutions?

                        Not in this business.

           Edmund drinks.  He looks up at himself in the bar mirror.  
           There he sees Eula trying to slip through the bar crowd.  

           Drunk Cowboy stops her, pulls her close.

                                 DRUNK COWBOY
                        How ‘bout a dance, honey?

           EXT. DUST DEVIL - NIGHT

           Henry is stationed at the door.  He massages his fist.  Lee 
           comes lumbering out with his DRUNKEN FRIENDS.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Not bad down there, boy.  Hell, for 
                        a minute I was afraid you’d dusted 
                        off some balls.

           He pulls a bill from his winnings and tucks it in Henry’s 
           pocket.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        A gratuity.

           Henry says nothing.  Abruptly there is a change in Lee’s 
           demeanor.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        He beat the manners outta you too?

           This could get very ugly very fast.

                        Thank you, sir.

           LEE grins with a wink and fans his money.

                                 LEE
                          (to men)
                        I don’t know about you fairies, but 
                        this could be the start to one hell 
                        of a year.

           They go on their way.  Henry glances at a commotion

           INSIDE

           Where Eula tries to politely fight off the Drunk Cowboy.
                                          (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 EULA
                        C’mon now, I need to get home.  
                        Plenty of ladies here you can twirl 
                        with.

                                 DRUNK COWBOY
                        Don’t go proper on me, girl.  What, 
                        you fuck but don’t dance?

                                 EDMUND (O.S.)
                        I love to.

           Cowboy turns just as Edmund spins him hard against the wall.

                                 EDMUND
                        Have to warn you, though--

           Edmund holds a small ivory-handled KNIFE at the man’s belly.

                                 EDMUND
                         --I’m murder on a girl’s feet.

           Cowboy’s eyes raise from the knife to Edmund’s face, his hand 
           slowly moving behind him - towards a PISTOL in his belt 
           there.

           Edmund is jerked back by Henry.

           EXT. DUST DEVIL - CONTINUOUS

           Henry pulls Edmund out.

                                 EDMUND
                        What’re you--

                                 HENRY
                        Walk.

           He shoves Edmund into the street.

                                 EDMUND
                        You’re gonna defend that prick?

                                 HENRY
                        I’m doing my job.  Unless you want 
                        to find out what happens to the man 
                        holding a knife in a gunfight. 

                                 EDMUND
                        And here I thought your job was 
                        taking dives.
                                      (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)           Edmund sees Eula watching him from inside, and clams up.  He 
           tips his hat and heads down the street.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

           A young black woman, MOLLIE SMITH (25), walks carrying a 
           bundle of firewood.  It is quiet, but distantly there is the 
           whooping and crying of a party.

           She is passed by an elderly BLACK MAN driving a carriage.

                                 BLACK MAN
                        Missing the ball, Molly?  Heck 
                        Culler’s cousin from Louisiana is 
                        the devil’s own fiddler.

                                 MOLLIE SMITH
                        These bones is tired.  The devil 
                        will just have to wait till next 
                        year.

           The driver chuckles and canters away.  Mollie walks on.  A 
           DARK FIGURE watches her from the shadows across the street.

           MONTAGE - MIDNIGHT

           1) Couples in formal wear spin elegantly across a lavish 
           ballroom.

           2) The man from the street (face unseen) slips into a long 
           tarpaulin coat.  TATTOOS visible on his wrists as he pulls on 
           a pair of black gloves.

           3) Edmund stumbles through revelers with a liquor bottle.

           4) Prostitutes on a Guy Town balcony share a bottle of rum.

           5) Crystal champagne glasses come together in a toast.

           6) The man slowly pushes open a door, revealing a black 
           couple sleeping inside - Mollie.  The man stands with his 
           hands to his sides.  In one is a HATCHET, in the other a 
           metal SPIKE.

           7) POP! Champagne plumes from a bottle.

           8) BLOOD SPRAYS on the wall; the hatchet pulls back and comes 
           down again, harder. 

           9) BLAM! Henry looks up.  Gunfire and firecrackers.  The 
           party is getting wild.  He ignores it.
                                                  (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)           10) The city.  Cheers and laughter in the street, as 
           fireworks burst and sparkle over the Congress Avenue bridge.

           EXT. ALLEY - MORNING

           Edmund lolls asleep against a building in the blue early 
           morning light.  His head bobs back and thuds against the 
           brick, rudely waking him into a monumental hangover.

           Henry, turns the corner and heads down the alley.  He looks 
           down at Edmund.

                                 EDMUND
                        Well, if it isn’t the cavalier who 
                        saved me from certain thrashing.

                                 HENRY
                        And the asshole who deserved one.

                                 EDMUND
                        Spare an arm?

           Henry reluctantly tugs him up, and continues on his way.  
           Edmund pulls his watch chain - the watch is missing.

                                 EDMUND
                          (mutters)
                        An auspicious start.

           The RINGING of a police bell around the corner stops him.

           EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           A DEPUTY holds back a small buzzing crowd.  Henry and Edmund 
           approach.  Henry pauses a moment looking down - his foot in a 
           thin stream of BLOOD running into a sewer grate.

           A man in the crowd turns and vomits.  Edmund takes his place.

                                 EDMUND
                        Jesus...

           Before them lies the battered, blood-drenched body of Mollie 
           Smith, sprawled awkwardly in the dirt, her nightshirt hiked 
           up to her hips.  Her skull is SPLIT OPEN, her ear PUNCTURED.

           Edmund stares for a long beat, then quickly regains his 
           senses, sober and sharp.  He pads his coat for pencil and 
           paper, and grabs the arm of a nearby black man.
           (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what happened here?  
                        Were you witness?

           The man looks him over suspiciously, the only white man 
           present other than the deputy, then walks off.

           Henry looks down at the body - and immediately turns away.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                          (to deputy)
                        You.  Were you first on the scene?

           The pale deputy can only stare stunned at the corpse.  Edmund 
           searches around.  He sees Henry slowly backing away.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Back up, all of you!  Get on!

           Lee rides up and dismounts.  Edmund watches Henry a moment 
           more, then turns to Lee, who coldly surveys the scene.

                                 EDMUND
                        Marshal, could I get a statement in 
                        a moment?

                                 LEE
                        In a moment you’ll be collectin’ 
                        your dick from the dirt.

           Edmund relents.  He looks around.  Lee has scared off most of 
           the people.  A crow on a branch meets Edmund’s eye.  

           Then he spies Henry beyond it, quickly walking away.  

           EXT. WEED FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY

           Henry, Weed (in his funeral attire), Mary, and Rebecca, sit 
           on the porch, watching Mollie Smith’s family carry her pine 
           COFFIN out to a flatbed wagon.  

           Mollie’s somber FATHER walks up to Weed and shakes his hand.

                                 MOLLIE’S FATHER
                        I want to thank you again for what 
                        you done for us.  I wish I could...  
                        Times are tough.

                                 WEED
                        I know.  Not another word on it.
                                        (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)           Her father nods, tips his cap to all, and returns to his 
           family.

                                 HENRY
                        You dressed the body?

           Weed nods.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        So you seen her.  You seen what 
                        they done to her.

                                 WEED
                        Yeah.  I did.

                                 MARY
                        What did they do to her?

                                 REBECCA
                        Nothin’, honey.  C’mon, let’s go 
                        get us some of that lemonade.

           Mary goes inside.

                                 HENRY
                          (to Rebecca)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 REBECCA
                        It’s all right.  World’s gonna 
                        break her heart some day.

           She pats Henry on the shoulder and heads in too.

                                 WEED
                        I’d like to disagree with her...

           They watch as the family follows the slow wagon past a group 
           of NEWSBOYS brazenly selling their latest vulgar headlines.  
           Salt in the wounds.

                                 NEWSBOYS
                        Bloody Work!  A fearful midnight 
                        murder!  The New Year’s massacre!  
                        Details here!  

           Weed stands with a sigh and trudges inside.  Henry continues 
           to watch the weeping mourners disappear in the dust.

           Down the street beyond them stands the...

CAPITOL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           A CONTRACTOR gives Edmund a tour of the grounds what at this 
           stage is mainly torn up ground and chunks of foundation.  
           Edmund listens and takes notes with minimal interest.

                                 CONTRACTOR
                        The first stone screwed us.  
                        Discoloring iron particles all 
                        through it.  Unusable.  So the 
                        owners of Granite Mountain offered 
                        the state enough red granite for 
                        the job.  Problem is it’s a much 
                        harder stone to work with and 
                        kicked up the cost all around.  
                        Which is why we’re making use of 
                        another of the state’s vast natural 
                        resources.

           He sweeps his arm at a large assortment of LABORERS you 
           probably wouldn’t invite to the opera.

                                 EDMUND
                        Isn’t it dangerous, though, 
                        bringing this much convict labor to 
                        the most populous settlement for 
                        hundreds of miles?

                                 CONTRACTOR
                        Ain’t been trouble yet.  Marshal 
                        Lee keeps a close eye on ‘em.  

           He nods to a man on horseback in the distance watching the 
           workers - Lee, his stony face indecipherable.

                                 EDMUND
                        What about the recent murder?  It 
                        would seem you’ve got a hundred 
                        suspects right here.

                                 CONTRACTOR
                        Suspects?  No, all these fellas is 
                        white.
                          (beat)
                        C’mon, I’ll show you the plans.

           Edmund takes notes, more interested.  He follows the man, 
           with a glance back at Lee smoking on his horse.

NICE NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING

           Beautiful, warm homes on a tree-lined street.  A very 
           different neighborhood.  One particularly nice house stands 
           out...

           INT. MAYOR ROBERTSON’S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - EVENING

           Edmund sits at a grand dinner affair, with Mayor Robertson 
           and wife, Marshal Lee, and Albert Hancock and his wife.  Two 
           black servant women stand in the shadows. 

           From the imported crystal to the carefully waxed point of a 
           mustache, the room breathes with an obsession with appearance 
           and control.

                                 ROBERTSON’S WIFE
                        We’re delighted you could join us, 
                        Mr. Harrison.  Your family’s 
                        reputation is no stranger even in 
                        these parts.

                                 EDMUND
                        A pack of lies, I assure you.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        “These parts,” really.  In five 
                        years we’ll be the new Pittsburgh.  
                        And in ten San Francisco!  I’d be 
                        interested in the opinion of an 
                        outsider.  How do you find our 
                        little Athens of the West here?

                                 EDMUND
                        Ah, Athens.  Indeed, mayor.  It’s 
                        all Greek to me.

                                 HANCOCK
                          (chuckles)
                        Yes, I suppose our frontier edges 
                        remain a little raw yet.

           Lee downs his glass of wine.  His careless dress and demeanor 
           stand out from his rigid friends and family.

                                 LEE
                        I rather like it that way.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        A romantic notion, Grooms, but a 
                        doomed one; 
                                 (MORE)
                                            (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON(cont'd)
                        the West and its anarchy are dying.  
                        Progress breeds order, and order, 
                        progress.  I would think a lawman 
                        would be the very spearhead for 
                        such advancements.   

                                 LEE
                        I’ll leave the spears to the spear-
                        chuckers.

                                 EDMUND
                        Speaking of raw, I ran across quite 
                        a scene this morning on Pecan 
                        Street.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                          (attempting to dismiss)
                        Hm, yes, a dreadful incident.

                                 ROBERTSON’S WIFE
                        Pardon?

                                 EDMUND
                        Mollie Smith.

           She chews on the name - nothing.  

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        The murdered negro woman.

                                 ROBERTSON’S WIFE
                        Oh!  Yes.  Ghastly.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        And precisely what I’m talking 
                        about.  This is a perfect example 
                        of the kind of negro criminal 
                        element that needs to be dealt with 
                        in order for this city to fully 
                        shed its cloak of frontier 
                        provinciality and elevate us as a 
                        home of industry and culture. 

                                 EDMUND
                        How do you figure?

           Lee watches Edmund with thinly veiled contempt.

                                 LEE
                        You’re a university man, Edmund.  
                        Addition through subtraction.  
                        Shouldn’t be too hard to figure.  
                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 HANCOCK
                        Cloven right down the middle, 
                        that’s what I hear.  Something 
                        driven in the ear.

           The Mayor gives Hancock a sly but hard look to shut up.  He 
           gets the idea.

                                 HANCOCK’S WIFE
                        Gentlemen, please, can’t we find a 
                        conversation more suitable than 
                        politics and murder.

                                 EDMUND
                        They do fit so well together, 
                        though, don’t they?

                                 HANCOCK
                        In any case, the matter is 
                        finished.  They arrested the 
                        villain responsible, this Brooks 
                        fellow - the woman’s husband.  Or 
                        ex-husband.  Who can keep track.  

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        An isolated trouble.  
                          (changing subject)
                        I trust your tour of the capitol 
                        construction went well?  Now 
                        there’s a story.

           Edmund gets the picture as well.  

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes.  Quite an undertaking.

           INT. SERVANTS’ QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Still.  Quiet.  A small black BOY sleeps on a cot.  His eyes 
           crack open, then fully.  He doesn’t move.

           The man in the tarpaulin coat stands in the corner, watching 
           him.  He is almost invisible in the darkness, except for a 
           GHOSTLY MASK, giving him the appearance of little more than a 
           scarecrow.

           The man steps up to the boy and kneels without a sound.  Even 
           at this distance, his eyes are hidden in the shadows of the 
           mask.  His gloved hand caresses the boy’s cheek, then raises 
           to his lips - shh.
           (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                (cid:13)           He pulls the blanket up over the boy’s head.  He stands and 
           steps to an open DOORWAY.  In the other room sleeps the boy’s 
           mother - ELIZA SHELLEY.    

           The man’s hands slip into his coat pockets.  He pulls them 
           out holding the SPIKE and HATCHET.

           INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DAY

           Edmund stands beside the gruff TELEGRAPH OPERATOR.

                                 EDMUND
                        Can you recite that back to me, 
                        please?

           The operator tosses down his pencil, frustrated, and reads.  
           Edmund listens, pacing.

                                 TELEGRAPH OPERATOR

                        You know how long this is gonna 
                        take?

                                 EDMUND
                        That last bit there...  How does 
                        that sound to you?

                        Grand.  He’ll swell with pride.  

           Edmund sighs, conflicted.  A COMMOTION outside.  Through the 
           window Edmund sees people flocking around the corner.

           EXT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Edmund steps outside.  A coarse LABORER smokes in the shade.

                                 EDMUND
                        What’s the ruckus?

                          (to Telegraph Operator)
                        Hold that!

           He dashes down the street.

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Edmund pushes through the muttering crowd.  He stops 
           suddenly.  

           Hanging halfway out of her doorway is the body of Eliza 
           Shelley.  Flies buzz around a deep gash over her right eye 
           and a small hole in her forehead.

           A PUDGY DEPUTY drapes a blanket over her, which rapidly soaks 
           through with BLOOD.

           Edmund takes a knee and closer look.  

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        ...no I didn’t see him last night, 
                        but he comes through here every day 
                        on his way to work.

                                 DEPUTY (O.S.)
                        Okay, thank you, ma’am.

           Staring down at the blood spreading across the blanket, 
           Edmund pulls a pad and pencil from his coat and begins to 
           take notes.  

           INT. MAYOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mayor Robertson leans at the window, looking down at shocked 
           people in the street crowded around newspapers.  

           Lee sits smoking behind him.  Deputy JOHN CHENNEVILLE, Lee’s 
           number two, stands hat in hand, almost at attention - a 
           greasy, conniving man.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Do you hear that sound?
                          (beat)
                        You don’t hear it, but I do.  Not 
                        much more than a faint buzzing.  A 
                        hum in the wires...
                                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)           He turns to Lee.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON (CONT’D)
                        Thunder.

           He picks up a NEWSPAPER from his desk and reads.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON (CONT’D)
                        “The Foul Fiends Keep Up Their 
                        Wicked Work.  Another Deed of 
                        Devilry...”

           He tosses the paper to Lee.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON (CONT’D)
                        I trust I don’t need to go on.

                                 LEE
                        I don’t read the papers.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        How about the goddamn writing on 
                        the wall?
                          (beat)
                        As if we’re not competing enough 
                        for business with San Antonio and 
                        Houston already.  Now this 
                        disgrace?  

           Lee gets up and pours himself a scotch.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Fucking Hancock...  As we speak 
                        this story is spreading like a 
                        virus across the country.  The 
                        blame must fall somewhere, and this 
                        office is not a comfortable spot.
                          (beat)
                        Perhaps it was a dream, but I 
                        somehow recollect fair visions of 
                        an arrest and a case closed.

                                 LEE
                        Wrong man, I reckon.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Do you!

           Robertson paces, trying to calm.
                              (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)

                        The past aside, Grooms, we 
                        presently need a satisfying outcome 
                        to this matter.  Lest we ALL be 
                        remembered as only footnotes in 
                        the...
                          (reading headline)
                        “Crimson Catalogue of Crime.”

           Robertson pours himself a drink also.  Sips.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        I can rein in Hancock and the 
                        press, keep this local.  But the 
                        negros responsible, well...  You do 
                        what you do.

           Lee eyes him and downs his drink.  He heads for the door.  

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                        We’ll take care of it, sir.

           EXT. BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           A shanty town of shacks and cabins tightly lining a muddy 
           path, where rarely a white face is seen.

           Edmund is there with his notepad.  He steps up to a black 
           woman dumping dish water.

                                 EDMUND
                        Excuse me.  I’m a reporter, may I 
                        ask you a few questions about the 
                        recent crimes?  Do you know--

           She walks back into a cabin and shuts the door.  

                                 EDMUND
                        Fuck.

           He sips from his flask - this isn’t going well.  Down the 
           road, he sees several people crowded around the doorway of a 
           small CABIN.  

           INT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS

           A group of black men and women excitedly discuss the murders.  
           Henry and Rebecca stand in the rear, just listening.

           One BEARDED MAN stands and draws attention.
                                             (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 BEARDED MAN
                        We can holler all we want about 
                        this, but what’re we gonna do about 
                        it?  The law sure as shit ain’t 
                        gonna do a damn thing, except 
                        railroad those they can, like 
                        Brooks. 

           He nods to LEM BROOKS, a bruised man sitting in the corner.  
           Brooks looks away.

                                 BEARDED MAN
                        This is in our hands, or no one’s.

           The crowd buzzes again.  Rebecca shakes her head and moves 
           for the door.  Henry listens a bit longer, looking like he 
           wants to speak, then starts to follow.

                                 BEARDED MAN
                        Henry.  You was cavalry, you hunted 
                        Indians all over this state.  You 
                        can help find these men. 

           Henry pauses.  He looks up at Rebecca, her pleading eyes.

                                 HENRY
                          (moving on)
                        That was a long time ago.  Just let 
                        it go.  

                                 BEARDED MAN
                        Let it go?!  After what happened to 
                        your wife I woulda thought you of 
                        all people would be out for blood.

           That stops Henry cold.  And sets Rebecca on fire.  She steps 
           back inside.

                                 REBECCA
                        You don’t know a fucking thing, 
                        least of all about blood!
                          (beat)
                        You keep up this hollering, the 
                        law’s gonna do a hell of a lot more 
                        than nothing.

           Henry pushes his way out the door - past Edmund, who heard it 
           all.

                                 REBECCA
                          (to crowd)
                        Go home.
                                (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)           She follows Henry down the street.  Edmund watches them go.

           EXT. REBECCA RAMEY’S CABIN - DAY

           Henry leans close to a small mirror hanging on the porch 
           post, shaving.  The ring dangles around his neck.

           Rebecca leans in the doorway.

                                 REBECCA
                        Talking justice...  Those people 
                        got no sense.

                                 HENRY
                        It ain’t about sense.

                                 REBECCA
                        No, it’s about pain.  Look for 
                        justice, and that’s all they’ll 
                        find.

           She looks at him in the mirror.

                                 REBECCA
                        You fighting that Irish fella 
                        tonight?

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah.

                                 REBECCA
                        Why?  What’re you looking for?

           Mary steps out, breaking the moment.

                                 MARY
                        Mama, will you brush my hair?

                                 REBECCA
                          (beat)
                        Yeah, baby, go get my brush.

           In the mirror Henry sees Lee and Chenneville riding up the 
           path.

           He spins, accidentally CUTTING himself, and sending the bowl 
           of shaving water CRASHING to the ground.  People slip 
           indoors.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Get inside.
                                                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                 LEE
                          (to neighborhood)
                        Henry Bell!

           Rebecca freezes, as does Henry.

                                 HENRY
                        Go.

           Rebecca takes Mary inside.  Henry shuts the door.  

           Lee and Chenneville trot up.  Chenneville dismounts and steps 
           up to Henry.  

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                        Looks like you got a wild razor 
                        there.  Jumped right up and bit ya.

           Henry finally notices his tense grip on the razor.   

                                 CHENNEVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you better put it away.

           Henry sees Rebecca watching in the window.  He folds the 
           razor up and sets it down.  Lee tosses a pair of SHACKLES at 
           Henry’s feet.

                                 LEE
                        Let’s have a chat.

           EXT. JAIL - CONTINUOUS

           Edmund argues with a YOUNG DEPUTY at the door.

                                 YOUNG DEPUTY
                        No press.  No exceptions.

                                 EDMUND
                        This is absurd!  What’s the 
                        evidence?  Is there ANY statement 
                        to be had here?

                                 YOUNG DEPUTY
                        Yeah: Get fucked.  End quote.

           Edmund gives up and walks away.

           ALLEY

           He tries to peek in one of the windows, but it’s too high.  
           It’s then he sees a BRAT KID pissing on the wall.
                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                 EDMUND
                        Hey, kid.
                          (pulls out a COIN)
                        Wanna make two bits?

           INT. JAIL, CELL - DAY

           Henry sits shackled at a table, sweaty, face bloody.  SMACK - 
           Chenneville slugs him.  Henry takes it, fuming.

                                 LEE
                        That’s enough.  Man takes beatings 
                        for a living.

           Lee sits across from Henry, rolling a cigarette.

                                 LEE
                        We got a witness described a man 
                        matches you.  Now, you want me 
                        asking the questions, or John here?

           Henry just stares him down.

           EXT. JAIL - MOMENTS LATER

           Young Deputy yawns.  A dirt clod nails him in the gut - brat 
           kid flips him off as he scampers away.

                                 YOUNG DEPUTY
                        You little bastard.

           He takes off after the kid.  Edmund emerges from the shadows 
           and slips into the building.

           INT. JAIL, OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Two POLICEMEN in plain clothes tear open a big paper package.  
           One pulls out a new BLUE POLICE UNIFORM, cringes.

                                 POLICEMAN #1
                        We gotta wear these things every 
                        day?  Chicago fuckin’ wool in 
                        Texas?

                                 POLICEMAN #2
                        Welcome to big city policing.

           Edmund skirts past their open door and down the hall.
                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)

JAIL, CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Lee paces.  Chenneville watches Henry with an anxious fist.

                                 LEE
                        I’ll ask you again - where were you 
                        that night?

                                 EDMUND (O.S.)
                        With me.

           They turn to find Edmund in the doorway, lighting a thin 
           cigar.  Henry’s just as surprised to see him.

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                        How the hell did you get in here?  
                        Fuckin’ Johnny...

                                 EDMUND
                        We played cards until three.  He 
                        took - ten dollars was it? 

                                 HENRY
                          (beat)
                        Twenty.

                                 EDMUND
                        Twenty.  Then passed out.  I had to 
                        see the poor sap home.
                          (to Henry)
                        You really should watch your drink, 
                        Henry.

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                        Bullshit.

           Chenneville steps to deal with Edmund.

                                 EDMUND
                        I think Mayor Robertson will find 
                        me a reliable alibi.  Don’t you, 
                        Marshal?

           Lee studies Edmund, whose posture and drift are unmistakable.

                                 LEE
                        Turn him loose.

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                        What?
                                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                 LEE
                        Do it.  Whole thing’s a jerk-off 
                        game anyway.

           Lee pushes through them and up the hall.  Chenneville 
           reluctantly pulls his keys out, steps to Henry.

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                        Watch yourself against that Irish 
                        fella tonight.
                          (pops the handcuffs)
                        An awful stubborn race, I hear.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Lee watches from a window, as Henry and Edmund step out of 
           the jail and down the street.  Edmund smokes, waiting for a 
           word from him.

                                 EDMUND
                        Please, no need to thank me.

                                 HENRY
                        There must be, because I don’t 
                        recollect you dragging me home or 
                        finding ten bills in my pocket.

                                 EDMUND
                        Twenty.

                                 HENRY
                        Well I ain’t got any, if that’s 
                        what you’re after.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want money.  Just a word.  
                        Please.

           Edmund motions Henry to a 

           SIDE ALLEY

           He speaks with a new sincerity.  

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        I’m at an impasse here.  I need 
                        this story, but the town is a 
                        mystery, and none of the negros 
                        will talk to me.  I need...   
                          (swallowing pride)

                        And you want me to help you.  Get 
                        your own pet nigger and all them 
                        darky gums’ll flap, huh?

                                 EDMUND
                          (you said it, not me)
                        Yes.

           Henry is about to leave.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        I want us to help each other.  
                          (beat)
                        I was at that meeting.  You tried 
                        to mind your business, and look 
                        where it landed you.  You just 
                        gonna ignore it all again?

                                 HENRY
                        And how you gonna help that?

           Edmund looks around as if it is completely obvious.

                                 EDMUND
                        I’m white.

           Henry almost bends, then heads down the alley.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        You saw that woman.

           Henry pauses, a nerve touched.  Edmund talks to his back.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        I see it when I sleep.
                          (beat)
                        This is a rough-and-tumble town, 
                        but these aren’t any card table 
                        killings or the work of drunken 
                        husbands.  They’re something else.  
                        And you know it.

           Henry forces himself on.

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t know nothin’.

                                 EDMUND
                        I see, you’ve been taking dives so 
                        long, you’ve forgotten how to 
                        fight!

Edmund throws 
           his cigar against the wall.

           INT. DUST DEVIL, BACKROOM - NIGHT

           SMACK. The crowd cries out as a bruised Henry hits the floor.

           He looks at his blood spattered there, as the ref counts him 
           out - Edmund’s words clearly on his mind.

           INT. REBECCA RAMEY’S CABIN - NIGHT

           Henry sits, rubbing his jaw.  Rebecca stands beside him.

                                 REBECCA
                        Who was he?

                                 HENRY
                        A reporter.

                                 REBECCA
                        And I don’t imagine he sprung you 
                        outta charity.

                                 HENRY
                        I told him no, what do you want 
                        from me?

           Henry stands and pours a glass of water.  He feels at a 
           bleeding cut on his lip.  She hands him a cloth.

                                 REBECCA
                        I want to know you ain’t gonna make 
                        this about her.

           She holds his gaze a moment, then walks into the back room.  

           LATER

           Rebecca and Mary have long gone to bed.  Henry sits in dark 
           thought, fist opening, closing, opening, closing.

           He opens his fist to reveal it contains the cord with his 
           wedding ring on it.  He puts the chain around his neck, eyes 
           staring hard at a small CHEST in the corner of the room.

                                                         CUT TO:

           The hinges on the chest creak like it hasn’t been opened in 
           years.  Henry digs under the folded CAVALRY UNIFORM inside.  
           His hand comes out holding an OILY RAG.
                                        (cid:13)

           INT. DRISKILL HOTEL, BAR - DAY

           Edmund sits brooding over a shot, presumably not his first.  

           Eula, the prostitute he had an encounter with earlier, passes 
           by the window.  She pauses, seeing him, then walks on.

           Edmund glances up at men playing cards across them room - you 
           can feel his itch - then back down at the drink.

                                 EULA (O.S.)

           He looks up.  Eula.

                        On the house.

           He slides her the shot.  She drinks it.

                        I never got to thank you for the 
                        other night.

           Edmund just waves the bartender over for another shot.  
           Around her, his demeanor seems to become shy, guarded.

                                 EULA

           He looks at her, surprised.

           She notices Henry standing in the saloon doorway.

                        Speaking of...

           Edmund turns, as she walks out past Henry with a wink.  The 
           bartender sees Henry.

                                 BARTENDER
                        No negroes allowed.

           Edmund and Henry share a look.

                                 EDMUND
                        He’s with me.

           EXT. STREET - EVENING

           Henry and Edmund walk through the black neighborhood.  Edmund 
           looks at the sad sights and suspicious eyes around him, 
           visibly uncomfortable.

                        Fine.

           INT. CABIN - LATER

           Lem Brooks sits at a small table with Edmund and Henry.  His 
           weathered old FATHER polishes boots in a rocking chair by the 
           window.  

                                 LEM BROOKS
                        She was a good woman Mollie.  
                        Better than me, but I guess she 
                        figured that out soon enough.  
                        Mollie...

           He trails off, choking on emotion.

                                 HENRY
                        You know anyone who’d want to hurt 
                        her, hurt her like that?

                                 LEM BROOKS
                        No.  And believe me I’ve thought on 
                        it.  If I knew, I’d surely...

           Lem’s jaw clenches.  Henry watches him with pity and 
           understanding.

                                 LEM BROOKS (CONT’D)
                        But no -- she were a hellcat, but a 
                        mouth don’t bring that on you.  

                                 EDMUND
                        Why did they pick you up as a 
                        suspect?

                                 LEM BROOKS
                          (shrugs)
                        I’ve had words with her husband.  
                        The dumb, drunk kind.  That - that 
                        night, he thought I stole her 
                        slippers.

                                 EDMUND
                        Slippers?

                                 LEM BROOKS
                        She couldn’t find her slippers 
                        afore she went to sleep.

                        I said, “Now what in the hell use 
                        would I have with her old 
                        slippers?”   

           Edmund writes “slippers?” on a notepad.  Henry gives him a 
           look.

                                 EDMUND
                        And do you know of any connection 
                        Mollie might have had with Eliza 
                        Shelley?  A shared -- admirer, 
                        perhaps?

                                 LEM BROOKS
                        I never heard of no Eliza Shelley 
                        myself.

           Lem’s MOTHER enters from a back room with a RED CANDLE.

                                 MOTHER
                        It wasn’t him.  It wasn’t my boy.

                                 HENRY
                        We know, ma’am.

           She sets the candle in the window and lights it, whispering a 
           prayer, then returns to the back room.  Lem shakes his head, 
           nods to the candle.

                                 LEM BROOKS
                        Ever since the killings she’s been 
                        lightin’ them things.  All the ol’ 
                        women have.  Bad spirits, they say.

           Henry looks at the candle and smiles.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah.  I used to know someone who 
                        did that too.

                                 FATHER
                        “Bad spirits.”  Bullshit.  Fuckin’ 
                        women...  This is a bad MAN.  Man 
                        with that kind of stomach, that 
                        kind of hate -- this is a man with 
                        the black fire of perdition in his 
                        soul.  

                                 LEM BROOKS

                        I seen a man wronged by his woman 
                        do foul, foul things, but I never 
                        seen anything like this kind of 
                        evil.  There ain’t no reason for 
                        him to do the things he did.  No 
                        reason you can hold up in the light 
                        of day.

           Lem shakes his head, but the words hold Edmund rapt.

           EXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER

           Henry and Edmund exit the Brooks’ home, and walk.  Edmund 
           looks over his notes.

                                 EDMUND
                        There has to be some connection 
                        with these women.  Someone they 
                        wronged.

                                 HENRY
                        Maybe Shelley’s people know more. 

           Edmund stares quizzically at one note - “Slippers.”  He looks 
           up at the houses around them - and the red candles burning in 
           the windows.

                                 EDMUND
                        “Bad spirits.”

           ACROSS THE STREET

           Lee questions a NEIGHBORHOOD MAN.

                                 LEE
                        ...The fellas that done this must 
                        have been covered with blood.  
                        You’re telling me you were on the 
                        streets all night of the killing 
                        and saw nobody?  

                                 NEIGHBORHOOD MAN
                        I swear.  It was graveyard dead.

                                 LEE
                        If you’re fuckin’ lying to me 
                        that’s right where you’ll be 
                        laying.

           Lee turns away to mount his horse, frustrated and stumped.  
           It’s then he sees Henry and Edmund walking away.  
                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)

SERVANTS’ CABIN - NIGHT

           Steam curling from a tub.  A black woman, IRENE CROSS (25), 
           humming, as she pours in a last bucket of hot water.  

           She removes a RIBBON from her hair and sets it on a table 
           next to a flickering candle, slips off her gown and steps 
           into the tub with a sigh.  

                                 IRENE
                          (eyes closed, sings 
                           softly)
                        O my good Lord's done been here / 
                        Blessed my soul and gone away / My 
                        good Lord's done been here / 
                        Blessed my soul and gone...

           There is a breeze and the candle goes out.  She opens her 
           eyes and looks around.  No one is there.  Nor is her ribbon.

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           Edmund noses around the scene where Eliza Shelley was 
           discovered.  He pushes at the door of a nearby warehouse, but 
           it’s boarded up.  Kneels by a sewer grate, looks into the 
           hissing blackness.

           He looks up at the yard and Shelley’s cabin, and steps over 
           there.  

           CRUNCH - broken glass under his boot.  He looks up at the 
           gaslight streetlamp above him - SMASHED.

           He takes a knee, studying the scene.  Dried BLOOD SPATTER on 
           the old picket fence.

           Sound of footsteps.  Henry.

                                 EDMUND
                        She was killed here.  Then dragged 
                        into the alley, where he...
                          (beat)
                        Same as first.

                                 HENRY
                        I went to Shelley’s family, but far 
                        as they knew she didn’t have 
                        nothin’ to do with Mollie Smith.

           Edmund shakes his head, perplexed.
           (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                 HENRY
                        But, the day before, her favorite 
                        scarf, the one her mama made her in 
                        slave times, goes missing.  This 
                        accordin’ to her boy.

                                 EDMUND
                        That’s a strange coincidence.

                                 HENRY
                        Or a strange system.

           Beat, as they ponder that one.  Edmund notices something in 
           the dirt - a broken FINGERNAIL.

                                 HENRY
                        She fought back.

           FLASH OF THAT NIGHT: 

           Eliza struggles with the dark figure, who holds his gloved 
           hand over her mouth.  Abject terror and desperation in her 
           wide eyes.

           She frees a hand, and rakes her nails across his face, 
           breaking one.

           The man recoils, and with a savage hiss swings his ax down - 
           a sickening, wet CRUNCH - blood arcs.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Edmund stares at the dried blood on the fence.

                                 EDMUND
                        The force in it all.  The anger.  
                        How can this not be personal?  How 
                        can there be no connection between 
                        victims?

                                 HENRY
                        Maybe it ain’t about them.

           Edmund examines the fingernail, noticing a SMALL BIT OF 
           MATTER under it.  His mind turns, staring off at the sun 
           burning down in the west.

           EXT. CITY - SUNSET

           The sky bleeding over the skeleton of the capitol.  Windows 
           latch and doors lock throughout the black neighborhood.
                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                (cid:13)           INT. DINGY ROOM - EVENING

           Two thick hands clasped in desperate prayer.  On his forearms 
           are two tattoos of Tahitian dancers with X’s for eyes.

           The man mumbles inaudible Latin.  The intensity of his prayer 
           devolves into a feeble whimper...

           Threaded around his fingers is the stolen RIBBON, so taut the 
           tips bulge white.

           INT. DRISKILL HOTEL, EDMUND’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Edmund sleeping fitfully.  Starts awake - bad dreams, bad 
           memories.  

           He turns up the lamp, and rubs his face.  His eyes fall on 
           the bloody fingernail resting on his handkerchief on the 
           desk.  

           EXT. DRISKILL HOTEL, EDMUND’S BALCONY - NIGHT

           Edmund leans on the railing with a bottle of bouron.  The 
           things he’s dealing with are clearly disturbing him deeply.  
           He lifts the bottle to his lips, just as--

           A woman’s SCREAM penetrates the night.

           SIDEWALK 

           Edmund’s bottle hits and SHATTERS.

           EXT. ALLEY - MINUTES LATER

           Growing commotion. Edmund races through the muck.  A 
           horrified black WOMAN runs away past him, back the way he 
           came.

                                 WOMAN
                        Not another.  My God, not again.

           He runs on, seeing the petrified figure of a TEENAGE BOY 
           ahead.  He reaches him and turns the

           CORNER

           To find the bloody body of Irene Cross lying in the mud, 
           skirt hiked up around her hips.  Her head a mess of gore, 
           hacked and gouged.
                                                               (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                (cid:13)           Edmund drops to his knees beside her.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                          (to teenage boy)
                        Doctor!  Now!

           The boy finally breaks his spell and runs.

           Edmund attempts to check her pulse, then pulls back, hand 
           covered with blood. 

           A crowd is gathering.  Henry bursts through them, panting 
           from a sprint.  Edmund looks up at him in shock.

           She GASPS.  Her swollen eyes snap open, wild.

                                 IRENE
                        Esau, have I hated...

           Her words are choked out as she coughs up blood.  Henry 
           breaks his stunned trance, pushes Edmund out of the way, and 
           scoops her up.  

           He runs with her down the alley.

                                 HENRY
                        Stay with me, stay with me, stay 
                        with me...

           There is a pain more personal in his eyes and words.  Edmund, 
           still frozen, watches him run, then looks down at the blood 
           covering him.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

           A haggard Edmund and Henry watch a HEARSE CARRIAGE roll away 
           down the street.  The citizens buzz with talk of the new 
           murder.  Everyone rattled, stunned. 

                                 EDMUND
                        What is this?

           Henry’s eyes haven’t left the hearse.  He walks away.

                                 EDMUND
                        Henry?

           No response.  Edmund turns back to the hospital.  Behind 
           him...

           ACROSS THE STREET
                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)           There is a soft WHISTLING - a sea shanty.  A tattooed hand 
           flips through the newspaper, as though searching for 
           something. 

           The whistling stops, as the shadowy figure watches Edmund 
           enter the hospital.

           INT. HOSPITAL, NURSE’S DESK - DAY

           Edmund, buttoning his coat over his bloody shirt, approaches 
           a severe-looking NURSE.

                                 EDMUND
                        Excuse me, could you direct me to 
                        the coroner?

                                 NURSE
                        Your business?

                                 EDMUND
                        My name is Edmund Harrison.  I’m 
                        with the New York Times.

                                 NURSE
                        Dr. Knight doesn’t speak with 
                        newspapers. 

           Edmund nods, turns a

           CORNER

           and approaches an ORDERLY.

                                 EDMUND
                        Excuse, I’m Harrison with the Texas 
                        Physio-Medical Journal.  Do you 
                        know where I might find Dr. Knight?  

           INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS

           DR. EDGAR KNIGHT, a portly, imperious man, dissecting a 
           little gross chunk of indeterminate something.  There is a 
           knock on the door.  Knight stops, annoyed.

                                 KNIGHT
                        Yes?

           The orderly enters with Edmund.
                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 ORDERLY
                        A Mr. Harrison with the Texas 
                        Physio-Medical Journal.

           Beat.

                                 KNIGHT
                        Very well.  Shut the door behind 
                        you.

           The orderly leaves.  Knight returns to his work.

                                 KNIGHT (CONT’D)
                        How intriguing that your 
                        publication would take an interest 
                        in me after refusing to print my 
                        treatise on paleo-encephaly and the 
                        American negroid.  

                                 EDMUND
                        Dr. Knight, you hold the post of 
                        Travis County Coroner, correct?

                                 KNIGHT
                        Correct.

                                 EDMUND
                        Then you saw her. 

                                 KNIGHT
                        If by “her” I may presume you are 
                        referring to the unfortunate Miss 
                        Irene Cross, then yes, though I 
                        must confess curiosity over what 
                        your esteemed journal might have in 
                        so lurid an affair, not to mention 
                        how you would come to be inquiring 
                        before even the dailies.

                                 EDMUND
                        Dr. Knight, I apologize for the 
                        subterfuge, but I was wondering if 
                        there are any consistencies worthy 
                        of note in the attacks on Irene 
                        Cross, Eliza Shelley, and Mollie 
                        Smith.  In your professional 
                        opinion, is this the work of a 
                        single culprit?
                                             (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                 KNIGHT
                        It is my considered opinion, Mr. 
                        Harrison, that one who has invited 
                        such a degree of unfavorable 
                        attention in such a short span of 
                        time may consider respectfully 
                        removing himself from this city 
                        before one night he finds a pen 
                        knife plunged somewhere in his 
                        thoracic region by the same common 
                        nigger he has styled himself the 
                        champion.  Now please kindly leave 
                        myself and my intracranial tumor in 
                        peace.

                                 EDMUND
                        Sorry to trouble you.

           As Edmund leaves, he spies a small MICROSCOPE - and swipes it 
           into his coat.  

           Knight waits until his is gone, then removes his gloves.

           INT. MAYOR ROBERTSON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Robertson standing with a snifter of brandy.  Lee and 
           Chenneville sit across from him.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Well?

                                 LEE
                        We ran in a chicken thief name of 
                        Mack, known to woo the deceased. 

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        And might this chicken thief 
                        provide an adequate prosecution?

                                 LEE
                          (lights cigarette)
                        Well cousin, I suppose that would 
                        depend on a jury of his peers.  

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Grooms, as useful as your impolitic 
                        nature has been in the past, allow 
                        me a brief civics lesson.  Every 
                        time the Great Northern Railroad

                        But do you know what it is that our 
                        city has to distinguish it from its 
                        peers?  Goddamn class.  And the 
                        loss of this reputation will result 
                        in a commensurate loss of revenue.  
                        So it is our responsibility to 
                        uphold this reputation - at all 
                        costs.  Now does this permeate the 
                        soft grey material between those 
                        lopsided ears?

           Lee nibbles his fingertip, winces.

                                 LEE
                        You ever get a hangnail?  Stings 
                        like the dickens.

           Robertson hurls his glass against the wall.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        This is an election year!  Get me a 
                        conviction or I’ll find someone who 
                        will.

                                 LEE
                          (rises)
                        You’ll get your conviction.  Shit, 
                        might even give us the elbow room 
                        to find the right man.

           Lee walks out.  Chenneville hesitates, then grabs his hat and 
           starts to follow.  

           Just then the mayor’s ASSISTANT ushers in Dr. Knight.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Yes, Edgar, what is it?  Those 
                        vagrants still stealing laudanum?

                                 KNIGHT
                        Had a curious inquiry this 
                        afternoon.

           Robertson immediately knows.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        John.  Wait.

DUST DEVIL - NIGHT

           Edmund stands at the bar, paying for a bottle, when a WOMAN 
           wrapped in a shawl comes down the stairs.  Her head turns 
           briefly to Edmund - it’s Eula.  

           She hurries to exit.  He follows.  

           EXT. DUST DEVIL - CONTINUOUS

           Her pace quickens on the street.

                                 EDMUND
                          (catching up)
                        Hey.  Hey.  I could use a friendly--

           She turns to face him.  There is a STITCHED CUT on her cheek.

                        Who?

           She pushes past him.  He stops her.

           demarcate Guy Town.

           INT. DRISKILL HOTEL, EDMUND’S ROOM - NIGHT

           A thick medical text.  Edmund sets a whiskey bottle on it, 
           and wipes his mouth.  A deep breath.  Puts a belt in his 
           teeth.

           He takes his knife and cuts into his hand, shaving off a 
           small piece of SKIN.

           He sets it on the handkerchief beside the fingernail, then 
           slumps back, spitting out the belt.  He takes a long drink, 
           and pants, staring at the two bloody bits.

                                 EDMUND
                        You and your fucking hunches.

           He grabs the microscope and sets it beside them.  

           EXT. WEED FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY

           Rebecca washes the windows.  Henry steps up and sets a bundle 
           of firewood down.

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t say it.

           Rebecca sees something behind him, and starts to leave.

                        Would you listen if I did?

           Henry turns - Edmund walking up.

                                 EDMUND
                        He’s white.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Edmund and Henry sitting on the steps; grim discussion.

                        I thought maybe the coroner could 
                        shed some light on the pathology at 
                        work, but he was not what you would

           They turn to find Weed standing in the doorway.

           INT. WEED FUNERAL PARLOR, HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Weed leads Edmund and Henry toward a door.

                        Family’s coming for the body in an

                        We saw her.

                        Not really.

           He unlocks the door and ushers them into the 

           BACKROOM

           A sheet lies over IRENE’S BODY on the table.  Weed locks the 
           door.

                        And those interests are served in 
                        no way if news gets out that in our

           He pulls back the sheet and indicates a small round hole on 
           the forehead.

                        Tracker has to know what he’s 
                        trackin’.  What do we know from the 
                        trail he’s left so far?

                                 EDMUND
                          (thinks)
                        He’s targeting women, negroes, to 
                        whom he does great violence, both 
                        pre and post death.  He brutalizes 
                        the face and debases the body.  He 
                        uses a particular... toolkit, 
                        including hatchet, knife, and metal 
                        rod.  He clearly stalks his victims 
                        in advance, stealing some personal 
                        effect before the actual act.  What 
                        do you suppose is the purpose of 
                        that?  

           Beat.

                                 HENRY
                        He’s fuckin’ crazy.

           They pass a small crowd mobbing a GUN STORE.

                        That’s it, I told ya!  I’m sold

                        Back the fuck up!

           He BLASTS a shot into the air.  A flock of blackbirds 
           scatters from a telegraph wire.

           Edmund and Henry turn from the chaos and walk on.

                                 EDMUND
                        We have to do something.

           INT. AUSTIN AMERICAN STATESMAN, EDITOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Edmund sitting across from Hancock.

                                 HANCOCK
                        I give it to you, Harrison, a hell 
                        of a theory, but what exactly do 
                        you expect me to do with it?

                                 EDMUND
                        Print it.

                                 HANCOCK
                        And cause a panic, because you’ve 
                        been reading too many penny 
                        dreadfuls?

                                 EDMUND
                        Cause a panic?  Have you been in 
                        the streets?

                                 HANCOCK
                        I am assured by the mayor’s office 
                        that putting an end to this menace 
                        is their highest priority.  Tell me 
                        in what way that’s aided by 
                        convincing an already spooked, not 
                        to mention armed, populace that 
                        there is some bloodsucking fiend 
                        stalking the streets at night?   

                                 EDMUND
                        And by priority he means 
                        railroading the nearest negro with 
                        a strong arm and weak alibi.  This 
                        man is white and isn’t finished.

                        Now perhaps my father instilled me 
                        with some eccentric ideas on the 
                        subject of the free press but it 
                        seems to me we have some obligation 
                        to tell the people the goddamn 
                        truth.

                                 HANCOCK
                        Your truth, Edmund.  Your truth, 
                        and you are a stranger, a long way 
                        from home.  This ain’t New York.  
                        We are a frontier town on the verge 
                        of a city.  Progress, industry - 
                        you think Robertson is gonna let a 
                        few dead niggers stand in the way?  
                        News spreads of what this really 
                        is, and it’ll be the end of them, 
                        of all of it, so it ain’t news.  
                        Period.  

                                 EDMUND
                        It’s your duty to--

                                 HANCOCK
                        It’s my duty to keep my job, and no 
                        disgrace to the name on his 
                        monogrammed fucking handkerchiefs 
                        who wants to crawl out of his 
                        daddy’s shadow and call it a 
                        crusade is going to lecture me on 
                        the free fucking press in my 
                        office.

           Beat.  Edmund rises, reaches into his breast pocket, and 
           pulls out his HANDKERCHIEF.  It’s saturated with Irene 
           Cross’s BLOOD.  He drops it on Hancock’s blotter.

                                 EDMUND
                        Sir.

           EXT. NEWSPAPER BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Edmund storms out, carelessly bumping into a MAN coming the 
           opposite way on the sidewalk.

                                 MAN
                        Watch it.

                                 EDMUND
                        Fuck off.

           Edmund marches past the CLERK, dusting off his coat.

                                 HOTEL CLERK
                        Mr. Harrison.  Telegram from New 
                        York.

           He hands Edmund the paper, who reads it, a little thrown off.  
           A few phrases leap out: “reckless sensationalism” and 
           “pandering filth.”

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON (O.S.)
                        Edmund!

           Edmund looks up.  Mayor Roberson and a group of stuffed suits 
           sit at a table in the hotel saloon playing cards.

           Mayor Robertson waves him over.

           SALOON

           Edmund walks up to their table.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON (CONT’D)
                        Thought you’d be long departed by 
                        now.  I told you our fair town 
                        would grow on you.

                                 EDMUND
                        How are you?

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Well.  Please, join us.

           He does, running over his telegram again.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Bad news?

                                 EDMUND
                        Questions from my father about my 
                        return.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                          (dealing him in)
                        Must miss you terribly.

           Edmund takes his cards and the challenge.

                                 EDMUND
                        We’re a tender-hearted lot.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        What delays you, if I may ask?  Not 
                        this recent savagery, I hope.

                                 EDMUND
                        You’ll have to be more specific 
                        these days.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        I hope, because it is of course 
                        your right as a journalist, but I 
                        don’t mind saying you’d be doing us 
                        a great service focusing on more 
                        positive aspects of our city.  A 
                        service we wouldn’t soon forget.
                          (beat)
                        If that is the case at all.

                                 EDMUND
                        Of course.  If.  

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        I’d think you’d find larger 
                        interests here more attractive over 
                        a tabloid piece.  And lucrative.

                                 EDMUND
                        It’s all just a curiosity, really.

                                 STUFFED SUIT
                        Fingers crossed you fare better 
                        than the cat.

                                 EDMUND
                        I’m sure your Marshal Lee has 
                        things well in hand.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        And all our confidence.

           The men lay their cards out.  Edmund appears happy with his.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                          (polite smile gone)
                        And we’d be happy to connect you 
                        with a more suitable guide than you 
                        seem to have acquired.

           Edmund’s taken aback a bit by this.  Stuffed Suit fans out 
           his winning hand over Edmund’s.
                                   (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                 STUFFED SUIT
                          (to Edmund)
                        Sorry, friend.  But yankee luck 
                        don’t cross Kentucky.

           INT. REBECCA RAMEY’S CABIN - NIGHT

           Henry takes a step in and stops.  Deputy Chenneville stands 
           inside thumbing through Rebecca’s Bible.

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                        “We are troubled on every side, but 
                        not distressed; we are perplexed, 
                        but not in despair...”
                          (beat)
                        You ever find anything in this?

           He finally looks up at the silent statue of Henry.

                                 CHENNEVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, me either.  Distressed has 
                        always been my natural born state.

           He strolls about, thumbing through the book.

                                 CHENNEVILLE (CONT’D)
                        But I’m rarely perplexed.  A life 
                        of purpose and intention.  That’s 
                        about the only gospel my daddy ever 
                        taught me.

                                 HENRY
                        What do you want?

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                        Oh, just making the rounds.  Burden 
                        of the law.  I don’t often get out 
                        to the dark side of town.  
                          (beat)
                        More often these days.

           He chuckles at something he reads.

                                 CHENNEVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Resurrection.  Now that’s for me.  
                        I’m law, but I always loved that 
                        about this town.  A man can always 
                        disappear here, try to start fresh.   
                          (beat)
                        Ain’t that right, Henry?
                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                 HENRY
                        If you say so.

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                        It don’t trifle me none.  Unless 
                        they find disappearing’s not 
                        suiting ‘em.  And they start 
                        thinking on old ways.  Start 
                        stepping out.    

           He glances down at the pistol tucked in Henry’s waistband.

                                 CHENNEVILLE (CONT’D)
                        I gotta protect the citizens.  And 
                        I will protect them, you believe 
                        that, don’t you?

           Henry just stares him down.

                                 CHENNEVILLE (CONT’D)
                        That’s good to know.  Cuz we’re 
                        awful busy doing just that.

           Chenneville hands him the bible at the doorway.

                                 CHENNEVILLE (CONT’D)
                        But not that busy.

           Chenneville mounts his horse and fits his hat back on.

                                 CHENNEVILLE (CONT’D)
                        You might should take another look 
                        in that thing.  I hear there’s 
                        something for everybody.

           He trots away, just as Rebecca and Mary walk up from the 
           other way with a canvas sack of groceries.  

           Rebecca’s eyes add up the situation as they move in past 
           Henry.  

           EXT. STREET - SAME

           Edmund jogs through the narrow lane.  He passes a horseman 
           heading the other way - Chenneville.  He points his trigger 
           finger at Edmund, cocks his thumb - pow - then tips his hat 
           and trots on.

           Edmund watches a moment, then continues on, now at a run.
                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)           INT. REBECCA RAMEY’S CABIN - CONTINUOUS

           Rebecca shoves the groceries into the pantry.

                                 REBECCA
                        For a man who doesn’t want to 
                        attract attention from law, you’re 
                        getting an awful lot of it.

           Henry just looks down at the Bible in his hands.  Mary comes 
           back in.

                                 MARY
                        Mama, will you brush my hair?

           Rebecca watches Henry’s back for a moment, waiting for a 
           response.

                                 REBECCA
                        Sure, baby.  Go find my brush.

           Mary runs off to the back room.  Rebecca goes still.  

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        My sister was a good woman, Henry, 
                        and she loved you.  I miss her 
                        every day.
                          (beat)
                        And that man that...

           Rebecca’s jaw clenches as she holds back tears.

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        Ain’t no one to blame but him.  And 
                        ain’t no fixing it.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Where is it?

           Rebecca takes a calming, controlling breath.

                                 REBECCA
                        I don’t know if you’re looking for 
                        punishment or forgiveness.  But I 
                        do know you don’t need either.

           Edmund appears in the open front door.  He caught some of 
           that.

           Rebecca notices him, and heads to the back room.  Henry just 
           stares at the book.

           Henry and Edmund stand on the porch, as rain begins to tap 
           the tin roof.  Edmund drinks from his flask.

                                 EDMUND
                        We’re on our own.

                                 HENRY
                        Always were.

           They look out at the passers-by shrouded under coats and 
           hats.  Shady cowboys and dead-eyed laborers.  He could be any 
           one of them.

                                 EDMUND
                        Henry, if you want to stop this...  

           Henry takes Edmund’s flask and a long drink.  

                                 HENRY
                        Knew I shoulda let that cowboy 
                        drill you.

           He hands it back.  They share a small grin.

           Edmund pockets the flask, feels something.  Pulls out a NOTE, 
           looks.  Then it hits him--

                                 EDMUND
                        My God.

           QUICK FLASHBACK

           Edmund walking away from the Austin Statesman office, 
           colliding with a man (face unseen).  The man’s hand brushes 
           Edmund’s pocket.  Glimpse of a grimy smile...

                                 MAN
                        Watch it.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 HENRY
                        What.

           Edmund hands him the note.

                                 EDMUND
                        It was him.

Written in BLOOD: “Reporter, do you want 
           to know what I am?”  With a CRUDE MAP scrawled at the bottom.

                                 EDMUND
                          (beat)
                        Do you know where this is?

                                 HENRY
                        No place we want to go.

           EXT. HILLSIDE - EVENING

           A light rain falls over the rocky thicket of mesquite trees 
           and scrub brush.

           Henry and Edmund on horseback trotting along a narrow path 
           there.

                                 HENRY
                          (hushed)
                        The Bee Caves is where brigands 
                        nest like rattlers.  Law don’t even 
                        come out here.  But we leave them 
                        alone they leave us alone.  

           Crack of a twig up on the low hill -- Two ratty BANDITS at 
           camp, eyeing them riding by.

           Henry adjusts the pistol in his belt.

                                 HENRY
                        Long as we don’t stick our hand 
                        down the wrong hole.

           They ride deeper in.

           EXT. TRAIL - LATER

           Henry and Edmund clomp through, wary.  Edmund examines the 
           note, trying to comprehend the man behind it.

                                 OLD MAN (O.S.)
                        Pst.  Hey, cowboy.

           They turn to find a scrawny OLD MAN emerging from a campsite 
           in a small clearing.

                                 OLD MAN
                        You boys lookin’ for company?
                                  (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)           He cocks his head back to his campsite - and the young 
           COMANCHE WOMAN tied to a tree there.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Keep ya warm on the trail.  Twenty 
                        bucks.

           Edmund stares at the frightened woman.

                                 HENRY
                        You see any man come up alone ahead 
                        of us?

                                 OLD MAN
                        You want a boy, I can get you a 
                        boy.

           Henry pulls his coat back, revealing the gun.  The old man 
           gets the hint.

                                 OLD MAN
                        No.  I ain’t seen any man.

           Henry trots on.  Edmund lingers.  He reaches into his pocket, 
           and tosses a wad of CASH at the old man’s feet.

                                 EDMUND
                        Turn her loose.

           He eyes the old man hard, then glance back up at the woman, 
           old wounds opening again.  He spurs his horse on.

           EXT. CAVE - LATER

           Henry and Edmund dismount.  Henry consults the map.

                                 HENRY
                        This should be it.

                                 EDMUND
                        Do we pray that we’re right or 
                        wrong?

           Henry takes out his gun and pulls back the hammer.

                                 HENRY
                        Prayin’s a bug never did bite me.
                                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)           INT. CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

           They cautiously enter, Edmund carrying a lantern, the only 
           sound the patter of rain outside. 

                                 HENRY
                        You smell that?

                                 EDMUND
                        What?

                                 HENRY
                        Smoke.

           They descend a few yards and notice something coming from a 
           side tunnel: faint dancing light.

           Henry gesticulates at Edmund, and he douses the lantern. 

           SIDE TUNNEL

           Their dark shapes approaching the glow at the end wall. 

                                 EDMUND
                        My God...

           A kind of SHRINE there.  Two red candles flickering beneath 
           TWO HUGE, OUTSTRETCHED ARMS fashioned out of bone bolted to 
           the rock.  

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        What is this?

                                 HENRY
                        Him.

           Edmund looks over the cave walls - nailed there are dozens of 
           little OBJECTS from all over the world - gloves, earring, 
           bonnet, burka, etc.  He sees Mollie’s SLIPPER.  Beside it, 
           Eliza’s scarf.  He runs his finger along a carved jade ring.  

                                 EDMUND
                        This is from China.  Christ, there 
                        must be dozens.

           Henry sees a piece of dark CLOTH between the candles.  He 
           uncocks the pistol and hands it to Edmund, transfixed.

           He takes a knee there.  Unfolds the cloth.
                                       (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                 HENRY 
                          (soft)
                        No.

           He backs away.

                                 EDMUND
                        What?

           Henry bolts back up the tunnel.  

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Henry!

           Edmund steps up to the shrine, takes another look, then runs 
           after him.

           There between the candles lies a HAIRBRUSH.

           EXT. TRAIL - NIGHT

           THUNDERING HOOFBEATS, as Henry rides recklessly in the dark.  
           Edmund is not far behind.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Henry rides with everything in him.  His face contorts with 
           dread, seeing Rebecca’s cabin ahead and the lamplight from 
           the OPEN DOOR.

           INT. REBECCA RAMEY’S CABIN - CONTINUOUS

           Henry bursts in, a quick look, then runs to the 

           BEDROOM

           He falls to his knees beside Rebecca on the floor.

                                 HENRY
                        Rebecca.  Oh Christ, please, no.

           He cradles her in his lap.  BLOOD POURS from a gash in her 
           head.

           EXT. STREET - SAME

           Edmund dismounts, panting, and runs towards Rebecca’s cabin.  
           He slips in the mud and falls.  He looks up through the 
           downpour at something across the street.
                                  (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)           INT. REBECCA RAMEY’S CABIN - SAME

           Rebecca’s eyes flutter open.  Henry bursts into tears, 
           smiling.

                                 HENRY
                        God, thank you.  

           Her bloody hand CLAMPS onto his shirt.  She stares wildly at 
           him through her haze.

                                 REBECCA
                        It’s not me he wanted.

           EXT. STREET - SAME

           Edmund kneels frozen in the muck, eyes locked on an alley 
           across the street.

           ALLEY 

           A dark figure rises over the BUTCHERED BODY OF MARY - the man 
           in the tarpaulin coat.  He looks at Edmund behind the plain, 
           expressionless MASK.

           STREET (INTERCUT)

           Edmund remembers Henry’s pistol.  He fumbles with it, finally 
           raising it at the man.

           The man turns around - another MASK, this one GRINNING - we 
           were looking at his back.

           He stands over Mary, now truly looking at Edmund, and opens 
           his long coat, revealing his chest and a large TATTOO OF 
           BLACK THORNS, “ESAU” ON ONE SIDE, “JACOB” THE OTHER, as 
           though inviting Edmund to kill him.

           Edmund is paralyzed with shock and terror as though face to 
           face with the devil incarnate.  The man waits terribly, arms 
           outstretched.

           Edmund at last takes a breath, aims -- as a TEAM OF HORSES 
           AND A WAGON move between him and the man.

           Edmund, senses regained, searches through the legs of the 
           horses and wheel spokes.

           Henry bursts out of the cabin to Edmund, just as it passes.  
           The man, running away, disappears down the darkness of the 
           alley.
                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)           Henry sees Mary’s body.  It holds him for a moment, then rage 
           overtakes him.

           He snatches the gun from Edmund’s hand and runs after him.

           Edmund remains on his knees in the mud.  Drenched.  A child.

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Henry - all fury - slams through old crates, tearing after 
           the dark figure ahead, who disappears in and out of the 
           shadows and moonlight.  

           Henry rounds a corner -- and is SLAMMED with a board.  Hits 
           the mud hard, bleeding from the head.  The figure dashes away 
           down a side alley.

           Henry grits through the pain and fog of the hit, and 
           scrambles after him. 

           SIDE ALLEY

           He FIRES a shot, striking part of the mask, just as the man 
           rounds another corner.

           Henry stumbles up and swings around the same corner, pistol 
           ready.  A dead end -- and empty.

           He stands there, searching.  No way out.  Only the man’s two-
           faced mask, cracked in the corner, lying in the muck.  He 
           picks it up, the blood from his wound dripping down onto it’s 
           smiling face.

           EXT. REBECCA RAMEY’S CABIN - DAWN

           A crowd whispers around the crime scene.  Edmund, trying to 
           hold it together, talks to two BEMUSED DEPUTIES.  Henry to 
           the side, stone silent.

                                 EDMUND
                        He appeared to be slightly below 
                        average height, sturdy build... 
                          (beat)
                        Why isn’t this being written down?

           The deputies exchange looks.  

                                 DEPUTY

                        him?

                                 EDMUND
                        Seeing him, he was...

           Helpless, he looks at Henry nursing his head wound, but Henry 
           does not look at him - perhaps wondering the same thing.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Write it down.

           The deputies look to Lee, sitting on horseback nearby.  They 
           obey.

           Edmund can only stare at Henry.  Lee watches them, then trots 
           away.

           EXT. GRAVEYARD HILL - DAY

           A field of weeds and dirt spiked with faded wooden grave 
           markers.  Three fresh graves stand out.

                                 PREACHER (O.S.)
                        O God, who brought us to birth, and 
                        in whose arms we die...

           A gallery of mournful faces.  The black PREACHER with a small 
           prayer book continues, struggling with the words.

                                 PREACHER (CONT’D)
                        In our grief and shock, contain and 
                        comfort us...

           Henry stands next to Rebecca, her head bandaged.  They could 
           be carved from ice.

                                 PREACHER (CONT’D)
                        Embrace us with your love, give us 
                        hope in our time of confusion...

           A small CASKET is lowered.

                                 PREACHER (CONT’D)
                        We thank you that Mary is in that 
                        embrace, far from the cruelty of 
                        our world...

           Weed clasps his hands in front of him.
                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 PREACHER (CONT’D)
                        When trouble was near, we could not 
                        understand how you seemed to remain 
                        far away...

           Edmund looks away in grief and shame.  He notices someone 
           standing at the outskirts of the cemetery.  Eula, watching 
           him.

                                 PREACHER (CONT’D)
                        And yet it is to you we turn, for 
                        in life and death it is you alone 
                        we can trust...

           She holds his gaze like an embrace - tender, understanding.  
           He looks away, unable to face her.  

                                 PREACHER (CONT’D)
                        We pray that justice may be done.  
                        Come alongside your people, and 
                        give them your comfort and 
                        strength.

           Henry’s arms hang at his side.  Fists CLENCHED to break 
           walnuts.

                                 PREACHER (CONT’D)
                        Through Jesus we pray.  Amen.

           Henry’s lips remain a tight line.

                                 MOURNERS
                        Amen.

           INT. REBECCA RAMEY’S CABIN - LATER

           The wake.  People milling about, cooking, whispering.

           Rebecca sits in her rocking chair.  Abruptly, the room falls 
           silent.  She looks up.  Edmund stands in the doorway.  He 
           goes to her, eyes red with disgrace and sadness.  

                                 EDMUND
                        I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry, Mrs. 
                        Ramey.  I--

           She rises and regards him, face utterly impassive.  Beat.

           SLAP!  She cracks him across the face and he wheels back. 
           Henry takes an arm to guide him out.
                                                 (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                 HENRY
                          (gently)
                        Not today, Edmund.  Not today.

           SLAP!  Henry’s head whips as Rebecca gets him too.

           She walks out of room.

           INT. SALOON - DAY

           Edmund, looking like the living dead, sits at the bar, 
           several drinks into a potential bender.  The bartender fills 
           his glass.

                                 EDMUND
                        Leave the bottle, please.

           The bartender looks him over.  It’s a request that would have 
           at one time been easily obliged, but in his present state...

           Edmund pulls out a dollar and lays it on the bar.  Bartender 
           exchanges it for the bottle.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Have a ball.

                                 EDMUND
                        Thank you.

           He takes a drink.  Sits in dark thought.  Finishes the drink 
           and pours another.

           He looks up at his sad reflection in the bar mirror.

           Outside, a VENDOR hawking papers, catches his attention.

                                 VENDOR
                        Town meeting tonight!  City hall!  
                        The Mayor speaks out on the foul 
                        fiends!  Town meeting!

           The bartender dries mugs.  He looks up, hearing the door 
           swing shut.  

           Edmund’s bottle and full glass on the bar.  He’s gone.

           INT. CITY HALL - NIGHT

           The aisles overflowing with restless townspeople.  The back 
           section all black.  Mayor Robertson stands at the podium, 
           flanked by Lee and Chenneville.  Lee looks uncomfortable.
                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                          (barely speaking over the 
                           crowd)
                        ...These terrible crimes must, and 
                        will, come to an end.  Marshal Lee 
                        and myself will work tirelessly 
                        until the evil prowling these 
                        streets is swinging in the gallows.  
                        We are making every effort here--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        To cover your own asses!

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        To bring safety and order back to 
                        the city we all love.  Justice 
                        must, and will, prevail.

                                 ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                        You can’t even spell the word!

           Chenneville, livid, steps forward.

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                        Next smart-ass opens his fat mouth 
                        can meet me outside!

           Lee shoots him a shut-the-fuck-up look that may have once 
           worked, but this time Chenneville stares back with equal 
           venom.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        In the meantime we welcome your 
                        suggestions on how we might best 
                        unite against this dark tide.  
                        Orderly, now.

                                 LOUD CRACKPOT
                        Sharpshooters!  We need 
                        sharpshooters all around the city!  
                        No one gets in or out!

                                 LOUDER CRACKPOT
                        Round up all the niggers, spics, 
                        and Injuns, take ‘em out to the Bee 
                        Caves, and--

                                 EVEN LOUDER CRACKPOT
                        We must erect lampposts so tall and 
                        so bright to keep the town 
                        illuminated every hour of the--

           Clamor uprising.  Robertson BANGS the podium.
                                             (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Order!  Order!  I will have ORDER!

           The hubbub dies down.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.  Now if anyone--

                                 EDMUND (O.S.)
                        What if you start telling the 
                        truth?

           The mob, which we now see includes Eula, looks at Edmund 
           standing in the doorway.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Sir, please have a seat.  As I was 
                        saying--

                                 EDMUND
                        What if you tell the people that 
                        there is a serial murderer whose 
                        dementia will not permit him to 
                        stop that you jackals are not 
                        simply incapable but not interested 
                        in apprehending?

           Rabbling response.  The mayor doesn’t know what to do.  He 
           looks to Lee for help, who simply stares down with shame.  
           Chenneville steps forward once more.

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                        Hey Eddie - what if you’d done 
                        something to help that little girl?

           Beat.  Edmund’s jaw clenches and he exits.  Mayor returns to 
           quieting the crowd.  He leans close to Lee.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                          (sotto, an order)
                        Deal with him.

                                 LEE
                        What if he’s right?

           Lee pulls a rolled cigarette out and walks away, just as Eula 
           slips through the crowd toward the door.

           EXT. CONGRESS AVENUE BRIDGE - EVENING 

           A red Austin sunset.  Edmund, the worse for wear, sits 
           propped against the bridge wall with a bottle of booze.

He drinks

           A GOLD CHARM around her neck catches his attention.  She 
           notices.

           A sad smile flutters on his face.  She sits beside him, 
           examining the charm.  Both drifting to those private, painful 
           memories.

           He finally looks up at her.  Neither moves.  Silent, save the 
           muffled music of a fiddle and piano wafting in from somewhere 
           across the street.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The music spills out of a saloon entrance across the street, 
           at full, violent volume now.  It plays intermittently over 
           following:

           Dark  Two beds.  There is a shuffle, followed by a THUD and a 
           woman’s stunned GROAN.  

           LUCINDA BODY, a middle-aged black woman, wakes with a start, 
           searching the darkness.

           INT. EDMUND’S ROOM - SAME

           Edmund and Eula kissing hungrily.

           INT. SERVANT’S CABIN

           The cabin: chaos.  Lucinda hyperventilates.  She can make out 
           nothing on the other bed other than faint moonlight 
           highlighting sweat on a moving body.  Only sound. 

           GRACIE VANCE, another servant (who was hit), struggles there 
           with the man in the tarpaulin coat.  

           Lucinda SCREAMS.

           INT. EDMUND’S ROOM

           Eula moans, clutching Edmund’s neck.

           INT. SERVANT’S CABIN

           The axe swings down again and again on Gracie.  

           Blood spatters Lucinda’s face, who is only now coming to her 
           senses, terrified.  She fumbles into the dark toward the 
           door.

She doesn’t 
           even have time to scream, as the axe CRACKS down against her 
           skull.

           INT. EDMUND’S ROOM

           Eula and Edmund, bodies wracking, approaching climax.

           INT. SERVANT’S CABIN

           Lucinda fading in and out of consciousness:

           Heavy breathing and animal-like grunts just behind her.  She 
           blinks awake, bent over the bed, her body racked with 
           rhythmic thrusts.  On the wall - the faint shadow of the man 
           pinning her down.

           Through the window she can see the nearby HOUSE.  Her swollen 
           eyes flutter shut...

           A moment later, Gracie’s twitching body is dragged across the 
           floor and out the door.

           INT. EDMUND’S ROOM

           Eula, back arched, CRYING OUT.

           INT. SERVANT’S CABIN

           Shaking, Lucinda’s hand reaches out and turns the knob on a 
           kerosene lamp.  Warm light fills the room.

           She pulls herself to her feet, covered in blood, and looks 
           around, sucking in small gasps of breath.

           Blood-soaked sheets.  A clump of hair.  Her eyes track a 
           trail of blood to the doorway - where the silhouette of the 
           man appears.

           INT. HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A SCREAM outside awakens their employer, MAJOR DUNHAM.

           EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dunham bursts from the door with a rifle.
                                (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)           In the grass outside the servant’s cabin, Lucinda and the man 
           struggle.  The man looks up at Dunham and bolts into the 
           night.

           INT. EDMUND’S ROOM

           Eula lies in bed watching Edmund sleep.

           EXT. HOUSE

           Dunham jogs up to Lucinda, who stares catatonic out into 
           nothing.

                                 DUNHAM
                        Jesus.

                                 LUCINDA
                          (sotto)
                        We’re all dead.  We’re all dead.  
                        We’re all dead.

           INT. EDMUND’S ROOM - LATER

           Edmund in bed.  He stirs awake, sees Eula’s not there.  Rolls 
           over.

                                 EDMUND
                        Eula?

           A dark figure standing over his bed - wearing the mask.

           As Edmund starts to leap up, the killer’s gloved hand CLAMPS 
           down on his mouth.  The masked face hangs over him.  In his 
           other hand: the bloody HATCHET.  Holds it at Edmund’s throat.

                                 KILLER
                          (disturbing whisper)
                        If you make a sound, I will take 
                        off your head like a cock’s. 

           Edmund breathes quickly through his nose, eyes burning with 
           anger.  The killer removes his hand.

                                 KILLER (CONT’D)
                        I want you to make them see.

           Edmund’s hand creeps down to the bottom of the mattress.

                                 EDMUND
                        They won’t listen.
                                (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)           He shoves his hand under it for his knife - not there.  THUD - 
           the killer stabs it into the headboard next to Edmund’s ear.

                                 KILLER
                        They won’t now because it isn’t 
                        finished.  They are too small and 
                        it is too vast.  Your job is not to 
                        convince this fetid place, it is to 
                        make the world understand. 

                                 EDMUND
                        But - I don’t understand.

                                 KILLER
                        That’s because it’s isn’t finished.
                          (beat)
                        You will.

           The man flicks the hatchet up, slicing Edmund’s other ear.  
           And in a blink he’s gone.  

           Edmund rolls out of bed in pain, clutching his bleeding ear.  
           Then he jerks his knife free and in a rage dashes out into 
           the

           HOTEL HALLWAY

           Searches - empty.  An open window at the end of the hall, 
           curtains blowing in the night breeze.

           He runs up there, looks down into the dark, empty street.

           INT. LEE’S HOUSE, HALLWAY - DAYBREAK

           Lee sips a cup of coffee, looking in on his two DAUGHTERS 
           asleep in bed.  In this quite moment all his hardness falls 
           away, and his thoughts are clear: what if it was them?  

                                 LEE’S WIFE (O.S.)
                        What’s wrong?

           Lee glance down the hall at his wife shaking sleep in their 
           bedroom doorway.

                                 LEE
                        Nothing.

                                 LEE’S WIFE
                        Did you sleep at all?
                                                 (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)           Lee turns back to his daughters.  He freezes - the sound of 
           footsteps on gravel approaching outside the house.  A shadow 
           passes the window.

           Lee’s head sinks.  His wife watches with pity as he pulls his 
           hat from a hook on the wall.

           A loud KNOCK at the front door.

           INT. REBECCA RAMEY’S CABIN - MORNING

           Henry picks up the Bible lying on the floor.  Drops of dried 
           blood on the cover.  

           In the distance, the BAYING of bloodhounds.  He sits, wearily 
           holds his head in his hands.

           Ghostlike, Rebecca emerges, wrapped in a robe.

           Neither speak.

           EXT. SERVANTS’ CABIN - LATER

           Grey early morning.

           A wagon pulls away with a BODY wrapped in bloody sheets, 
           revealing a small crowd standing in the drizzle with grave 
           expressions.  They are muted no longer by the shock of these 
           crimes, but by sheer incomprehension, the weight of it all 
           adding up.

           Lee and Chenneville sit on horseback at the edge of the lawn.  
           Lee’s gaze turns from the crime scene to the BLACK CARRIAGE 
           beside it - and Roberson inside watching.

           A Young Deputy steps up to onlookers.

                                 YOUNG DEPUTY
                        All right, all of you get on.  You 
                        seen it, now we got work to do, and 
                        so do you.  Go on now.

           A distant roll of thunder.  The crowd begins to tear its eyes 
           from the scene and disperse.

                                 CROWD MAN
                        Devil’s in this town.

           Lee’s attention is drawn to a commotion at the nearby

           STABLE
                                (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)           Where policemen haul out two struggling BLACK MEN out.

                                 BLACK MAN
                        Murder?!  I didn’t do a thing!

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                          (to policemen)
                        Put that buck in irons!

           Lee looks to the lingering crowd.  The blacks, and even some 
           of the whites, stare at him with fear and hatred.  They 
           slowly slink away into the drizzle.

           The suspect that spoke bumps into Lee’s horse as the police 
           shackle him.

                                 BLACK MAN
                          (to Lee)
                        Why don’t you just get a fucking 
                        rope?

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                        Sass us again, and you bet I will.

           The cops pull the two men off.  Lee reins his horse away.  

                                 CHENNEVILLE
                        Where you goin’?  We got business 
                        here.

                                 LEE
                        No we don’t.

           Chenneville stares at Lee’s back, then spits tobacco and 
           turns back to the matter at hand.

           MARSHAL LEE

           Trots on.  He pauses at Robertson’s carriage.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Grooms.  What can you--

           Lee pulls his MARSHAL STAR from his vest and slings into 
           Robertson’s lap.

                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        What’s this?

                                 LEE
                          (spurring his horse on)
                        To go sideways up your ass.
                                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                              (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                 MAYOR ROBERTSON
                        Grooms?  Grooms!

           Lee adjusts his hat and heads on, never looking back.

           EXT. WEED FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY

           Weed and Edmund watch Gracie’s body being unloaded.

                                 WEED
                        He’s getting reckless.  Losing 
                        control.

                                 EDMUND
                        Approaching climax.

           Weed looks down at his thick, weathered hands.  Rubs a thumb 
           along his wedding ring.

                                 WEED
                        Things can never be the same after 
                        this.  I’m lucky.  I’m old.
                          (turns to door)
                        If I may offer you some advice: 
                        God’s gift to man is cunning, not 
                        happiness.  Never let a good thing 
                        in this world go.  Never.

           He goes inside.  Edmund broods.  Distantly, there is a train 
           whistle.  He turns his head toward it.

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM - DAY

           Eula looks at herself in the mirror.  The wear of her life 
           starting to show around her eyes.  With a precision that is 
           almost elegant, she raises the edge of her charm to her nose 
           and sniffs a small amount of cocaine.

           There is a KNOCK on her door.  Startled, she goes and 
           answers.  Edmund.

           EXT. SMALL PARK - DAY

           Edmund and Eula stand at a weathered gazebo, overlooking the 
           dark river sliding by.

                        Life... can feel like its own sort 
                        of prison.  Hopeless.  I’ve seen 
                        what that can do.  But the easiest 
                        thing in the world to forget is 
                        that we are our jailers.

                        I came to make no such argument.

           EXT. SERVANT’S CABIN - EVENING

           A stiff wind rattles the window panes.  Inside - dark and 
           empty, bloodstains on the walls.

He 
           searches the ground for anything, some scrap of hope.  

           He kneels and feels at a bloody patch of grass.  There’s 
           nothing here.  The horse snorts.  

                                 LEE
                        Okay, girl.

           With one last glance at the cabin, he mounts the horse around 
           and begins to trot off.

           Something catches his eye and he stops.  He stares at 
           something on the ground (unseen).  Steam.

           INT. REBECCA RAMEY’S CABIN - EVENING

           Henry slips into his coat, grabs his hat.  Behind him, 
           Rebecca slowly sweeps a broom across the floor without 
           purpose.  Tense silence.

                                 HENRY
                        Lacey Mitchell’s gonna come by and 
                        check on you.

           She watches him check that the pistol is loaded and stick it 
           in his waistband.

           He pauses at the door.  Feels her eyes on his back.

                                 HENRY
                        Tell me to do this, Rebecca.  Tell 
                        me to send this devil to hell.

           Beat.  He leaves with the Bible.  She holds there, clutching 
           the broom tight.

           INT. SEEDY SALOON - NIGHT

           Smoke.  This joint makes the Dust Devil look like the Ritz.  
           Edmund drinks at a corner table.  

           The Bible drops on the table - Henry standing beside him.

                          (sitting)
                        Maybe.  According to Genesis the 
                        twins Esau and Jacob wrestled in 
                        their mother’s womb.  Eventually 
                        they came to found two nations: 
                        Jacob was a dweller of tents, Esau 
                        a brutal hunter.  The two-faced 
                        mask, the tattoo - I think we’re 
                        dealing with a mind that’s split in 
                        two: a man who walks in the sun, a 
                        man with a job or family, who you 
                        could tip your hat to on the street 
                        and be none the wiser, and the one 
                        beneath it.

           Edmund takes a big drink, lost in his glass.  

                                 HENRY
                        Look at me.

           He does.  

                                 HENRY
                        Not bein’ quick to pull the trigger 
                        on another man - ain’t no shame in 
                        that.

           Edmund nods gratefully, but Henry’s sees he hasn’t reached 
           him.  Henry, takes a deep breath, seeming to steel himself 
           for something painful, and reaches into his coat pocket.

                                 HENRY
                        Show you something.

           He produces a weathered tin-type PHOTOGRAPH of a black woman 
           in a bonnet.  She vaguely resembles Rebecca.

                        green and you’ll half believe it.  
                        She said it was all in his head, 
                        she was fine, fine... Till four 
                        months later she took a nap on the 
                        train tracks.  But she weren’t 
                        alone.

           Henry taps her stomach.  In Edmund’s eyes - pain and total 
           sympathy.  He knows that hurt like his own name.

                                 HENRY
                        Now here was a mystery to be 
                        solved, and Henry Simms, believe it 
                        or not, had a habit of solving 
                        problems with his fists.  Several 
                        busted jaws later and Simms has the 
                        story: she couldn’t bring herself 
                        to get rid of it, but couldn’t face 
                        bringing into the world neither, 
                        not knowing if the father was the 
                        husband or the captain who’d taken 
                        a shine to her-- the white field 
                        marshal’s son who got out of drills 
                        one afternoon and wasn’t used to 
                        taking no for an answer.

           Henry can’t help dig his nails into his hand.  Pain.

                                 EDMUND
                        What did you do to him?

                                 HENRY
                          (exhales wearily)
                        Nothin’.  Rebecca made me promise 
                        on my wife’s fresh dug grave I 
                        wouldn’t try to honor her with my 
                        own death warrant.  So I took a new 
                        name, made myself to all parties’ 
                        satisfaction, and last I heard the 
                        boy was in a sanitorium, half-
                        rotted with syphilis.  And I may 
                        regret that decision every goddamn 
                        day, but here you are with the 
                        pleasure of my company.  

           Edmund looks up at him, and there is an unspoken 
           understanding.
                                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 EDMUND
                        He came to me last night.  You may 
                        be right.  Those eyes...  He wasn’t 
                        a man.  And he’s not finished.
                          (beat)
                        I just want another chance.

                                 HENRY
                        The one who walks in the sun.  He 
                        wants to be found, wants to kill 
                        the other.

           Edmund’s mind turns on Henry’s words.  Something strikes him.

                                 EDMUND
                        “The one beneath it.”

           He jumps to his feet.

           EXT. DEAD-END ALLEY - NIGHT

           Henry and Edmund stand in the trashy alley where Henry lost 
           the killer.  Edmund searches around.

                                 EDMUND
                        This is where it ended?  Where you 
                        lost him?

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah.  What’re you looking for?

           Edmund shoves over an old crate, revealing a SEWER GRATE.  
           They look into hushed black beneath it.

           INT. SEWERS - NIGHT

           Darkness is washed away as a lantern comes to life in 
           Edmund’s hand.  He and Henry, gun drawn, stand on the small 
           walkway ledge of the a narrow tunnel beside a stream of 
           sewage and water.  Edmund holds back a gag.

                                 EDMUND
                        There was a grate at the first 
                        murder scene.

                                 HENRY
                        Shelley’s too.

           They look both ways down the tunnel, unsure.  Henry squats 
           down and Edmund shines the light there.  BOOTPRINTS in the 
           grime.
                                                   (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)           Henry cocks the pistol, and they head in.

           LATER

           They cautiously press forward.  Rats squeak in the dark.

                                 EDMUND
                        There must be two dozen of these 
                        grate openings throughout the city.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Thirty-five.

           They freeze, pistol pointed.  A match strikes ahead of them 
           and lights a cigarette - Lee.  He rubs his boot on the muck.

                                 LEE
                        Rains washed away most of the 
                        bootprints.

           He looks up at them through his smoke.

                                 LEE
                        What do you know.

           Henry glances at Edmund, lowers his gun.

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Edmund, Henry, and Lee stand in the shadowy shelter of a 
           cluttered alley.  

           Henry studies a SEWER SYSTEM MAP on a barrel head.  Edmund 
           and Lee huddle around him.

                                 EDMUND
                          (to Lee)
                        What do you think?

                                 LEE
                        A solitary white man with access to 
                        the whole of the city?  We’ll have 
                        as good of luck selling Christ as 
                        the killer.

                                 HENRY
                        You wanted to know.

                                 LEE
                        And I’m telling you -- it can’t be 
                        done.  You’d need dozens of men to 
                        cover every grate.  
                                 (MORE)
                                                    (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 LEE(cont'd)
                        If the town catches a whiff of that 
                        it’ll explode, and Robertson won’t 
                        allow that.  

                                 HENRY
                        Even if it means another dead 
                        woman?

           Edmund looks up at them - knows they’re both right.

                                 EDMUND
                        Dead negro, yes.  He’s targeting 
                        the black community because he can.  
                        This cocksucker knows how to tow 
                        the line.

           Tense stare between Henry and Lee.

                                 HENRY
                        What’re you trying to do?

                                 LEE
                          (beat)
                        My job.

           Lee tosses his smoke.  Edmund steps back, thinking.

                                 EDMUND
                        We don’t need the men.  His victims 
                        may be random, but his methods 
                        aren’t.  These killings - like you 
                        said, there’s ritual to it all, 
                        meaning.  

                                 LEE
                        And?

                                 EDMUND
                        He’ll use the same entrance every 
                        time.  Some place deserted at 
                        night, but central.

           Something strikes Edmund.  He looks at Henry standing over 
           the map.

                                 EDMUND
                        Where does that tunnel terminate?

           EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT

           A SIGN with an artist’s rendition of the completed capitol 
           building.  Above it: “THE FUTURE OF AUSTIN”.
                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)           Behind the sign, sprawl the messy pieces of that picture - 
           stone blocks, wooden beams, and PIPES leading to a

           HOLE IN THE GROUND

           And the open sewer tunnel there.  Edmund, Henry, and Lee 
           stand around it.

           Lee takes a knee.  He looks around at the wide chaos of the 
           construction then up at the sky.  A rain drop hits the brow 
           of his hat, then another.

           He picks up his Winchester rifle and checks a shell is 
           loaded.  Adjusts his hat.

                                 LEE
                        Gentlemen.  Let’s kill this 
                        motherless fuck.

           LATER

           Light drizzle.  Edmund, Henry, and Lee sit hidden by granite 
           blocks within view of the sewer entrance.  They pass Edmund’s 
           flask.

           Lee watches Edmund pull his collar up.

                                 LEE
                        First night in the elements?

                                 EDMUND
                        First conscious one.

           Edmund starts to light a cigar.

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t.  The wind - he’ll smell it.

           Edmund puts it away.  Lee studies Henry.

                                 LEE
                        You work the warpath?

                                 HENRY
                        What?

                                 LEE
                        Tracker’s instincts.  I’m guessing 
                        Indian hunter.

                                 HENRY
                        Blake’s 9th cavalry.  
           (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                 LEE
                        Rangers.  Fifteen years.  I crossed 
                        paths with a couple of them colored 
                        companies, though.  Good soldiers, 
                        sharp.  You get far enough out 
                        there for long enough, and that’s 
                        all you have - instincts.  Skin 
                        don’t matter.  Everybody just 
                        animals in the dirt.

                                 HENRY
                        If you say so.

                                 LEE
                          (looks up at the sky)
                        But I do miss the stars.  Probably 
                        spent more nights under them than a 
                        roof.
                          (beat)
                        Fifteen years.  Too fuckin’ long.  
                        It changes you.  

                                 HENRY
                        Yes it does.

           Henry’s mind appears to drift to darker thoughts.  Lee’s 
           rough, scarred hand picks at rocks in the dirt.

                                 LEE
                        I’ve worked a lot of places ‘round 
                        the country, but Texas...  You 
                        cross that Red River, there’s no 
                        going back.  Out there in that 
                        nothin’, the things you see - You 
                        learn fast that four walls and a 
                        soft pillow is all that separates a 
                        charitable Christian from a savage 
                        bathing in the blood of his enemy.  
                        But here I am.  I guess in a way 
                        the city is just a great big 
                        promise we all enter into to keep 
                        that savage caged up.  
                          (beat)
                        Now this fella...  Ain’t known 
                        nothin’ like this before.  Maybe 
                        ain’t no man at all, may be a 
                        spirit like all them old niggers 
                        say.  A ghost.   
                          (sad chuckle)
                        Might as well be.  A man like 
                        that...

                        You know how it feels to kill a 
                        thing?

           Henry doesn’t respond - yes.

                                 LEE (CONT’D)
                        Cut down all manner in my time.  
                        Killin’s hard, ain’t no fucking 
                        doubt.  Not nearly as hard, though, 
                        as living with what you took.  And 
                        once you stepped over that slope 
                        ain’t nothin’ much to do for 
                        yourself but roll.  But this...  
                        The stomach it takes to do 
                        something like this, the goddamn 
                        patience.  This fella lives for it.  
                        It’s bigger than he is.  Running 
                        him like a locomotive.  
                          (beat)
                        Whole town looking for him.  
                        Nothing.  Man like that...  
                          (beat)
                        How can you stop something can’t 
                        even stop itself?

           Lee becomes aware of his openness.

                                 LEE
                        Fuckin’ booze.  

           He passes the flask and stands.

                                 LEE
                        I gotta take a shit.

           He grabs his rifle, and walks off a few paces, stomps to make 
           a crow on the ground fly off.

                                 LEE
                        Hateful fuckin’ things.

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM - NIGHT

           Eula humming as she packs.  She picks up a nice dress and 
           holds it up to herself in the mirror -- heartbreaking smile.  
           She notices a small hole by the armpit, puts a finger through 
           it.

           She picks up a sewing kit and sits with the dress on her lap.
                                             (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)           EXT. CAPITOL CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT 

           Henry glances up as thunder rolls in the distance.

                                 HENRY
                        Getting closer.

           A PEBBLE hits Edmund’s boot.  He looks up and sees Lee 
           standing off in the dark, nodding toward the sewer entrance.

           Edmund and Henry freeze and look - the man in the tarpaulin 
           coat there, descending.

           Two CLICKS as Henry and Lee cock their guns.

           INT. SEWERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Edmund’s boots hit the water, as he drops down beside Henry 
           and Lee.

           Henry strides forward with his gun, no attempt at stealth.  
           Lee and Edmund follow.

           Henry comes to a cross tunnel, listens.  Marches forward.

           He spies a hint of movement ahead, and breaks into a run.

           The man with his back to him.  Henry SLAMS him into the wall, 
           knocking the man’s hat off.  Smack and thud - It’s all a 
           chaotic blur in the dark.

                                 EDMUND
                        Henry!

           Henry crushes the man’s throat and presses the barrel against 
           his temple.

                                 MAN
                        Oh God, no!

           Henry now catches a look at the man’s face, or rather the 
           TEENAGE BOY’S - his terrified eyes.  Edmund and Lee run up.

                                 TEENAGE BOY
                        Please don’t.  I’m sorry.

           Edmund and Lee share a confused look.

                                 EDMUND
                        Who are you?  What’re you doing 
                        down here?
                                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                 TEENAGE BOY
                          (still terrified)
                        I just--  This fella gimme five 
                        dollars come down here with his 
                        coat.  I don’t know why.  When I 
                        asked him, he just gimme five more.

           Henry still holds his gun at the kid’s head, eye’s burning.

                                 EDMUND
                        Henry.

           Henry ignores him until Edmund puts a hand on his shoulder.  
           He lowers the pistol.

                                 TEENAGE BOY
                        Are you the reporter?

           Edmund looks back at the kid - oh fuck.

                                 TEENAGE BOY
                        Man told me to give you this.

           He hands Edmund EULA’S NECKLACE.  They all know what this 
           means.

                                 TEENAGE BOY
                        Please, I just want to go home.  I 
                        just want to go home... 

           Edmund takes a stunned step back.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Edmund charging through the drizzle like a madman.  Henry and 
           Lee race behind him.

           A RIDER on horseback crosses Edmund’s path.  He rips the man 
           down.

                                 RIDER
                        The fuck’re you doin’?!

           Edmund springs into the saddle.  The man pulls a small pistol 
           from his coat, aims--  And is slammed by Henry.

           Edmund spurs the horse, oblivious.

                                 HENRY
                        Edmund!

           But he’s already tearing off through the mud.

           Whips the horse into a froth.  

           FLASH FROM EARLIER--

           Long shot of Edmund clasping Eula’s hand by the creek.  Back 
           view of a short, sturdy man observing them.

           STREET - PRESENT

           Edmund rounds a corner.  Hooves hammer the road.

           ANOTHER FLASH--

           Edmund leaving Eula’s.  He passes a sewer grate.

           PARK - PRESENT

           Edmund tears across the park, ducking branches.

           ANOTHER FLASH--

           Eula, in bed, stirs.

                                 EULA
                        Edmund?

           In the dark, a figure is kneeling on the floor, facing the 
           other direction, as though in prayer.

           She sits up, confused.

           The leering MASK turns.  

           EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - PRESENT (MOMENTS LATER)

           Edmund pulls up reins and leaps from the horse.

           SMASH - Edmund shoulders the door open, stumbles, scrambles 
           around the corner to

           EULA’S ROOM

           It’s empty.  Edmund pants.  It’s then he sees a smear of 
           BLOOD on the door frame.  A soft CREAK...

           He looks down the hall - and the open SIDE DOOR slowly 
           swaying in the breeze.
                                           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)           EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Edmund bursts out of the side door.  He gasps and winces as 
           though sucker-punched -- 

           Beneath a tree stands the man in the mask, Eula slumped on 
           her knees before him.  Her nightgown is torn and bloody, and 
           her face a battered mess.

           The man looks up at Edmund.  He tugs Eula up by her hair.  
           Holds the knife to her throat and the ax in his other hand.

           Edmund drops to his knees, almost in tears.

                                 EDMUND
                        Oh please, God, no.

           Eula does her best to struggle, but it’s all been beaten out 
           of her.  Her swollen eyes lock on Edmund - her desperation, 
           helplessness.

                                 KILLER
                          (to Edmund)
                        How does this feel?

           Edmund can only stare.

           The killer presses knife harder against her throat, raises 
           the ax to her cheek.  She squirms.

           Edmund clenches his jaw, full of fury and pain, but 
           completely impotent.  It is all he can do to say in one 
           piece. 

                                 EDMUND
                        Don’t.  I’m begging you.  I’ll do 
                        whatever you want.  Anything.

           The killer is impassive.  A LIGHT comes on in one of the 
           upper boarding house windows.  He glances that way, then back 
           at Edmund.

                                 KILLER
                        Yes...

           Beneath the mask, Edmund can see the man’s mouth stretch into 
           a shining grin...

                                 EULA
                          (barely a whisper)
                        Edmund.
                                            (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                 KILLER
                        That’s what they do to you.

           Edmund’s eyes go wide.  

                                 EDMUND
                        NO!

           He leaps forward -- just as the man, in one powerful, fluid 
           motion, cuts her throat and hacks her with the ax.

           The man spins and darts into the night.

           Edmund catches Eula just as she falls.  She clutches at his 
           coat.  Blood sheets down her chest.

           He presses his hand to the wound, but it’s no use.  Her eyes 
           search his for help, terrified.  Her mouth moves as though 
           gasping for air.

                                 EDMUND
                        No, no, no.  I’m right here.  
                        You’re okay, it’s okay...

           Tears run down her pale cheeks.  She shakes, tries to speak, 
           but can’t.  Coughs blood.

           Edmund pushes all his fear and anger down, and tries to calm 
           for her, knowing there’s no hope.

           He takes her bloody, shaking hand in his.  Brushes her hair 
           back.

                                 EDMUND
                        Look at me.  It’s okay.  We’re 
                        okay, we’re okay, we’re okay...

           He continues to mumble the words as she fades away.  Her grip 
           goes weak, and her hand falls.  

           Dimly, a few bars of Edmund’s mother HUMMING.

           Two more short gasps for air.  And Eula’s gone.

           Edmund’s words break apart into a SOB.  Pulls her close.  

           He buries his face in her shoulder, and lets out a muffled 
           yell of utter fucking anguish.

           Henry and Lee jog up panting, guns ready.  They see.

           Lee puts a hand on his gut, turns away.  A WOMAN screams up 
           in the window.
                                                 (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                 LEE
                          (to woman)
                        Get inside and lock your door!

           Henry takes a step up to Edmund.  Reaches out.  

           Edmund looks up to the building - and a curtain gently 
           wafting there.  Before our eyes his face becomes pure burning 
           hate.  He stands, looking into the darkness ahead.

           EXT. RIVERFRONT - MOMENTS LATER

           Trees give way to rotting lumber and rusting refuse of the 
           mills and small factories along the river.

           Edmund crashes through the brush and scrambles around and 
           over the debris in a mad dash after the killer.

           Henry hot on his heels.  Lee lags behind, pauses, and veers 
           off for the road.

           The man in the mask can barely be seen - flashes of movement 
           ahead.  He zips into the decrepit half-collapsed wreckage of 
           an old

           WAREHOUSE

           Edmund and Henry right in after him, still sprinting - pure 
           adrenaline.

           Henry FIRES a shot.  Splinters fly from a board beside the 
           man’s head, just as he leaps out of a small opening at the 
           other side of the building.

           Groans of CATTLE ahead.  Edmund dives through the same 
           opening

           OUTSIDE

           And slams and rolls over an old flatbed wagon - and 
           immediately back to a run through the weeds.

           Ahead, the man disappears into a small CATTLE PEN attached to 
           a two story brick building.

           Edmund glance back at Henry, point toward the back of the 
           building.

                                 EDMUND
                        Go!
                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                        (cid:13)           Henry branches off that way.  Edmund vaults over the fence 
           into the

           CATTLE PEN

           Two dozen cattle mill about with big snorts of foggy breath.  
           Edmund creeps quickly through them.  Quiet, save his panting 
           breaths and the low moans and wet stomps of the cattle.

           He draws his knife, crouched, eyes searching through the 
           lumbering bodies.

           Ahead - the busted latch and open gate to the narrow cattle 
           shoot heading inside.  A SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

           EXT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE, FRONT - SAME

           Lee falls back against the brick, winded.  He takes a few 
           breaths, then BASHES in the front door with his rifle butt.

           Swings the gun up to the darkness inside.  A short hall.  
           Stairs.  Still and quiet.

           INT. CATTLE SHOOT - CONTINUOUS

           Edmund’s boots pound the muddy boards, as he races through 
           into the

           SLAUGHTERHOUSE

           Slides to a stop in the blood of the sunken killing floor.  
           It’s a sprawling, semi-divided room.  Chains and hooks swing 
           from the ceiling - someone’s come through there.

           He moves up the steps into the main floor.  Somewhere O.S. 
           the distant sound of a machine and a periodic GRINDING noise.

           Little light.  Flies buzz.  Floor slick with blood.  You can 
           smell the stench.   

           SLAUGHTERHOUSE, FRONT - STAIRS (INTERCUT WITH EDMUND)

           Lee slowly moves up the stairs, rifle ready.

           Below, Edmund approaches a HEAVY DOOR across the room.  The 
           grinding sound coming from behind it.  

           He spies Henry at the dirty back window.  Henry shakes his 
           head - nothing.
                                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)           Upstairs, Lee swings around a corner, aims at nothing.  Halls 
           and compartments of equipment.  Not a sound except the light 
           rain tapping the roof.

           Edmund grips the door handle and his knife.  Shoves into the

           COLD STORAGE ROOM

           Carcasses hang from hooks.  Crushed ice packs the floors and 
           rear wall.

           He steps further in.  A fierce GRINDING--  He spins around, 
           sees a square HOLE in the wall spit out crushed ice.  Calms. 

           Lee turns down a hall.  A window, and the killer silhouetted 
           against it in the first light of dawn.

           Edmund jumps at GUNFIRE upstairs.

           Lee ejects the shell, stares quizzically through the curling 
           gunsmoke.  He reaches out -- and pulls the man’s coat from a 
           pair of hooks.

           THUD - Lee winces and goes rigid, as the man buries his knife 
           into his lower back.

           Lee grits his teeth, reaches back and grabs a hold of the 
           man’s neck.  Brings the man’s head forward to look him in the 
           eye.  He’s not going down easy.  

                                 LEE
                        Look at me, you bitch’s bastard.

           The man twists the knife.  Lee buckles and falls to the 
           floor.

           His head lolls back against the wall.  He looks up as the man 
           produces his ax.

           Lee hacks spit on the man’s boot.  The man raises the ax.

           RUNNING FOOTSTEPS.  He turns just as Edmund SLAMS into him, 
           and both go crashing through the window.

           EXT. ICE FACTORY - CONTINUOUS

           In a shower of glass, the two tumble, SMASHING down through a 
           tin tube (where the ice was coming from) and the shingled 
           roof, finally - CRUNCH - falling hard onto a stack of ICE 
           BLOCKS stacked on the wagon loading dock.  
                                    (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)           Two WORKERS scamper away from the melee.  Ice explodes in  
           Edmund’s face as he dodges the swinging ax blade.

           Edmund stabs back - but the killer catches his knife with 
           his.  The man raises up to take another swing, then suddenly 
           rolls back--

           BOOM-BOOM - two pistol shots crack into the wall where he 
           was, from Henry standing in the shattered window.

           SLAUGHTERHOUSE

           Henry offers his hand to Lee - who slaps his rifle into it.

           Henry hesitates, then runs down the hall.  Lee looks at the 
           blood on his hand, more frustrated than anything.

                                 LEE
                        Goddamn it.

           ICE FACTORY LOADING DOCK

           Edmund leaps after the man into the

           ICE FACTORY

           Wheels and pistons churn on a massive ICE MACHINE.  Edmund 
           charges like some unleashed beast.  

           He tackles the killer into the machine - ax goes spinning 
           away.  Edmund cracks him in the face.  Slices his arm.

           The two go at it, close and ferocious, with fists and blades.  
           This is no movie knife fight.  Both get licks in - stabbed, 
           sliced, broken ribs, nose - but there’s no stopping them.    

           Edmund catches the man’s stabbing knife an inch from his gut.  
           Barely holds it off. Closer - then spins and the knife shoves 
           into the gearworks of the machine and is jerked from the 
           man’s hand.

           They roll and slam into a stack of ice blocks, knocking a few 
           down.  Edmund slashes with his knife - blood spatters the 
           ice.

           The man smacks Edmund to the ground.  Edmund narrowly dodges 
           as an ice block SMASHES down beside his head.  He grabs an 
           ICE HOOK and pulls the man’s leg out from under him.

           Edmund rears up with the knife - just as the man’s hand falls 
           on his ax in the slush.

           groggy and bleeding, as the man finds his feet and runs for 
           the

           LONG DOCK

           And the ice-loaded STERN WHEEL RIVER BOAT shoving off there.

           ICE FACTORY

           Blood runs down Edmund’s face.  He slowly rises to his hands 
           and knees.  Takes in air, and looks up at the man leaping 
           onto the steamboat.  

           LONG DOCK

           Edmund runs with everything he has.  The boat moving off. 

           He jumps...

           EXT. STERN WHEEL RIVER BOAT - CONTINUOUS

           ...and catches the railing.  Pulls himself up.  

           He staggers forward.  Sees a thin trail of blood on the deck.  

           Ahead, a SHIPWORKER stumbles out of a door, hand pressed to a 
           gash on his head, and drops to the ground.

           Edmund, moves toward the door, back pressed to the wall - 
           leaving a long smear of blood along it.

           Throws open the door.  An empty hall.

           He catches a flash of movement above him, and jumps back just 
           as a POLE HOOK swings down and stabs into the door frame - 
           the killer on the upper deck.

           Edmund somersaults back over the railing, but clamps on 
           before falling.

           The killer hops down to the deck and wrenches the hook free.  
           Edmund’s bloody hands struggle to hold.

           The hook swings up - BAM - the wood bursts in splinters and 
           the killer’s hand pours blood.  He drops to his knee in pain.  
           Another bullet SMASHES into the wall beside him.

           RIVERFRONT

           Henry jacks the rifle lever and aims again.

           A distant TRAIN WHISTLE.  The killer sees a RAIL BRIDGE 
           approaching ahead, and makes a dash for the stairs, another 
           SHOT narrowly missing him.

           Edmund summons some strength and pulls.

           RIVERFRONT

           Henry aims - CLICK.  Empty.  He drops the rifle, whips out 
           his revolver, and empties the last three shots at the killer.  
           No good.  

           Henry sees him making his way to the ship wheelhouse.  Sees 
           the black plume of smoke from the FREIGHT TRAIN nearing the 
           bridge.

           He takes off in that direction.

           RIVER BOAT

           The killer clambers up, desperation killing all pain.  He 
           reaches the wheelhouse roof, and stands waiting for the 
           bridge and its train a few yards ahead.  

           A hand grabs his ankle - Edmund.  He tugs the man down and 
           slugs him.  Smack - again.  

           Flash of the ax--

           RIVER BOAT WHEELHOUSE (INTERCUT)

           The CAPTAIN at the wheel looks up at the noise.  The ax blade 
           cracks through the ceiling.

           WHEELHOUSE ROOF

           Edmund holds off the ax, trading blows with him.  The bridge 
           only a few feet off now, and the train almost across it.

           BOOM!  A huge hole blows through the roof - the captain below 
           with a double-barrel hammer shotgun.

           Edmund rolls off the roof, dodging the second barrel’s shot.

           The killer lunges up - and catches the I-beam of the bridge, 
           the slow train thundering above him.  Starts to climb.

           Edmund, on his back, looks up at the bridge passing over him.  
           He pulls himself up.
                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)           EXT. RAIL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           The river boat moves below.  Edmund’s hands slap onto an I-
           beam on the other side of the bridge.  

           Slow climb.  He sees the last train car approaching.  He 
           searches through the beams and wheels for the killer.  

           His arms shake with fatigue.  Foot slips, catches.   

           The final car passes, just as he makes a dive for it.

           Misses.

           And the killer is gone.

           Edmund pants, staring through blood and sweat at the train 
           clacking away toward the railyard.

           Breathes harder, finding energy.

           EXT. RAILYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Blue light of dawn over a muddy maze of hulking rail cars on 
           and off tracks.  

           The freight train hisses to a stop, and the killer drops to 
           the ground from between cars.  Searches - a TRAIN WHISTLE 
           blows across the yard.

           Boots drop from the train and hit the mud behind him.

           The killer turns - and catches Henry’s fist in the face.

           The killer reels.  Henry seizes him and SLAMS his head into 
           the boxcar.  The killer falls to all fours, spitting blood.  
           Henry KICKS him in the mouth.

           The killer sprawls onto his back.  Henry crouches over him, 
           pulls the hatchet from the man’s coat, raises it--

           Henry gasps and falls back against the train.  The killer’s 
           spike buried in his side.

           The killer drags to his feet, stands before him.  He takes 
           off toward the sound of the whistle.

           With muffled grunt, Henry pulls the spike out.  Drops it.

           He grips the ax and is after him.  His eyes - savage, 
           unstoppable.

           (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)           The killer jumps up and through an old rail car.  Across 
           tracks.  Henry right behind him.

           INT. RAILYARD SHACK - CONTINUOUS

           A RAIL WORKER lounges in a SHACK.  He sees the bloody killer 
           whiz by the open door, followed by Henry with the ax. 

                                 RAIL WORKER
                          (sitting up)
                        Holy shit...

           EXT. RAILYARD - CONTINUOUS

           The killer and Henry charge deeper into the maze of tracks 
           and cars. 

           The killer vanishes behind a boxcar.  Once again, TRAIN 
           WHISTLE, now closer.

           Henry slows as he approaches the shadows.

           He surges around the boxcar, but no one is there.  Turns, and 
           the killer BASHES him with a rock.  The hatchet goes skidding 
           to the ground, and Henry falls, heavy, like there’s no 
           getting up this time.  

           The killer drops the rock and leaves Henry lying there.

           Henry dives after the killer on all fours, seizing his pant 
           leg.  The killer kicks at him, but Henry grips his foot and 
           twists brutally.  The killer SHRIEKS and falls.  

           Henry headbutts him once, twice.  Wrests himself on top of 
           him.

           A train rolling away close by.  The killer regards Henry 
           without apology or enmity -- he is defeated but gives no 
           ground.  

           Henry wraps a hand on his throat, starts to squeeze.  

           BAM! - a gunshot.

           TRAIN TRACKS - SAME

           Edmund follows the tracks at a limping run.  He freezes, 
           hearing the gunshot ahead.

           Runs on, faster.
                                            (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                    (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                              (cid:13)           RAILYARD

           Dark BLOOD pumps from Henry’s chest.

           Several yards behind him stands the Rail Worker with a 
           smoking RIFLE.

                                 RAIL WORKER
                        I got him.  I got him!

           Henry continues to squeeze the killer’s neck, then slowly 
           looks off, middle-distance, at the dawn, fading.

           His grip loosens and he slumps over. 

           The perplexed killer crawls from under him.  Grabs the ax, 
           shakily stands.  Henry, barely conscious, looks up at him.  
           The killer once more regards him clinically, before racing 
           off to the train as it gains speed.

           Edmund shoves the Rail Worker out of the way, sees Henry.  

                                 EDMUND
                        No...

           He takes a few more steps, stumbles.  Gets to his feet and 
           moves on - the walking dead.  He’s losing it.

           He drops to his knees beside Henry, who lies on his side, 
           glassy eyes staring off at the sunrise.  On his face - a 
           smile?

           Edmund looks up half-eyed.  In the distance, the killer drags 
           himself up on the caboose ladder of the rolling train. 

           Edmund raises his weak arm - with Henry’s pistol.  

           Shaky aim.  Thumbs back the hammer...CLICK.  

           Hammer...CLICK.  Again.  And again.  The killer watches him.  
           Two broken men.

           The killer fades away in the rain.  

           Edmund lowers the gun.  Stares out at nothing.

           Elegiac fiddle takes us into...

           MONTAGE - AFTERMATH

           1) The town humming with the news - “a white woman.”
                                                (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)

           Smith, was found.

           3) Mayor Robertson trying to maintain order at a chaotic town 
           meeting.  Chenneville, now marshal, squirms at his side.

           4) The muddy corner where Eliza Shelley was found.

           5) Edmund, stitched and bandaged, stands at Rebecca’s door.  
           It opens.

           6) Irene Cross’s dark doorway.

           7) A familiar back walks up a ship gangplank.

           8) A wagon rolls by Mary Ramey’s murder site.

           9) Graveyard.  Edmund, Weed, Rebecca, and others watch as 
           Henry is laid to rest beside Mary.

           10) The empty lawn and cabin where Gracie Vance was murdered.

           11) Lee sits shirtless and bandaged on his porch, watching 
           his wife and daughters play in the yard.  He smiles but it 
           can’t cover the look in his eyes - haunted.

           12) The tree and grassy patch between buildings where Eula 
           was killed.

           13) Eula’s necklace hanging from Edmund’s bruised hand.

           14) Edmund standing in the observation car of a train, 
           watching Austin go by.  Clack-clack...Clack-clack...Clack-
           clack...  

           BLACK

           That sharp heartbeat of the train gives way to the light 
           clack-clack-clack of a typewriter...

           INT. EDMUND’S OFFICE - DAY

           Edmund at a desk, typing fitfully, absorbed.

           There is a stack of radical new books on CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY 
           on his desk.  He has become a man consumed.

           His father, James, knocks softly and steps in.  He glances at 
           what Edmund is typing, Freudian terms leaping out like 
           “totenism,” “erotogenicity,” “death instinct.”  It’s clear 
           this is for personal reference, not an article.

                                 JAMES
                        A few of the men and I are stepping 
                        out for supper, if you’d like to 
                        join us.

                                 EDMUND
                          (never looking up)
                        Maybe next time.

           James nods resignedly, expecting this response - a very 
           different sort of concern on his face than before.  He 
           leaves.

           Edmund types away, then stops, rubs his face.  His eyes fall 
           on an open drawer - and Eula’s necklace inside.

           INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE, WASHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Edmund wipes water from his face at the basin.  He pulls out 
           a flask and drinks.  

           He starts to screw the top back on, then viciously hurls it 
           across the room and kicks the trash can.  Leans against the 
           wall - frustration and old open wounds getting to him.

           INT. EDMUND’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Edmund slumps back down into his chair, and looks over his 
           work.

           James steps back in.

                                 JAMES
                        Almost forgot.  London paper’s just 
                        in.

           He sets a NEWSPAPER on Edmund’s desk.
                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                     (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 JAMES
                        Good night, son.

           He pats Edmund’s shoulder and leaves.  Edmund takes up the 
           paper and looks it over - routine.

           He stares frozen a moment, then leaps to his feet.

           INSERT: LONDON NEWSPAPER HEADLINE: “EAST END DEMON!  HORROR 
           WITHOUT PRECEDENT!”

           EXT. LONDON - NIGHT

           An indigo sky over the Thames.  A fog rolling in.

           SUPER: London

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           A cheap, sparse room with a large MAP lying on the bed.  It 
           is a grid of the London sewer system with lines drawn over it 
           - murder sites.  At the confluence of these lines there is a 
           circle.

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           A lighted window across the street - a voyeur's view inside, 
           where a matronly WOMAN kisses a small GIRL and sends her 
           upstairs.

           INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The woman hums a hymn as she tidies up the room.  From a dark 
           doorway behind her steps a figure in a long tarpaulin coat.

           She sees him - and smiles.

                                 WOMAN
                        They got you working another night 
                        shift?

                                 MAN
                        The docks sleep for no man.

           This is his home, his life.

           She gives him a peck on the cheek.

                        Be safe, love.

           EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The man walks out, buttoning his coat, and heads down the 
           side alley.

           And all seems still a moment - until Edmund emerges from the 
           shadows across the street and follows.

           EXT. ALLEY - LATER

           Edmund stands against a building a block away from the man, 
           who lowers himself into a sewer opening.

           Edmund pulls out Henry’s revolver, checks the cylinder, and 
           cocks it.

           INT. SEWERS - NIGHT

           Edmund drops down onto a trashed, wet NEWSPAPER - headline: 
           “Ripper Strikes Again!  More Whitechapel Butchery!” 

           He quickly steps out of the moonlight from the opening above, 
           and leans against the damp brick, eyes adjusting and darting 
           around like a predator’s.

           Moonlight shines from small grates in the ceiling, the only 
           light.  He looks down the tunnel both ways, listening close.  
           No sign of movement.  The only sound is that of the trickle 
           of water at his feet.  Something’s not right.  He was just 
           here.  

           Edmund finally pushes off the wall and creeps forward--

           The man BURSTS from a recess in the wall beside him.  The gun 
           FIRES as he slams into Edmund, knocking them both into the 
           water.  The pistol spins away.

           Flash of a LONG BLADE.  Edmund ducks, sparks fly as it 
           scrapes the brick where his head was.   

           They struggle, tooth and nail.  The man is an animal.  Little 
           can be seen of his face, save the shine of his barred teeth.  
           He drools in anticipation, the knife pressing closer to 
           Edmund’s throat.

           Edmund gets a boot under the man and kicks him away, then 
           scrambles for the fallen pistol.
                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)           He spins back with it, and FIRES, just as the man runs into a 
           side tunnel.

           Edmund charges in after him, an animal himself.  

           SIDE TUNNEL

           Edmund races through the darkness.

                                 EDMUND
                        You think you can run!

           BAM - muzzle flash as he fires into the tunnel ahead.

                                 EDMUND
                        You think there’s a place in this 
                        world you can run from me!

           Another shot lights up his face, savage and unhinged.

           EXT. RIVER, DRAINAGE PIPE - MOMENTS LATER

           The killer emerges, climbs up a concrete embankment, and runs 
           into a

           PARK

           Breathing raggedly, he darts across the lawn to a tall fence, 
           on the other side of which is some kind of pavilion.  

           He desperately climbs the fence and leaps to the other side, 
           but there is a TEARING NOISE and he jerks in mid-air -- his 
           long coat has snagged and he is suspended a foot or two over 
           the ground. 

           He kicks at the fence violently, ripping the coat free, and 
           continues to run.

           BAM!  He falls in front of some kind of CIRCUS TENT.  Edmund, 
           on the other side of the fence, has shot him squarely in the 
           back.

           PAVILION

           The killer lies on his face RASPING.  Edmund approaches, 
           kicks him over.

           Edmund aims without responding.  The killer looks at him with 
           chilling calm.

                                 KILLER
                        Now I will never be forgotten.

                                 EDMUND
                        People forget everything 
                        eventually.

           A SHOT rings out across the park as he shoots him in the 
           head.

           EXT. BRIDGE - LATER

           Soft sound of boots approaching.  Edmund’s dark figure 
           emerges from the night fog. 

           He casually tosses the gun into the river, then pulls his 
           coat tight, and walk on, vanishing back into the fog.

           EXT. PAVILION - SUN-UP

           Two MEN in suits approach the tent.  One is wearing an 
           ostentatious cowboy hat, the other a Native American with 
           tribal face makeup.  A sign on the tent advertises TEXAS 
           TATUM’S WILD WEST EXTRAVAGANZA.

           Both men stop and stare: a bloody man on the ground with his 
           torn coat fallen around him almost like black wings.

                                                       FADE OUT.
