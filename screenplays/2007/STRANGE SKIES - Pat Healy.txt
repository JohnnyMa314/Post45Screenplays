           EXT. JOHNSON’S POND - DAY

           We are soaring above a frozen pond, the ice an almost 
           blinding white. The surrounding poplars frosted with new 
           snow, the sky at tree line an ash grey.

           As we fly in slow-motion, we see a young girl, ten, 
           gracefully glide along the surface on metallic skates. 
           She lithely makes several figure eight movements, marking 
           the ice, effortlessly spinning up and around and back 
           again, as we float above and beyond her.

           We hear the voice-over of our narrator: Paul Mauro. 

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        It astounds me. The euphoric felicity 
                        wrought by the simple act of a child 
                        skating around endlessly in a circle.

           As we float around the other side of the girl, she looks 
           upward, showing the thousand watt smile of impeccable 
           orthodontia. 

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Blissfully unaware that what separates 
                        them from youthful joy and plunging to a 
                        gelid death is a thin sheet of frozen 
                        water.

           The girl, now staring straight at us from our birds-eye 
           view, frowns.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Stupid little fuckers, aren’t they?

           We hear the blood-curdling scream of an infant and we are 
           in:

           INT. ERIC’S HOUSE - DAY

           A baby boy, Matthew, howls in agony. His tear-stained 
           eyes pained with hunger.

           A lone breast: pale, saggy, varicose-veined and stretch-
           marked, is pushed into his mouth by a dry hand with bad 
           nails. This silences him as he chugs away.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        I mean, God bless ‘em. If a tit in my 
                        mouth could make all my worldly concerns 
                        go away, life would be much simpler.

           The camera moves back to reveal Terry, mid-thirties but 
           looking forty. Her face is pale and malnourished. The 
           purple rings around her eyes indicate she doesn’t sleep 
           much. She has a ‘Fantastic Sam’s’ unisex haircut and the 
           gravity of her entire body has begun to shift downward.
                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Even if that tit happens to look like a 
                        rotten eggplant. 

           The camera now swings around to show Paul Mauro, 38. Not 
           an unattractive man, but the years are starting to age 
           him: physically, mentally and emotionally. He sits at a 
           dining room table opposite Terry. She looks to Paul, 
           whose timid exterior and demeanor mask his sharp, cutting 
           cynicism.

                                 TERRY
                        Sorry Paul. The kid’s gotta eat.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh. No, no no. Do what you gotta do.

           He smiles weakly at her. His eyes are sad.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Terry was a real catch once. Nice cans. I 
                        accidentally caught her changing one time 
                        at a pool party when Eric first starting 
                        dating her. 

           Paul sits next to his wife, Lee, attractive.

                                 LEE
                        He’s so hungry!

           Paul forces a laugh.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. Cute.

           Terry shoves a chunk of ham in her mouth as the kid sucks 
           like there’s no tomorrow.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Now look at her. 

           Paul’s mouth is agape, a forkful of mashed potatoes 
           unable to make its way to his face. His hand trembles.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It’s terrifying to think that the false 
                        promise of emotional value that kids 
                        provide could end in all of this.

           The camera wheels around the room and we see that we are 
           in the South Orange, New Jersey home of Paul’s brother, 
           Eric. It is a gruesome, cramped little suburban affair: 
           the walls covered in a grotesque burnt orange patterned 
           wallpaper, layered in grease and film and crayon 
           drawings. The floor is littered with toys, the counter 
           tops filled with detritus and newspapers.
                                 LEE
                        I made a broiled ham steak with a mustard 
                        glaze not long ago.

                                 TERRY
                        Oh yeah?

                                 LEE
                        Very easy Terry. You just mix the mustard 
                        with brown sugar and vinegar, cook it in 
                        a shallow pan. It’s good with asparagus. 
                        Pilaf. It was good, right honey?

           Paul distractedly smiles towards them.

                                 PAUL
                        Terrific. 

           Opposite Lee sits Eric, 40, with a ‘SPIN DOCTOR’S TOUR 
           ‘94’ T-shirt and a goatee from the same era. He stares 
           blankly, sipping a beer, oblivious to the animated 
           conversation the two women are having.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        My brother Eric. He thought he was 
                        building a kingdom.

           Paul looks to his wife Lee, who makes goo-goo eyes at the 
           nursing infant.

                                 LEE
                        Who’s the pretty baby? Who’s the pretty 
                        baby?

           She looks to Paul lovingly, batting her eyelashes at him. 
           He forces a half-smile.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        Who is the pretty baby? 

           He stares at the kid’s cross-eyed, fat little face.

                                 TERRY 
                        Bobby, take the goddamn ashtray out of 
                        your mouth! 

           Paul looks across the table to see two other small 
           children, Bobby, 4 and Megan, 2. They chatter incessantly 
           and scream, food flying from their lips, pasted against 
           their cheeks. Everyone at the table smiles in amusement. 
           Paul grimaces sourly.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) 
                        When you eat with a kid? 
           As Paul stares at the kids with his rotten expression, 
           Lee leans against him and feeds him a carrot, which he 
           chews slowly, his eyes gone slack.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Their beady little eyes barely break the 
                        plane of the table, and you have to 
                        endure inane conversation that would make 
                        a chimp sound like William Butler Yeats. 

           Lee kisses Paul on the cheek. He smiles at her.

                                 LEE
                        Aren’t they adorable?

                                 PAUL
                        Sure are.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Well not me. No way, no how. I just have 
                        to figure out a way to tell Lee. Break it 
                        to her gently. She’ll understand.

           Lee smiles warmly at Paul. Paul runs his hands lovingly 
           through her hair.

                                 PAUL (WHISPERING) (CONT'D)
                        Love you.

           They kiss.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I mean, I do. I love her to death. But 
                        kids? Not my bag.

           She goes in for a hug. He embraces her.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But now wouldn’t be the right time to 
                        tell her. She has enough on her mind, 
                        what with problems at work, not to 
                        mention that thing they cut off my bicep. 
                        Who knows what that might be?

           Paul thinks for a moment, his eyes reflecting a sort of 
           realization. He is then snapped into the conversation at 
           the table by the screeching laughter of Terry.

                                 TERRY
                        All of a sudden I look up and THE WHOLE 
                        STOVE IS ON FIRE!

           Paul looks at the infant, chugging away on that boob. He 
           seems to shoot Paul a “What the hell are you looking at?” 
           Glare. 
           Paul cocks his head and looks up again at the completely 
           oblivious Terry, openly breast feeding at the table.

                                 LEE
                        Oh my god! Did you hear that Paul?

           Paul is staring at Bobby, who is incessantly punching 
           Eric in the crotch over and over, laughing maniacally. 
           Eric barely blinks.

                                 LEE (CONT'D)
                        Paul?

           Paul turns to Lee, lost in thought.

                                 PAUL
                        Huh?

           Eric catches Paul’s eye again. Something is wrong with 
           his face. What is it? He realizes and blurts out loud:

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        JESUS ERIC! WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO 
                        YOUR EYEBROWS?

           Alarmed, Terry turns towards Eric, moving her breast from 
           the baby’s mouth and shooting a jet of milk onto Paul’s 
           lap. 

           EXT. ERIC’S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Paul and Eric stand outside on a dilapidated back porch 
           covered with wet leaves. Eric’s eyebrows almost totally 
           gone, Paul’s crotch moist with milk.

           Paul looks up to the thickening clouds in the late 
           afternoon sky and a sense of foreboding crosses his face.

                                 ERIC
                        Fuckin’ grease fire man! My whole head 
                        could’ve gone up in a ball of flame.

           Paul smiles slyly at this.

                                 PAUL
                        You wouldn’t have minded that, would you, 
                        you old dog?

                                 ERIC
                        The fuck you talking about?

                                 PAUL
                        I mean, wouldn’t that be great? Just 
                        check out, leave all this behind?
                                 ERIC
                        Hey man, speak for yourself. I got a good 
                        thing goin’. Don’t project your shit onto 
                        me.

           Eric pulls a half of a joint from a cigarette box and 
           lights it. He takes a tug and hands it to Paul.

                                 PAUL
                        I can’t. I’m driving back to Brooklyn.

                                 ERIC
                        So what? It’s not like you have three 
                        kids strapped to the backseat.

           Paul gives Eric the sly look again.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        But it’s good man. I’m not complaining.

           Paul takes a quick toke and coughs. He looks to a rusted 
           hunk of metal that used to be a Webber kettle chained to 
           a tree. It is missing a leg and looks like a sadly 
           abandoned robot, left to waste in a pile of desiccated 
           leaves.

                                 PAUL
                        Nice grill.

                                 ERIC
                        That shit causes cancer bro.

           Paul looks incredulous.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        The way it cooks the meat or something. 
                        So Terry won’t let me use it anymore. 
                        We’re into this Silk Tofu stuff. You ever 
                        had Silk Tofu?

                                 PAUL
                        Fuck off.

                                 ERIC 
                        C’mon, pretty soon you’re going to be 
                        walking in my shoes.

                                 PAUL
                        What, managing a Panda Express and 
                        spending the remainder of my days 
                        gambling online to make ends meet?

                                 ERIC
                        Hey man, I got kids to feed. Someday you 
                        will too and you’ll understand that.
                                 PAUL
                        I could just walk away Eric. I could just 
                        kiss Lee on the cheek one morning and get 
                        in the Mazda. Drive off.

           Eric tosses the joint into a pile of leaves.

                                 ERIC
                        That’s nuts. Lee’s great. 

           Paul stares nervously at the smoking pile. Eric lights a 
           cigarette and hands Paul one, distracting him.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Here.

                                 PAUL 
                        She wants kids. I can’t do it man. They 
                        scare me.

                                 ERIC 
                        That. Is intensely sad.

           Paul looks again to the pathetic grill.

                                 PAUL
                        Eric. You live in New Jersey in a house 
                        that smells like lunchmeat and feces. 
                        Three screaming, eating, pissing machines 
                        running amok. That’s intensely sad.

                                 ERIC
                        No bro. It’s the greatest.

           Paul pauses, then looks thoughtfully to his brother.

                                 PAUL
                        I was at the doctor last week.

                                 ERIC
                        Oh yeah?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. There was a little lump on my 
                        bicep, so I went and had it checked out.

           Eric blows out some smoke. 

                                 ERIC
                        No shit.

                                 PAUL
                        The doctor said it was an adnexal 
                        carcinoma.

                                 ERIC
                                 PAUL
                        I’m gonna tell you dummy. He did this 
                        sentinal node excision, took it out, you 
                        know. I gotta go in Tuesday and get the 
                        results.

                                 ERIC
                        Is it bad, or what?

                                 PAUL
                        Probably not. But there is a small chance 
                        it might have spread to my lymph nodes.

                                 ERIC
                        Jesus. Does Lee know?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. She’s not taking it too well.

                                 ERIC
                        I’ll bet.

           Eric now throws his cigarette into the pile of leaves.

           Paul looks again to it. A plume of smoke rising.

                                 PAUL 
                        And you wanna know the funny thing? When 
                        the doctor told me, I wasn’t worried I 
                        was going to die. At that moment, I had 
                        only one thought in my head: “I may have 
                        a malignant tumor, but at least now I 
                        don’t have to have a kid.”

           Eric stares at Paul.

                                 ERIC
                        You’re demented and need serious help.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m demented? Eric, you have no eyebrows. 
                        Oh, and Blind Melon called, they want 
                        their facial hair back.

           Eric takes a deep breath.

                                 ERIC
                        You always knew how to hurt me bro.

                                 PAUL
                        Eric, I’m not trying to hurt you, I’m 
                        trying to help you. Stop killing 
                        yourself. Run. As fast as you can.

                                 ERIC
                        You’re projecting again. Kids are great, 

                                 (MORE)
                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        I think it’s just what you need to get 
                        out of this Selfish bullshit mode you’re 
                        in.

                                 PAUL
                        Jesus. I don’t even know if I like being 
                        married.

                                 ERIC
                        Problems at home?

                                 PAUL
                        Not really. I guess. You know...

                                 ERIC
                        Well, hey, look man, It’s never storybook 
                        and all that jazz. But you make it work. 
                        Just look at mom and dad. Forty years. 
                        And it’s not like they didn’t have bumps 
                        in the road.

           Paul looks at Eric and furrows his brows.

                                 PAUL
                        Eric. Dad cheated on mom with five 
                        hundred and seventy-one different women.

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah. But he never told her about them. 
                        He saved her from that hurt.

                                 PAUL
                        Are you fucking retarded? He wrote every 
                        single one down in a book that she found 
                        after he died. It broke her heart. It 
                        killed her.

                                 ERIC
                        You know man, I can’t get with you when 
                        you’re all negative like this.

           Paul stares dumbly.

                                 PAUL
                        What are you? Suffering from septic kid 
                        shock? You know what, just run, 
                        seriously. I’ll cover for you until you 
                        get a few miles away.

           He looks again at smoke teeming above the pile of leaves, 
           then back to Eric, who has an expression of almost 
           laughable sincerity on his face.

                                 ERIC 
                        One day you’re going to understand. 
                        There’s love here. And that’s all that 
                        matters.
           They stare at each other in silence for a moment. Then 
           Eric rips a huge fart. Paul sadly nods.

           EXT./INT. PAUL’S MAZDA - NIGHT

           On the street outside Eric’s house, Lee and Paul sit in 
           silence in the Mazda. Piles of dead leaves surround the 
           row of old Victorians with vinyl siding, one right after 
           another, which line the street. It is beginning to rain.

                                 LEE
                        Where are you?

           Paul stares into the rearview mirror. He looks completely 
           worn out. He looks up to the sky, now completely black.

                                 PAUL
                        Huh?

                                 LEE
                        You’re so far away.

                                 PAUL
                        No. I’m just....

                                 LEE
                        I thought we were going to tell them. 
                        About the lump.

                                 PAUL
                        No.

                                 LEE 
                        I want to talk about it.

                                 PAUL
                        I thought you wanted to talk about ham.

                                 LEE
                        You know that food is my ‘go-to’ subject 
                        when I’m avoiding something painful!

           They smile at one another.

                                 PAUL
                        Just promise me we’ll never end up like 
                        that.

                                 LEE
                        How?

                                 PAUL
                        Oblong and washed-out in New Jersey.

           They both laugh. Then Lee looks sincerely to Paul.
                                 LEE
                        It’s not all that bad, is it?

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        Here we go. Doesn’t she realize that 
                        after thirty-five there’s a good chance 
                        the kid turns out a retard?

           Lee suddenly looks very serious.

                                 LEE 
                        Let’s talk about...the thing.

                                 PAUL 
                        No. I get the results Tuesday. I don’t 
                        want to make a big deal out of it.

           Lee pouts.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I mean, what can I do? All I can do is 
                        wait. 

           Lee holds Paul’s hand tightly.

                                 LEE
                        I know you’re going to be okay.

                                 PAUL
                        Thanks.

                                 LEE
                        And once you’re okay. I want to get 
                        pregnant. 

           Paul looks out the window and swallows.

                                 PAUL 
                        I guess we’ll just have to wait until 
                        Tuesday.

           Lee looks forlorn. Paul stares out at the darkened sky. 
           Blue clouds hovering against the black, starless night.

           EXT. ERIC’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Eric runs through his backyard, head aflame. An incessant 
           beeping runs underneath.

           INT. PAUL AND LEE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Early morning. Paul awakens to find his digital alarm 
           clock beeping and reading six a.m. He shuts it off.
           He looks to Lee who snores and lays in a pile of her own 
           drool, a novel with the ‘Oprah’s Book Club’ gold 
           medallion shining on its’ cover open across her chest.

           INT. SHOWER - DAY

           Paul, depressed, washes himself.

           INT. PATH TRAIN - MOVING - DAY

           Paul rides a PATH train and stares blankly into space. He 
           looks out the window into the sky: slate grey, bilious 
           clouds looming overhead. 

           EXT. MONARCH HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY - DAY

           Paul walks across a long blacktop parking lot towards a 
           building in a large office park. The sign reads: MONARCH 
           HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY.

           INT. MONARCH HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY - DAY

           Paul walks through aisle upon aisle of cubicles in an 
           undistinguished office with off-white walls and brown 
           carpet.

           He sits at his desk and boots up his computer. 

           With a kind of wistfulness, Paul looks at the screen 
           saver: a Norman Rockwell-lite painting of a farmhouse in 
           winter, the lights on, the sun just setting, a child 
           walking back home. 

           Suddenly, a clattering like castanets can be heard.

           Lisa Hunt, a dumpy and overweight young woman in ill-
           fitting clothes carrying fistfuls of pill bottles in each 
           hand lumbers towards him. He looks resigned.

           Lisa smiles at Paul as she approaches. Paul clicks open 
           some spreadsheets on his computer.

                                 LISA
                        HEY!

                                 PAUL 
                        Hey, let’s jump back into this.

           Lisa sits opposite Paul, her ponderous weight causing the 
           shocks on the swivel chair to take tremendous pressure.

           Paul sniffs the air.
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        What’s that smell?

                                 LISA
                        Uck! I left this sweater in the washer 
                        overnight. It’s a little mildewy.

           Paul just stares.

                                 LISA (CONT'D)
                        Okay. So what’s this again?

           He looks closely at Lisa’s adult acne, then back to his 
           pages.

                                 PAUL
                        Well, it’s just the layout of the data 
                        flow operations group.

           She breathes heavily from her mouth.

                                 LISA
                        Wait. What?

                                 PAUL 
                        Um, DFOG.

           Paul looks on helplessly as Lisa lines her pill bottles 
           along his desk. The bottles read: “For the treatment of 
           Diabetes.”

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        That’s the anagram anyway.

           Lisa looks amorously into Paul’s eyes. He looks to some 
           papers on his desk and begins explaining to her.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Listen to me. ‘Anagram.’ I mean 
                        ‘Acronym.’

           He chuckles.

           Paul shows Lisa some papers. She just giggles and 
           playfully shoves him. It’s forceful though and he nearly 
           falls out of his chair.

                                 LISA
                        You’re hilarious!

           Paul half-smiles, barely masking his disdain.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) 
                        Not nearly as hilarious as the eighteen 
                        cupcakes you shoved into your craw this 
                        morning.
           Lisa clicks a pen.

                                 LISA
                        So DFOG stands for what now?

           Paul stares at Lisa and imagines:

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Lisa crosses the street. Paul zooms by in his Mazda and 
           WHAM! Runs right into her. She rolls up on the hood and 
           shatters the windshield, her fat face pressed up against 
           the glass.

           INT. MONARCH HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY - DAY

           Paul smiles a demonic grin as Lisa shovels pills into her 
           mouth.

           INT. PATH TRAIN - NIGHT

           Paul sadly rides the PATH train home in the dark.

           INT. PORT AUTHORITY - NIGHT

           Paul walks through a crowded Port Authority to a subway 
           train.

           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT

           Paul stands on a crowded subway train and thinks.

           EXT. PAUL AND LEE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Paul puts a key in the front door of his apartment 
           building.

           INT. PAUL AND LEE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Paul enters the apartment and approaches the bathroom, 
           hearing water running.

           He discovers Lee curling her eyelashes while she pees on 
           the toilet with the door open.

                                 LEE
                        Don’t forget. Dinner with the Browns.
                                 PAUL
                        Aw hon. I got a butt load of work I gotta 
                        get done tonight.

                                 LEE
                        You said a week ago you’d go! Now why 
                        don’t you be a nice guy for once and do 
                        what you say you’re gonna do!

           She slams the door in his face. Paul leans against it.

                                 PAUL (TO HIMSELF)
                        Whatever.

           The last dribble of Lee’s urine can be heard. Paul 
           shudders. The sound becomes...

           INT. BROWN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A bottle of white wine being poured into a glass. Pull 
           back to reveal: Paul and Lee have dinner with Brenda and 
           Felipe Brown. Brenda is a cute, pixie-like woman and 
           Felipe is a rather staid conservative type with wire-
           framed glasses and a strong chin. Brenda and Lee speak 
           animatedly. A small girl, Justine, sits in a corner 
           coloring.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        If Lee had her way, we’d join the ranks 
                        of the Browns and other couples who move 
                        to Park Slope to mate, breed and die.

           Brenda takes off her watch and displays it for everyone.

                                 BRENDA
                        I mean, if you found this watch laying in 
                        the woods, you wouldn’t say “Wow, look at 
                        this thing that just happened here in 
                        nature!” No. You’d say, “wow look what 
                        someone created.” Well there’s no 
                        difference between this watch and a tree. 
                        It had to have been created. And created 
                        intelligently. 

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        Domesticity has turned Brenda into some 
                        kind of fucked-up born-again. She’s 
                        literally bored herself into religion. 
                        Not that she hasn’t had an assist from 
                        old Felipe.

           Felipe pipes up rather stiffly.
                                 FELIPE
                        You know if I subscribe one more investor 
                        to a security issuance this week, I’ll 
                        just about burst!

           The conversation stops dead. Brenda stares, Lee smiles. 
           Paul picks at his food. Felipe goes back to eating.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        Way to pick it up, snazzy. Bore your hot 
                        little wife right into the arms of The 
                        Lord. What a waste.

                                 BRENDA
                        Well, all that is well and good. It puts 
                        a roof over our head. But if you don’t 
                        turn your life over to Jesus, literally 
                        what is the point?

           Paul and Lee share a “Ugh!” look. Paul looks back at 
           Brenda.

                                 PAUL (V.O.). 
                        I’d like to fuck the god right out of 
                        her.

                                 LEE
                        Oh! You know who we love is Paula Deen, 
                        on The Food Network?

           Paul’s eyes glaze over.

                                 BRENDA
                        OH MY GOODNESS I LOVE HER!

           Felipe shushes Brenda.

                                 FELIPE
                        Honey. Justine is having quiet time.

           Brenda embarrassingly puts her hand over her mouth. 

           Lee gets up and sits down on the floor with Justine, 
           rubbing her hair.

                                 LEE
                        She had a special Pannini sandwich on her 
                        show the other day that was, you know, 
                        Cibatta bread and you slice it and you 
                        put white truffle butter on each side, 
                        and then you stuff it with Mozzarella, 
                        Proscuitto di Parma, Sopressata, the 
                        Calabrese kind, lettuce. Uh, Radicchio, 
                        balsamic vinegar, basil, olive oil and 
                        you take it...
           As Lee goes on and on, her voice goes silent. The camera 
           moves in on her as she drones on about the recipe, 
           running her fingers through the head of the small child, 
           staring at Paul and giving him a sly wink.

           Paul stares hopeless.

           INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Paul sits in a crowded waiting room in his doctor’s 
           office. The room is filled with sick-looking people 
           except for two: Paul, and an extremely attractive, 
           statuesque and exotic woman, Alex Hivinshki. She is olive-
           skinned, brunette, well-attired and reads a copy of Paris 
           Vogue. Paul looks her up and down. She is way out of his 
           league.

           He looks to the wall: a poster of a well-built African 
           American athlete, Demetrius Davenport. The poster reads: 
           HELP PUT THE SMACK-DOWN ON CANCER. He is in a Minnesota 
           Vikings uniform, holding a football aloft in one hand and 
           pointing his finger straight out at Paul, who snickers. 
           This gets the attention of Alex, who looks up at Paul 
           from her magazine.

                                 PAUL
                        Just what we need, right? Medical advice 
                        from some date rapist.

                                 ALEX
                        Excuse me?

                                 PAUL
                        This guy. Davenport. He wants you to know 
                        how concerned he is about cancer. 
                        Meanwhile he’s giving roofies to underage 
                        girls on party boats.

           She gives him a glare, completely creeped out. Her eyes 
           drift back to the magazine. Paul is red-faced.

           A nurse appears.

                                 NURSE
                        Alex Hivinshki?

           Alex stands and disappears into the office. He turns and 
           sees the entire waiting room staring at him.

                                 PAUL 
                        What? 

           The nurse emerges again.
                                 NURSE
                        Mister Mauro?

           Paul turns sharply to her, expecting another accusatory 
           stare.

                                 PAUL
                        What?

                                 NURSE
                        You can come on back.

           INT. EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

           Paul looks around at the cold, clinical details in the 
           examining room: the silver metal counter tops, the 
           antiseptic wipes, the blood-pressure cuff. He suddenly 
           hears the voice of Doctor Tolson through the thin walls 
           in the room next door.

                                 DR. TOLSON (O.S.)
                        How are we doing today Alex?

           There is a pause. The voices become quieter, more 
           muffled. Paul listens closer. He hears only parts of 
           things.

                                 ALEX (O.S.)
                        How serious is it?

           Doctor Tolson is quieter. Paul struggles to put his ear 
           next to the wall, but trips on a scale and knocks some 
           containers over. As he bends down, picking up cotton 
           swabs and tongue depressors, he hears Alex weeping rather 
           loudly. He freezes and sits back down.

                                 DR. TOLSON (O.S.)
                        I’m afraid there’s nothing more we can 
                        do. I’m sorry.

           Paul hears Doctor Tolson rather clearly as he opens the 
           door to leave, turning back to say one last thing to her.

                                 DR. TOLSON (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Alex, we’re going to make this as 
                        comfortable for you as possible.

                                 ALEX (O.S.)
                        Okay. Thanks.

           He hears the doctor close the door and almost immediately 
           he opens Paul’s door, startling him.

                                 DR. TOLSON
                        Hello Paul.
           He pumps Paul’s hand in a shake. He throws his clipboard 
           to the silver counter top where it lands with a metallic 
           thud. Paul stares at the clipboard. Time stands still. He 
           turns towards the doctor.

                                 DR. TOLSON (CONT'D)
                        Paul... You passed the test.

           Paul almost looks disappointed, confused.

                                 PAUL
                        No spread?

                                 DR. TOLSON
                        The sentinel node came back negative. 
                        You’re A-Okay.

                                 PAUL
                        Are you sure?

                                 DR. TOLSON
                        Go on. Get out of here. Just schedule a 
                        chest X-ray and a follow-up appointment. 
                        I’ll see you in six months.

           Dr. Tolson is smiling broadly. Paul is not.

                                 PAUL
                        But there’s a five percent chance the 
                        test missed something. You said that at 
                        the beginning.

           Dr. Tolson’s smile fades.

                                 DR. TOLSON
                        Paul, the test came back negative for 
                        spread. Do you want cancer?

           Paul seriously contemplates this question.

           INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY

           Paul walks down the hallway towards the elevator, 
           deflated.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        So this is it: Welcome to the rest of 
                        your life. It won’t be today good sir, 
                        but someday, you’ll wake up one morning, 
                        eighteen years gone, and realize your 
                        life is over. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        You’ll take your ragged-looking wife on a 
                        short cruise, gamble the last of your 
                        savings away, get a black belt in 
                        silence, and drive fourteen hours to 
                        Utica to visit your spawn on 
                        Thanksgiving, pass on the coffee, and 
                        plow into an oak tree on the way home. 
                        Awesome.

           EXT. ERIC’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Eric runs through the backyard, his head aflame.

           INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY

           Paul continues to walk in disappointment, his shoulders 
           sinking by the second.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Paul walks distractedly into a waiting elevator. He hears 
           a voice from behind him:

                                 ALEX (O.S.)
                        Hi.

           Paul is startled to see Alex.

                                 ALEX (CONT'D)
                        You okay?

                                 PAUL
                        Me? I’m great.

           He stares at her up and down. She’s gorgeous. He 
           accidentally presses the garage button on the elevator.

                                 ALEX
                        You’re shell shocked too. 

           Paul presses several more buttons before he gets the 
           right one. Then he just blurts out:

                                 PAUL
                        This blows.

           Alex just stares at him. Silence. Then the PING of the 
           elevator and the door opens.

           Alex grasps Paul’s hand, smiling warmly, pulling him 
           along.

                                 ALEX
                        You’re coming with me.
           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           They walk out onto a busy Manhattan street. Alex whistles 
           for a cab. 

           Paul looks around to see if anyone is catching this.

           A cab pulls up and Alex pulls him in.

           INT. TAXI - DAY

           Alex speaks to the driver:

                                 ALEX
                        23rd and Lex.

           As the driver pulls into traffic, Alex puts her hands all 
           over Paul and begins fondling him. She kisses his ears, 
           his neck. Paul is aroused but a bit hesitant and Alex 
           picks up on this.

                                 ALEX (CONT'D)
                        I’ve never done this before.

                                 PAUL
                        Me neither.

           He looks her in the eyes. She is in a state of high 
           arousal.

                                 ALEX
                        There’s got to be some upside to dying.

           She smiles. He smiles back. They attack each other.

           INT. ALEX’S APARTMENT - DAY

           A photograph of a smiling Alex and her husband on their 
           wedding day vibrates until being kicked down by Alex’s 
           bare foot, accompanied by grunts and moans. Paul and 
           Alex, completely naked, hump on a king-sized bed. The 
           room is filled with expensive furniture. 

           INT. ALEX’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Later: Paul sweatily does Alex from behind. He notices a 
           pamphlet, LIVING WITH BREAST CANCER, on a table. He 
           adjusts his eye line, looking over to a grand piano. Atop 
           the piano is a photograph of Alex and her husband on some 
           Caribbean island.
           INT. ALEX’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Post-coital. Paul sits up in bed. Alex stands naked on a 
           balcony in the late morning sun, smoking a cigarette. 

                                 PAUL
                        Shouldn’t you put a robe on or something?

                                 ALEX
                        Who cares? 

           Alex looks back at Paul and smiles a sad, crooked grin. 
           Her naked, sweaty body glistening golden in the sun.

           Paul hops up and stands naked near the piano. He picks up 
           the photo and examines it. There’s Alex and her husband. 
           But he is also drawn in by the deep blue skies and white 
           sandy beaches. Alex walks up behind him.

                                 ALEX (CONT'D)
                        Cinnamon Beach. Caneel Bay. St. John. We 
                        went there on our honeymoon.

                                 PAUL
                        It’s beautiful.

           Alex slaps Paul on the ass and goes into the bathroom.

           INT. WALK-IN CLOSET - DAY

           Now wearing a robe, a thin, post-coital patina of sweat 
           on his brow, Paul explores a deep walk-in closet.

           Hundreds of pairs of men’s shoes: Fine-grained, all 
           custom-made. Fitted shirts draped in dry-cleaner bags. 
           Rows of cuff links and assorted jewelry totalling in the 
           millions. In the corner, a bag of expensive golf clubs. 

           Paul touches the smooth fabric of the shirts, admiring 
           things he’s never had.

           Alex stands in the archway of the closet, looking at him. 

                                 ALEX
                        Let’s go shopping.

                                 PAUL
                        What? Why?

                                 ALEX
                        It’s time to squeeze a life of luxury 
                        into every living day.
                                 PAUL
                        Cool.

           INT. BARNEY’S - DAY

           Alex leads Paul by the hand through the luxurious New 
           York department store.

           She buys him an expensive buffalo hide biker jacket. He 
           puts it on and feels like a new man. 

           A salesman fits Paul with a thousand dollar pair of shiny 
           black boots. Alex is sitting at his side.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Why don’t you try walking around?

           Paul stands and struts. He checks himself in a full-
           length mirror. He likes what he sees but focuses on his 
           hair. He tries to pull his bangs forward. Unsatisfied.

                                 ALEX
                        What do you think?

           He turns towards her with rumpled brow. She looks at his 
           hairline.

                                 ALEX (CONT'D)
                        Oh yeah. I’ll call Rex.

           INT. BARNEY’S - DAY

           Paul and Alex walk through the store. He is grinning in 
           his fancy new duds. She begins to seem absent.

                                 PAUL
                        Everything OK?

           Alex just nods. She sees a fur coat and moves towards it. 
           Paul looks over and sees an area of changing rooms.

                                 ALEX 
                        Hey. How about it?

           Paul looks at Alex in white sable. She wears a sarcastic 
           grin as she models for him. He gives her the thumbs up, 
           then smiles big.

                                 ALEX (CONT'D)
                        What?
           INT. CHANGING ROOM - DAY

           Paul fucks Alex hard inside a small dressing room in 
           Barney’s. She wears the fur coat.

           INT. HAIR SALON - DUSK

           Rex, Alex’s hairdresser, gives Paul a haircut. He turns 
           him towards a mirror. Paul grins broadly. He looks 
           younger, more stylish, richer. He turns to show Alex, who 
           wears her new fur coat but stares sadly out the window. 
           His grin fades. He looks up to Rex and nods.

           INT. HAIR SALON - DUSK

           Alex distractedly signs the credit card slip and walks 
           out the door. Paul grabs her card and follows.

           EXT. HAIR SALON - DUSK

           Paul chases Alex down the street, eventually catching up 
           with her. He holds the card out.

                                 ALEX
                        Let’s take a walk in the park.

           She walks right into traffic. Cars screech to a halt and 
           honk at her as she darts into Central Park. Paul follows, 
           holding the American Express card in his hand.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DUSK

           It’s getting dark. Paul feels a chill but Alex is 
           oblivious. He tries to grab her hand but she pulls away 
           and sits on a bench. He sits next to her.

           She stares at a curtain of algae on the surface of the 
           pond. Paul sees the sky reflected in it, stars beginning 
           to appear. He admires his new clothes.

                                 ALEX
                        Isn’t it incredible?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. Thank you. I’ve never worn real 
                        buffalo hide before. It’s amazing.

                                 ALEX
                        No. The fact that we’re not going to be 
                        here anymore. That this is all going to 
                        go on without us.
                                 PAUL
                        I don’t know about you but I plan on 
                        coming back as a grasshopper.

                                 ALEX
                        No. This is it. We’re both as good as 
                        dead.

                                 PAUL 
                        How about a little levity? This is some 
                        depressing shit.

           Alex is oblivious to Paul’s insensitivity.

                                 ALEX
                        You know the funny thing? Last week I 
                        thought I was the center of the universe. 
                        And then suddenly the world’s not even 
                        paying attention.

           Alex looks at her fur coat, her jewelry. She gets a burst 
           of energy.

                                 ALEX (CONT'D)
                        I don’t want to sleep tonight. I don’t 
                        want to waste any more time. I’ve got to 
                        figure out what to do with the rest of my 
                        life. We could still do something 
                        amazing.

                                 PAUL
                        What? Like learn to hang-glide or 
                        something?

           Alex squeezes Paul’s wrist really tight, digging her 
           nails into his skin.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Jesus! You’re hurting me!

                                 ALEX
                        We could become human bombs or something. 
                        Blow up Cheney!

           Paul gets a nervous look on his face and looks around to 
           see if anyone has heard. Alex, frustrated, releases her 
           grip and walks off.

                                 PAUL 
                        Hey! Your credit card!

           She just keeps walking. Paul looks after her in a daze, 
           holding the card in his hand.

           His eyes widen in realization. He pulls a cell phone out 
           and dials.
                                 PAUL (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        Hi.

           Lee’s voice can be heard on the other end.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        I’ve been trying to call you babe. I’ve 
                        left fifteen messages.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        I had to take a walk. I couldn’t go back 
                        to work. I had to think.

           There is silence on the other end. Then Lee begins to 
           weep.

           Paul says nothing. He looks torn. She begins to weep.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        It’s okay. We’ll get through this. It’s 
                        just... It’s spread to my lymph nodes.   
                        Doctor Tolson is giving me a... 
                        five...percent...chance of survival. 

           Paul thinks: “Is that the right number?”

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        Wait... yeah. Five.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        I understand.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        This changes everything.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Yeah. I understand. I love you.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        I’ll be right home.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Come right home. Don’t do something 
                        stupid.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        Okay.

           He hangs up, putting the phone back in his pocket. He 
           realizes his fly is open and zips it up. He takes a deep 
           breath and smiles, walking boldly down the sidewalk.
           INT. PAUL AND LEE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Paul throws open the door. Lee is standing there, all 
           cried out. She stares at him framed in the doorway in his 
           leather coat and boots. He looks a foot taller.

                                 PAUL
                        I went shopping.

           She’s stunned speechless.

           INT. PAUL AND LEE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Later. Paul and Lee sit at the dinner table, halfway 
           through a meal. Lee weeps. Paul stares guiltily at her 
           for a second, then goes back to finishing his pork chop. 

                                 LEE
                        How can you go on eating?

                                 PAUL
                        Well, I’m not dead yet.

           The phone rings. He goes to pick it up.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        Hello?

           Screaming children can be heard and soon Eric’s drunken 
           voice.

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        Hey bro, Lee called me. I love you. I 
                        just--- SHUT UP! I’M ON THE PHONE!

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE) 
                        Hey Eric.

           INT. ERIC’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           *Intercut with Paul and Lee’s apartment.

           The children are running rampant. Terry is changing the 
           diaper on the baby. Eric is drinking.

                                 ERIC
                        You wanna watch these kids or what?

           One of Eric’s kids starts screaming bloody murder.

                                 TERRY
                        Why don’t you clean the shit out of this 
                        one’s diapers for once?!
                                 ERIC
                        I’m on the phone with my brother! He has 
                        cancer!

                                 TERRY
                        You’re drunk! And you’re using this as an 
                        excuse.

           Paul is holding the phone away from his ear.

                                 PAUL
                        Eric, why don’t I call you back later?

           He hangs up the phone.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        What’s for dessert?

           Lee looks at him in astonishment.

           EXT. ERIC’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Eric runs through his backyard, head aflame. This time, 
           however, he douses his head in a thick bank of snow atop 
           his rusted grill. Hisssssssss.... The flame goes out. He 
           lifts his head from the grill, revealing it to be the 
           smiling face of Paul.

           INT. PAUL AND LEE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Paul awakens from deep sleep. He smiles.

           INT. PATH TRAIN - DAY

           Paul rides the train to work with his slick haircut and 
           new duds. He beams brightly, as does the sun. Not a cloud 
           in the sky.

           EXT. MONARCH HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY - DAY

           He walks across the parking lot and into the office 
           building, his head held high, his stride broad and 
           confident.

           INT. MONARCH HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY - DAY

           He struts to his desk, boots up his computer. He stares 
           at the young boy running towards the farm house.
                                 PAUL (TO THE SCREEN)
                        Run home you little pussy. I’m heading in 
                        the other direction.

           Paul hears the clattering of pill bottles and looks up to 
           see Lisa Hunt hovering.

           She lines her pill bottles along his desk and sits on the 
           swivel chair, audibly challenging its’ hydraulics.

           Paul stares at her with a wry grin. He turns to his 
           computer and clicks on some spreadsheets.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Sorry I missed yesterday.

                                 LISA
                        Yeah, where were you anyway?

                                 PAUL
                        I had an appointment.

                                 LISA
                        Um, RUDE!

           She barks a sarcastic laugh. Paul winces.

                                 PAUL
                        All right, well let’s just look at these 
                        spreadsheets we were working on.

                                 LISA
                        Hold on Speedy Gonzales! 

           Lisa sluggishly opens each pill bottle and removes a 
           pill, swallowing each one and taking a gulp of Diet Coke. 
           The tension is rising in the veins of Paul’s neck, his 
           face reddening with each slow, deliberate gulp.

                                 PAUL
                        SO! Here we are...

           He nudges his face towards the computer screen.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Your customer has called in and asked you 
                        about POS for DFOG. What do you enter?

           Lisa places her meaty hand on Paul’s leg.

                                 LISA
                        Something’s different about you. 

                                 PAUL
                        I got a haircut.
                                 LISA
                        No, not that. You’re assertive. I like 
                        it!

           He tries to edge his way out of her grasp.

                                 PAUL 
                        What do you enter?

           He points to the screen, about to burst.

                                 LISA
                        Oh my god! So serious! Okay. Let me 
                        concentrate. DFOG. I already forgot what 
                        that stands for.

                                 PAUL
                        I’VE BEEN TALKING TO YOU ABOUT IT FOR SIX 
                        MONTHS!

           People in the office look over. Paul lowers his voice.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I mean really, come on now. 

                                 LISA 
                        What line are we on?

           Lisa rolls her chair closer to Paul and rubs her kneecap 
           against his. He stands up and stares at her.

                                 PAUL
                        Okay. We’re done here.

                                 LISA
                        What?

                                 PAUL
                        You know when training’s over, so’s your 
                        time with me. So you conveniently forget 
                        everything as soon as I tell you. 

           People are really paying attention now. Paul’s boss has 
           come out of his office and is watching. Lisa looks hurt. 
           Paul sits.

                                 LISA
                        Okay sit down please. Look, I didn’t 
                        mean...

           She puts her hand on his leg again.

                                 PAUL
                        Take your goddamn hand off my leg.

           She does.
                                 LISA
                        You could’ve just moved it off. You 
                        didn’t have to get nasty.

                                 PAUL
                        Even if I had wanted to, I couldn’t get 
                        my fingers around it. It’s like a loaf of 
                        sourdough.

           Tears start to well up in Lisa’s eyes.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Let me ask you something...

           He leans in close to her, almost whispering:

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Did you really think I was going to fuck 
                        you?

           The entire office goes silent. Greg Boyden, Paul’s boss, 
           speaks up.

                                 GREG
                        Mauro. Why don’t you come in here a sec.

           Paul stares at Lisa and walks towards Greg’s office.

           INT. GREG’S OFFICE - DAY

           Paul sits opposite Greg in his office. Greg is a frat-boy 
           type with fluorescent white teeth. Paul looks penitent. 

                                 GREG
                        No wonder you flipped on Lisa. Dude!

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        Jesus this guy is a douchebag.

           Greg’s head explodes, like that guy in ‘Scanners.’ Then 
           Greg’s head is back to normal, Paul shakes it off.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Yeah. It’s a terrible thing this... 
                        canc... Jesus!

                                 GREG
                        Take it easy dude. You gonna be all 
                        right?

                                 PAUL
                        I don’t know. It metasta. It meta-sta-tas-
                        sta-sized.

                                 GREG
                                 PAUL
                        It like spread to other parts of my body 
                        like my bones and stuff. Whatever.

                                 GREG
                        Dude. I am so sorry. I’ll tell Tim. You 
                        should take some time off.

                                 PAUL
                        Aw man, no. I feel like I’m bailing on 
                        you guys. The whole training deal...

                                 GREG
                        We’ll dump her on Tommy, dude. No 
                        problemo. You gotta take care of your 
                        health. My uncle Roy got that shit in his 
                        testes. Dude lost a fuckin’ ball.

           Silence.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. Well.

           Greg shakes that off. Jumps up.

                                 GREG
                        We’ll handle it dude. Just go home.

           Paul smiles. 

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        If having serious cancer is this much 
                        fun, I’m never going to be healthy again.

           INT. PAUL AND LEE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Paul lays on his couch. Leaves are piling up outside on 
           the fire escape. ‘The Tyra Banks Show’ plays on TV. Paul 
           watches, bored, as he picks up his phone and dials.

                                 PAUL (INTO PHONE)
                        Alex. It’s Paul. Where are you? I’m 
                        getting worried. All that bomb talk. Call 
                        me?

           Suddenly a key in the lock. Paul hangs up quickly. Lee 
           enters. He smiles, surprised.

                                 LEE
                        I thought I’d take the rest of the day 
                        off, come hang out with you. Is that 
                        cool?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. Of course. Come here.
           She sits down next to him on the couch. He gives her a 
           kiss, then goes back to watching the TV. Lee looks to the 
           screen, then back at Paul.

                                 LEE
                        Is this a good time to talk?

                                 PAUL
                        I was just watching this Tyra Banks, and 
                        they were giving her shit for putting on 
                        weight and she was all like ‘SO WHAT?!’

           Lee turns the TV off. Paul looks at her.

                                 LEE
                        Why are you sitting here watching this 
                        crap?

                                 PAUL
                        That’s what we do. We distract ourselves. 
                        It’s in a pamphlet I gave you.

           Lee takes a deep breath. 

                                 LEE
                        I think it’s great you got a haircut 
                        Paul. And the leather jacket. And the 
                        boots. I mean, if I had cancer, I’d go on 
                        a spending spree too.

                                 PAUL
                        But?

                                 LEE
                        I feel like you’re starting to act weird.

                                 PAUL
                        This is about you getting pregnant, 
                        right?

                                 LEE
                        Can’t we talk about it?

           Paul leaps up and paces the apartment, trapped like a rat 
           in a cage.

                                 PAUL
                        NO! How can we? I’m not going to be 
                        around in five years. Possibly three!

                                 LEE
                        Stop shouting at me.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m not shouting Lee! I have cancer!
                                 LEE
                        Sometimes I think you just want to die.

           Paul takes a deep breath and slowly walks over to the 
           couch, taking a seat next to his weeping wife.

           He puts his arm around her and holds her close, kissing 
           her gently. Her crying dissipates. 

                                 LEE (CONT'D)
                        My mother wants us to go on vacation.
                        She wants to pay for it. 

                                 PAUL
                        That’s big of her.

                                 LEE
                        I could take a week off. I mean, the time 
                        between us is so precious now.

           Paul runs his fingers through her hair. He looks out the 
           window and thinks.

                                 PAUL
                        I think...I should go by myself.

           Lee pulls away and stares at him strangely.

                                 LEE
                        What?

           Paul stands again, gesticulating with his hands. Laying 
           it on thick.

                                 PAUL
                        This might be the last time I really get 
                        to figure out who I am... really get to 
                        the bottom of me. 

           A silence.

                                 LEE
                        All right. Like a retreat or something?

                                 PAUL
                        Sure.

           He sits back down and turns on the TV. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        There’s a killer beach called Cinnamon 
                        Bay on St. John. 

           Paul notices Lee looking at him suspiciously.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
           She keeps eyeing him. He grabs his shoulder and winces.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Jesus Christ!

                                 LEE
                        What?

                                 PAUL
                        Sharp pain. Terrible pain.

                                 LEE
                        I’ll get one of my Vicodins.

           Lee gets up and runs into the bathroom. 

                                 LEE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I’ll call my mother today. It’s a good 
                        idea. You deserve it, Paul. You’ve been 
                        really incredible.

           The camera moves in on Paul’s satisfied face.

                                 LEE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Don’t forget. Dinner with the Browns 
                        tonight.

           Paul’s smile drops.

           INT. BROWN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           As Paul and Lee enter, Brenda gives Paul a long, sincere 
           look. 

                                 BRENDA
                        So. How are you?

           There is a long silence as everyone stares at each other. 
           Lee looks at Paul, wide-eyed and smiling. Brenda bites 
           her lip.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m fine.

                                 BRENDA
                        Good. 

                                 LEE
                        We’re fine. We’re great.

           Brenda laughs an uncomfortable giggle. 

                                 BRENDA
                        Good. Oh good!
           Felipe uncorks a bottle. POP!

                                 FELIPE
                        We’re really sorry.

           Paul looks Brenda hard in the eye.

                                 PAUL
                        It’s actually been a blessing.

           Brenda’s eyes tear over. She massages Paul’s hand.

                                 BRENDA
                        That’s such a beautiful thought. So long 
                        as you understand that it is God’s 
                        providence. You can’t buy your way into 
                        heaven Paul. You must do it by his grace.

                                 PAUL
                        You know, when you put it that way, it 
                        really throws everything into a whole new 
                        light.

           Brenda’s eyes widen more.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Born-agains just can’t deal with that 
                        word, light. It’s like Christian Heroin.

           Brenda grasps Paul’s hand tighter, bringing him to the 
           table.

                                 BRENDA (WHISPERING)
                        I want to hear more.

           Lee notices the flirtation and is perturbed but follows.

           INT. BROWN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Felipe and Lee eat slowly, quietly. Paul shovels 
           blackened Tilapia into his craw like there’s no tomorrow. 
           Brenda stares fascinated by him

                                 PAUL
                        This is great Brenda. What did you do to 
                        it?

                                 BRENDA
                        You squirt some juice on it. Let it soak 
                        in.

           She smiles at him, he smiles back. Lee rolls her eyes. 
           Felipe gets up and goes over to his daughter.
                                 BRENDA (CONT'D)
                        This must be so hard. Sitting here and 
                        listening to the same old conversation. 
                        I’d be crazy.

           Paul puts his fork down, locks eyes with Brenda and with 
           a mouthful of food says:

                                 PAUL
                        When the time comes... I’m sure you’ll do 
                        just fine.

           Paul stares intensely into Brenda’s eyes. She blushes.

           INT. BROWN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Paul’s bare ass plunges into a naked Brenda Brown, her 
           legs sprawled upwards and outwards.

                                 BRENDA
                        Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus!

           The camera pans over to show the baby Justine asleep in a 
           crib in the same room, a metal crucifix on a wall.

           EXT. BROWN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Paul leaves the apartment, kissing Brenda, smiling. 

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        If my father can get away with five 
                        hundred and seventy-one, why shouldn’t I 
                        get away with two? Three if I’m lucky.

           INT. PAUL AND LEE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Paul and Lee eat dinner in silence. 

                                 LEE
                        What did you do today?

                                 PAUL
                        Nothing.

           Lee continues to eat, then stops. Paul smiles.

                                 LEE 
                        Paul?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah?
                                 LEE
                        I’m almost afraid to ask you this.

                                 PAUL
                        Shoot.

                                 LEE
                        I don’t understand why you seem so happy.

           Knowing she’s got him on the spot and wanting to escape, 
           Paul stands up, feigning outrage.

                                 PAUL
                        Kubler-Ross! Stage one! Denial. Read the 
                        damn pamphlet Lee!

           Paul storms out of the apartment. Lee just sits 
           dumbfounded.

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Paul runs down the street, talking into his cell phone.

                                 PAUL (INTO PHONE)
                        Alex! I need to see you. I’m coming over 
                        right now!

           He continues running into the subway station.

           INT. ALEX’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Paul runs into the lobby of Alex’s apartment, where a 
           chubby, pock-marked young night watchman watches 
           ‘America’s Got Talent!’.

                                 PAUL
                        Hi. I’m here to see Alex Hivinshki.

           The watchman looks up at him.

                                 WATCHMAN
                        You a friend of hers?

                                 PAUL
                        No. I mean yes. 

                                 WATCHMAN
                        She’s dead.

                                 PAUL
                        What?
                                 WATCHMAN
                        Night before last. Jumped off the 
                        balcony. Landed on the sidewalk right out 
                        here in front. 

           Paul is stunned silent. The watchman takes a perverse 
           pleasure in describing the details.

                                 WATCHMAN (CONT'D)
                        You shoulda seen it. She broke on the 
                        pavement like a sack of wet fruit. I 
                        almost shit my pants. Thought it was 
                        another Arab attack for a second. Cops 
                        were cleaning brains off the glass all 
                        day yesterday. Fuckin’ crazy dude!

           He picks up a phone.

                                 WATCHMAN (CONT'D)
                        Her husband’s in. You wanna talk to him?

                                 PAUL
                        No no. That’s all right. Thanks.

           Paul slowly backs out the door.

           EXT. ALEX’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Paul walks out and looks at the sidewalk. He thinks he 
           sees some specks of blood. He crosses the street and 
           looks up at the balcony of Alex’s apartment. There is a 
           light on inside and the wind is blowing the yellow drapes 
           outward. The sky above is a thick purple.

           Paul retreats into the darkness. He walks at a quickened 
           pace, before breaking into an all-out run. The sound of 
           an airplane blasting off as he races away.

           EXT. AIRPORT PARKING - DAY

           Paul parks his car in airport parking and lugs a duffel 
           bag towards the shuttle. Planes taking off and landing 
           can be heard.

           INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

           Paul stands with his duffel riding the moving walkway at 
           JFK airport.
           INT. AIRPORT BATHROOM - DAY

           Paul washes his hands and looks into the mirror. He 
           removes his wedding ring and puts it in his pocket. He 
           looks at the tan line on his ring finger.

           INT. AIRPORT GIFT SHOP - DAY

           Paul grabs a bottle of liquid tanner off of a shelf. He 
           looks around to see if anyone is watching, then squirts a 
           little in his palm and rubs it over his finger.

           INT. AIRPORT BAR - DAY

           Paul throws his duffel on the ground and takes a stool at 
           the airport bar.

                                 BARMAID
                        What can I get you?

                                 PAUL
                        Scotch. Double.

           She pours. He sips. And then he hears the voice of a 
           small child behind him and that ‘sour’ look appears on 
           his face.

                                 JACK (O.S.)
                        I want to sit at the bar.

           Paul turns and sees two people: Barb, an attractive and 
           buxom blonde, wearing too much make-up, and Jack, her 
           eight year-old son, who wears a Minnesota Vikings hat 
           that is entirely too big for his tiny head.

           Jack rudely steps on Paul’s bag and hops up on the stool 
           next to him, staring him in the eye. Paul frowns at the 
           kid and takes a long sip, the ice clinking in his glass.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Are you an alcoholic?

                                 BARB
                        Jack! That’s not nice! Sorry.

           She squeezes his neck playfully, but he wrenches away 
           from her.

                                 JACK
                        Don’t embarrass me. I’m talking to this 
                        guy.

           Jack locks eyes with Paul.
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        I asked you a question.

           Paul stares. 

                                 PAUL
                        Nope. Just having my early morning 
                        scotch. A double.

           Jack smiles at this: kindred assholes? Paul turns away 
           and faces forward. The bartender runs over.

                                 BARMAID
                        You can’t sit at the bar. It’s for grown-
                        ups.

           Paul is looking at the barmaid’s face as it falls.

                                 BARMAID (CONT'D)
                        Oh. I’m sorry.

           Paul turns and looks at the kid, who has removed his hat. 
           He is completely bald from Leukemia.

                                 BARB
                        No reason to be sorry. We can move to 
                        that table over there.

                                 BARMAID
                        No. Just stay put. What do you want 
                        honey?

                                 JACK
                        A Coke on the rocks please.

           Jack grins shittily at Paul, who narrows his eyes. 
           Noticing the ample cleavage on Barb, sitting on the other 
           side of Jack, he decides to engage them in conversation. 
           He is staring directly at her breasts as he asks:

                                 PAUL
                        So, where are you two headed?

           His forced geniality strikes a strange tone. 

                                 JACK
                        Mom, can we move down another seat?

                                 BARB
                        Why?

           Jack whispers to her loudly enough for Paul to hear.

                                 JACK
                        Because. He’s really creepy!
                                 BARB 
                        He gets like this sometimes. He’s 
                        excited. We’re going to Minneapolis.

                                 PAUL
                        Wow. Minneapolis. That is exciting!

                                 JACK
                        It’s a special trip, dumbass!

                                 BARB
                        Jack! Stop it!

                                 JACK
                        Mom, he doesn’t get it. Let me explain, 
                        guy.

           Jack removes a glossy photo from his backpack. It is of 
           the football player whose poster was in Paul’s doctor’s 
           office. The photo is of him striking the same ridiculous 
           pose, extending the football heavenward. It reads: To J, 
           Hang in there tough guy, D.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        We’re going to meet Demetrius Davenport. 
                        The Wish-On-A-Star Foundation put it 
                        together. It’s going to be great.

                                 PAUL
                        That sounds great.

           Paul looks at Barb and smiles. She looks uncomfortable. 
           Paul extends his hand in front of Jack, knocking him back 
           a little.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I’m Paul.

           Barb shakes his hand. 

                                 BARB
                        Barb.

                                 JACK
                        Whoa! Watch your reach, Jackson! You 
                        almost knocked my ass over.

                                 BARB
                        Shut up Jack.

                                 PAUL
                        No, it’s okay.

                                 BARB
                        Where are you headed?
                                 PAUL
                        St. John.

           An uncomfortable silence. Barb seems weirded-out by Paul. 
           He looks at his watch.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Shit. Don’t wanna be late. You two have 
                        fun now. Good luck.

                                 BARB
                        Same to you.

           Paul picks up his duffel and as he’s exiting, behind 
           Barb’s head, gives the kid a dirty look.

           INT. AIRPORT GATE - DAY

           Paul looks over a glossy, colorful brochure for the 
           Caneel Bay Resort in St. John. It details The Self 
           Center, “Which helps guests realize their own desires 
           through a variety of body and mind approaches.” Suddenly 
           a voice comes over the loudspeaker.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, flight 444 to St. 
                        John has been cancelled due to a 
                        mechanical problem.

           Paul crumples up his brochure.

                                 PAUL
                        The fuck it has!

           He joins a crowd at the ticket desk, groaning and 
           mumbling.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        There’s another flight tomorrow at five 
                        forty five in the morning. I can put you 
                        on that if you like.

           The crowd is dispersing.

                                 PAUL
                        C’mon lady!

           Paul looks for support, but finds only an elderly couple.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        I’m sorry sir?

                                 PAUL
                        I am terminally ill! I do not have a day 
                        to waste.
                                 OLD MAN
                        My wife is too!

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        What?

                                 OLD MAN 
                        He just said he’s terminally ill. He 
                        doesn’t have time for this.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Good for you! What do you have?

                                 PAUL
                        Cancer.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        WHAT?

                                 PAUL
                        CANCER!

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Liver failure.

                                 PAUL
                        Right on.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        WHAT?

                                 OLD MAN
                        HE SAID ‘RIGHT ON!’

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        WHY?

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        I can put you on a flight to Minneapolis 
                        and you can connect there. 

                                 PAUL
                        Minneapolis?

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        I can upgrade you to first class.

                                 PAUL
                        It’s a thousand miles in the wrong 
                        direction!

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        I’m very sorry. It’s the best I can do 
                        sir.

           Paul looks as if he’s going to carry on with his tirade. 
                                 PAUL 
                        Okay, I’ll take it.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Paul and the elderly couple move onto an airplane, 
           sitting down across the aisle from one another. Then he 
           hears a familiar voice.

                                 JACK (O.S.)
                        Well well well...

           Paul turns to see he is seated next to Jack and Barb.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        If it isn’t the old boozehound.

                                 BARB
                        Oh. Hi.

                                 PAUL
                        Hello again. Change of plans, have to 
                        connect in Minneapolis.

                                 JACK
                        What, are you stalking us now?

                                 BARB
                        Jack, button it or I’m gonna smack you.

           Jack pouts.

                                 JACK
                        I want to change seats.

                                 BARB
                        Well, you can’t. The plane is starting to 
                        move.

                                 PAUL
                        Your mother’s right. You could fall over 
                        and kill yourself. We wouldn’t want that, 
                        would we?

           They give each other the stare: “I’m onto you buddy!”

           Paul pulls the brochure from his pocket and reads. Jack 
           looks over his shoulder.

                                 JACK
                        What’s a self Center?

                                 PAUL
                        It’s a place that grown-ups go to pamper 
                        themselves.
                                 JACK
                        Sounds gay. Are you a fag?

           Barb digs her fingers into Jack’s arm and he screams 
           bloody murder.

                                 BARB
                        Okay, okay, I’m sorry.

                                 PAUL
                        It’s okay.

                                 JACK
                        Yeah mom, don’t get your panties in a 
                        bunge. 

           Paul looks dreamily at the pamphlet.

           EXT. ST. JOHN’S BEACH - NIGHT

           Paul makes love to a beautiful blonde inside a hammock on 
           a white sandy beach. An army of island natives in white 
           robes practice Tai Chi around the hammock. Fireworks 
           explode in the night sky. Suddenly he is interrupted by 
           BEEP BOP BOOP!

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Jack is violently playing a Gameboy. Paul looks across 
           the aisle to the elderly couple. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        Good for you for speaking up. And I’m 
                        very sorry to hear about your cancer. 

                                 PAUL
                        Thank you.

           Paul looks back over at Jack. He is looking plaintively 
           up at him.

                                 JACK
                        You have cancer?

           Paul frowns.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Some time later. Paul has three empty airplane bottles of 
           scotch on his tray. Jack is going on and on about his 
           Leukemia. Paul looks like he’s going to kill himself.
                                 JACK
                        A lot of times I get a fever, chills, 
                        night sweats, the flu. Sometimes I feel 
                        real weak, and I don’t feel like eating 
                        so I lose a lot of weight.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah, well, mine has spread to my lymph 
                        nodes so ---

                                 JACK
                        My gums bleed when I brush my teeth, I 
                        get headaches a lot, bruises, you name 
                        it.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah...well.

                                 JACK
                        You still got your hair.

                                 PAUL
                        My cancer is different. You can’t treat 
                        it with Chemo.

                                 JACK
                        Must not be too serious if your hair 
                        hasn’t fallen out. My doctor doesn’t even 
                        know how I do it. He thinks I’m some kind 
                        of hero or something. 

                                 PAUL
                        I’ll probably die before you do, though.

           Jack gets a pained, frightened look on his face.

                                 JACK
                        What?!

           Barb leans over, upset.

                                 BARB
                        Excuse Me?!

                                 JACK
                        I’m not going to die stupid!

           Paul looks ashen.

                                 PAUL
                        I, uh, I meant, um.. Just, I’m a lot 
                        older than you. You’re just a kid.

           Jack gets snotty again.

                                 JACK
           Paul mouths ‘Sorry’ to Barb. She turns away towards the 
           window, frowning.

           INT. MINNEAPOLIS AIRPORT - DAY

           Paul exits the airplane just behind Barb and Jack.

                                 PAUL
                        Look. Sorry about that back there.

           Barb behaves a little more coldly towards Paul. 

                                 BARB
                        For someone who should be empathetic you 
                        sure aren’t real sensitive, are you?

           Paul doesn’t know what to say. Jack, sensing his mother’s 
           dislike of Paul, gets an impish smile on his face and 
           decides to goad her:

                                 JACK
                        Why don’t you come with us?

           Barb squirms at this idea.

                                 BARB
                        He can’t. He’s got to catch another 
                        flight, honey.

                                 PAUL
                        Five hours.

           Barb is trying to discourage Paul but not disappoint 
           Jack.

                                 BARB
                        It’s pretty far from the airport. Are you 
                        sure you’ll make it back in time?

           Paul begins to shake his head ‘no’ but his eyes drift 
           down to Barb’s chest. She has undone one more button. 

           Paul swaggers a little bit from the booze and the plane 
           ride. He fantasizes:

           EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY

           Demetrius Davenport smilingly tosses a football to a 
           glowing Jack. The camera pulls back to reveal Paul 
           feverishly banging a highly aroused Barb behind an 
           equipment shed.
           INT. MINNEAPOLIS AIRPORT - DAY

           Paul smiles.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. Sure. What the hell.

           EXT. RECREATIONAL CENTER - DAY

           Barb, Jack and Paul pull up in a cab. The Twin Cities Rec 
           Center is in an urban area. It’s swarming with people of 
           all ages. A security guard with a Bluetooth phone in his 
           ear stands at the entrance with a clipboard. 

           They exit the cab and the driver pulls out their luggage. 
           Barb pays him and he drives off.

                                 BARB
                        Here, hold my hand.

           Jack pulls a football from his bag, grabs his mother’s 
           hand and removes his hat, revealing his bald head. He 
           puts on a sad face. Paul stands back and watches as the 
           crowd parts for the sick little kid.

                                 PAUL (TO HIMSELF) 
                        You sneaky little shit.

           Barb and Jack make their way to the security guard. Jack 
           turns around and waves Paul forward. He joins them. Barb 
           is speaking to the guard who is looking at his clipboard.

                                 BARB
                        Volero.

                                 GUARD
                        Don’t see it.

                                 JACK
                        Maybe they spelled it with a B mom?

                                 GUARD
                        No Bolero here either.

                                 BARB
                        Well, you’re going to have to let us in. 
                        You can call the Wish-On-A-Star 
                        Foundation. We came all the way from 
                        Rhode Island.

                                 GUARD
                        I can’t call anyone right now, I’m doing 
                        security. Can you step to the side 
                        please?
                                 BARB
                        Wait a second buddy!

           She pokes him in the chest.

                                 GUARD
                        DON’T PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME LADY OR I’LL 
                        KICK YOUR ASS OUTTA HERE!

           Within seconds, three other large men are shoving Barb, 
           Paul and Jack out away from the door.

                                 BARB
                        I’D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY IT! YOU’RE 
                        NOTHING BUT A LIMP DICK WITH A CLIPBOARD!

           As they run across the street, Jack is crying, Barb is 
           livid and Paul checks his watch. He is nervous. It is 
           clear it’s time to move on out.

           Paul reaches out to pat Jack on his head, to say goodbye.

                                 PAUL 
                        Hey...

           Jack, bawling, buries himself in Paul’s arms. Surprised, 
           Paul stiffly puts his arms around the boy, patting his 
           back. He gives Barb a weak smile.

           Jack pulls away and Paul sees his brand new buffalo hide 
           jacket is covered in snot. He tries to shake it off and 
           wipes some on a tree, but it’s ruined. 

           Just then, a loud commotion is heard, and Demetrius 
           Davenport, surrounded by his entourage, comes from the 
           rec center. He pushes his way towards a mammoth SUV. Jack 
           takes his football and runs towards him.

                                 BARB
                        Jack, wait!

           Jack runs right up to Demetrius, blocking his entrance to 
           the SUV. He holds his football aloft. Barb runs up behind 
           him.

                                 JACK
                        I’m Jack Volero. The Wish-On-A-Star 
                        Foundation said you wanted to meet me.

           Demetrius looks down at Jack with annoyance.

                                 DEMETRIUS
                        I’m done signing. Get out of my face.

           Hearing this rankles Paul and he joins them.
                                 PAUL
                        He’s telling you the truth! He came all 
                        the way from Rhode Island!

           Barb looks incredulously at Paul. He looks at her.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Where in Rhode Island?

           She smiles at him. 

                                 BARB
                        Coventry. It’s just south of Providence.

           Paul raises his eyebrow at Demetrius.

           Demetrius looks at Paul, then back at Jack. He takes the 
           football in his hands. Jack smiles.

                                 DEMETRIUS
                        See how this works? I sign it, and daddy 
                        turns around and sells it on eBay.

           Paul has had it.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m not his daddy.

           Demetrius looks to Barb and then back to Paul.

                                 DEMETRIUS
                        You know what? I’d tap that ass too.

                                 PAUL
                        Really? I didn’t think conscious women 
                        were up your alley.

           The assembled crowd lets out a collective “ooh!”

                                 DEMETRIUS
                        What you say?

                                 PAUL
                        Maybe poor little sick kids aren’t your 
                        gig. Maybe You’d feel more comfortable 
                        with an eightball and a yacht full of 
                        fourteen-year old girls gone wild. 

           The whole crowd is frozen. Paul is stunned at his 
           newfound courage. He looks to Barb and Jack who just 
           stare at him.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        C’mon, let’s go.

           Paul walks across the street, then turns around where the 
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You guys coming or what?

           Demetrius throws the football hard across the street. 
           Everyone turns to watch it spiraling through the air.

           WHAM! It hits Paul square in the nose.

           INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

           Paul sits on an examining table, a broken nose covered in 
           an aluminum splint, gauze stuffed in his nostrils. Barb 
           pulls a curtain back and comes in.

                                 BARB
                        Hey.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey.

           Barb seems concerned but remains guarded, arms crossed. 
           She approaches Paul. 

                                 BARB
                        Does it hurt?

           She lightly touches his splint.

                                 PAUL 
                        AAAAH!

                                 BARB
                        Oh my god, I’m so sorry! 

                                 PAUL
                        It’s okay.

                                 BARB
                        And to think, you could’ve been sitting 
                        in the airport enjoying a twelve-dollar 
                        Sprite.

           This makes Paul laugh, but it hurts his nose. Barb 
           smiles, then catches herself being vulnerable and puts up 
           her tough exterior again.

                                 BARB (CONT'D)
                        That was a very brave thing you did 
                        before. Sticking up for my boy. 

           Paul stares dumbfounded.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        What the fuck are you doing? Leave! You 
                        don’t need another family. You just 
           Paul abruptly gets up and begins putting on his blood-
           stained clothes.

                                 BARB 
                        What are you doing?

                                 PAUL
                        Getting dressed.

                                 BARB
                        You look like Leatherface.

           He looks at himself in a mirror. Bloody clothes, 
           mutilated face, she’s right. So what?

                                 PAUL
                        I gotta get to the airport. Where’s my 
                        bag?

           Barb’s eyes widen.

                                 BARB
                        Oh shit!

                                 PAUL
                        What?

                                 BARB
                        I don’t know. In all that commotion, we 
                        must’ve left your bag there. Ours too. 
                        Maybe the ambulance has it...?

                                 PAUL
                        C’mon lady, I have a plane to catch.

                                 BARB 
                        Paul, your flight left hours ago.

           Paul looks at the clock on the wall. He stands deflated, 
           with broken nose and blood-stained clothes. 

                                 PAUL 
                        WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME?!!!

           He pulls back the curtain and reveals a very old man in a 
           hospital bed with two tubes stuck in his nose, looking 
           terrified.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        It’s okay. I’m a victim too.

           INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Barb, Jack and Paul eat dinner. Barb eats like a bird, 
           Jack picks at his plate and Paul just guzzles wine and 
                                 BARB
                        I’m sure your bag will turn up.

           He doesn’t look at her. He has discarded his bloody 
           clothes and is wearing a T-shirt that says: “YA DAMN 
           RIGHT I’M FROM MINNESOTA!” and some horrible sweat pants. 
           He finds a dried spot of blood on his new boots but 
           scrapes it off with a fingernail.

                                 JACK
                        Your eyes are going to be black and blue 
                        tomorrow. 

           Paul looks at the kid like he wants to strangle him.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        You’ll probably look like a raccoon.

                                 BARB
                        Jack!

                                 JACK
                        Chill out!

           Paul puts his wine glass down and touches his splint.

                                 PAUL 
                        Oooh!

                                 BARB
                        Why don’t you just go up to the room 
                        Paul. Between the wine and the Vicodin, 
                        you’re gonna pass out in a sec. 

                                 JACK
                        HE’S SLEEPING WITH US?!

           The entire restaurant turns to see the lady with too much 
           make-up, the bald kid and the guy with the busted face.

                                 BARB (QUIETLY)
                        Just one night Jack.

                                 JACK
                        Why?

                                 BARB
                        There weren’t any rooms left. Besides, 
                        he’s a nice guy.

           Paul chokes on his wine.

                                 PAUL
                        Sorry. Went down the wrong pipe.
           INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Paul stumbles into the elevator. He sees a sign 
           advertising ‘SNOWMOBILING ADVENTURES!’. Everything begins 
           to go blurry. PING. The elevator door opens.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Paul stumbles into the darkened room and into the double 
           bed nearest the door, onto his face. He groans in pain.

           He rolls over onto his back and passes out. His bloody 
           clothes are piled on a luggage rack in the foreground, a 
           severe snow storm beginning outside the window in the 
           background.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           Paul’s crusty eyes open to the sound of the television. 
           He sees Jack’s bald head against the bed, watching 
           cartoons, the volume turned all the way up.

           Paul looks over to see Barb asleep in the bed opposite. 
           He notices his boots have been taken off.

                                 PAUL 
                        Who took off my boots?

           Jack doesn’t take his eyes from the television.

                                 JACK
                        Mom did.

           Paul thinks.

                                 PAUL
                        One by one or at the same time?

           Jack just turns around and stares at him, confused.

           Paul smiles slightly at this. He stumbles out of bed, 
           still wearing his Minnesota T and leisure pants. He peels 
           open the curtains to the biggest blizzard he’s ever seen.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        FUCKING COCKSUCKERS!

           Jack leaps up in excitement.

                                 JACK
                        I know! It’s a megastorm! They say we 
                        might get up to sixteen inches!
           Paul looks on in horror.

           Barb rubs her eyes and awakens, looking out the window. 

                                 BARB
                        Oh my God! It’s snowing!

                                 JACK
                        I know! We’re going to be stuck here for 
                        days!

           Jack jumps up and down on Paul’s bed.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

           Paul walks through the busy hotel lobby, passing an easel 
           featuring a snow mobile reading: ‘BLACKHAWK THUNDERCATS!’ 
           He sees a phone booth, gets in and dials.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Hello?

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        It’s me.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Hi.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        I’m not in St. John.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        You’re not? Where are you?

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        Minneapolis. 

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        I don’t understand.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        It’s a long story. I’m at a pay phone in 
                        a hotel in Minneapolis and my cell phone 
                        was in my bag which is missing. It’s 
                        snowing a lot. Also my nose is broken.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Look, Paul, we need to talk.

           Paul notices Jack walking through the lobby.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        Now’s not a good time.
           Jack spots Paul and runs towards him, throwing open the 
           phone booth door.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        You’re always saying---

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        Look, Lee, I’ll call you back later.

           He hangs up. Jack grins at him.

                                 JACK
                        Who’s Lee? Is that your girlfriend?

           Paul grabs Jack by the shoulders.

                                 PAUL
                        Look you little shit, I know you’re sick 
                        and everything but get off my ass!

           Jack gives Paul a shit-eating grin.

                                 JACK
                        Too bad. I think my mom likes you. YUCK!

                                 PAUL
                        Really?

                                 JACK
                        She took your boots off, didn’t she?

           Paul looks and sees the snowmobile sign.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Jack and Paul return to the room. Barb is on the phone.

                                 BARB (ON PHONE)
                        He’s fine... I’m not getting into that 
                        with you again....The answer is 
                        no...Tony, drop it...Besides, I’m here 
                        with someone... Yeah, a guy.

           Barb looks at Paul and mouths the word ‘Psycho.’

                                 BARB (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        Yeah yeah yeah... Goodbye.

           She hangs up, takes a deep breath, smiles.

                                 BARB (CONT'D)
                        All right. Now that that’s behind us.

           Jack has begun to put on his outdoor gear.
                                 BARB (CONT'D)
                        Jackie, what are you doing, hon?

                                 JACK
                        Paul’s taking us snowmobiling. It’s gonna 
                        be rad.

           Barb looks at Paul, surprised. Paul shrugs.

                                 PAUL
                        I figure...it’s the least I can do.

                                 BARB
                        For what?

                                 PAUL
                        I have no idea.

           After an awkward moment, Paul sits on the bed, Barb sits 
           next to him.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Was that your husband? On the phone?

                                 BARB
                        Ex.

           Paul brightens at this.

                                 BARB (CONT'D)
                        Are you married?

                                 PAUL
                        Ah, uh, no.

           Paul holds up his ringless hand. To Barb it looks good, 
           but the fake tan has started to rub off on his palm side. 
           He quickly puts his hand back down.

                                 BARB
                        Yeah, I can’t get rid of this guy. He 
                        uses Jack to stay in my life.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh. One of those.

                                 BARB
                        And he’s not a nice guy, believe me.

                                 PAUL
                        How so?

                                 BARB
                        He wouldn’t have stuck up for Jack like 
                        that. He would’ve just been embarrassed. 
                        Jack being sick just makes him... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARB (CONT'D)
                        uncomfortable. Like he’s less of a man 
                        because of it.

                                 PAUL
                        Well look, I’m not...

                                 BARB 
                        I had no idea what he was really like 
                        when I married him.

           Paul ponders this.

                                 PAUL
                        I know what you mean, once you peel the 
                        layers away.

                                 BARB
                        Layer.

           They both laugh. It hurts Paul’s nose and he holds it but 
           they definitely share a moment as they stare into each 
           other’s smiling eyes.

                                 PAUL
                        You’re divorced?

                                 BARB
                        In the works. With Jack’s leukemia, I 
                        haven’t even had the time to finalize it. 
                        And this year hasn’t been good. It really 
                        hasn’t.

           Barb looks as if she’s about to cry, then stifles it. She 
           whispers to Paul:

                                 BARB (WHISPERING) (CONT'D)
                        Jack’s not doing too well.

           Paul just stares. Jack interrupts, fully dressed.

                                 JACK
                        Let’s go you turds, get your asses in 
                        gear!

                                 BARB
                        Oh just shut up!

                                 JACK
                        Nice attitude.

                                 BARB
                        Nice mouth. You kiss your mother with 
                        that mouth?

                                 JACK
                        Yep.
           He kisses her on the cheek. She lets out a playful little 
           shriek and hugs him. Paul is oddly moved by this gesture.

           INT. TOUR BUS - DAY

           Paul, Barb and Jack ride a tour bus with several others 
           through the wintery landscape just outside Minneapolis. 
           Jack sits alone in the row in front of them, reading a 
           pamphlet out loud.

                                 PAUL
                        It’s just a few hours out of town, but I 
                        think it’ll be worth it.

                                 JACK (READING ALOUD)
                        Nothing compares to the power of 
                        untouched wilderness, stopping to catch 
                        your breath on a spectacular scenic 
                        overlook, or experiencing the solitude of 
                        riding where no one has ever snowmobiled 
                        before.

                                 BARB
                        It’s really nice that you’re doing this.

                                 PAUL
                        Stop saying that.

                                 BARB
                        What? It is. Tony takes Jack to 
                        McDonald’s and drops him off on the end 
                        of the driveway.

           Paul laughs. So does Barb, begrudgingly. 

                                 BARB (CONT'D)
                        I wish it was a joke.

                                 PAUL
                        Look, I’m not going to act altruistic and 
                        pretend I’m doing it all for him. It’ll 
                        be good for me too. It sounds like... 
                        freedom.

           Paul looks out the window. He sees his own reflection: 
           two deep dark circles have formed around his eyes. He 
           loses his smile.

                                 JACK (READING ALOUD)
                        Enjoy the breathtaking scenery, spot 
                        wildlife such as moose, deer and wolves, 
                        or maybe tall timber and deep powder are 
                        what you’re after. 

           The camera zooms in on Paul’s black eyes and they become:
           EXT. SNOWMOBILE RENTAL HOUSE - DAY

           Two black snowmobiles racing across the powder into the 
           distance. The camera pans over to the ski lodge/rental 
           house.

           INT. SNOWMOBILE RENTAL HOUSE - DAY

           Paul stands at the rental counter talking to a clerk. 
           Barb and Jack look around the shop at gear.

                                 CLERK
                        It’s 175 dollars per vehicle for the day. 
                        Plus you’ll need to rent gear. And the 
                        little guy will need a guide. You’re 
                        lookin’ at, oh, eight, nine hundred.

                                 PAUL
                        Jesus.

                                 CLERK
                        Hey man, nobody rides for free.

           Paul gives him an icy stare.

           EXT. SKI LODGE - DAY

           Paul and Jack are in full snowsuits: goggles, gloves and 
           all. Paul moves stiffly. Jack jumps up and down. A guide, 
           Rudy, moves them towards two machines. Barb stands in the 
           background.

                                 RUDY
                        Just stay close by me. Keep it around or 
                        under eighty. And stay on the trails. We 
                        don’t wanna lose you when the weather is 
                        like it is today.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah yeah yeah.

                                 RUDY
                        C’mon buddy.

           Jack hops up on the back of Rudy’s vehicle. Paul turns 
           around towards Barb, a worried look on her face. Paul 
           looks ridiculous in his snow gear.

                                 PAUL
                        Don’t worry! It’s gonna be great!
           EXT. SNOW TRAIL - DAY

           Paul is going ninety miles an hour on his snowmobile. He 
           has a giant smirk across his face as the wind and G-
           forces ripple his skin. He lifts his goggles up. His 
           black eyes are smiling.

                                 PAUL
                        WOOOOO-WOOOOOO!

           Paul looks to Jack. Jack is smiling. 

                                 PAUL (SHOUTING) (CONT'D)
                        Not too bad, huh sport?

           Jack gives him a thumbs-up. He is giggling madly.

           EXT. SNOW TRAIL - LATER

           Rudy pulls up alongside Paul and motions for him to pull 
           over. Jack is shivering.

                                 RUDY
                        I think we should head back. The kid’s 
                        freezing.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh c’mon! I’m just getting started. 

                                 RUDY
                        Look, the weather’s gonna get fierce 
                        soon. We should turn around.

                                 PAUL
                        Look, why don’t you two go back. Get him 
                        some hot cocoa. All right if I spin 
                        around a little longer?

                                 RUDY
                        Jeez mister, I don’t know.

                                 PAUL
                        C’mon man. Don’t be a dick about it.

                                 RUDY
                        Fine. Just stick to the trails, will ya? 
                        And if you get into any trouble, You’re 
                        on your own. Got it?

                                 PAUL
                        Fine.

           Rudy gives a dismissive wave. Jack waves his frozen 
           little arm weakly. They ride off into the distance until 
           Paul cranks his snowmobile up and zooms off. 

           Racing among the pines at almost a hundred miles an hour, 
           Paul giggles like a child. Suddenly, something catches 
           his eye. He slows and stops his machine.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Whoa, whoa whoa. What’s this, what’s 
                        this?

           Paul’s P.O.V.: a large clearing past the pines. Vast, 
           fresh powder, the fading sun in the distance.

           EXT. CLEARING - DAY

           Paul does donuts across the large, circular clearing. The 
           pines that lined the trail he was on are way off in the 
           distance.

           Paul is giddy as a school girl. Happier than we’ve ever 
           seen him. Laughing and screaming.

                                 PAUL
                        YEAH! OH YEAH!

           Paul pulls on the brakes and the snowmobile skids out. He 
           is laughing so hard, he is nearly out of breath.

           He stares off into the open sky, the snowflakes becoming 
           larger, the landscape overwhelming around him. He takes a 
           big deep breath of air, his chest puffing up. He lifts up 
           his goggles. He smiles.

           Then, he hears a cracking. He looks beneath him. The 
           ground seems to be opening. He kicks away some snow. He 
           is above ice. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Oh Jesus no.

           He hears some more cracking. He looks around and realizes 
           he is on a frozen lake. His eyes widen. He quickly jumps 
           off the snowmobile, but as soon as he does, the ice 
           buckles under the weight of it.

           He watches as the mammoth contraption sinks under, 
           bubbling up in the water.

           He removes his hat and runs his hand through his hair.

           He walks to the ledge of the ice and looks down, his face 
           reflected in the water. 

           CRASH! The ice he is standing on collapses beneath his 
           feet and he is half-submerged in water. 
           With his upper body strength, he pulls himself out of the 
           hole and onto the surface.

           He looks into the hole to see the snowmobile sinking to 
           the bottom of the lake. His eyes close for a moment.

           He begins to pull himself and crawl off the lake.

           EXT. SNOW TRAIL - DAY

           Paul has made his way back to the trail, the pines lining 
           him on either side, but it has begun to snow heavily 
           again and he can’t see two feet in front of his face.

           Added to that, his clothes are waterlogged and his face 
           is covered in ice. And it’s getting dark out.

           He stops for a moment. He lifts his goggles. He goes to 
           his knees. Breathless. He falls on his back. Shivering.

                                 PAUL (WHISPERING, TO 
                                 HIMSELF)
                        Help me. Somebody help me. I’m sorry.

           Suddenly, Paul’s brother, Eric, emerges from the snow.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Eric. What are you doing here?

                                 ERIC
                        I thought you wanted help.

                                 PAUL
                        You can’t help me. You can’t even help 
                        yourself.

                                 ERIC
                        Look at you. You have all the answers.

                                 PAUL
                        I lied to Lee. I told her I had serious 
                        cancer.

                                 ERIC
                        Why?

                                 PAUL
                        I don’t want to have kids. I don’t want 
                        to be you.

                                 ERIC
                        You always were a jerk-off.

                                 PAUL
                        Come on, Eric. Admit it. You’ve been 
                        trying to kill yourself for years. You’re 
                                 ERIC
                        You don’t get it. There’s love here.

                                 PAUL
                        Don’t start with that.

                                 ERIC
                        You telling me you didn’t get a glimpse 
                        when you stuck up for that kid?

           Paul is silent. Eric lights a cigarette and turns. As he 
           does so, his house in New Jersey appears.

           Eric tosses his cigarette into a pile of leaves. It goes 
           up in flames.

                                 PAUL
                        The leaves are on fire.

           Eric walks away and disappears into his house.

           The entire house ignites into a giant ball of flame.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        ERIC! WAIT! DON’T GO! DON’T LEAVE ME!

           As the house becomes an all-consuming fireball, their 
           light becomes the blinding headlamp of an oncoming 
           snowmobile. Rudy hefts Paul aboard and drives off.

           INT. SKI LODGE - NIGHT

           Paul sits shivering on a table covered in blankets. Barb 
           talks to Rudy in the distance. Jack hops up on the table 
           and sits next to Paul.

                                 JACK
                        They didn’t want to go back for you. They 
                        said it was too dark and the weather was 
                        too thick. They wanted to wait until 
                        morning. But I made them. I made them go 
                        back.

           Paul looks at Jack. He is shivering, but there is a look 
           in his eyes that this gesture has genuinely touched him.

                                 PAUL
                        Th-th-thanks.

           Jack smiles.

           Paul looks back at Barb. He manages a jittery smile to 
           her. Barb looks skeptical.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Paul sits shivering, covered in blankets. Barb brings two 
           more. Jack stares at him from the other bed.

                                 BARB
                        Are you sure you don’t wanna see a 
                        doctor?

                                 PAUL
                        Positive. B-besides, what’s he gonna t-
                        tell me? You’re sick? I have cancer. 
                        Hypothermia is a walk in the park.

                                 JACK
                        Dude. You’re like some kind of awesome 
                        superman.

           Paul shivers but manages a wink to Jack.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Later. The lights are off. Jack is asleep, Barb at his 
           side. Paul still shivers. Barb stirs, looks towards him. 

                                 BARB
                        You’re still trembling.

           Barb sits up in bed.

                                 BARB (CONT'D)
                        I could lie next to you. It might help.

           Wearing only a long ‘Minnesnowda!’ T-shirt, her fit 
           thighs visible beneath, Barb gets up, crawling into bed 
           with Paul.

                                 PAUL
                        Are you sure he’s asleep?

                                 BARB
                        Positive.

           Paul’s shaking hands make their way up Barb’s shirt. 

                                 BARB (WHISPERING) (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god! Your hands are like freezer 
                        packs.

                                 PAUL (WHISPERING)
                        Sorry.

           They both start to laugh. Then try to stifle it. Barb 
           reaches her hand down below on Paul. His eyes go wide.
                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        F.Y.I. Fun fact: A frozen man’s penis is 
                        the first body part to thaw out.

                                 BARB
                        There you go. Poor guy.

           Paul pulls down Barb’s underwear. It’s clumsy. Awkward. 
           She climbs on top of him, moans. Stops. Covers her mouth. 
           They both hear Jack’s breathing. They go at it a little 
           more. Stop. Jack moves around. They go at it a little 
           heavier, Barb riding on top of Paul, trying to silence 
           her blissful groans.

                                 JACK
                        Mommy.

           They stop cold. Silence.

                                 BARB
                        It’s okay. He’s talking in his sleep.

           Barb is now rocking back and forth atop Paul.

                                 BARB (WHISPERING) (CONT'D)
                        Are you gonna come?

                                 PAUL (WHISPERING)
                        I don’t have to.

                                 BARB (WHISPERING)
                        No no. Go ahead. 

                                 PAUL (WHISPERING)
                        I want you to come.

                                 BARB (WHISPERING)
                        I can’t. I’ll make too much noise. You 
                        come. It’s fine. Just pull out and come 
                        all over my ass.

                                 JACK
                        Mommy.

                                 BARB
                        He’s asleep. Just keep going.

                                 JACK
                        I’m not asleep mommy. I’m wide awake.

           Barb clenches up tight, just as Paul is letting out an 
           orgasmic groan. Barb sticks her hand over his mouth, 
           muffling the sound.

           They both look over, Jack is silhouetted, sitting up in 
           bed. There is a long silence. Barb takes her hand off of 
                                 PAUL 
                        Hey pal. Mommy’s just warming me up...

           Barb slowly climbs off of Paul.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You know...Like Luke Skywalker and the 
                        Ton-ton?

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           Paul stares at his blackened eyes in the mirror. Barb and 
           Jack are still asleep.

           He puts on his bloody clothes. He takes one last look at 
           Barb, the make-up stripped away, peaceful in sleep.

           Jack looks like a little angel. 

           Paul exits the room and closes the door.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

           He walks quickly down the hotel hallway, not smiling.

           The sound of a jet flying overhead builds in intensity as 
           Paul walks and we are in:

           EXT. ST. JOHN POOL BAR - DAY

           Paul is standing in four feet of completely clear water. 
           His body pale and flabby against the tanned and toned 
           tourists of St. John. He sips a tropical drink through a 
           straw, sunglasses across the bridge of his metallic 
           splinted nose. He doesn’t smile. The scenic beauty is a 
           sharp contrast to his sad demeanor.

           He looks up to the sky. Paul’s P.O.V.: The sky is clear 
           blue, but tinted a strange red through his rose-colored 
           shades. He moves them back and forth, creating a 
           kaleidoscopic effect. He frowns.

           EXT. ST. JOHN’S BEACH - DAY

           Paul walks alone across a white sandy beach.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        It’s nice here. And there isn’t a kid in 
                        sight. I thought I could discern a 
                        childlike scream earlier in the distance, 
                        but that was it. The noise was quickly 
                        extinguished.
           INT. PAUL’S BUNGALOW - DAY

           Paul removes the bandages from his nose. There’s just a 
           little yellowish black bruise under each eye. He tries to 
           smile but it seems strained.

           EXT. ST. JOHN’S BEACH - DAY

           Paul participates in a yoga class, everyone in identical 
           white robes.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        I’m brilliant. I really am. A late 
                        bloomer, but still. I could be sitting in 
                        Englewood Cliffs, listening to Lisa Hunt 
                        wheeze and unscrew her pill bottles.

           EXT. NARROW WHITE PATH - DAY

           Paul walks with a group of people in white robes down a 
           long white path with palms and bent green grass.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        I could have a fucking kid!

           INT. SAUNA - DAY

           Paul is being given a massage by a broad shouldered man 
           who places rocks on his back and rubs his shoulders. 
           Paul’s expression is blank.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        Worse yet, I could be dead. Frozen solid 
                        beneath Bald Eagle Lake! 

           EXT. ST. JOHN’S BEACH - DAY

           Paul watches the sailboats off in the distance.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        A psychologist friend of Lee’s once told 
                        me at a party that I suffered from 
                        Anhedonia, the inability to experience 
                        true pleasure. I told him to go fuck 
                        himself.

           EXT. ST. JOHN’S BEACH - DUSK

           Paul practices Tai Chi with a group in white robes on the 
           beach at dusk. He has developed a tan.
                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        Anyway, when you have momentum, nothing 
                        really gets in your way. Not Anhedonia, 
                        not even cancer.

           Paul makes eye contact with a pretty young blonde. She 
           smiles at him, and he at her.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Paul eats alone at a busy restaurant on the beach: the 
           very definition of lonely in a crowd. He spots the young 
           woman from his Tai Chi class. He waves her over. She sits 
           down.

                                 LUCY
                        I’m Lucy. I saw you in class.

                                 PAUL
                        Paul.

                                 LUCY
                        What happened to your face Paul?

                                 PAUL
                        Oh this? I had a disagreement with a 
                        drinking fountain.

           She laughs at this silly joke. He smiles.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        No. I tripped over an alligator and fell 
                        through a plate glass window onto a 
                        lawnmower.

           She laughs even harder.

                                 LUCY
                        Oh my god!

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. So what brings you to the self-
                        center?

                                 LUCY
                        Oh, you know, messy divorce, strained 
                        relationship with my parents, early 
                        thirties career malaise. The usual. You?

                                 PAUL
                        Terminal cancer.

           She laughs even harder.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
           She holds her hand to her mouth.

           He gives her a wry smile. She laughs again.

           INT. PAUL’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Paul is fucking Lucy hard but dispassionately under white 
           sheets. Although the setting is idyllic, the sex is 
           perfunctory. He is distracted by the blinking red light 
           on the phone, But continues thrusting.

           INT. PAUL’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Later. Paul stares up at the ceiling fan. He does not 
           smile. Lucy kisses his chest.

           Paul sits up in bed. Lucy moves over to the side, 
           lighting a joint. She offers it to him. He declines. He 
           turns on the TV.

           The movie ‘The Champ’ is on. Young Ricky Schroeder cries 
           over his father’s body, as he lies dying in the ring.

                                 RICKY SCHROEDER (ON TV)
                        Don’t die Champ! I love you, don’t die 
                        Champ!

           Paul’s eyes well up with tears. Lucy looks over at him 
           and laughs. 

                                 LUCY
                        You homo!

           He turns off the TV, wiping away his tears, sniffling. He 
           turns away from her on his side. He thinks:

           EXT. REC CENTER - DAY

           In front of the gathered crowd, Barb holds down Demetrius 
           legs and Paul his arms as Jack kicks and punches him in 
           the stomach. Demetrius screams in pain as the crowd 
           cheers them on.

           INT. PAUL’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           He smiles thinking about this. Lucy looks to the blinking 
           light, to Paul who ignores it. He closes his eyes.
           INT. PAUL’S BUNGALOW - DAY

           Paul drinks a glass of orange juice in a white terry 
           cloth robe. He opens the white wicker shutters of his 
           bungalow, revealing the white sandy beach. He looks down 
           to the phone, the blinking red light. He dials “8.”

                                 DR. TOLSON (ON PHONE)
                        Hi Paul. It’s doctor Tolson. I’m sorry to 
                        bother you on your vacation. Your wife 
                        gave me the number. call me as soon as 
                        you get this, okay? 212-545-6176.

           Paul is puzzled. He hangs up, then dials Dr. Tolson.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        Hi, Paul Mauro for Doctor Tolson.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        One moment please.

                                 DR. TOLSON (O.S.)
                        Paul. I’ve been trying to reach you.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        What’s up?

                                 DR. TOLSON (O.S.)
                        Listen. I have some bad news.

           Silence. The blood drains from his face. 

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        I’m...I’m in St. John. Have you ever been 
                        to St. John?

           Silence.

                                 DR. TOLSON (O.S.)
                        Once. Long ago. Lovely place. Listen, the 
                        chest X-ray came back.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        It’s another perfect day. I mean, it’s 
                        almost intimidating. Have you ever been 
                        parasailing?

           EXT. ALEX’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Alex jumps from her balcony window, stark naked. The big 
           yellow curtains billow in the wind. We are above her as 
           she plummets downward, looking up at us and smiling 
           broadly. She looks ethereal and free.
           INT. PAUL’S BUNGALOW - DAY

                                 DR. TOLSON (O.S.)
                        Paul, I hate to ruin your trip, but you 
                        should come back as soon as you can.

           Paul slowly drops his hand, bringing the phone to his 
           side. He stares at his bare feet. We can vaguely hear Dr. 
           Tolson giving out bad news, although we can’t quite make 
           out what he is saying.

           WHAM! Paul slams down the phone. He yanks the cord out of 
           the wall and throws the phone out the window onto the 
           sand. A uniformed groundskeeper runs up and stares at it. 
           He looks at Paul quizzically. 

                                 PAUL
                        It’s a phone! I didn’t throw a baby out 
                        of the window! Get a life! 

           The groundskeeper picks up the phone and walks away with 
           it. 

           EXT. ST. JOHN’S BEACH - DAY

           Completely dazed, Paul walks out onto the beach, staring 
           into the sea. He hears a low scraping sound behind him.

           Paul turns to sea a small man with a broom, dressed in 
           the attire of a resort employee, sweeping the white sand. 

           He watches numbly as this man performs his futile task, 
           the seemingly endless beach stretching out beyond him, 
           focusing on a few grains at a time.

           He looks at the clouds gathering in the sky.

           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT

           The clouds in the sky become the clouds on Paul’s lungs. 
           We back away to see that he is looking at a set of X-
           Rays, riding on a New York subway train. Although he 
           frowns, he looks ridiculously tan against the pale 
           citizens riding the train in New York in the early 
           winter.

           Paul stares into space. The conductors voice booms.

                                 CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
                        Seventh avenue is the next stop. Seventh 
                        avenue, Park Slope.

           Paul hears this and gets off the train.
           EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE SUBWAY STOP - NIGHT

           Paul walks up the steps at the seventh avenue subway in 
           Park Slope, Brooklyn. He is like a zombie as he comes 
           across a cheese shop, its’ windows all decked out for 
           Thanksgiving. Paul’s eyes are like black-rimmed saucers.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        Will I be around for next Thanksgiving? 
                        Will anyone miss me?

           He turns to see a tiny bookstore on a corner.

           INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

           Paul walks in dazed. He is startled by the gentle older 
           woman who greets him.

                                 BOOKSTORE LADY
                        Can I help you?

           Paul stares at her in disbelief. Then he blurts out:

                                 PAUL 
                        Hi. I feel especially awful about myself 
                        and I’m looking for something about 
                        someone particularly evil, more evil than 
                        me. You know... So I can feel better.

           The woman stares blank-faced. Then:

                                 BOOKSTORE LADY
                        There’s Hitler.

                                 PAUL
                        Great.

           A large Hasidic woman in the store looks over at him. 
           Paul looks embarrassed and follows the bookstore lady 
           away from her glare.

           The bookstore owner reaches up and hands Paul a hardback 
           copy of ‘Last Mystery of the Third Reich.’ 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Thank you.

                                 BOOKSTORE LADY
                        You’re welcome.

           She walks away and Paul tries to read but he cannot 
           focus, his eyes dart to the store window where he sees 
           Brenda’s husband, Felipe, standing outside. Paul smiles, 
           happy to see a familiar face and puts the book back on 
           When he turns back, Felipe is embracing and kissing a 
           woman. And the woman is Lee, Paul’s wife. Paul looks like 
           he’s been punched in the gut by a horde of Vikings. They 
           walk off, laughing, and Paul involuntary cries out:

                                 PAUL
                        OH COME ON! REALLY?

           INT. PAUL AND LEE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Paul sits in his darkened apartment, smoking a cigarette. 
           Lee comes in, sniffs.

                                 LEE
                        Is something burning? Paul?

           She turns on the light.

                                 LEE (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god. I didn’t even know you were 
                        here. When did you get back?

           She notes the cigarette. 

                                 LEE (CONT'D)
                        When did you start smoking again?

                                 PAUL
                        What difference does it make?

           Lee sighs.

                                 LEE
                        Let me guess what stage you’re at 
                        now...self-pity?

           Paul does not answer. He takes a long drag.

                                 PAUL
                        I saw you. In the bookstore window. 

           Lee thinks. Realizes.

                                 LEE
                        Oh. I’m sorry Paul.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m fucking livid.

                                 LEE
                        What gives you the right to be livid at 
                        me?

                                 PAUL
                        I’m dying. Have a little class.
                                 LEE
                        Oh Jesus. Here we go again.

                                 PAUL
                        I mean, didn’t that make you think twice?

                                 LEE
                        It did. But you made it impossible for me 
                        to be close to you.

           Paul stands, pacing.

                                 PAUL
                        BULLSHIT! You just want kids. You’re just 
                        moving on. Why not steal poor Brenda’s 
                        husband?

                                 LEE
                        Poor Brenda?!!

           She looks at him with a knowing disgust. He sits down.

                                 PAUL
                        Jesus Christ, those born-agains really do 
                        confess everything, don’t they?

           Lee stares at him in revulsion.

                                 LEE
                        You know, you’re really something else 
                        Paul. You’re really something else. 
                        Goodbye.

           Lee gets up and leaves, slamming the door. Paul smashes a 
           lamp from pottery barn.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        My father told me never to marry someone 
                        smarter than me. “That’s how you get away 
                        with things,” he said.

           He looks out the window to see Lee walking away down the 
           sidewalk.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But who, really, in the history of 
                        mankind has ever gotten away with 
                        anything?

                                                               FADE OUT.

                                                                FADE IN:
           INT. PAUL AND LEE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           A week later. Unshaven, unkempt, bloodshot eyes, in a 
           bathrobe with a cigarette dangling from his lips, Paul 
           walks through his filthy apartment, littered with empty 
           pizza boxes, beer cans and booze bottles. Maury Povich 
           plays on the TV. 

           He goes into the bathroom. He finds a few pill bottles: 
           Vicodin, Tylenol with Codeine. 

           He throws the pills on the kitchen table and smashes them 
           with a hardcover copy of ‘Fatherhood’ by Bill Cosby.

           He dices the powder up with a razor blade and snorts it 
           off a framed wedding photograph of Lee and himself. He 
           falls back on the couch. 

           EXT. ALEX’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Paul climbs naked onto Alex’s balcony, smiling, climbing 
           the rails. Ring ring ring.

           INT. PAUL AND LEE’S APARTMENT

           Paul comes to and answers the phone.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        Lee?

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        Paul? Jesus bro, you sound like shit.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        Eric. What’s up?

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        Well, Terry wanted me to invite you over 
                        for Thanksgiving....

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah okay.

           Paul hangs up. His head falls back.

           INT. ERIC’S HOUSE - DAY

           Thanksgiving day. A familiar scene. We’re right back 
           where we started from. Paul eats dinner and tolerates the 
           constant screaming of the children. Resigned. Lifeless.
           Eric’s oldest son throws a yam that hits Paul in the 
           face. He hardly reacts.

           EXT. ERIC’S HOUSE - DAY

           Paul and Eric stand on Eric’s back porch. It is burnt 
           black from a fire. Paul surveys the damage.

                                 PAUL
                        What the hell happened?

                                 ERIC
                        Leaves caught fire. Who the fuck knows 
                        how.

           Eric takes a drag on his cigarette.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Terry wants to have another kid.

                                 PAUL
                        Are you serious?

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah.

                                 PAUL
                        Well...good for you.

                                 ERIC
                        What?

                                 PAUL
                        You’re alive. You’re spawning. This is 
                        good.

                                 ERIC
                        I can’t tell if you’re joking.

                                 PAUL
                        I can’t either.

                                 ERIC
                        You’re a weird fucker.

                                 PAUL
                        I think I’m in love.

                                 ERIC
                        You’re in love?

                                 PAUL
                        I’m in love with a family. A woman and 
                        her kid.
                                 ERIC
                        I thought you hated kids.

           Paul smiles.

                                 PAUL
                        This one’s an exception.

           Terry shouts out the screen door at Eric.

                                 TERRY
                        You gonna defrost this fucking pie? It’s 
                        not gonna do it itself.

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah.

           Eric absent-mindedly tosses his cigarette into a pile of 
           leaves. He goes back into the house. Paul stomps it out, 
           making sure it’s fully extinguished.

           INT. PAUL AND LEE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Paul excitedly runs into his apartment, throwing a wet 
           bag of Thanksgiving leftovers on the table and picks up 
           the phone, smiling as he dials.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        Coventry. Rhode Island. The number for a 
                        Barbara Volero.

           Paul hastily jots down the number and hangs up, dialing 
           again.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        Barb! It’s Paul. Paul Mauro.

           The sound of the phone hanging up loudly can be heard.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        Barb?

           Paul hangs up and dials again.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        Hey, I think we got---

                                 BARB (ON PHONE)
                        Listen scumbag! Don’t ever fucking call 
                        here again!

           The phone clicks again. Paul stands frozen, holding the 
           receiver.
                                 PAUL
                        Happy turkey day.

           INT. PAUL AND LEE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Two weeks later. Paul’s beard is fuller, his face more 
           haggard. He is weeping inconsolably, watching television. 
           The camera swings around to show that he is watching 
           Benny Hill chase a half-naked woman around.

           Paul turns it off. He stops crying. He thinks. He picks 
           up the phone and dials.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE) 
                        Barb, it’s Paul. Please don’t hang up!

           INT. BARB’S HOME - NIGHT

           Barb sits in the kitchen of her home, on the phone. 

           *Intercut with Paul’s apartment.

                                 PAUL (ON PHONE)
                        I know it was the wrong thing to do. 
                        Leaving like that.

                                 BARB
                        Oh, you figured that out? You want to be 
                        forgiven? That it?

                                 PAUL 
                        No. Just wondering how Jack is.

           Barb is silent for a long time.

                                 BARB
                        He’s doing better.

                                 PAUL
                        What happened?

                                 BARB
                        None of your fucking business.

           Silence.

                                 PAUL
                        Anyway. I wanted to say Merry Christmas. 

                                 BARB
                        It’s two weeks away. 

                                 PAUL
                        I know. Can I ask you a question?
                                 BARB
                        No.

                                 PAUL
                        What kind of tree are you getting this 
                        year?

                                 BARB
                        The same kind we get every year. The fake 
                        one down in the basement.

           Paul thinks:

                                 PAUL
                        Listen, I’m coming to visit you.

                                 BARB (SARCASTIC)
                        Sure. That sounds like a great plan. You 
                        can fuck me and ditch my dying son in the 
                        morning.

           There is a long silence on the phone. 

                                 PAUL
                        I told you I was an asshole. You gonna 
                        keep busting my balls? I wanna come and 
                        help you have a merry fucking Christmas.

           Barb just barely smiles.

                                 BARB
                        C’mon, give me a break.

                                 PAUL
                        Look, it’s either that or I sit at home 
                        listening to Jingle Bells while I stick 
                        my head in the oven.

           Barb laughs at this.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        The really jazzy Andy Williams Jingle 
                        Bells.

           She laughs again.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I’m glad my very real suicidal thoughts 
                        have brought a smile to your face.

           Barb is smiling.

                                 BARB
                        Paul. It just... It’s not so simple as 
                        that.
                                 PAUL
                        Let me make it up to you. What’s your 
                        address? 

           Barb contemplates.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Paul’s Mazda drives up I-95 with a Christmas tree twice 
           the size of the car strapped to its’ hood.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        I’m going to do it. I’m going to be the 
                        cancer Grinch this year.

           EXT. COVENTRY STREET - DAY

           Late afternoon. The cloudless sky is tinged with pink. 
           The ground is covered in snow. Paul looks at a Mapquest 
           printout with the address 271 Hollyhock Lane. He looks up 
           and sees it: 

           271. A modest house with a nice yard. But dead-set in the 
           middle of the front lawn is a disconcerting detail: A 
           cement block and a forty foot flagpole with an enormous 
           American flag, flapping in the breeze. Then Paul sees the 
           faded blue BUSH/CHENEY sign in the bay window.

                                 PAUL
                        You gotta be fuckin’ kiddin’ me.

           He pulls into the driveway and gets out of his car. Barb 
           cracks the screen door in an extra-large sweatshirt.

                                 BARB
                        Hi Paul.

                                 PAUL
                        Hi Barb.

                                 BARB
                        Nice tree. 

                                 PAUL
                        Nice flag.

           She looks up at it and smiles.

                                 BARB
                        It’s my ex’s. He put it up when the war 
                        started. I haven’t had the time to get it 
                        removed.
                                 PAUL
                        Let’s get some migrants from Home Depot 
                        to chop that fucker down. I’m buying.

           She smiles slightly, as Paul follows her into the house.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        How about the sign?

           Barb grabs that and rips it into pieces. She hands the 
           pieces to Paul as he walks into the house.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Well all right.

           INT. BARB’S HOME - DAY

           Paul and Barb sit in her small kitchen, drinking coffee. 
           They stare at each other not speaking, sipping. 

           The kitchen table is littered with Jack’s hospital 
           papers, tons of them, lined with coffee cup rings.

                                 PAUL
                        Jack’s not doing well? 

                                 BARB
                        No. He’s not. He’s bleeding inside. They 
                        switched him to Clolar. It’s something 
                        they give kids when they’re doing fine 
                        for a while and then relapse.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m sorry.

                                 BARB
                        So did you come all this way to get laid?

                                 PAUL
                        No. 

                                 BARB
                        This isn’t going to work. It’s my fault. 
                        I shouldn’t have told you to come.

           Paul stands up, paces.

                                 PAUL
                        Look... I’m just... the tree. How about 
                        we just decorate the tree? That’ll be a 
                        nice surprise for Jack. And then I’ll 
                        just drive away. You won’t see me again. 
                        Fair enough?

           Barb stands. She slaps Paul hard in the face. 
                                 BARB 
                        Fair enough? You sick, selfish son of a 
                        bitch. 

                                 PAUL
                        I’m sorry.

                                 BARB 
                        Shut up. What you did to my son is 
                        unforgiveable. So you better hope he 
                        accepts your apology.

           Barb slaps him again. Paul is stunned into silence. 

                                 BARB (CONT'D)
                        Now go get the fucking tree.

           Paul runs out.

           INT. BARB’S HOME - DAY

           Paul pushes the enormous tree through the front door, 
           shedding nearly every needle in the process. When he gets 
           it in, it looks like a twig with a few branches on it.

                                 PAUL
                        Well shit.

           They both look at the pathetic thing laying on the 
           ground. Barb’s face contorts into one of amusement. 

                                 BARB
                        Oh.

           Paul stands the tree up. Barb begins to laugh.

                                 BARB (CONT'D)
                        Well, you made the effort.

           She laughs harder.

                                 PAUL
                        It was going to be great.

           They both laugh.

                                 BARB
                        It doesn’t matter anyway. Jack’s doctor 
                        says there’s a good chance he’ll still be 
                        in the hospital for Christmas.

           She is on the verge of tears. Paul hugs her and she 
           accepts his embrace. The phone starts ringing. She 
           doesn’t answer.
                                 PAUL
                        Your phone is ringing.

                                 BARB
                        That’s Tony. My Ex. He calls me twenty 
                        times a day. I don’t even answer it 
                        anymore. 

           It stops ringing. Barb grabs Paul’s hand and smiles.

                                 BARB (CONT'D)
                        Hey! You wanna go for a ride?

           INT.  SUV - MOVING - DAY

           Barb drives Paul around town in a giant, flame-red SUV. 
           Everyone seems to know her. Cars honk. Pedestrians wave.

                                 PAUL
                        You’re popular here.

                                 BARB
                        It’s Jack. Everybody knows about it. He’s 
                        like the town mascot now.

           They drive by a pond. Barb pulls over. 

           EXT. JOHNSON’S POND - DAY

           A frozen pond just off the road. Both children and adults 
           skate on it.

                                 BARB 
                        That’s Johnson’s Pond. Jack and I skate 
                        there every winter. He hasn’t been well 
                        enough this year.

                                 PAUL
                        Very pretty.

           Barb is lost in thought for a moment.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Barb?

           She snaps out of it.

                                 BARB
                        Oh. Sorry. 

           She drives off.
           EXT. WAL-MART - DAY

           Barb pulls into the large parking lot of a WAL-MART and 
           turns off the ignition.

                                 BARB
                        I’ll be right back.

                                 PAUL
                        Where are you going?

                                 BARB
                        I told Jack I’d bring him a Nutter 
                        Butter.

           She gets out and slams the door. Paul watches Barb skip 
           into the WAL-MART. People smile and wave at her. She 
           disappears into the store and Paul is startled at the 
           sudden rapping on his window.

           A uniformed cop, broad-shouldered, mid 40’s, with dark, 
           slicked-back hair looks in at him. He has intense eyes. 
           The window is open about six inches, so he purses his 
           lips, talking through the crack.

                                 PAUL
                        Is there a problem officer?

           The cop walks around the car and gets in the driver’s 
           seat. He stares at Paul.

                                 COP (TONY)
                        Nice ride huh?

                                 PAUL
                        The car? Yeah. Yes.

                                 COP (TONY)
                        Are you comfortable? You look a little 
                        cramped. 

           The cop toggles the little button adjacent the seat and 
           Paul goes sliding slowly forwards instead of backwards, 
           his harness seat belt choking him a little.

                                 PAUL (CHOKED)
                        Are we parked in a handicapped or 
                        something?

                                 TONY
                        Get the fuck out of my car. 

           Paul realizes this is TONY.
           Paul nods. He tries to unlock the door, shaking. He 
           finally gets it and opens the door but gets stuck in the 
           still fastened seat belt. He undoes the latch and 
           stumbles onto the blacktop.

           Tony gets out and walks around the car towards Paul as 
           Paul tries to hustle away from him.

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        Hold on. Hold on. 

           Paul freezes, his back to Tony. Tony kicks Paul square in 
           the ass and he falls to his knees. Paul gets up.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey man. Don’t kick me in the ass.

           Just as Tony is about to lunge forward, a pack of Nutter 
           Butters hits him square in the forehead.

                                 BARB
                        Get back in the car Paul!

           Paul is frozen as Tony bends over to pick up the cookies. 
           He smirks and throws them back to Barb.

                                 TONY
                        What a great mother you are. Buying that 
                        crap for Jack. Driving around like a 
                        whore with this scumbag so everyone can 
                        see.

           Barb starts to move towards Tony but they are interrupted 
           by a honk. All three look over to see Tony’s girlfriend, 
           a redhead with clumps of mascara and Lee Press-On Nails 
           in a silver BMW tapping the horn. Barb points to the car.

                                 BARB
                        There Tony. Heat Miser will give you a 
                        lift.  

           Tony walks to the BMW, He looks at Barb.

                                 TONY
                        You just assaulted an officer of the law, 
                        sugar. Luckily I’m off duty.

            Tony smiles a sinister grin at Paul.

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        Nice to meet you Paul.

           He gets in the Beemer and they peel off. Paul is frozen.

                                 BARB
                        You coming?
           Paul looks to Barb, terrified.

                                 PAUL
                        You didn’t tell me he was a cop.

                                 BARB
                        Must’ve slipped my mind.

                                 PAUL
                        He wears his uniform off duty?

                                 BARB
                        He wears it to bed. Well, the gun anyway.

                                 PAUL
                        Great.

           They get in the SUV and drive off.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Barb and Paul walk into Jack’s hospital room. It is 
           stuffed with gifts: flowers, toys, silver balloons, even 
           a giant wooden key resting against the window.

           Jack is asleep, a blanket pulled up to his chin. He looks 
           very ill. There’s an IV taped to his wrist. He wakes up 
           and faintly asks:

                                 JACK
                        Did you bring the Nutter Butters?

           Barb puts them on the bedside table. Jack smiles weakly.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Mom? I think I’m gonna puke again.

                                 BARB
                        It’s the Clolar. I thought they weren’t 
                        going to start you until noon.

           Barb kisses Jack on the forehead and sits down next to 
           him. Jack is ignoring Paul, choosing instead to focus on 
           the football game on TV.

                                 JACK
                        Demetrius is playing today. 

                                 BARB
                        Paul came a long way to see you. Remember 
                        last night I told you he was coming? He 
                        brought a tree with him.

           Jack is silent. Paul gestures to the giant key.
                                 PAUL
                        What’s that?

                                 BARB
                        The mayor stopped by. Gave Jack a key to 
                        the city.

                                 JACK
                        It doesn’t open anything. It’s fake.

           Jack looks right at Paul.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Just like you.

                                 BARB
                        I’ll let you two catch up.

           Barb goes into the bathroom and closes the door. Paul 
           takes a seat next to Jack.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey.

           Jack doesn’t look at him.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I know I let you down. I should’ve said 
                        goodbye. I’m hoping we’re still pals.

           Jack still focuses on the TV.

                                 JACK
                        Not fucking likely.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey. C’mon. Don’t talk like that. 

                                 JACK
                        Why not? You do.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. But I’m an asshole. 

                                 JACK
                        I saved your life. Remember that, guy? If 
                        it wasn’t for me, you’d still be freezing  
                        on Bald Eagle Lake.

                                 PAUL
                        I know Jack. I’ll never forget it. 

           Jack’s expression is less serious, but he still watches 
           the game. Paul watches Demetrius Davenport in action.
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You know what Jack? I remember how sad 
                        you were in Minnesota. Disappointed by 
                        Demetrius because he wasn’t the guy you 
                        thought he was. That’s just the way it 
                        is. They put on a big show about what 
                        great heroes they are, but they’re just 
                        jerks. All of them. I’m no different. 
                        Sometimes I pretend to be something I’m 
                        not. And I’m not even sure who that is. 
                        But I’m trying... with you and your mom. 
                        If you’re willing to still give Demetrius 
                        a chance, can’t you cut me some slack?

           Jack looks at Paul. He is about to break into a smile but 
           it quickly distorts into a painful grimace.

                                 JACK
                        OW! 

           Paul gets freaked out. A nurse, Laura, comes rushing in.

                                 LAURA
                        Jack?

                                 JACK
                        My wrist hurts!

           Laura adjusts the catheter in his wrist.

                                 LAURA
                        Just a few more hours honey.

           Barb comes bursting out of the bathroom, fly still open, 
           black lace panties exposed. Paul notices this.

                                 BARB
                        What the hell’s going on?

           She is buttoning her jeans.

                                 LAURA
                        Everything’s fine. 

           Laura exits.

                                 BARB
                        Were you really in that much pain baby?

                                 JACK
                        Yes. And can you zip up your pants 
                        please? Paul’s checking you out.

           Paul gives Jack that narrow-eyed sideways glance again.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Paul sits on the window sill, looking out to the sky. 
           Cloudy. He plays with the giant key.  Barb and Jack are 
           both fast asleep. They look peaceful. Paul smiles. Then 
           he hears a deep booming voice coming down the hallway. He 
           stands up.

           Tony enters, out of uniform, wearing a shirt buttoned 
           down to his mid chest and a distressed brown leather 
           bomber jacket. He holds a gift wrapped package. His 
           girlfriend is on his arm, holding a giant teddy bear.

                                 TONY
                        Well, well, well. If it isn’t Paul from 
                        Minnesota. Hello Paul.

           Paul is trying to stay cool.

           Barb wakes up, her face tensing. Jack weakly opens his 
           eyes.

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        Hey buddy boy. I brung you somethin’.

           Tony places a gift-wrapped package next to Jack’s legs. 
           Paul notices his holstered gun as he bends over.

                                 JACK
                        The only time you bring me things is when 
                        you’ve been a dick to mom.

           Barb smiles. Tony looks to her.

                                 TONY
                        You teach him that language?

           Barb shrugs. Tony narrows his eyes at Paul.

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        That’s not true Jack. I bring you stuff 
                        because I love you. I want you to get 
                        better.

                                 JACK
                        Whatever.

           Jack quickly darts up and begins to tear the box open.

                                 TONY’S GIRLFRIEND
                        There’s a card.

           The card just falls to the floor, unopened. Jack pulls 
           out an orange and green football jersey from the box, the 
           word Bulldogs stitched across the front.
                                 TONY
                        You get better Jack, coach says he’ll let 
                        you play next season.

           Jack tosses the jersey aside.

                                 JACK
                        Yawn. I’m over it. What else?

           Tony’s girlfriend puts the teddy bear next to him.

                                 TONY’S GIRLFRIEND
                        We thought you might like this.

                                 JACK
                        You thought wrong, firecrotch.

           Tony gets up in Jack’s face, grabbing him by the 
           shoulders.

                                 TONY
                        HEY! You don’t talk to her like that!

           Jack just stares Tony in the eye, Tony releases his grip. 
           Barb is ready to pummel him. Paul slinks back down to his 
           seat. 

           Tony backs away, nervous and sweaty. Jack just grins at 
           him.

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        Who wants a smoothie? I’m buyin’!

           Barb stands up and pulls Paul by the arm.

                                 BARB
                        C’mon Paul. Let’s go.

           She pulls him out the door but stops and turns around to 
           an uneasy Tony. She whispers to him:

                                 BARB (CONT'D)
                        If you ever lay a hand on my son again, 
                        I’ll hit you so hard you’ll be shitting 
                        teeth for a week. 

           Barb and Paul begin to exit.

                                 JACK
                        Mom, don’t go.

                                 BARB
                        It’s all right honey. Spend some time 
                        with your dad. We’ll be back.
           Jack looks sad but Barb smiles at him. Paul gives Jack a 
           wink. Jack smiles back at him. Tony notices this and 
           frowns. Paul and Barb leave.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

           Barb comes across Laura, the nurse.

                                 BARB
                        Will you please keep an eye on my ex?

           As Barb and Paul walk away, Laura gives a knowing smile 
           and enters the room.

           EXT./INT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Barb and Paul sit in the SUV.

                                 PAUL
                        He’s quite a guy that Tony.

                                 BARB
                        The fuck do you know? For all I know 
                        you’re worse than him. I don’t even know 
                        who you are.

           Paul leans back and lets this soak in.

                                 PAUL
                        You’re right. I don’t know what it feels 
                        like. I’ll just shut up.

           Barb looks up to the window of Jack’s room. She can see 
           the flicker of the TV and she just bursts into tears.

                                 BARB
                        I feel so powerless. I wake up every 
                        morning and I can’t believe this is 
                        really happening.

                                 PAUL
                        Listen, if it would be easier, I could 
                        just take off.

                                 BARB
                        You mean easier for you?

                                 PAUL
                        No, I...

                                 BARB
                        How do you feel when you wake up? Are you 
                        scared shitless about dying? How do you 
                        deal with it?
           Paul stops and thinks. He really has nothing to offer but 
           empty platitudes.

                                 PAUL
                        You just gotta go on. One step at a time.  
                        Don’t sweat the small stuff. Courage.

           Barb looks confused, then she smiles.

                                 BARB
                        Oh, I get it.

                                 PAUL
                        What?

                                 BARB
                        It hasn’t hit you yet.

           He sits back. He opens his mouth to speak but does not. 
           He realizes she’s right. Barb smiles sweetly and pats 
           Paul on the leg. She turns the car on and they drive off.

           INT. BARB’S HOME - NIGHT

           Barb and Paul decorate the pathetic tree. It isn’t so bad 
           once they have it ornamented and wreathed with garland.

                                 BARB
                        Shit. I forgot the cresh.

                                 PAUL
                        What’s a cresh?

                                 BARB
                        A cresh. It’s a french clay thing.

           He looks at her, puzzled.

                                 BARB (CONT'D)
                        It’s a french clay baby Jesus! It’s in 
                        the basement. Would you get it?

           Paul exits laughing. Barb calls after him.

                                 BARB (CONT'D)
                        It’s by the washing machine. 

           Barb takes a sip of wine, looks at the tree. She smiles. 
           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Stepping down the creaky steps to the basement, Paul sees 
           a bunch of cobwebbed baby toys, a ten-speed bike with a 
           flat tire, the washer and drier, and leaning against the 
           drier, between the Maytag and a cement wall, is a Force 
           150 crossbow with olive and brown camouflage. 

           Paul gingerly lifts the weapon. It has some heft to it. 
           He can barely pull back the cord. His whole body 
           shudders. He puts it back. Looks at it. Finds the clay 
           baby Jesus and picks it up.

           INT. BARB’S HOME - NIGHT

           Barb is admiring the tree. Paul enters.

                                 PAUL
                        What’s with the crossbow?

                                 BARB
                        I told you he was psycho. I’m just happy 
                        he took the guns out. 

                                 PAUL
                        I’m sure he’s thrilled we’re trimming the 
                        tree together.

           Barb laughs and gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.

           Paul plugs in the lights, illuminating the room. They 
           smile at one another.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        So... What now?

                                 BARB
                        I’m not having sex with you so don’t even 
                        ask.

           INT. BARB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Barb lies awake in her bed. Paul lies on the floor.

                                 BARB
                        Paul?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah?
                                 BARB
                        Can you take Jack to see Santa tomorrow? 
                        The nurse said he’d be strong enough to 
                        leave the hospital for a few hours and 
                        you two haven’t spent any time alone.

                                 PAUL
                        Santa?

                                 BARB
                        There’s one at the Warwick mall.

                                 PAUL
                        Sure.

                                 BARB
                        Good.

           Barb hops out of bed and starts putting her clothes and 
           boots on.

                                 PAUL
                        What are you doing?

                                 BARB
                        I’m going back to the hospital.

                                 PAUL
                        He’s asleep.

                                 BARB
                        Doesn’t matter. It’s just the thought of 
                        him lying there. Sleep in the bed. I’ll 
                        be back in an hour.

           She’s out the door. Paul stands up, goes to the window, 
           watches her drive off. He looks at the Mazda. He stares 
           at it long and hard, then shuts his eyes.

           INT. BARB’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Paul wakes in a fog. Barb is asleep in a chair opposite 
           the bed. He stands, picks her up in his arms and puts her 
           in the bed, tucking her in. He kisses her forehead. She 
           wakes up.

                                 BARB
                        Paul?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah?

                                 BARB
                        How much time have you got left?
                                 PAUL
                        I’m not sure. I try not to think about 
                        it.

           Barb pauses. She has a pained expression on her face and 
           barely squeezes these words out:

                                 BARB 
                        I’m pregnant.

                                 PAUL
                        Huh?

                                 BARB
                        I’m pregnant. I’m going to have your 
                        baby.

           Paul is stunned.

                                 PAUL
                        Uh... Uh... Are you awake right now?

                                 BARB
                        Minnesota. It was an accident, I know, 
                        but I’m having it.

                                 PAUL
                        Barb...

                                 BARB 
                        Paul. You need to get comfortable with 
                        the idea that I’m going to have your 
                        child. I would have told you before but I 
                        figured you were out of the picture.

                                 PAUL
                        Shouldn’t we...

                                 BARB
                        I’m not asking you. I’m telling you. I 
                        know you won’t be around and I’m okay 
                        with that. 

                                 PAUL
                        Are you sure?

                                 BARB
                        This isn’t about you. It’s better if you 
                        leave after a few days. I know you don’t 
                        want to be here anyway. 

                                 PAUL
                        Don’t I have any say...

                                 BARB
                        No. Now go take Jack to see Santa.
           Barb rolls over and goes to sleep. Paul stands frozen for 
           a moment, then goes downstairs.

           EXT. BARB’S HOME - DAY

           Paul exits the house. He stands for a moment thinking. He 
           smiles. He gets in the SUV.

           INT. SUV - DAY

           Paul drives Jack to the Warwick Mall. Jack has his 
           sneakers obnoxiously kicked up on the dashboard. 

                                 JACK
                        Of all the nurses, Laura’s got it for me 
                        bad. She’s crushing on me big time. Right 
                        here.

           Startled, Paul pulls a sharp, screeching right.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Then there’s Mandy. She just looks at me 
                        and melts. I don’t want to hurt her 
                        feelings, because Becca likes me more 
                        than either of them. Right at the next 
                        light.

           Paul is getting pissed off at Jack’s directions.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Cause, this one time they had a fight 
                        about who was gonna give me a spongebath. 
                        This light. You seem really distracted 
                        today. Is everything all right?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. Great.

           Paul makes the turn and can see the giant mall in the 
           distance.

                                 JACK
                        THAT’S THE MALL DUDE!

           Paul speeds up and takes the exit ramp too fast. He 
           notices Johnson’s Pond, just beyond the metal railing 
           where he takes the turn to the mall. Jack is forced to 
           lean against him from the centrifugal force.

           EXT. MALL - DAY

           Paul zooms into the mall parking lot and screeches to a 
           halt. He looks at Jack with an almost zealot’s fervor.
                                 PAUL
                        READY TO SEE SANTA?

           Jack is freaked out.

           INT. MALL - DAY

           Paul walks into the mall, looking for a directory. Jack 
           grabs his hand. Paul is surprised by this. He looks down 
           at the hand, then at Jack who is looking around the mall 
           in amazement. Paul finds the directory.

                                 PAUL
                        He’s on the B Concourse. Follow me.

           As Paul and Jack are riding on the escalator, Paul 
           becomes faint and slips, gripping the handrail for dear 
           life. When they get to the top, a dizzy Paul has to sit 
           on a bench.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Hold up. Hold up.

           Paul looks around at the food court and the Christmas 
           decorations, swirling about in a psychedelic haze. Jack’s 
           face appears.

                                 JACK
                        Paul. Are you okay?

                                 PAUL
                        I’m fine.

           Paul puts his head between his knees and spits. Then sits 
           back up.

                                 JACK
                        Maybe it’s your meds.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m not taking any meds! Would you just 
                        shut up for a second?

           Paul says this loud and some other people in the mall 
           notice, frowning at him. Jack runs off. A woman with 
           thick, caked-on make-up looks sternly at Paul.

                                 MAKE-UP LADY
                        That’s child abuse.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey, Tammy-Faye, child abuse would be 
                        making a kid stare at you.

           The woman is shocked. Paul looks around for Jack, then 
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You see where he went, Bozo?

           Shocked, the woman just points.

                                 MAKE-UP LADY
                        Through the sunglass hut.

                                 PAUL
                        Thanks.

           Paul saunters off to find Jack.

           INT. SANTA’S WORKSHOP - DAY

           Paul finds the hordes of parents and children waiting in 
           line to meet Santa. He cranes his neck, looking for Jack. 
           He tries to move ahead. A fat woman with a fatter 
           daughter puts her arm in front of him.

                                 FAT WOMAN
                        Where do you think you’re going?

                                 PAUL
                        I’m looking for my son. He’s in a 
                        Minnesota Vikings cap?

                                 FAT DAUGHTER
                        The boy with the bald head.

                                 FAT WOMAN
                        Oh. 

           Her expression changes to one of sympathy.

                                 FAT WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        They let him go to the front.

           Paul looks forward, squinting his eyes to see that, 
           indeed, Jack is sitting on Santa’s lap, his hat off, that 
           shit-eating grin on his pale mug. Jack begins to hop 
           animatedly up and down, and Paul moves to the side out of 
           their line of sight.

                                 SANTA
                        O.K. That’s enough little boy.

                                 JACK
                        Is it?

                                 SANTA
                        Excuse me?

                                 JACK
                        That half a boner in your pants says 
           Paul’s eyes go wide in shock.

           Santa removes candies from his pocket.

                                 SANTA
                        Those are Mentos young man.

                                 JACK
                        Only foolin’. Hey, does that thing itch?

           Jack pulls on Santa’s fake beard and snaps the elastic 
           back in his face.

                                 SANTA
                        Hey!

           Paul smiles at this.

                                 JACK
                        Wait a second. Didn’t you sell my mom and 
                        me a pretzel at Auntie Anne’s a week ago?

           Paul is really laughing now. Santa looks around to see if 
           anyone is catching this.

                                 SANTA
                        You must be confusing me with someone 
                        else.

                                 JACK
                        It’s all right. I know you’re not the 
                        real Santa.

           A bunch of mothers in the front of the line put their 
           hands over the ears of their kids.

           Paul makes a move to grab him but he’s just enjoying this 
           too much to interfere.

                                 SANTA
                        Why would you say that?

                                 JACK
                        You mean other than the beard, your 
                        Nikes, the stomach pad that smells like 
                        six Christmases worth of B.O. and the 
                        Coor’s light on your breath?

           The entire line is aghast. Kids are crying. Paul is 
           laughing. And a couple of security guards are descending.

                                 SANTA
                        How do you know what Coor’s Light smells 
                        like?
                                 JACK
                        My old man drinks it. He’s a low-rent 
                        phony like you.

           Jack hops off of Santa’s lap.

                                 JACK 
                        Plus, if you were for real, I wouldn’t 
                        have gotten fucked with the toys I got 
                        last year.

           The entire crowd lets out an audible gasp. As the 
           security guard goes to grab Jack, Paul intervenes and 
           swoops him up.

                                 PAUL
                        I got this one guys.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Paul and Jack walk silently through the parking lot. Paul 
           is smiling.

                                 PAUL
                        That was pretty funny back there.

                                 JACK
                        You won’t tell my mom?

                                 PAUL
                        Nope.

           Jack smiles.

           INT. MAZDA - DAY

           Paul and Jack drive back from the mall. Paul looks sad. 
           He glances over to the passenger seat to see a sleeping 
           Jack. Peaceful. He holds an empty Nutter Butter wrapper 
           in his hand and the corners of his mouth are stained with 
           Peanut Butter.

           INT. BARB’S HOME - DAY

           Paul walks in, exhausted. Barb looks beautiful, lounging 
           on the sofa, reading a book next to the lit up Christmas 
           tree. She smiles at him.
                                 BARB
                        How was Santa?

                                 PAUL
                        Terrific.

           He smiles back at her.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        How are things around here?

                                 BARB
                        Well, the phone’s stopped ringing.

                                 PAUL
                        That’s good, right?

                                 BARB
                        I don’t know. It scares me.

                                 PAUL
                        Why?

                                 BARB
                        Because it means he’s ready to take it to 
                        the next level.

           Paul rolls his eyes.

                                 PAUL
                        Awesome.

           Paul and Barb are startled by the phone ringing.

                                 BARB
                        Perhaps I spoke too soon.

                                 PAUL 
                        Sit down. I’ll get it.

           She sits back on the couch. Paul answers the phone.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Hey Tony? I think it’s time you moved on.

           Paul hangs up the phone and takes it off the hook.

           In a moment, a horn starts violently honking from 
           outside. Paul and Barb run to the front door and open it 
           to see Tony peeling away in his Beemer with his 
           girlfriend in the passenger seat. He screams out the 
           window:

                                 TONY
                        NICE FUCKING MAZDA, FAGGOT!
           Paul closes the door and chains it. Barb moves to the 
           couch. He turns around to see her beaming brightly. She 
           holds her arms out to him.

                                 BARB
                        Come here tough guy. 

           He moves towards her. She puts her arms around him. And 
           they engage in a long, wet kiss.

           INT. BARB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Paul and Barb make passionate love, vastly different from 
           their first awkward encounter. They smile and laugh and 
           stare deep into each others eyes. They kiss deeply, 
           caressing each other everywhere.

           INT. BARB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Post-coital. Barb and Paul lie holding one another 
           tightly, eyes wide open.

                                 PAUL
                        It hit me by the way.

                                 BARB
                        What did?

                                 PAUL
                        That I’m going to die.

                                 BARB
                        I’m sorry. That’s terrible.

           She laughs.

                                 PAUL
                        Thank you.

           She playfully shoves him. He smiles.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I always felt, not God necessarily, but 
                        something was looking out for me. I mean 
                        at me. Monitoring. “There goes Paul, he’s 
                        fixing the sink.” “There’s Paul eating a 
                        Falafel.” But there’s no one there. No 
                        one.

           Barb pulls his face close to hers.

                                 BARB
                        I’m here.
           She kisses him. He embraces her.

                                 PAUL
                        You know, I could stay. If you wanted me 
                        to.

                                 BARB
                        Is that what you want?

                                 PAUL
                        Yes.

                                 BARB
                        Fine.

           They kiss. Paul nestles his head against her and goes to 
           sleep.

           INT. BARB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Later. Barb is fast asleep. Paul is wide awake. He 
           decides to slip on his boxers and head downstairs. 

           INT. BARB’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The Kitchen is dark. He walks to the refrigerator and 
           opens the door, turning away to shield his eyes from the 
           light, he notices that Tony is sitting at the kitchen 
           table, his knuckles clenched, his giant watch causing a 
           glare..

           Paul is frozen staring at him.

                                 TONY
                        Help yourself.

                                 PAUL
                        Jesus. You scared me.

                                 TONY
                        I know. You left the back door open. I 
                        mean, what’s the sense of chaining the 
                        front if you’re gonna leave the back wide 
                        open?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. 

                                 TONY
                        You can put your cock away.

           Paul looks down and notices his dong hanging out. He puts 
           it back in his boxers.
                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        Make yourself a sandwich. Then come and 
                        sit down.

           Paul nervously pulls out two pieces of wheat bread and a 
           jar of Mayo. He spreads the Mayo on the bread and shakily 
           presses the slices together. He puts it on a plate and 
           sits opposite Tony.

           Tony pulls the chain on the light hanging over the table. 
           It makes him seem vampirish.

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        You know there’s cold cuts. Salami, 
                        pickles.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m okay.

                                 TONY
                        That’s a pathetic sandwich.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m not even hungry really.

           Paul forces himself to look Tony in the eye. 

                                 TONY
                        Jack tells me you have cancer. Is that 
                        true?

                                 PAUL
                        Actually... It’s a funny thing... I 
                        didn’t...and now I do... so...

                                 TONY
                        So there’s really no point in killing 
                        you.

           Silence.

                                 PAUL
                        Not really. 

           Paul takes a bite of his Mayonnaise sandwich and quickly 
           spits it out onto his plate.

           Tony leans forward.

                                 TONY 
                        Listen. I gotta run. But I want you to 
                        relay a message to my wife. I’d tell her 
                        myself but she’s not taking my calls. 
                        Plus when I see her in public, she has a 
                        tendency to throw things at me.
                                 PAUL
                        The Nutter Butter.

                                 TONY
                        Yeah. Whatever. The message...

           Tony stands up. Paul gears himself for death. 

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        Is that Jack is going to be spending 
                        Christmas with my girlfriend and me. 
                        You’ll tell her?

                                 PAUL
                        Absolutely.

                                 TONY
                        Good. And stay away from my kid or I’m 
                        going to kill you anyway. Enjoy your 
                        sandwich.

           Tony walks out the back door and Paul can hear his car 
           zoom off.

           INT. BARB’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Paul awakens. Alone. Could it have been a dream? He hears 
           Barb rustling in the kitchen and goes downstairs.

           INT. BARB’S KITCHEN - DAY

           He walks in to find Barb cooking eggs and bacon and 
           pouring coffee. And a Mayonnaise sandwich with a bite 
           taken out of it on the kitchen table.

                                 PAUL
                        Barb...

                                 BARB
                        Tony was here.

                                 PAUL
                        How did you know?

                                 BARB
                        I could smell the Aqua Velva.

                                 PAUL
                        He scared the shit out of me.

                                 BARB
                        What did he say?
           Paul just stares at her for a moment. Her face sinks. 
           Then:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

           Jack’s room is empty, save for the useless key to 
           Coventry.

                                 BARB
                        Where’s Laura?! She knows better than 
                        this!

                                 NURSE
                        She has the day off. It’s Christmas eve.

                                 BARB 
                        How could you just let them take him?!!! 
                        He’s in the middle of a Chemo cycle!!!

                                 NURSE
                        His father kept saying how much he just 
                        wanted him home for Christmas. I...

           Barb just stares at Jack’s empty bed.

           Paul stands in the corner in a kind of paralyzed agony.

           INT. BARB’S HOME - NIGHT

           Barb is weeping inconsolably on the sofa. Paul holds her 
           tight. The Christmas tree lights blink on and off.

           INT. BARB’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Barb is asleep. Paul is wide awake. There is a time-lapse 
           dissolve which takes us into:

           INT. BARB’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           An exhausted Barb still sleeps. Paul is wide awake. He 
           looks over at the clock: Six A.M. He gets out of bed and 
           puts on his clothes.

           INT. BARB’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Paul finds Tony’s info in an address book.

           INT. BASEMENT - DAY

           Paul grabs the crossbow from next to the drier.
           He grabs an arrow and a tip in a toolbox.

           He grabs the crossbow, throwing it over his shoulder.

           INT. MAZDA - DAY

           It has just begun to snow, and Paul drives his Mazda with 
           purpose, the crossbow visible in the back seat.

           EXT. TONY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Paul pulls the Mazda to the side of the road in front of 
           Tony’s house. It is a well-to-do neighborhood. Tony’s is 
           a white brick, three story colonial with a large chimney. 
           It has a long, curvy driveway, an enormous front door 
           with a gigantic wreath hanging from it.

           Paul flips on his hazards. He gets out of the car, the 
           crossbow slung over his shoulder, his fist clenching an 
           arrow.

           He begins his ascent up the driveway.

           He stops at the front door and rings the bell. He takes 
           the arrow and, with great consternation, pulls the steel 
           wire backwards, locking it in place. His whole body 
           convulses from the pressure of it.

           He waits about ten seconds. Then, picking up his right 
           foot, he rings the bell again. Soon, he can hear stirring 
           inside and he sees a figure through the curtained side 
           window.

           Tony opens the door. They stare at each other: Tony, in 
           his silk bathrobe and slippers. Paul, shuddering as he 
           points an arrow square at Tony’s chest. Even his face is 
           spasming from holding the wire back. Tony’s girlfriends 
           voice can be heard from inside the house.

                                 TONY’S GIRLFRIEND (O.S.)
                        Who is it?

                                 TONY
                        No one.

           The men are in stand-off mode for a few seconds. Then, 
           Tony makes the slightest lurch towards Paul. Paul points 
           the weapon downward and accidentally releases.

           They stare at one another, then both look down. The arrow 
           is sticking out of Tony’s slippered foot, the foot nailed 
           to the floor. 

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
           Tony falls backwards and lands in the doorway. Paul 
           tosses the crossbow in a bush, steps over him and into 
           the house.

           INT. TONY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Paul enters the large home and sees a gigantic fake tree 
           with what looks like hundreds of presents under it. As 
           Tony’s girlfriend enters the room from the kitchen with a 
           cup of coffee, Paul ascends a spiral staircase.

                                 TONY’S GIRLFRIEND
                        Tony, what’s in your foot?

           Paul hears a blood-curdling scream and then Tony gasping:

                                 TONY
                        Call 911! Call 911!

           Paul tries the first door, a bathroom. A second door: the 
           kids room.

           INT. KID’S ROOM - DAY

           Paul lifts the covers off the top bunk. It’s the 
           girlfriends’ kid. Fat and slobbering.

           He tries the bottom bunk. Jack sleeps soundly. Paul 
           gently tries to rouse him. 

                                 PAUL
                        Jack. Jack.

           Jack sleepily opens his eyes. He sits up. He puts his 
           arms around Paul’s shoulders. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        How fast can you get dressed?

           INT. TONY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Paul quickly carries Jack down the stairs.

                                 TONY
                        How much blood am I losing?

                                 TONY’S GIRLFRIEND
                        The ambulance is coming. Oh my god! I’ll 
                        get some ice.
           Tony’s girlfriend goes into the kitchen. Jack is still 
           half-asleep as Paul carries him over Tony through the 
           front door. Tony is so focused on his foot he doesn’t 
           even notice.

           EXT. TONY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Paul is carrying Jack down the driveway. Jack looks back 
           towards the house. Rubbing his eyes, he sees his father 
           laying in the doorway.

                                 JACK
                        What’s going on?

           Paul is getting his keys out. 

                                 PAUL
                        Nothing. It’s all good.

           Almost at the car, Paul freezes as he can hear Tony’s 
           girlfriend scream from the house:

                                 TONY’S GIRLFRIEND
                        HE SHOT MY BOYFRIEND! SOMEBODY HELP ME 
                        PLEASE!

           Jack gives Paul a stern look. 

                                 JACK
                        Put me down.

           Paul places Jack on the ground. He stares up at him.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        You shot my dad.

                                 PAUL
                        He deserved it. C’mon, let’s go have a 
                        nice Christmas.

           Jack begins to cry. Big, heaving sobs. Paul is looking 
           around waiting for the sirens. Paul grabs Jack’s hand.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Let’s go.

           Jack wrenches his hand away.

                                 JACK
                        I’m not going with you.

           Paul crouches in front of him and speaks with intensity.
                                 PAUL
                        Your mom loves you more than anybody in 
                        the world ever could. And we’re both 
                        gonna die soon. You and me.

                                 JACK
                        You’re going to die!

           Jack looks at Paul for a moment. Then he takes off back 
           towards the house.

           Deflated, Paul watches Jack run back inside. Paul gets in 
           his car, turns off the hazards, starts the ignition. And 
           then he hears Jack’s voice:

                                 JACK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        WAIT!

           Jack is running back towards the car, this time with his 
           Minnesota Vikings cap in hand. Jack hops in the car, 
           breathless.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        I was just getting my hat.

           Paul smiles.

           INT. MAZDA - DAY

           Paul smiles as he drives a sleepy-eyed Jack home. Jack 
           puts his mittened hand on top of Paul’s and grabs it 
           tight. Paul looks down at this, clearly moved. 

           INT./EXT. BARB’S HOME - DAY

           Paul and Jack practically kick the door open. Barb is 
           staring at the Christmas tree, but she immediately turns 
           around. Tears fill her eyes. Jack jumps into her arms. 
           She looks to Paul, signals him to join them. He just 
           slowly nods his head ‘no’. She looks confused.

           The sound of sirens can be heard in the distance. Barb 
           listens to them knowingly. Paul steps out onto the porch.

                                 PAUL
                        I should probably just go. Things get bad 
                        when I stick around.

           Barb, holding Jack in her arms, pops open the screen 
           door. She listens to the sirens getting closer. She 
           laughs.

                                 BARB
                        You think?
           This makes Paul laugh too.

           Paul gets in the still running Mazda. He rolls down the 
           window and calls to her:

                                 PAUL
                        You’ll be all right.

           Barb laughs again.

                                 BARB
                        I need you to tell me that?

           He smiles at her. She smiles back. A deep, knowing 
           understanding between the two of them. Jack sleepily hugs 
           his mother. Paul puts the car in reverse and peels off 
           down the street.

           Barbs eyes are beginning to tear, but still she smiles. 
           She looks to her son and takes him inside. Still smiling.

           EXT. COVENTRY STREET - DAY

           Two police cars follow Paul in quick pursuit. Their 
           lights flashing, their sirens blaring. He drives with a 
           strange, sad smile on his face. And although his speed is 
           well over 100 MPH, he seems eerily calm. 

           Paul floors it. He recognizes the road he is on.

           He looks off in the distance, to the mall where he took 
           Jack to see Santa.

           He smiles and looks up. One of those ‘God Speaks’ 
           billboard is above him. It reads: “Will the road you’re 
           on get you to MY place?” - God. Paul laughs. But in his 
           revelry, he loses focus of the metal railing separating 
           him from the frozen pond dead ahead.

           EXT. JOHNSON’S POND - DAY

           Travelling at an alarming speed and taking the sharp 
           turn, the car breaks through the guard rail.

           We are now in the moment at which the film began: The car 
           sails in slow motion over a young girl skating on the 
           ice. She watches as it floats over her head...

           And lands. WHAM! Right onto the ice.

           Paul’s head hits the dashboard and the windshield 
           shatters. The hood buckles.
           The car goes slip-sliding across the pond. Skaters race 
           to get out of the way. 

           Birds skitter from their branches, shorn of leaves. They 
           flap their wings against the sun, gently peeking through 
           a haze of clouds. The light flickers across Paul’s face 
           as the car moves forward.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        You’re gonna go out anyway, might as well 
                        go big, right?

           Paul looks over to the passenger seat. The empty Nutter 
           Butter wrapper lays there and flaps a little from the 
           breeze coming through the cracked windshield.

           The cops stop their vehicles on the road and get out to 
           watch.

           Paul looks at the ice-skating girl outside his window. 
           She looks like an angel, all dressed in white. He smiles 
           as his car drifts farther from her.

           And like a newborn child, Paul looks at the world around 
           him as if for the first time: the sky, the sun, the 
           flittering birds, the children with wonder in their eyes. 
           He seems to understand something in a new way.

           He looks at himself in the rearview mirror. His front 
           teeth are cracked and his lip is bleeding.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        At least you did something. At least you 
                        made somebody else happy for a change. 

           The car slides to a patch of thin ice. He hears the sound 
           of the ice breaking beneath him.

           He makes eye-contact with the terrified skater girl, 
           moving farther away from him as the car slithers onto the 
           thin ice.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I hope this girl will skate away and tell 
                        some reporter exactly where I went under, 
                        so Barb and the kid I’ll never meet can 
                        skate over me years from now.

           The car stops moving. Paul sits still. He has plenty of 
           time to get out and escape but he does not. He sits, 
           calmly smiling. At peace. Everyone surrounding the car 
           watches in silence. Not moving an inch. 

           Paul looks past the curious skaters to two snowmen on the 
           banks of the pond. One, a large man and the other a small 
           child. He observes the stick hands touching each other. 
           He grins. The stick hand of the large snowman falls off 
           his round torso and into the snowbank.

           His eyes refocus to the young skater girl. A small stream 
           of snot runs down from her nose. She wipes it on her 
           rainbow-colored mittened hand, without a hint of 
           selfconsciousness.

           CRASH! The ice breaks and the car is completely submerged 
           under water.

           EXT. ALEX’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Paul smokes a cigarette naked on Alex’s balcony. He peers 
           over the edge and smiles.

           INT. MAZDA - DAY

           Paul’s car fills with water as he watches fish go by.

                                 PAUL (V.O.)
                        I’ll never know if it’s a boy or a girl. 
                        Whether he’ll break bottles on this 
                        frozen lake when he gets older, or smoke 
                        pot on a humid summer night and imagine 
                        he sees my ghost. Or her. Could be a 
                        girl. That’d be a kick in the pants.

           The water is nearly up to Paul’s chin. He looks out the 
           window through the hole in the ice. He can see the sky, 
           slightly cloudy, the wind blowing snow flakes.

           The water is now above Paul’s head. He smiles and some 
           air bubbles escape his mouth.

           EXT. JOHNSON’S POND - DAY

           The tires touch the bottom of the pond and the camera 
           slowly pulls away from the car.

                                 PAUL (V.O.) 
                        Now’s a good time to figure out the 
                        future of the world. Now’s a real fine 
                        time to finally show some interest.

           EXT. JOHNSON’S POND - DAY

           The camera tracks the young skater girl as she races away 
           from the sinkhole, the water bubbling up in the distance.

                                 THE END.
