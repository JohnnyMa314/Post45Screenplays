           INT. ULTRA COOL L.A. CLUB - NIGHT

           An upscale bar filled with attractive people.  Stunning women 
           are everywhere.   

           TWO GORGEOUS GIRLS, mid 20s, sit alone at a tall cocktail 
           table.  They seem available, ready to be picked up by any guy 
           with the stones to make a move.  Across the bar, we find TWO 
           27 YEAR-OLD GUYS staring at them, awed.

           JESSE is clean-cut and nice-looking in a boyish way, but has 
           a timidity and self-consciousness to him.  His best friend 
           CHARLIE, sloppier and less self-aware, stands next to Jesse, 
           coaching him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        C’mon, you got this.  Just walk 
                        over and say “hey, I’m Jesse.”

                                 JESSE
                        Why do I have to do this?  Why 
                        can’t you be the one to walk over 
                        and say hi?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Because this isn’t my issue, I’m 
                        not the one who’s all timid and 
                        crippled from a year-old breakup.  
                        I’m also not afraid of hot ladies,  
                        I constantly do stuff like -

           He turns to the NEAREST GIRL -

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey gorgeous.  Let’s take a chance 
                        at love.

           She rolls her eyes and turns away.  Unfazed, Charlie turns 
           back and continues -

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        - which rarely works, but I’m not 
                        afraid to do it.  C’mon, don’t be 
                        intimidated by their beauty.  Or 
                        theirs.

           He nods to THE HANDSOME GUYS AROUND THEM - tall, model-esque 
           studs who make Jesse and Charlie look like boys in a sea of 
           men.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Any bar filled with hot girls is 
                        going to draw hot guys.
                                 JESSE
                        Please don’t call the guys “hot.”

                                 CHARLIE
                             (staring in awe)
                        What should I call them?  Gorgeous?  
                        Stunning?  Masculine sexuality 
                        personified?

           Charlie realizes he’s crushing Jesse’s confidence.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, they’re not even here.  It’s 
                        just you and those girls.  So get 
                        confident, remember that you are 
                        awesome, and do your thing.

           Jesse steels himself, game face on, and starts to walk over.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Jesse -
                             (as Jesse turns back)
                        Relax.  They’re just people.  
                        What’s the worst that could happen?

           Jesse considers this and loosens up.  Charlie’s right.  
           What’s the worst that could happen?

           Jesse approaches and stands at the girls’ table.

                                 JESSE
                        Hey there.  I’m Jesse.

           He smiles.  The girls say nothing.  They’re not rude, they 
           don’t look away, they just... say nothing.  An awkward beat.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Well.  Guess I should have planned 
                        more than four words, huh?  Not 
                        that I planned anything - I’m not 
                        one of those guys who rehearses 
                        what he’s going to say to girls. 
                             (a long, awkward beat)
                        Although maybe I should be, right?  
                        Because this is... not going well. 
                             (chuckles, then)
                        Okay, let me start over.  My name -

           As he sets a hand on their tall table, it rocks - KNOCKING 
           OVER THEIR FULL DRINKS.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Shit!  Sorry, let me grab a -
           No napkin in sight.  With the liquid spreading, threatening 
           to pour into their laps...

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        What the hell -

           He puts both arms on the table and pulls the fluid toward 
           himself, soaking his sleeves.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        There.  That was chivalrous, right?  
                        Sacrificed my own -

           His arm passes over a candle - one of HIS SLEEVES CATCHES ON 
           FIRE.  Not an inferno, just a slow flame on his forearm.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Wow, look at that.  What were you 
                        drinking, Red Bull and kerosene? 
                        Kidding.  I should put this out.

           He calmly pats the flame with his other sleeve - WHICH ALSO 
           CATCHES ON FIRE.  He stands there with two flaming forearms.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Hmm.  Probably should have seen 
                        that coming.  Okay, I’m getting a 
                        little scared...

           With no other ideas, Jesse pulls off his shirt and stamps out 
           the flame.  He’s bare-chested.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        There we go.  Problem solved.
                             (then, realizing)
                        And I’m shirtless.  So, yeah.  This 
                        is me.  This is what I’m working 
                        with.  A perfect male specimen?  
                        Not exactly.  I don’t live at the 
                        gym.  But I do have a membership, 
                        and I get there when I can.  
                        Actually, check this out -

           As Jesse goes into an awkward bicep flex, we CUT TO:

           EXT. BAR - LATER

           Jesse is dejected and still wearing his half-burned shirt as 
           the guys walk home in silence.  Finally:

                                 CHARLIE
                        I thought that went okay.  Not 
                        perfect.  But okay.
                                 JESSE
                        I caught on fire.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Like I said, not perfect.
                             (then, upbeat)
                        Don’t worry buddy, I got a lot more 
                        action on the docket: pub crawls, 
                        ladies nights, a museum showing of 
                        18th Century Victorian art that’ll 
                        be boring as shit but crawling with 
                        tail... I even got us invited to a 
                        costume party Friday.

                                 JESSE
                             (flat)
                        Sounds thrilling.

           They walk in silence for a beat.  Then:

                                 CHARLIE
                        So you’re keeping the shirt, huh?

           INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - CUBICLE - MORNING

           In his best suit and tie, Jesse paces, nervous as he quietly 
           rehearses a presentation.  As he runs through his speech, he 
           references a professional looking presentation folder.  A few 
           additional copies sit on his desk.

                                 JESSE
                        In today’s global economy, it’s 
                        imperative for a company to 
                        incentivize and strategize... 
                             (checking notes)
                        To strategize and incentivize its -

                                 DAVE
                        Big Dog!  How they hanging?  And by 
                        they, I am referring to your testi-
                        clees.

           DAVE, 28, leans against the cubicle entrance.  He’s a classic 
           alpha male - slick, sharply dressed and brimming with ego.

                                 JESSE
                        Dave.  Hey.

                                 DAVE
                        You ready for our presentations to 
                        the old farts?
                                 JESSE
                        I think so.  I feel good about the 
                        content of my report - I’m just a 
                        little nervous about reporting it.

                                 DAVE
                        Let me peep your shit.

           Jesse hands him a copy of his presentation folder.  Dave 
           looks over it, flipping through pages.  He’s impressed.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Damn, bro.  This is legit.  You’ll 
                        be walking in there with a big 
                        stout cock.  Only concern is 
                        getting the bitch wet enough to 
                        take it.

           Dave chuckles.  Jesse considers this, a bit disturbed.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        You’re up first today, and that 
                        room’ll be ice cold.  So how ‘bout 
                        I help you out, shoulder the load?

                                 JESSE
                        You’d want to present first?

                                 DAVE
                        Hey, I don’t want to have to follow 
                        this -
                             (holds up Jesse’s folder)
                        And more importantly, I can prime 
                        the crowd.  Get ‘em all slick and 
                        slippery so you can slide on in.

                                 JESSE
                             (disgusted)
                        Oh.  Sure.  Thanks.

                                 DAVE
                        Sweet, bro.  It’s boner time.

           He gives a cocky wink and exits.  Jesse starts to gather his 
           things - not realizing that Dave took the copy of his folder.

           INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - BOARD ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A DOZEN STUFFY SENIOR EXECUTIVES surround a board room table.  
           Jesse and another Junior Guy sit against the wall, nervously 
           awaiting their turn to talk.
                                 EXEC AT PODIUM
                        First up, we’ll be hearing from 
                        Jesse Stratton -
                             (then, off Dave’s wave)
                        Excuse me, David Hemingway.  David?

           Dave takes the podium at the head of the room.

                                 DAVE
                        Morning Gents.  You know, the other 
                        day I was thinking, and it hit me:  
                        In today’s global economy, it’s 
                        imperative for a company to 
                        strategize and incentivize...

           Jesse looks up from his notes.  Is that...?  Is he...?  And 
           the answer is yes to both - Dave is reading off Jesse’s 
           folder, delivering Jesse’s presentation. 

           Jesse is in shock.  He’s breathing heavily, sweating.  How 
           can he stop this?  What can he do?  Should he raise a hand?  
           Shout out and interrupt?  Run up to the podium and - 

           HUGE APPLAUSE.  A standing ovation.  Jesse looks up - it’s 
           over.  Dave gave the entire presentation as Jesse sat there.  
           Dave basks in the glory, shaking hands as he takes his seat.

                                 EXEC AT PODIUM
                        Thank you, David!  That was... wow.  
                        I would not want to have to follow 
                        that.
                             (chuckles, then)
                        Next up, Jesse Stratton.  Jesse?

           Jesse is petrified as all eyes turn to him and stare...

           INT. UNKNOWN BUILDING - LATER

           In a brightly lit building, Jesse relays his story to 
           Charlie.

                                 JESSE
                        And he launches right into my 
                        presentation.  Starts delivering it 
                        right in front of me!

                                 CHARLIE
                        What a prick.  So when you charged 
                        the podium, how did you take him 
                        out?  Uppercut?  Body slam?  Or did 
                        you just put a boot in his dick?
                                 JESSE
                        Charlie, you may not realize this, 
                        but at most jobs it’s a bad idea to 
                        put a boot in a co-worker’s dick.  
                        I don’t know how it is at your job.

           Charlie turns to a PASSING GUY who pushes a cart -

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey Frank - what would you do if I 
                        stole your work? 

                                 PASSING GUY
                        Put a boot in your dick.

           REVEAL we are at a PETCO PET STORE.  Charlie is an employee.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well.  There you have it.

                                 JESSE
                             (still in disbelief)
                        The guy humiliated me.  And I just 
                        sat there.

           Charlie continues his work, sprinkling food into cages.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You need to sack up.  Find your 
                        balls.  Take a page from the 
                        hamsters.
                             (off Jesse’s blank look)
                        Hamsters are violent as fuck.

                                 JESSE
                        I don’t think that’s a widely known 
                        piece of information. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh yeah.  Put a few adults together 
                        and it’s carnage: severed arms, 
                        chewed off faces, stray eyeballs 
                        and rivers of fucking blood...

           Charlie then realizes a YOUNG BOY AND GIRL at the hamster 
           cages are listening to him.  A beat.  The boy starts to CRY.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (sotto to kids)
                        Sorry.  I’m Frank, if someone asks.
           EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           The guys walk home.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What about getting revenge?  I know 
                        a dude who works at an aquarium - I 
                        can get a barracuda.

                                 JESSE
                        And do what with it?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t know, put it in the guy’s 
                        bath.  Does he take baths?

                                 JESSE
                        I have no idea.  Even if he does, I 
                        think he’d notice a barracuda in 
                        his tub.  And wouldn’t a barracuda 
                        die in fresh water?

                                 CHARLIE
                        So we’ll get some salt -

                                 JESSE
                        Okay, Charlie - stop.  You’re not 
                        getting it.  It’s over.  There’s 
                        nothing I can do.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So you’re just going to let him get 
                        away with it?  That’s insane!

                                 JESSE
                        That’s insane.  You want me to go 
                        after him with a giant fish.

                                 CHARLIE
                        A fish that would probably bite off 
                        his penis.  It’s a good plan.

           Jesse ignores this.  They walk in silence for a moment.

                                 JESSE
                        Do you think I should call Kelly?

           Charlie stops walking - he’s so annoyed that he needs a 
           moment to contain his frustration.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And why would you do that, Jesse?
                                 JESSE
                        Say hi.  Maybe she’d want to get a 
                        coffee.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Kelly.  The girl who dumped you 
                        fourteen months ago.  And in your, 
                        I don’t know, nine attempts to 
                        reconnect, has told you: no, not 
                        interested, not happening, please 
                        stop calling, please stop texting, 
                        stay away from my house, why won’t 
                        you leave me alone, and if you come 
                        any closer I’m calling my Uncle who 
                        works for the FBI.  You think she 
                        might like to get coffee.

                                 JESSE
                             (beat, small)
                        Or a scone, or something.

           Charlie shakes his head, trying not to lose it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s it.  That is completely, 
                        officially it.  Jesse, look at 
                        yourself - you’re a giant pussy!  A 
                        gaping, cavernous vagina!  I can’t 
                        take it anymore!
                             (then, determined)
                        I’m pulling you out of this rut.  I 
                        don’t know how, but mark my words, 
                        I am pulling you out - even if I 
                        have to drag you by the testicles.

                                 JESSE
                        I’m a vagina with testicles?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I mixed metaphors.  But I stand by 
                        it.

           Jesse just sighs and checks his watch.

                                 JESSE
                        I should get home.  Catch you 
                        later.

           He starts walking in one direction as Charlie starts in the 
           other.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Night.  Love you.
           Jesse stops and looks back at Charlie... and starts laughing.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        One of these days you’re going to 
                        say it back.  I know it.

           INT. OFFICE CUBICLE - THE NEXT DAY

           Jesse sits at his desk and mindlessly types into a boring 
           spreadsheet on his computer.

           After a moment, he checks to be sure no one is looking and 
           opens a FACEBOOK PAGE.  He clicks to a group of pictures.

           WE ANGLE ON:  PHOTOS of Jesse with a cute girl, smiling and 
           happy - but these pictures are at least a year old.  He 
           stares at them wistfully, memories of a happier time...

           Dave enters and launches right into:

                                 DAVE
                        Okay, here’s the sitch.  I -
                             (then, off the computer)
                        Who’s that chick?  Your sister?

           Jesse closes the page, caught.

                                 JESSE
                        Just... nobody.

                                 DAVE
                        Not bad.  I’d stick her.  
                             (then, back to it)
                        Listen, bro - yesterday, I got a 
                        little carried away.  I was so 
                        jazzed about your presentation that 
                        I went ahead and delivered it 
                        myself.  But stepping on your toes 
                        like that, it was...
                             (steels himself, then)
                        Not the coolest thing I’ve ever 
                        done.

           He sighs, then holds his hands out - so there you have it.

                                 JESSE
                        Uh... thanks?

                                 DAVE
                        You’re welcome.  To be honest, I 
                        did you a favor.  That promotion 
                        they gave me?  You did not want it, 
                        bro.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        I mean yeah, it’s a shitload more 
                        money.  Pretty sweet office, and my 
                        assistant’s hot as fuck - but it’s 
                        a lot of pressure.  And you can’t 
                        handle that, you know?  This 
                        cubicle stuff here, papers and 
                        folders and shit?  That’s your jam.  
                        You’re a wizard at that crap.  So 
                        I’m not looking for a big thank you 
                        or anything, I just want you to 
                        know I got your back.  Cool?

           Jesse glares at him, wanting to say so many things, but:

                                 JESSE
                        Cool.

                                 DAVE
                        Sweet titties, bro.  Keep rockin’. 

           Dave gives an obnoxious wink and walks off.  Jesse sits in 
           silence, feeling like the world’s biggest loser.

           INT. JESSE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Jesse sits in front of the TV, but only half pays attention 
           as he eats a frozen pizza. The TV is on a local news channel:

                                 TV NEWSCASTER
                        ...the third murder of an alleged 
                        crime boss in as many weeks.  
                        Police say they have no suspects.

           There’s a BANG BANG BANG at the apartment door.

           As Jesse gets up to answer it, we HOLD ON THE TV.  

           ONSCREEN:  A 50ish man speaks with reporters.  A caption 
           below reads KENT MCNULTY, CHIEF OF POLICE.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY (ON TV)
                        We’re doing all we can.  But the 
                        simple fact is, a murder in the 
                        world of organized crime makes for 
                        a very difficult investigation... 

           Jesse reaches the door.  Right as he cracks it open, Charlie - 
           DRESSED AS AN LAPD OFFICER - blows in with authority.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Sir, we’ve had complaints of loud 
                        squishing and grunting sounds, as 
                        if someone was violently 
                        masturbating with honey butter.  
                        You mind if I take a look around?

                                 JESSE
                        What the hell is this?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Cop uniform.

           Charlie turns and grins proudly.  His uniform looks 100% 
           authentic.  From boots to badge to a black utility belt with 
           baton and real-looking gun, Charlie is a legit Cop.

                                 JESSE
                        That looks completely real.  Where 
                        did you get it?

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know my friend who works at the 
                        TV studio?  It’s from their 
                        wardrobe department - this is the 
                        same shit they wear on Law & Order. 
                        I’m only missing one accessory: a 
                        partner.

           From behind his back, Charlie presents a SECOND POLICE 
           UNIFORM.  Off Jesse’s confused look:

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s Friday.  Costume party.

                                 JESSE
                        Right.  Forgot.  Look, Charlie, I 
                        appreciate that you’re trying to 
                        get me back out there, but a 
                        costume party?  We’re not twelve.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do you not realize what “costume 
                        party” is?  It’s code for “ladies, 
                        put on something slutty and let’s 
                        get nuts.”  We’re talking about a 
                        parade of tight skirts and slut-
                        boots, garter belts and hosiery, 
                        tiny blouses struggling to restrain 
                        the monstrous breasts crammed 
                        therein.  And tonight, you’re not 
                        Jesse Stratton -  
                             (dangling the uniform)
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                        You’re Officer Rick Hugeballs, 
                        certified badass. The ladies are 
                        waiting, Officer.  Time to cop up.

           Jesse stares at the uniform, considering, and as RAUCOUS 
           PARTY MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY, WE...

                                                                CUT TO:

           A CLOSE UP ON A STUNNING GIRL: long legs, tiny skirt, giant 
           breasts in green overalls, sexy braided pigtails... she’s 
           amazing, a perfect match for The St. Pauli girl...

           INT. APARTMENT COSTUME PARTY - NIGHT

           WHERE WE REVEAL that she is the St. Pauli Girl - or more 
           specifically, a cardboard bar standee of a model for St. 
           Pauli beer.  It’s the only attractive thing in the apartment. 

           This party sucks.  Twenty guys compete for the attention of 
           three homely girls dressed in wildly un-sexy Hobbit costumes.

           To the side of the party, Jesse glares at Charlie, annoyed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did I oversell it?  Feel like I 
                        oversold it.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Jesse and Charlie walk home in their Cop Uniforms, dejected.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay, I’ll admit: that was less 
                        erotic than I was expecting.

                                 JESSE
                        That was less erotic than 
                        hemorrhoids.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, what are hemorrhoids?  I know 
                        they’re bad and you get ‘em on your 
                        ass, but... what are they?

                                 JESSE
                        Probably not worth getting into.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m sorry the party sucked.  But it 
                        was worth a shot.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                        It takes effort to meet girls.  
                        They don’t just magically -

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                        Hey, guys!

           They turn.  THREE GIRLS - very, very attractive girls - wave 
           from across the street.  Baffled by this, Jesse and Charlie 
           point to themselves: us?  The girl smiles.

                                 GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Yes, you.  C’mere.

           Thrilled, the guys hurry over, speed-walking with excitement.  
           Charlie realizes and whispers:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit, we’re going too fast!  We 
                        look overeager.

           They pull back, and begin taking slow, oddly casual steps.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Shit, that was a weird transition.  
                        We look crazy.  
                             (then)
                        Fuck it, just walk.

           The guys arrive at the outdoor bar patio where the three 
           stunning girls sit, and instantly shift into cool-guy mode.

                                 JESSE/CHARLIE
                        Hey there. / ‘Sup. 

                                 GIRL
                        Hey.  What are you guys up to?

                                 JESSE
                        Friday night, what else?  Partyin’.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Partyin’ our dicks off.

                                 JESSE
                        Smokin’ this, drinkin’ that...

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s all good.

           The three girls give a confused look.

                                 GIRL
                        Oh.  Because we think my friend’s 
                        purse was stolen.
           She nods to a fourth friend who quietly sobs a few feet away.

           Jesse and Charlie are silent for a beat, confused.  Jesse 
           then looks to their uniforms and realizes:

                                 JESSE
                        Oh!  And here we are looking 
                        exactly like Cops.  But actually, 
                        we’re not -

                                 CHARLIE
                             (quickly)
                        Too busy to help.  Not too busy at 
                        all.

           Charlie walks to the Crying Girl and puts an arm around her.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, shhh... we’ll find the 
                        sonofabitch who did this.  I swear 
                        it.

           Jesse watches in disbelief as Charlie hugs and holds her.

           MOMENTS LATER:

           Charlie scribbles into a small notepad, then flips it shut - 
           a tough cop getting the facts.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for the info.  We’ll call 
                        you if we find something.  We may 
                        also call if we don’t.

                                 GIRL
                        Thanks Officers.  It’s good to know 
                        you’re out there protecting us.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Just doing our job, ma’am.

           Charlie initiates another hug, and somehow it catches on - 
           soon Charlie and Jesse are hugging all four girls.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        You ladies stay safe.

           Charlie tips his hat, and he and Jesse turn and walk off.  As 
           they go, they share a look... it becomes a grin, then...

                                                              SMASH TO:

           Two pair of shiny black boots.  Over SUPER BAD-ASS MUSIC they 
           march in perfect step.  
           WE TILT UP ON dark pants, dark blue shirts and shiny badges.  
           OFFICER JESSE and OFFICER CHARLIE walk tall, their faces 
           tough and intense.  Pedestrians are quick to step out of 
           their way as they move.  Right now, THEY ARE COPS.

           AN OBNOXIOUS SKATEBOARDING TEEN zips down the sidewalk, 
           heading toward them - Charlie HIP CHECKS HIM INTO A WALL.

           MONTAGE:

           - Officers Jesse and Charlie, in full bad-ass mode, sip beers 
           and talk confidently to a SEXY BARTENDER.

                                 JESSE
                        I wouldn’t say I don’t fear death.  
                        Other people say that about me.

           - The guys take turns trying to slide across the hood of a 
           car like TV Cops - failing in a variety of painful ways.

           - At a different bar, to a different SEXY BARTENDER:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, it was Christmas Eve, but 
                        that skyscraper was filled with 
                        terrorists.  I had to stop them.

           - The guys talk to a GROUP OF TEENS ON BIKES.

                                 JESSE
                        Stay away from drugs.  They’ll ruin 
                        your life.  Well - not pot, that’s 
                        okay.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And you should at least try 
                        ecstacy.  See what all the fuss is 
                        about.

           - Officer Charlie stands at a parked convertible sports car - 
           the BEAUTIFUL FEMALE DRIVER, LATE 30s, looks worried as he 
           examines her driver’s license.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        You blew through the stop sign, but 
                        your real crime is lying - calling 
                        yourself 38 when you’re clearly 24.

           The female driver smiles shyly.

           - Jesse talks with a GROUP OF HOT DRUNK GIRLS:
                                 HOT DRUNK GIRL
                        Hey Officer, can my friend take a 
                        picture of you putting me in cuffs?

                                 JESSE
                        I don’t know, that may be against 
                        regulations.  Charlie?

           REVEAL Charlie, posing for a picture:  One of the girls is on 
           her knees, pretending to scream as Charlie presses his gun to 
           her temple and makes an angry face.  Off Jesse’s question:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hmm?

           - A 19 YEAR OLD KID nervously hurries out of a grocery store 
           with two cases of beer.  He suddenly RUNS SMACK INTO TWO 
           COPS.  Charlie shakes his head - tsk tsk - takes one of the 
           two cases... and the Cops walk off.  The kid is shocked.

           - TWO CUTE GIRLS scribble their phone numbers for the guys.

                                 CUTE GIRL
                        I’ve never gone out with a Cop 
                        before.

                                 JESSE
                        Well, you know what they say: Once 
                        you go Cop, you never... um... 
                             (he’s got nothing)
                        We’re very fun.

           - Jesse and Charlie are laughing as they turn a corner and 
           suddenly - bump into TWO REAL LAPD OFFICERS.  The guys 
           freeze.  The Officers stare them down for a tense beat, then:

                                 LAPD OFFICERS
                        Evening fellas.

                                 JESSE
                        Uh, evening.  Fellas.

           The Officers walk off.  Charlie and Jesse exchange a look - 
           we’re invincible.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           The guys walk home, elated.  Charlie is wasted, holding a 
           beer in one hand and carrying a case in the other.
                                 JESSE
                        That was unbelievable!  Free 
                        dinner, eight phone numbers, 
                        everyone in town kissing our ass...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dude, Cops are the tits!  We should 
                        do this every day, and every night, 
                        forever.  From this day on -
                             (suddenly GASPS)
                        I have an idea.

           He stops in his tracks, dropping the case of beer.  He’s wide-
           eyed, almost dumbstruck by the genius of his plan.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        This is... it’s the greatest idea 
                        I’ve ever had.  It’s so brilliant 
                        it’s making me dizzy.  
                             (chugs his beer, then)
                        C’mon!

           Charlie darts off.  Confused, Jesse slowly follows him to...

           EXT. JESSE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie stands at the passenger side of the car, giddy.

                                 JESSE
                        Why are you standing at my car?

                                 CHARLIE
                        The idea!  We have to drive there!

                                 JESSE
                        We have to drive?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay, you do.  Look, don’t argue.  
                        Don’t think.  Just go, go with the 
                        genius.  Let it take you.  Open up, 
                        get in.  C’mon.  Let’s go.  Let’s 
                        ride...

           Charlie is completely amped.  Jesse sighs, annoyed as he 
           reluctantly hits the power locks to open his car.  We -

                                                                CUT TO:

           A FIST knocking on a door, slowly, authoritatively.
           INT. UPSCALE APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           DAVE - Jesse’s co-worker - opens the door.  A look of concern 
           comes over his face and he subconsciously stands up straight.

                                 DAVE
                        Uh, hi.  Officer.

           OFFICER CHARLIE stands on his doorstep.  He’s in tough cop 
           mode, his eyes intense, his face deathly serious.

                                 CHARLIE
                        David Hemingway?

                                 DAVE
                        Yes sir?

                                 CHARLIE
                        You mind if I come in?  I got a few 
                        questions.

           Dave hesitates, confused at the request, not sure what to 
           say...

           INT. JESSE’S PARKED CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Jesse sits at the wheel of the car.  The passenger door soon 
           opens and Charlie hops in.

                                 JESSE
                        What happened?  Was he there?  What 
                        did you do?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, I went in his apartment.  And 
                        I sort of... tossed it.

                                 JESSE
                        You... tossed it?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah.  I... tossed it.

           FLASHBACK TO CHARLIE AT DAVE’S APARTMENT:  

           Charlie summons Samuel L Jackson as he rages through Dave’s 
           apartment, flipping over furniture, ripping down bookcases...

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Where are the drugs you mother 
                        fucker?!  I want the fucking drugs 
                        right now you piece of shit!
                                 DAVE
                             (terrified)
                        Please, I don’t know what you mean!  
                        You must have the wrong -

           Charlie turns and violently SHOVES Dave over a table, then 
           continues trashing the apartment.

           BACK TO JESSE AND CHARLIE:

           Charlie grins a huge shit-eating grin.  Jesse’s jaw hangs 
           open in shock - but slowly the shock turns to a smile, then a 
           giggle, then he BUSTS OUT LAUGHING.  Both guys laugh 
           hysterically now, tears streaming down.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - LATER

           Jesse drives.  Both guys still laugh as Charlie recounts:

                                 CHARLIE
                        You should have seen his face!  I 
                        thought he was gonna cry!  
                             (impersonating)
                        Please, there are no drugs!  Why 
                        are you kicking a hole in my TV?!

           Suddenly, they pull up to a HUGE TRAFFIC JAM.

                                 JESSE
                        What the hell?  Traffic this late?

           It stretches out in every direction.  Jesse makes a quick 
           turn to bypass it - and they hit TOTAL GRIDLOCK.  A hundred 
           cars, completely stuck.  Even for LA, this is weird.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?  I don’t see an 
                        accident.  No construction.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (shifting in his seat)
                        Uh-oh.  I gotta empty the tank.
                             (an uncomfortable beat)
                        Hey, is it cool if -

                                 JESSE
                        No, it isn’t cool if you pull your 
                        dick out in the front seat of my 
                        car and try to fit a bladder-full 
                        of piss into an empty beer bottle.
                                 CHARLIE
                             (a beat)
                        The back seat?

           Jesse just glares back - not happening.  Charlie squirms as 
           he surveys the surrounding area.  No other choice.

           EXT. JESSE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie walks to the closest bush.  But before he starts to 
           go, he peeks over his shoulder to be sure no one is watching - 
           and spots a 5-year-old kid in a nearby car, staring at him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, c’mon.  What the hell, kid?

           Charlie tries to pee anyway.  He can’t.  He looks back at the 
           kid - he’s still staring.  Charlie tries again... focusing...

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Dammit!

           But can’t make it happen.  He zips up and walks away, giving 
           the kid a middle finger as he walks off.  He angrily mouths:

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you, kid!  You creepy little 
                        shit!  Fuck!  Y-

           Charlie isn’t paying attention as he turns a corner, and -

           CHAOS.

           Flashing lights, police cars everywhere.  At least TWO DOZEN 
           LAPD OFFICERS are in action, and a huge spotlight shines on a 
           nearby building.  This is the cause of the traffic jam.

           It’s a massive raid - the police have stormed a building and 
           haul out COUNTLESS NUMBERS OF THUGS  The situation is still 
           volatile as thugs fight back.  The officers are overwhelmed.  

           Three Officers struggle with A HANDCUFFED FELON.  One of the 
           Cops CRACKS HIM OVER THE HEAD WITH A BATON, KNOCKING HIM OUT.  
           Charlie watches this, stunned.  Suddenly -

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Officer!  Hey!  Get over here!
                        Yes, you!  Get the fuck over here!

           In a daze, Charlie slowly approaches the Officer, who holds 
           up the passed out thug.
                                 POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        This thing’s out of control!  They 
                        had twice the numbers we thought 
                        and the fucking wagon’s nowhere in 
                        sight!  Get this guy to county, 
                        we’ll sort ‘em out later!

           He shoves the dazed felon to Charlie - Charlie catches him as 
           the Officer sprints off.  He looks to his captive: tall, 
           muscular, dark goatee.  Charlie just stands there, terrified.

           INT. JESSE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Jesse sits in traffic when the back door opens.  Someone is 
           thrown in.  Then Charlie gets in the front.  Confused, Jesse 
           looks to Charlie, who stares off blankly, glazed over - then 
           to the back.  A mean-looking guy is passed out on the seat.

                                 JESSE
                        Dude.  What - what did you do?  Who 
                        is that?  Charlie? 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (mumbling, spaced out)
                        S’outta control.  Twice the numbers 
                        we thought.

                                 JESSE
                        What are you talking about?  Who -

           A CAR HORN BLARES from behind.  The civilian traffic is 
           moving as a fresh crop of police cars arrive from the rear.  
           A police car is right behind us, lights flashing.  

                                 POLICE LOUDSPEAKER (O.S.)
                        Move your vehicle immediately!  Get 
                        out of the way!  Now!

                                 JESSE
                        Charlie, what’s going -

                                 POLICE LOUDSPEAKER (O.S.)
                        Get out of the fucking way!

           Jesse pulls forward, and soon he’s moving, nowhere to pull 
           over and figure this out. 

                                 JESSE
                        What’s happening?!

           MOMENTS LATER:
           The car is stopped on the side of a quiet side street.  The 
           guys stand outside.  Eyes closed, Charlie grins in ecstacy as 
           he finally UNLEASHES A MASSIVE FLOOD OF PISS.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t know, man.  He just told me 
                        to take the guy.

                                 JESSE
                        So you did?!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dude, it was total chaos.  Bad guys 
                        swinging, pissed-off cop 
                        screaming... I panicked.

                                 JESSE
                        Charlie, you took a police captive 
                        and put him in my car!  You took a 
                        felon and threw him in my backseat!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes I did.  Sorry.

                                 JESSE
                        Okay, we have to call the police.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And tell them we’ve been running 
                        around town, impersonating Cops for 
                        the last four hours?  No thanks.

                                 JESSE
                        So what the hell do we do?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (thinks, then)
                        Let’s take him in.  We can drive to 
                        the nearest police station, shove 
                        him through the door and duck out 
                        before anyone can question us.  We 
                        made a mistake, but that fixes it.

                                 JESSE
                        “We” made a mistake.  That’s the 
                        word you’re using.

                                 CHARLIE
                        C’mon, the guy’s unconscious and 
                        handcuffed, how hard can it be?

           Jesse considers this, but gets distracted as he realizes 
           Charlie is still peeing.
                                 JESSE
                        Dude, that’s incredible. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know, right?
                             (then, looking down)
                        Those ants are not gonna be happy.

           INT. JESSE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Jesse is rigid and nervous as he drives.  The felon is still 
           sprawled out in the back seat, eyes closed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay, true or false: this is a 
                        little bit cool.

                                 JESSE
                        False.  Big, resounding false.

           Slowly, we notice the FELON’S EYES BEGINNING TO TWITCH...

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re crazy.  We’re taking a bad 
                        guy to jail - that’s real Cop 
                        stuff!  Think about it, that piece 
                        of shit back there?  That filthy 
                        fuck?

           THE FELON SITS UP IN THE BACK SEAT.  Awake.  He looks around, 
           groggy, no idea where he is.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        We’re getting this low-life asshole 
                        off the street.  The city will be 
                        safer once we deliver this dirty no-
                        good cock-

           Sensing something, Charlie turns - and sees THE FULLY AWAKE 
           FELON STARING RIGHT BACK AT HIM.  Charlie is frozen.

                                 JESSE
                        Cock... Sucker?  Smoker?  Holster, 
                        is that it?  Is he a cock holster?  
                        Charlie?

           Off Charlie’s silence, Jesse peeks in his rearview mirror - 
           AND LOCKS EYES WITH THE FELON.  Before Jesse can even gasp, 
           the felon LIFTS HIS LEGS AND WRAPS THEM AROUND JESSE’S NECK.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Whoa!  No!  Stop it!
           As Jesse struggles, his flailing legs hit the gas - the car 
           lurches ahead, swerving.  Charlie tries to break the felon’s 
           leg-lock choke-hold.

                                 JESSE
                        Get... him... off!

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m trying, his legs are like 
                        pythons!  Okay, that does it!

           He grabs the nearest weapon he can find - A ROLLED UP 
           MAGAZINE - and repeatedly smacks the felon over the head:

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        No!  Bad!  Stop it!

                                 JESSE
                        Charlie... dying...

                                 CHARLIE
                             (as he keeps whacking)
                        I got a Men’s Health Magazine, 
                        Jesse, I’m doing the best I can!

           Charlie then spots the felon’s exposed ankle flesh.  What the 
           hell:  HE TAKES A DEEP BREATH AND BITES, LATCHING ON LIKE A 
           PIT BULL.  The felon CRIES OUT, squeezing Jesse tighter.  

           Jesse’s eyes roll back into his head.  The CAR CRASHES INTO A 
           TREE.

           EXT. QUIET ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           All three guys are motionless, dazed.  Gradually, the felon - 
           still cuffed - inches to the door and finds the handle.  A 
           second later he’s out.  Jesse and Charlie come to, stunned.  

           Charlie unbuckles his seat belt and opens the door.

                                 JESSE
                        What are you doing?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Going after him.

                                 JESSE
                        Are you crazy?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jesse, we just set a criminal free!  
                        What if he goes and hurts somebody?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                        That’s on us, we fucked up.  We 
                        have to fix it.

           Charlie steels himself, then SPRINTS OFF.  A beat.

                                 JESSE
                        I object to this abuse of the word 
                        WE!
                             (then)
                        Oh man...

           And Jesse reluctantly steps out of the car.

           EXT. SUBURBAN LOS ANGELES - MOMENTS LATER

           The felon runs, stumbling, limited by his hands cuffed behind 
           his back.  Charlie sprints after him, with Jesse bringing up 
           the rear.

           Jesse catches up to Charlie, and they’re running in step - a 
           real pursuit, like real Cops.  They share a look: this is 
           incredible!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop!  Police!

                                 JESSE
                        Freeze, asshole!  LAPD!

           They chase the felon through a row of backyards, jumping over 
           fences, sandboxes and picnic tables.  Dogs bark, homeowners 
           and their families watch on in shock.  

           The felon is fast, but with each stumble the Officers gain 
           ground - in a semi-remote area, a quiet patch between 
           neighborhoods, they finally catch up and TACKLE THE FELON 
           FROM BEHIND.  All three guys go sprawling to the ground.  

           Slowly they get to their feet and face each other, panting.  
           A long, silent beat.  Jesse looks to Charlie: what now?  
           Charlie looks back: I’m not sure.  Finally:

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re under arrest.

                                 FELON
                        I was already under arrest.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, well... you still are.

           The Felon curiously looks them over.  Then, to Jesse:
                                 FELON
                        You’re not a Cop.

                                 JESSE
                        Hey, why did you single me out?

                                 FELON
                        Turn around and go home.  Or stay 
                        here and get fucked up.

                                 JESSE/CHARLIE
                        Yessir, turning. / Bring it.

           Jesse looks to Charlie - what the hell are you doing?!

                                 CHARLIE
                             (to Jesse, sotto)
                        It’s cool, we got this.  He’s just 
                        making threats ‘cause he knows we 
                        can take him.  We’ll come at him 
                        from different angles, okay?  When 
                        I charge, you charge.  Got it?

           Jesse reluctantly nods, and they begin to slowly approach the 
           waiting felon.  As they close in, Jesse keeps a careful eye 
           on Charlie...

           Charlie HEAD FAKES - but doesn’t go.  Off the fake, JESSE 
           CHARGES, barrelling ahead full speed.  The felon swiftly 
           kicks him in the gut.  Jesse drops to the ground.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh... shoot.  Jesse?  You okay?

                                 JESSE
                             (rolling in agony)
                        What... the fuck... Charlie...

                                 CHARLIE
                        I am so sorry, I was trying to head- 
                        fake and I sort of... flinched.  
                        That’s on me, Partner.  Seriously.

                                 FELON
                        One down.

           The felon grins.  Charlie glares at the smirking felon.  He’s 
           pissed.  He scans the area, spots an old 2x4 and grabs it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay, dick fuck.  Let’s do this.

           Charlie closes in, swinging at him with the 2x4. 
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s right.  Who’s tough now?  
                        And this is just the rain, asshole - 
                        you’re about to get the thunder.

           He raises the 2x4 high in the air - and the felon explodes, 
           charging his shoulder into Charlie’s mid-section.  Charlie 
           goes flying and lands on his back.

                                 FELON
                        Was that the thunder?  ‘Cause I 
                        wasn’t sure if -

           Jesse NAILS HIM, tackling him to the ground.  As they wrestle 
           in the dirt, Charlie finds an old beer bottle and SMASHES it 
           over the felon’s head.  The felon rolls onto his back, dazed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Actually, that was the thun-

           The felon sweeps Charlie’s legs.  Charlie goes down again.  
           The felon LEAPS TO HIS FEET and turns, looking for Jesse -

           WHACK!  Jesse catches him with a 2x4 to the face.  The felon 
           goes down.  He’s out.  A long beat, and they slowly realize:

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit... we did it.  We did it!

                                 JESSE
                        Hell yeah!  We whooped his ass!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Whooped it good!
                             (they hi-five, then)
                        When we tell this story, let’s not 
                        mention that he was in handcuffs.

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah, definitely not.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - RAID SITE - NIGHT

           Police finally have the situation contained.  An unmarked 
           police car screeches up and a tough-looking 50ish man in a 
           suit, Gary Oldman-esque, steps out.  CHIEF MCNULTY - the man 
           from the TV interview - storms over to a Senior Officer.

                                 SENIOR OFFICER
                             (instantly worried)
                        Chief McNulty!  Evening, Sir.  Glad 
                        you’re here.  We, uh -
                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        Fucked up.  You were told not to 
                        move until I arrived.

                                 SENIOR OFFICER
                        Sir, we were taking position around 
                        the building, and someone inside 
                        must have spotted us.  We saw 
                        activity, they were mobilizing.  I 
                        made the call to move in.

           The Chief glares at him, then moves to check out the felons.  
           He looks them over, then marches back to the Senior Officer.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        Where are the rest?

                                 SENIOR OFFICER
                        Sir?  Everyone we grabbed is here, 
                        or they’ve been shipped to County -

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        I just spoke to County.  The man I 
                        want isn’t there.

           McNulty holds up a PHOTO: a mug shot of the felon Charlie 
           tossed in Jesse’s car.  He walks down a line of officers, 
           showing the photo.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY (CONT’D)
                        We got a tip from inside, we know 
                        he was in the building.  So where 
                        is he?

                                 YOUNG OFFICER
                             (timidly)
                        Sir?  I saw him.

           The Chief marches over to the Young Officer, the Cop who 
           handed the felon to Charlie.  He seems intimidated, a rookie.

                                 YOUNG OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        I cuffed him myself.  I put him in 
                        the custody of the other Officer...
                             (looking for Charlie, 
                              worried)
                        But... I don’t see -

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        Where the fuck is this man?!

           The Chief is red-faced, furious.
           EXT. DARK, QUIET AREA OF LOS ANGELES - LATER

           The guys finish tying a dirty old rope around the groggy 
           felon’s legs.

                                 JESSE
                        You ready to do this?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s take out the trash. Or - take 
                        it in.  That didn’t work, but, yes.

           The felon is dazed, but still conscious.  As they start to 
           drag him away, he’s slowly coming to, realizing where he is.

                                 FELON
                        Wait... stop... you can’t take me 
                        to the Cops... they’ll kill me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, they’ll mess you up alright.  
                        Might whip your ass even worse than 
                        we did.

                                 FELON
                        No.  Not like that.  Literally 
                        killed.  Shot in the head, dead.

           Jesse and Charlie stop, thrown by this.

                                 FELON (CONT’D)
                        You don’t know what you stumbled 
                        onto tonight.  That wasn’t just a 
                        raid on some thugs.  It was a 
                        massive operation to get one man - 
                        me.  Because I know something I’m 
                        not supposed to know.  Something 
                        the Cops can’t allow to get out.  
                        And they’ll kill me to keep it 
                        quiet.

           Charlie GASPS.  He’s fully sold.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How can we help?

                                 JESSE
                        Charlie!  Don’t be an idiot, he’s 
                        full of shit.  We’re not helping 
                        him.

                                 FELON
                        Actually, you are.
                                 JESSE
                        Actually, we’re not.  You’re not 
                        calling the shot-

                                 FELON
                             (forceful)
                        I am now.  Because if you don’t do 
                        exactly as I say I’ll make sure all 
                        my nastiest pals know I was turned 
                        in by Jesse Stratton, a junior 
                        analyst at Wilson and Stern who 
                        drives a shitty Ford Taurus, 
                        supports the Sierra Club, and 
                        sleeps alone in Unit 209 of the 
                        Fairview Apartments on Wilshire 
                        Boulevard.

           The felon lets this sink in for Jesse.

                                 FELON (CONT’D)
                        Now let’s loosen this rope, 
                        partners.

           EXT. RUN-DOWN AREA OF LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           They drive through a dark, scary row of abandoned homes.  
           Jesse glares ahead, pissed.  Charlie leans over the backseat, 
           enthralled by everything about his new friend COLIN.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Colin, how did you know that stuff 
                        about Jesse?  Where he lives, where 
                        he works?

                                 COLIN
                        There’s a lot of mail back here.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dude... you’re fucking smart.  But 
                        how did you know he slept alone? 

                                 COLIN
                        Just assumed. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (laughs)
                        Nice!  You’re right, he gets like, 
                        zero ass.
                             (off Jesse’s look)
                        Just making conversation.
                             (then back to Colin)
                        So why do the Cops want to kill 
                        you?
                                 FELON
                        The last few years I’ve been 
                        employed by a... businessman.  A 
                        criminal businessman.  Kevin Best. 
                        He controls a lot of activity in 
                        town - just not as much as he’d 
                        like.  A month ago he hooked up 
                        with a new partner and began 
                        systematically eliminating his 
                        competition.  That partner is the 
                        Chief of the LAPD.  They’re using 
                        Cops as a private hit squad, 
                        cleaning up the streets with 
                        executions.  And I can prove it.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (staring, awed)
                        Your five o’clock shadow is like, 
                        off-the-charts cool.  Do you use an 
                        electric or a blade? 

           EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Jesse’s car sits in front of an abandoned one-story house.  
           It’s falling apart, all broken windows and rotted wood.

           Jesse and Charlie exit the car.  Jesse opens the back door 
           for Colin, and as Colin gets out and stands, he and Jesse 
           share a long, tense stare.  

           Colin walks to the house with Charlie following, but Jesse 
           stops - something is wrong with his car.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You coming?

                                 JESSE
                             (crouching at a tire)
                        Go ahead, I’ll be right there.

           At the door, Charlie gets a serious look, then dramatically 
           KICKS it open.  He draws his gun and disappears inside.

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        Police!  Get down!  Do it now!  
                        I’ll blow your fucking head off!
                             (then, poking head out)
                        Just kidding.  There’s no one here.

           Colin rolls his eyes and follows Charlie in.  The second 
           they’re inside, Jesse takes out his cell phone and dials.
                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        911 Operator.

                                 JESSE
                             (quietly)
                        I need to talk to the LAPD.

           INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The place is old, wet and rotten.  Colin nods to a corner 
           that’s obstructed by wood and trash.

                                 COLIN
                        There.  Under the floorboards.  
                        Third one from the left.

           Charlie looks at the spot.  He’ll be putting himself in a 
           vulnerable position.  He hesitates, then turns back:

                                 CHARLIE
                        I want to get something straight, 
                        Colin:  I’ve taken your story at 
                        face value.  Accepted your words as 
                        truth, because I trust you and I 
                        want to help you.  So if I get down 
                        to reach that board and you ambush 
                        me... if you smash my face into the 
                        wall, or kick a shard of wood in my 
                        gut and rupture my spleen... I’m 
                        going to be very disappointed in 
                        you.

                                 COLIN
                        Noted.

           EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Jesse speaks quietly but urgently into his cell phone.

                                 JESSE
                        He threatened me into bringing him 
                        here.  Says he has a tape tying the 
                        Chief of Police to a murder scheme 
                        or something...  I don’t trust this 
                        guy, I just want him taken in.

           INTERCUT TO:

           Jesse has been connected to CHIEF MCNULTY.  Still at the 
           scene of the raid, he listens to Jesse while communicating 
           something to a Cop in a parked patrol car.  Into phone:
                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        You were smart to call us, Jesse.  
                        Our officers on the way.

           The Chief hangs up his phone and thinks a moment.  The Cop in 
           the patrol car looks up to him.

                                 OFFICER
                        Sir?  The officers you requested 
                        are three miles from this address.  
                        But we have a patrol car in the 
                        vicinity.  Should I send them?

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        No, don’t send anyone else.  I need 
                        the right men on this.

           The Chief walks off.  The Officer watches him go, confused.

           INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Jesse enters - and finds Charlie standing behind Colin, 
           trying to help him squeeze out of his cuffs.

                                 JESSE
                        What the hell are you doing?!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Trying to get his cuffs off.  That 
                        tape’s a fascinating listen, check 
                        it out.

           Charlie nods to a table.  Jesse walks over and sees a micro 
           casette tape recorder.  He hits play, and we hear:

                                 MAN 1 (ON TAPE)
                        ...take out Martinez next.  Once 
                        people know he’s gone his business 
                        will start flowing to me -

                                 MAN 2 (ON TAPE)
                        Already on it.  We got one of his 
                        guys to roll over, he’s getting us 
                        access to Martinez’ home tonight...

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s the head of the LAPD getting 
                        a hit list from a crime boss!  
                        They’ve got police executing people 
                        and getting paid a shitload for it.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                        Colin was about to turn that over 
                        to a federal judge - the Cops won’t 
                        hesitate to kill him, and anyone 
                        else who knows about this!

           Jesse suddenly feels panicked and nauseous.

                                 JESSE
                        Hey, let’s uh... we should leave.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What is it?

                                 JESSE
                        Nothing, just - we should go.  Now.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why?  What’s going on?

                                 COLIN
                        He just called the police.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No he didn’t, Jesse wouldn’t go 
                        behind my back.  We’re Partners.  
                        And Partners always -

           Then they hear it - A SIREN APPROACHING.  Charlie sighs.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Dick move, dude.  Dick move.

           EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           As they sprint to Jesse’s car, Charlie shouts, livid -

                                 CHARLIE
                        I can’t believe you!  I don’t know 
                        if I’ll ever forgive you for this!  
                        That was a betrayal of staggering -

           Charlie slides across the hood of Jesse’s car - and 
           BEAUTIFULLY STICKS THE LANDING.  He’s stunned.  And thrilled:

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit!  Did you see that, 
                        Jesse?!  I fucking nailed it!

                                 COLIN
                        Way to hold a grudge.

           MOMENTS LATER:
           Jesse drives slowly through the dark stretch of abandoned 
           homes.  Oddly, the sirens are gone.  It’s eerily calm.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did we lose them?  I think we lost 
                        them.  Hot damn, I think we -

           SUDDENLY a police car pulls right in front of them, blocking 
           their path - Jesse slams hard on the brakes and Charlie’s 
           face SMACKS HARD INTO THE DASHBOARD.

           MOMENTS LATER:

           Jesse and Charlie walk side by side in a dark field, staring 
           off into the distance.  Charlie has an introspective look.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Funny, I can’t recall the last time 
                        I looked up at the stars.  So 
                        magnificent, and yet, we take them 
                        for granted.  Kinda like 
                        friendship.
                             (a long beat)
                        You know I love you, right?

                                 JESSE
                        Don’t do that.  You’re so weird.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re weird.  Three words, and you 
                        can’t say them.  Even now, when 
                        we’re about to die. 

                                 JESSE
                        You don’t know that for sure.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sir?  Are we about to die?

           REVEAL A BIG POLICE OFFICER walking behind them, gun in hand.  
           They’re in a dark, secluded area behind the abandoned homes.

                                 OFFICER 1
                        Yeah.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Told you.

           INT. PARKED POLICE CAR - SIMULTANEOUS

           Still at the row of abandoned homes, Colin sits helplessly in 
           the back of a parked patrol car.  Officer 2 - an African-
           American Cop - sits in the front seat, smoking a cigarette.
                                 OFFICER 2
                        Colin, Colin, Colin.  You thought 
                        you were gonna get away with this.  
                        Didn’t you?

                                 COLIN
                        Obviously yes.  Why else would I 
                        have done it?

                                 OFFICER 2
                             (a beat, stumped)
                        Colin, Colin, Colin.

           EXT. DARK AREA BEHIND ABANDONED HOME - SIMULTANEOUS

           Jesse and Charlie continue to march at gunpoint.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Maybe you weren’t hugged as a baby, 
                        I don’t know.  I wasn’t there. 

                                 JESSE
                        What is wrong with you?!  How are 
                        you talking about this right now?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I bet this guy tells his Partner he 
                        loves him.  And he’s a dirty Cop.

                                 OFFICER 1
                        Hey - I don’t care for that term.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I apologize, is there something 
                        more P.C.? 

                                 OFFICER 1
                        Shut up.  Stop here.  Think this is 
                        far enough from the neighbors.

           They stop walking.  The Cop COCKS HIS GUN and looks around, 
           making sure there are no witnesses.

                                 JESSE
                        Oh my God.  This is it.  We’re 
                        going to die.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And yet you still can’t say it.  
                        Unbelievable.
                             (to the Cop)
                        Sir?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                        Back me up here, do you love your 
                        Partner?  You’re about to kill us, 
                        so we won’t tell anyone.

                                 OFFICER 1
                             (an annoyed sigh)
                        Yes.  Okay?  I love my partner.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ha!  See?  He loves his Partner!

                                 JESSE
                        Charlie, he’s about to shoot us!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Then you better start talking!

           Jesse is baffled.  And Charlie is oddly irate, getting in his 
           face.  The Cop is also perplexed, moving to shut Charlie up -

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, fine!  If you can’t say it 
                        even now?  When we’re about to die?  
                        Then I want to be shot!  Because I 
                        don’t want to live in a world where 
                        my best friend can’t even -

           WHACK!  In one lightning-quick motion, CHARLIE WHIPS THE 
           BATON OFF HIS BELT AND CRACKS THE COP ACROSS THE FACE.  

           The Cop hits the ground.  Out.  Jesse is stunned.

                                 JESSE
                        Holy shit!  Charlie, that was 
                        awesome!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sun-Tzu once said, “war is 
                        deception.  We are most able to 
                        attack when we appear unable.”

           He leans down to grab the COP’S GUN, then:

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Seriously, why can’t you say it?

           INT. PARKED POLICE CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Officer 2 continues to taunt Colin.

                                 OFFICER 2
                        McNulty will be here soon.  And 
                        he’s gonna dice your ass up.

                                 OFFICER 2 (CONT'D)
                        Then fillet it.  Then toss it in a 
                        pan and flambe that sh-

                                 CHARLIE
                        We get it, you have the Food 
                        Network, shut up.

           Charlie leans in the window, A GUN RIGHT IN THE COP’S FACE.

           MOMENTS LATER:

           Officer 2 is irate as he lays on his stomach on the street.  
           Hands shaking, Jesse nervously cuffs the Officer’s arms 
           behind his back while Charlie keeps his gun on him.

                                 OFFICER 2
                        You don’t know who you’re fucking 
                        with!  I swear, I’m gonna find you, 
                        and when I do -

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shut up, dick hole.  You’re a 
                        disgrace to your kind.
                             (then)
                        To Cops, I mean.  Not black people.  
                        There’s nothing racial about this.

                                 JESSE
                        Even though you were going to kill 
                        us, I still feel obligated to 
                        apologize for this.

                                 OFFICER 2
                             (menacing)
                        Don’t worry.  I’ll get you back.  
                        Promise.

           He shoots Jesse a vicious glare.  Terrified, Jesse finishes 
           with the cuffs and moves away.

           As Jesse and Charlie walk to the Patrol Car, Officer 2 
           realizes something - Jesse DIDN’T GET HIS CUFFS LOCKED.  He 
           slowly slips a hand free, stealthily REACHING FOR HIS 
           HOLSTER...

                                 JESSE
                             (sotto to Charlie)
                        Dude, how are you so calm?  I’m 
                        losing my shit here. 

           Charlie chuckles, super cool as he tosses the gun back and 
           forth between his hands.  Officer 2 reaches, fingers INCHES 
           FROM HIS OWN GUN...
                                 CHARLIE
                        Jesse, my friend, “cool” is a just 
                        state of -

           BLAM!  THE GUN GOES OFF IN CHARLIE’S HANDS.  Officer 2 cries 
           out as a bullet fires straight into his butt cheek. 

                                 OFFICER 2
                        Aghhh!  You mother fucker!  You’re 
                        dead!  You’re fucking dead!

                                 CHARLIE
                        We should go.

           INT. PARKED POLICE CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Jesse and Charlie hurry into the car, with Colin still in the 
           back.  Jesse sits behind the wheel - then suddenly realizes:

                                 JESSE
                        Wait, why did we get in the Cop 
                        car?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Because we’re Cops?

                                 JESSE
                        No we’re not!  I’m not stealing a 
                        Cop car!

                                 COLIN
                        Jesse, drive!  Now!

                                 JESSE
                        Don’t yell at me!  My car is right 
                        there.  Why steal a car when we -

                                 COLIN
                             (staring out the back)
                        FUCKING DRIVE!

           Jesse looks in his rearview - as it’s SHATTERED BY A BULLET. 

           OFFICER 2 IS UP AND FIRING.  Jesse SLAMS ON THE GAS.  Bullets 
           rip into the car as they speed off, swerving wildly.

           INT. STOLEN POLICE CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Now in a more populated part of town, the guys sit at a red 
           light, silent and shell-shocked.  Finally:
                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay, true or false -

                                 JESSE
                        False!  This is not awesome!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Really, not awesome?  Said the guy 
                        driving the police car?

                                 JESSE
                        Charlie, Cops are after us!  They 
                        want us dead!  We can’t even - 

           SUDDENLY - a convertible of cute girls pulls up next to them.

                                 JESSE/CHARLIE
                             (instantly cool)
                        Ladies. / ‘Sup. / Lookin’ good...

                                 COLIN
                             (also super cool)
                        Where’s the party?

           The light turns green and the girls drive off.  A beat - and 
           Jesse and Charlie turn to Colin.   He was acting like an 
           idiot too?  Colin shakes his own head in disbelief.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Okay, your stupidity is wearing off 
                        on me.  We can’t be macking on 
                        chicks when we’re driving around in 
                        a stolen... cop car.
                             (realizing)
                        Shit.  This is a stolen cop car.  
                        Shit!  These have GPS, they’ll know 
                        exactly where we are!  We have to 
                        get out of here, now.  Right now.  
                        We have to -

           Jesse THEN SEES ANOTHER POLICE CAR driving at a normal speed 
           in the opposite direction - not pursuing them.  However...

                                 JESSE
                        Shit!

           Spooked, Jesse SLAMS ON THE GAS.  THEIR CAR TAKES OFF.

                                 COLIN
                        What the hell are you doing?!  We 
                        have to get out of here!

                                 JESSE
                        I’m trying!
                                 COLIN
                        No you idiot, out of here!  Away 
                        from the police car!

                                 JESSE
                        I saw it!  It’s coming!

           Jesse watches the rearview mirror for the other Cop car.  It 
           starts to turn... making a U-turn to follow them?  Jesse 
           doesn’t want to find out - he accelerates even faster.  

           Soon they’re blowing through lights and intersections - THEY 
           NARROWLY AVOID GETTING SIDESWIPED.

                                 COLIN
                        Jesse, what the fuck?!  We have to 
                        get away from the car!  This car!

                                 JESSE
                        Stop yelling!  I’m freaking out!  I 
                        am freaking out!

           Jesse is almost hyperventilating as they speed ahead. Charlie 
           subtly grins as he FLIPS ON THEIR FLASHING LIGHTS AND SIRENS.

                                 COLIN
                        Jesse, STOP!  We can’t - who turned 
                        on the fucking siren?!  Charlie!

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s a matter of public safety!

                                 COLIN
                        JESSE WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!

                                 JESSE
                        Freaking out!  I am freaking out!!!

           THE POLICE CAR FLIES DOWN THE STREET, SIREN SCREAMING AND WE -

                                                                CUT TO:

           The guys slowly, carefully unbuckle their seat belts and take 
           a delicate step out of the police car.  Which is currently -

           INT. TACO BELL - NIGHT

           The car is literally INSIDE A TACO BELL.  All the way inside.  
           Jesse drove right through a giant window.  Charlie shows his 
           badge to a dozen stunned late night diners.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Nothing to see here, folks.  Relax 
                        and enjoy your food.  Hey, Chalupa - 
                        good call.  Next time try the 
                        cinnamon twists.

           MOMENTS LATER:

           Colin and Jesse sit in the back of a new car, calm and quiet.

                                 COLIN
                        So was there a specific thought 
                        going through your head?  A degree 
                        of logic, however skewed, to 
                        explain what you were doing?

                                 JESSE
                        Well, I was... freaking out.

           REVEAL the three guys in the car of a A FRIGHTENED TEENAGE 
           KID, one of the Taco Bell diners.  As the kid drives, Charlie 
           sits shotgun, playing super cool:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Being a Cop isn’t all car chases 
                        and shootouts.  There’s also a lot 
                        of sex.  A lot of sex.

           EXT. QUIET SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - MOMENTS LATER

           They guys step out of the kid’s car.  He drives off.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay, next time we need a car, I’m 
                        commandeering one.  Bumming a ride?  
                        What kind of Cops are we?

           Charlie angrily bites into a taco.  Jesse surveys the area, 
           confused, and turns to Colin:

                                 JESSE
                        Why did you have the kid drop us 
                        off here?

                                 COLIN
                        If you’ll recall, before our 
                        unscheduled trip to taco town, we 
                        were trying to expose some crooked 
                        Cops.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (laughs, mouth full)
                        Trip to taco town.  Sounds dirty.
                                 COLIN
                        And the Judge who was going to help 
                        me with this - 
                             (holds up his tape)
                        Lives on this block.

           The guys wait for Colin to lead the way - but for some reason 
           he isn’t walking.  He’s having doubts.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        But something’s been bothering 
                        me... I made arrangements to hand 
                        this tape over tomorrow.  For the 
                        Cops to risk that raid tonight, to 
                        ambush a group of armed thugs in a 
                        crowded part of town, they must 
                        have known this was their one 
                        chance to get me.  Which means 
                        someone told them.

                                 JESSE
                        How many other people knew what you 
                        were doing?

                                 COLIN
                        Two.  So either the judge wasn’t as 
                        honorable as I thought - or...

           Colin trails off, not wanting to consider the second option.

           EXT. UPSCALE SUBURBAN MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           They stand in a dark area across the street from the giant 
           house.

                                 COLIN
                        As a teenager I was in this guy’s 
                        courtroom more times than I count.  
                        He was a good man, kept giving me 
                        second chances to turn my life 
                        around.  I obviously didn’t take 
                        them.  
                             (then)
                        I had to get this tape to someone 
                        important - someone I knew would do 
                        the right thing.  When I contacted 
                        the judge and told him what I had, 
                        he promised to help.  I have to 
                        know if I can still trust him.

                                 JESSE
                        How are you going to find that out?
                                 COLIN
                        I’m not.

           The implication is clear: they are.  The guys react: us?

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        I can’t confront him myself.  If 
                        he’s the guy who sold me out, he 
                        won’t admit to that.  But when two 
                        Cops show up on his doorstep at 
                        1AM, he’s going to let them in and 
                        listen to what they have to say. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        And then we kick his ass?

                                 COLIN
                        What?  No.  How would that help?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t know.  It’s an option.  
                        We’ll keep it on the table.

                                 COLIN
                        Tell him: “We have Colin.  It’s 
                        under control.”  If he’s the guy 
                        who turned on me he’ll be relieved 
                        to know I’ve been caught.  If he’s 
                        not, he’ll be confused, and scared.  
                        Because the two Cops in his house 
                        are probably there to kill him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And then if things get out of hand -

                                 COLIN
                        Charlie, there is no scenario in 
                        which you kick the judge’s ass.  
                        None.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Whatever.  This is a stupid plan.

           As Charlie and Jesse start approaching the Judge’s house:

                                 COLIN
                        One more thing - he has to believe 
                        you’re Cops.  So act like Cops.

           EXT. SUBURBAN MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Jesse rings the bell.  As a light comes on upstairs, Jesse 
           tries to psyche himself up:
                                 JESSE
                        Okay, I can do this.  I’m a Cop, 
                        I’m a Cop, I’m a Cop, I’m a Cop.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What are you doing?

                                 JESSE
                        Telling myself I’m a Cop.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, I hear the words, I’m just 
                        not buying them.  Dude, don’t say 
                        it - be it.  Get it in your head, 
                        you’re Dirty Harry.  John fucking 
                        McClane.  If you don’t believe it, 
                        how will anyone else?

                                 JESSE
                        If it’s that easy, let’s hear you. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Me?  You’re asking me if I’m a 
                        Police Officer?

                                 JESSE
                        Yes, I -

                                 CHARLIE
                             (with sudden intensity)
                        You’re damn right I am!  I’m LAPD, 
                        asshole!  A mother-fucking Cop!  A 
                        bad-ass, take-no-shit -

           The door opens and A DOG LUNGES AT THEM, furiously barking.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (recoiling)
                        Ah!  Dog!

                                 JUDGE
                        Sprinkles!  No.

           Sprinkles is a TWO POUND MALTESE with a pink bow.   The JUDGE 
           - mid 60s, wearing a bath robe - yanks the dog back.

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, no need to be afraid of her.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (macho voice)
                        No, obviously.  I’m just allergic.  
                        Back the fuck up, Sprinkles.
           EXT. LOS ANGELES - ROW OF ABANDONED HOMES - NIGHT

           A small group of new Cops have arrived.  Chief McNulty glares 
           angrily at Officer 1 and Officer 2 - Officer 2 leans against 
           a patrol car, pants at his ankles while an EMT tends to his 
           ass.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        So our target is handcuffed in the 
                        back of your car - and you let two 
                        civilians immobilize you, steal 
                        your weapon, and take him back?

                                 OFFICER 1
                        Sir, maybe these guys aren’t as 
                        dumb as they look.

           The Chief looks over a copy of Jesse and Charlie’s goofy 
           driver’s license photos - they both look extremely dumb.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        I don’t get it.  On paper they’re 
                        just a couple of dipshits.  No 
                        criminal record, no connection to 
                        Colin.  And they’re running around 
                        in police uniforms?  Why?

                                 OFFICER 2
                        I know this much - you don’t shoot 
                        a man in the ass for no reason.  A 
                        move like that means someth-AHH! 
                             (pained, turns to EMT)
                        What the hell!  What’s the deal?!

                                 EMT
                        Well, you have a bullet in your 
                        ass.  So... that.

           INT. SUBURBAN MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Jesse and Charlie follow the judge inside.

                                 JUDGE
                        You’ve come to my home at 1AM so 
                        I’ll assume this is important.

                                 BOTH GUYS AT ONCE
                        Yes Sir, it -

           They stop, then look to the other - okay, you say it.  Then:

                                 BOTH GUYS AT ONCE (CONT’D)
                        Yes Sir, it -
           They can’t get it together.  They angrily gesture back and 
           forth: let me say it.  No, I’ll do it.  Okay, go.  Finally:

                                 JESSE
                             (blurts out)
                        Yes it is important Sir!
                             (then, his Cop voice)
                        Here’s the deal, Judge.  We are 
                        Cops.  And we - well, obviously 
                        we’re Cops.  I mean, look at our 
                        uniforms, right?  Probably didn’t 
                        need to say it.  And, as Cops, we -

                                 JUDGE
                        I’m sorry, I need a drink.  Pardon 
                        me.

           The Judge moves into a nearby study.  Charlie sighs.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I may have to put in a request for 
                        a new partner.

                                 JESSE
                        Okay, that was not my best work.  I 
                        can admit that.

           The guys turn to peek at the study.  They’re still able to 
           see the Judge as he stands at a bar.  Confused, they whisper:

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Why does he suddenly need a drink?  
                        Because he’s afraid of us?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Not necessarily.  I think that’s 
                        just what old guys do.  They hang 
                        out in bathrobes and drink.
                             (then)
                        I think I’m looking forward to 
                        being old.  That sounds awesome.

           Jesse sees some wall photos and moves to check them out.

                                 JESSE
                        You keeping an eye on him?

                                 CHARLIE
                        He’s pouring a scotch.  One ice 
                        cube.  And he’s swirling it.  And 
                        swirling it.  And... swirling it. 

                                 JESSE
                        Whoa, he knows Shaquille O’Neal.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah?

           Charlie goes to check out the picture: the judge stands on a 
           golf course, smiling alongside Shaquille O’Neal.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, what weighs more: a full-
                        grown badger... or an average dump 
                        from Shaq?

                                 JESSE
                        Male or female badger?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Male.

           IN THE STUDY, we ANGLE ON the Judge’s face as he stares into 
           his drink.  He’s scared.  The swirling is a nervous stall.

                                 JESSE
                        I’m gonna say badger.

           THEN, we enter the POV of someone else - moving stealthily as 
           they sneak up behind the judge.  The judge turns, and -

           THWIP-THWIP-THWIP-THWIP!  A silenced gun fires into the 
           Judge’s chest.  The assassin - dressed in black, wearing mask 
           and gloves - slips out the study’s patio door.  Gone.

           IN THE HALLWAY, Charlie and Jesse still look at the photo.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re crazy, Shaq-dump’s way 
                        heavier.  Look at it this way: the 
                        average turkey leg -

                                 JESSE
                             (suddenly noticing)
                        Where’d he go?

           The Judge isn’t at his bar.  They exchange a worried look and 
           hurry to the study.  They stand in the doorway, confused. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where is he?

           They take a step in to examine - JESSE WIPES OUT.  His legs 
           slip out and he lands hard on his back.  Charlie cracks up.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, dude!  You should have seen 
                        that, that was incredible!  Your 
                        legs literally OHHHH...
           Charlie covers his mouth in horror.  The thing Jesse slipped 
           on was a GIANT POOL OF BLOOD.  Laying on his back, Jesse 
           turns his head and sees the judge on the floor - his face 
           pale white, eyes wide open in shock, dead.  Jesse SCREAMS.

           OUTSIDE THE HOUSE:  The assassin, walking away, freezes - did 
           he just hear something?  He sits still, listening...

           BACK IN THE STUDY, Charlie immediately jumps on Jesse, a hand 
           clamped over his mouth to silence him.  Jesse’s face 
           continues to make a screaming motion but no sound escapes.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        Shhhh!  Quiet!  
                             (as Jesse freaks out)
                        Jesse, calm down!  Whoever did this 
                        may still be here!

           Jesse still thrashes wildly - and then we see why.  Charlie’s 
           knee is planted square in Jesse’s crotch, SQUASHING HIS NUTS.

           OUTSIDE THE HOUSE:  The assassin, hearing nothing further, 
           continues walking.  

           BACK IN THE STUDY:  Jesse continues thrashing, freaking out.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Shhh!  I know you’re scared, 
                        Partner.  I’m scared too.

           Jesse looks like he may actually die.  Charlie has no idea.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        But it’s cool.  Look at me.  See 
                        how cool I am?  Ice tea, baby.  See 
                        my face?  See the coolness I’m 
                        putting out? Feed off that, try to -

           Jesse gets a hand free and PUNCHES Charlie.  Charlie falls 
           onto his back.  Jesse writhes in pain, trying not to scream.  
           He rolls on his side, grabs Charlie and yanks him face to 
           face, their noses touching.  Face red with fury, Jesse gasps:

                                 JESSE
                        YOU HAD.  YOUR KNEE.  ON MY NUTS.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ohhh... that makes sense.  I was 
                        wondering why I couldn’t calm you 
                        down.  You were really freaked.
           Jesse lets go and both guys roll onto their backs.  They lay 
           there a moment - then suddenly remember they’re in a pool of 
           blood.  They exchange a look, then jump to their feet and 
           tear out of the room, their slick shoes slipping as they go.

           EXT. SUBURBAN MANSION - LATER

           Colin waits in the darkness when two figures approach.  Jesse 
           and Charlie walk toward him in an odd, deliberate fashion, 
           but he can’t yet see them clearly.

                                 COLIN
                        Guys?  What is it?  What happened?

           As they step into a patch of moonlight -

                                 CHARLIE
                        There was an incident.

           Colin’s eyes go wide - their faces are SMEARED WITH BLOOD. 

                                 COLIN
                        Run!

           THEN, FURTHER DOWN THE STREET, WE FIND:

           The Judge’s killer calmly walking away from the house.  He’s 
           a pro, nonchalantly removing his mask and gloves as he slips 
           away.  He’s BIG AND SCARY LOOKING - someone we’ll remember.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           The three guys are hunched over, out of breath from running.

                                 COLIN
                        He was out of your sight for one 
                        minute - and then he was dead?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Super dead, I don’t know how much 
                        blood is in the human body, but 
                        every drop of his was on the floor.

                                 JESSE
                        I don’t get it - if the judge was 
                        the guy who turned you in, why 
                        would the Cops kill him?

                                 COLIN
                        They wouldn’t.  It wasn’t him.  
                        FUCK!
           Colin suddenly looks anxious and rattled.  Jesse and Charlie 
           exchange a look - what’s going on?

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I need to get these fucking 
                        cuffs off.  Now.

           Colin marches off, pushing into a wooded area.  The guys 
           shrug and follow.  As they go, Jesse looks at Charlie, his 
           face covered in blood.

                                 JESSE
                        You look like Carrie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Carrie who?

                                 JESSE
                        Carrie.  As in, Carrie.  The movie.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (a beat)
                        Sex and The City?

           MOMENTS LATER:

           Colin pushes through a wooded area as the guys follow.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I only saw the first one.  Was 
                        there some big bloodbath in part 2?

                                 JESSE
                        Yes Charlie, you look like Sarah 
                        Jessica Parker from the bloodbath 
                        scene in Sex and The City 2.  The 
                        girls were shoe shopping in Dubai 
                        when a camel exploded.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Seriously?

                                 COLIN
                             (turns back and snaps)
                        Can you dumbfucks shut up for one 
                        minute?!  Do you even know what’s 
                        happening?  The judge is dead 
                        because of me!  And now there’s no 
                        one I can trust with this tape 
                        which means the odds of us dying 
                        tonight are suddenly very fucking 
                        good!
           Colin turns and keeps moving.  The guys follow in silence, 
           scolded.  After a moment, he turns back:

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Look... I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t 
                        have called you dumbfucks.  You are 
                        dumbfucks.  But I shouldn’t have 
                        called you that.  Even though you 
                        are.  So... whatever.

           He turns and keeps walking.  After a moment, Charlie speaks 
           up delicately:

                                 CHARLIE
                        So who was it?  Who turned you in?

                                 COLIN
                             (sighs, troubled)
                        My cousin.  Mike and I grew up 
                        together, went to school together, 
                        dropped out together... and started 
                        working for the boss together.  I 
                        knew if I turned the boss in, 
                        anyone working for him would go 
                        down as well.  So I told Mike to 
                        cut ties and leave town by 
                        tomorrow.  Guess he didn’t.

           They step out of the wooded area and into -

           EXT. WEALTHY SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           They move down the quiet street, careful to stay hidden.

                                 JESSE
                             (humbly)
                        Hey, um... just wanted to tell you 
                        guys that... I’m in now.  I think 
                        we’re doing the right thing.  And 
                        I’m sorry I called the Cops.  I 
                        should’ve trusted you, Colin.

                                 COLIN
                        No, you shouldn’t.

                                 JESSE
                        What do you mean?

                                 COLIN
                        I mean why would anyone believe a 
                        word from the mouth of a desperate, 
                        handcuffed police captive?  You’d 
                        have to be a complete fucking idi-
                                 (MORE)
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                             (then, catching himself)
                        I mean... thanks, Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, no prob.

                                 JESSE
                        So what’s the plan here?

                                 COLIN
                        People this rich usually have more 
                        than one home.  So some of these 
                        will be empty.
                             (scans the houses, then)
                        That one.

           Colin starts toward a house up the street.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s amazing.  He’s like a “who’s 
                        home and who’s not” psychic.

                                 JESSE
                        Or just a criminal.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           They creep up.  Suddenly a FLOOD LIGHT shines on them.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit!

           Charlie DIVES head first into a row of hedges.  But they’re 
           dense, and he only gets a foot in - his head and neck are 
           simply lodged in the bush. 

                                 COLIN
                        Motion sensor.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (still in the bush)
                        Yeah, that makes sense.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           They stand outside a back door that leads to a kitchen.

                                 COLIN
                        Break the window.

                                 JESSE
                        With what?
                                 COLIN
                        Well, you could check the pool, see 
                        if they have any rocks.  You know 
                        that smooth, decorative kind that 
                        often adorn a pool perimeter? 

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah.

                                 COLIN
                        Or you could quit being a pussy and 
                        use your fist.

           Jesse smirks, then, determined to prove himself, takes off 
           his outer shirt, wraps his fist and presses it to the glass.  
           He focuses, takes a few slow practice punches, then... steps 
           back.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Gonna look for rocks?

                                 JESSE
                        Just a quick peek.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           A rock smashes through the window.  Jesse reaches in and 
           unlocks the door.  They enter.

                                 COLIN
                        Okay, first thing -

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll check.

           Charlie opens the fridge, grabs a beer, and chugs the entire 
           can in one sip.  He finishes with a contented ahhh...

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s a yes.  They have beer.

           He tosses a beer to Colin - it hits his chest and falls.

                                 COLIN
                        Now, ordinarily I would have caught 
                        that. But given that I’m currently -

                                 CHARLIE
                        Handcuffed!  Right.  Duh.

                                 COLIN
                        Let’s hit the garage.
           Charlie follows after Colin, but Jesse hangs back.

                                 JESSE
                        Hey, um... I’ll meet you in a sec.
                             (off their looks)
                        I have to poop, okay?

                                 CHARLIE
                        He’s an anxiety shitter.  When 
                        things get too crazy, watch out.

                                 COLIN
                        I really hit the jackpot with you 
                        two, didn’t I?

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie has an array of tools out.  Currently he tries to get 
           through the cuffs with a hacksaw.  Colin looks very worried.

                                 COLIN
                        For the record, I’d rather have the 
                        cuffs stay on than my hand cut off.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Relax, I know what I’m doing.

                                 COLIN
                        Did you know what you were doing 
                        when you shot that cop in the ass?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Touche.

           Charlie saws away for a beat.

                                 COLIN
                        Why do you smell like guinea pigs?

                                 CHARLIE
                        You mean hamsters.  Why do I smell 
                        like hamsters.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jesse drops his pants and takes a seat - no need to close the 
           door.  He thinks, processing.  His cell phone RINGS.  
           Startled, he finds it and timidly answers:

                                 JESSE
                        Hello?
           INTERCUT TO:

           EXT. TACO BELL - SIMULTANEOUS

           Chief McNulty stares at the POLICE CAR inside the restaurant.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        Jesse, I’m confused.  I thought you 
                        and I had an agreement.

                                 JESSE
                        Is this... Chief -

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        McNulty, yes.  And even though you 
                        drove a police car into a Taco Bell 
                        and shot one of my men in the ass -

                                 JESSE
                        Actually, that was Charlie -

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        I’m going to give you one more 
                        chance to help me.  If you tell me 
                        where Colin is now, I’ll forget I 
                        ever heard your name.  If you 
                        don’t, Jesse Stratton of 1520 North 
                        Wilshire, I’ll find you and I’ll 
                        kill you.  So what’ll it be?

           Jesse is speechless, no idea what say.  Then, A GASP.

           A 15 YEAR-OLD BOY stands in the doorway, stunned as he glares 
           at Jesse.  A beat... and he runs.  Jesse’s phone falls 
           between his legs and SPLASHES INTO THE TOILET.

                                 JESSE
                        Shit!

           Jesse jumps up.  Does he get the phone or go for the kid?  He 
           looks from the phone, to the hall, to the phone, to the hall -

           McNULTY stares at his phone.  Jesse has hung up.  He turns to 
           a Cop who types into the dashboard computer in his squad car.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        Anything?

                                 OFFICER
                        Got tech on it now, they should be 
                        able to locate his phone in a few 
                        minutes.
           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The young kid is in hysterics as he talks to SIX TEENAGE 
           FRIENDS, GUYS AND GIRLS.  Lights down, they drink beer and 
           smoke.

                                 KID
                        I’m serious!  Five-oh right there 
                        in the bathroom, droppin’ a D!

                                 KID 2
                        Dude, whatever.  There’s no way a 
                        Cop just snuck in the house and 
                        walked upstairs to drop a -  

           The bedroom door FLIES OPEN - Officer Jesse stands there.  
           The kids FREAK.

                                 KIDS
                        AGH!  FIVE-OH!  FIVE-OH!

           They scatter, steamrolling Jesse as they flee.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           A few broken tools lay on the ground at Charlie’s feet.  He 
           now tries a set of bolt cutters on the cuffs.  And he’s still 
           talking up a storm - Colin has gone mind-numb.

                                 CHARLIE
                        ...and ever since then, I get 
                        sexually aroused when I hear the 
                        sound of a ping pong game.

                                 COLIN
                             (flat, barely listening)
                        Uh-huh.  Really interesting.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, so why did you do it?  Risking 
                        your life to get all this evidence 
                        on your boss?  What happened?

           Colin hesitates - this isn’t something he wants to discuss.

                                 COLIN
                        It’s a long story.

                                 CHARLIE
                        C’mon - sharing’s a two-way street.  
                        You need me to talk more about 
                        myself?
                                 COLIN
                             (quickly)
                        So I got this call.  Six weeks ago.  
                        Ex-girlfriend on the east coast, 
                        hadn’t seen in years, contacts me 
                        out of the blue and says: guess 
                        what?  You have a son.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You sure it’s yours?  Bitches will 
                        pull shit like that when they want 
                        a man.  They’re devious.

                                 COLIN
                        You talking from experience?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.  But I hear stuff.

                                 COLIN
                        I’m sure.  And believe me, if she 
                        was lying to rope in a quality dad, 
                        I’m not the guy.
                             (then)
                        At first I wanted to forget she’d 
                        even told me.  But I couldn’t get 
                        it out of my head.  Found myself 
                        thinking about heading east to meet 
                        the kid.  Maybe even start over.  
                        But in my line of work, when a guy 
                        takes you under his wing, he 
                        expects to keep you there.  Somehow 
                        my boss heard about the kid.  So he 
                        sat me down and made it clear if I 
                        tried to skip town, he’d kill me.  
                        And he doesn’t make empty threats.  
                        I was stuck.  So when I stumble 
                        onto this plan of his and see a way 
                        to get him off my back for good, 
                        fuck a few dirty cops in the 
                        process, I had to take it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I once had a boss once who made us 
                        clock out when we had to pee.  He 
                        actually refused to pay us for the 
                        minute and a half we’d be pissing.

                                 COLIN
                        So you get where I’m coming from.

           The chain connecting the two cuffs suddenly SNAPS.
                                 CHARLIE
                        I did it!

           Colin stretches his arms out and rubs his wrists, a feeling 
           of incredible relief.

                                 COLIN
                        Thanks, Charlie.  I owe you one.

           Charlie grins and sticks his arms out for a hug.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Bring it in, my man.

                                 COLIN
                        Don’t try it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t fight it.

                                 COLIN
                        I’m not kidding.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m not either.  Don’t be afraid.  
                        Surrender to friendship.  It’s not 
                        wrong.

                                 JESSE (O.S.)
                        Guys?

           Jesse stands in the doorway with a worried expression.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Is it a good thing or a bad thing 
                        if we accidentally took a hostage?

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           They stare at a 15 YEAR OLD GIRL, gagged and tied to a chair.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit, Jesse.  Gagged and bound.  
                        Look at you getting all hardcore.

                                 JESSE
                        Her friend popped in when I was on 
                        the crapper, I didn’t know what to 
                        do!  She was the only one I caught.
                                 COLIN
                             (crouching down to her)
                        Hey.  Don’t worry, we’re not going 
                        to hurt you.  I need to take your 
                        gag off to ask you a question.  Do 
                        you promise not to scream?

           She nods yes.  Colin reaches for the gag, then hesitates.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Now, we all know how this usually 
                        goes.  You say you won’t scream, I 
                        pull the gag off, you scream, and I 
                        have to put the gag right back on.  
                        You think we can bypass all that by 
                        you just not screaming?

           She nods.  As Colin slips the gag off, she opens her mouth - 
           they flinch.  But there’s no scream.  She looks Colin over:

                                 15 YEAR OLD GIRL
                        You’re fucking hot.  I’m Sara.

                                 COLIN
                        Uh, hi.  Is there anyone else in 
                        the house, Sara?

                                 SARA
                        No, they bolted ‘cause of 5.0 here.

                                 JESSE
                        I found them upstairs.  Drinking 
                        alcohol and smoking narcotics.

                                 SARA
                        Fuck you, Pig.  My parents are out 
                        of town.  What do you care?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wow, this girl is sassy.

                                 JESSE
                        We’re not Cops.  Believe it or not, 
                        we’re outlaws.

                                 SARA
                             (scoffs)
                        Yeah, you look like it.
                             (then to Colin)
                        I mean, you do.  You look totally 
                        bad.  Are you bad?  You look bad.

           She winks and makes pouty lips at him.
                                 COLIN
                        Okay, you need to stop doing that.

                                 SARA
                        You can steal whatever you want, I 
                        don’t give a shit.  Can you untie 
                        me so I can fix a pizza?

           MOMENTS LATER:

           Colin is stone-faced, a serious moment.

                                 COLIN
                        The only way to protect ourselves 
                        is to get this tape to someone in 
                        law enforcement.  Someone we can 
                        trust.  Until we do, these Cops 
                        will keep coming for us.  And they 
                        won’t stop until we’re dead.

           REVEAL Jesse and Charlie, listening intently - FROM INSIDE A 
           RUNNING SHOWER.  They’re in their boxer shorts, scrubbing 
           blood off their hands, necks, and faces.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        It’s hard to talk serious with guys 
                        who are showering together.

                                 JESSE
                        We’re not showering together - 
                        we’re showering at the same time.  
                        Don’t make it weird.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Can one of you get my back?  I got 
                        this one spot that I just can not 
                        reach.

           MOMENTS LATER:

           The guys towel off.  Sara enters and drops their wrinkled 
           police uniforms on the floor.

                                 SARA
                        I rinsed them out in the kitchen.  
                        It looks like an elephant had its 
                        period in the sink.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (laughs)
                        Oh my God, that’s disgusting!  How 
                        are you this cool? 
           She just shrugs.  Jesse and Charlie start to sort through 
           their uniforms, when Charlie suddenly GASPS.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, shit!  I know who can help us.

           Amazed at the idea, Charlie turns and looks at Jesse.  It 
           takes a moment, but soon Jesse gets it.

                                 JESSE
                        What?  No.  Charlie, I can’t.  You 
                        said to never call again. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is different!  This isn’t 
                        casual stalking - this is, like, a 
                        weird sign.  Cosmic serendipity or 
                        something.  You have to call Kelly.

                                 COLIN
                        Kelly?

                                 JESSE
                        She’s sort of my... ex.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jesse was totally in love with her, 
                        all googly-eyed and fagsy, but she 
                        broke his heart.  He cried for a 
                        month, it was pathetic.

                                 SARA
                        And the award for lamest guy ever 
                        goes to...

                                 CHARLIE
                             (laughs at Sara, then)
                        In his defense, she was pretty hot: 
                        cute face, great smile, and her 
                        tits were like, blam.  Not the 
                        biggest you’ve ever seen, but 
                        really good sized, perfect shape -

                                 JESSE
                        How is this necessary?

                                 COLIN
                        I’d like to hear more.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Anyway, in addition to shapely 
                        boobs, she has an Uncle who works 
                        at the FBI.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                        And he’s a big swinging dick, like 
                        top guy at the LA office.

                                 JESSE
                        Roger Marks.  He’s an Executive 
                        Director, I think.

                                 COLIN
                        I’ve heard that name.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And the FBI is federal, as in not 
                        connected to the LAPD.  We just 
                        have to get Kelly to set us up with 
                        him - he hears that tape and I 
                        guarantee he’ll protect us!  Wow, 
                        who’s smart as shit?  That’s right - 
                        Charlie’s smart as shit.

           Proud of himself, Charlie looks to Colin - what do you think?  
           Colin considers, not sure about this...

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Or, we could go with the brilliant 
                        plan you guys came up with.  And 
                        what was that again?

           MOMENTS LATER:

           Jesse is visibly nervous as he holds the house phone.  The 
           receiver is in his hand, but he’s not dialing.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, you can do it.  Make the 
                        call.

                                 JESSE
                        I will, just... give me a second. 
                        This isn’t easy.  This was my dream 
                        girl.  The girl I thought I would 
                        marry.  Til the day she ripped out 
                        my heart, ate it, then shit it back 
                        out like a bad piece of chicken.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (moved)
                        That was haunting.

           Colin approaches Jesse, sympathetic.

                                 COLIN
                        Hey, I’ve been there.  Heartbreak 
                        is a bitch.  Rips your guts out. 
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                        You know what else rips guts out?  
                        Bullets.  Fired by Cops.  Who are 
                        working very, very hard to kill us.

           Jesse nods and takes a deep breath, steeling himself.  He 
           dials the number, then waits as it rings...

                                 JESSE
                        She won’t be thrilled I’m waking 
                        her up at 2 in the morning.  Hope 
                        she’s not too mad.  Probably been 
                        asleep for hou-

           A BLAST OF DANCE MUSIC SUDDENLY BLARES OUT OF THE PHONE.  
           Even from several feet away, Charlie, Colin and Sara flinch.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                             (shouting into phone)
                        Uh... Kelly?!  K- Kelly?!  Can you - 
                        This is - hello?!  Kelly?!  It’s J- 
                        Hello?!  Can you -

           The phone goes dead - Kelly has hung up.  The room is quiet 
           again.  

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        She, uh... wasn’t asleep.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No?  You sure?

                                 JESSE
                        Pretty certain, yes.  I couldn’t 
                        make anything out.  I don’t know 
                        where she is.

           They think for a moment.  Charlie stands - an idea.  He walks 
           to a nearby laptop computer and types a few keystrokes.

                                 CHARLIE
                        She is... here.  And - oh my - 
                        she’s wearing that.

           Charlie spins the laptop, and we - 

           ANGLE ON: Kelly’s Facebook page.  A status update shows a 
           photo of Kelly in a sexy outfit at a giant dance party.

                                 SARA
                        What a slut.
                                 JESSE
                        Hey!  She’s not a slut, she -
                             (then, seeing picture)
                        Okay, that’s a provocative dress.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (as he types)
                        Charlie... “likes” this.

           Charlie emphatically hits enter, then pops up from his chair.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Now then.  Shall we rave?

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The three guys are in a BAD-ASS SPORTS CAR, with Colin at the 
           wheel, Jesse shotgun, and Charlie in back.  Sara stands and 
           leans into the driver’s window.

                                 COLIN
                        Thanks, Sara.  I’m sure your Dad 
                        has insurance -

                                 SARA
                        Like I care.  I hope he freaks out 
                        and shits his chinos.  So you want 
                        to get my number?  Call me some 
                        time?

                                 COLIN
                        Uh, no.  Thanks though.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll take it.
                             (off their looks)
                        What?  For when she’s older, I 
                        mean.  It wouldn’t hurt to stay in 
                        touch, establish a rapport.  And 
                        maybe in five or six years...

           Colin backs the car out of the garage.

                                 COLIN
                        That’s messed up, Charlie.

           INT. BAD-ASS SPORTS CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Colin drives, the car now a block away from Sara’s house.
                                 CHARLIE
                        ...and maybe that sounds weird, but 
                        if you can look me in the eye and 
                        tell me she wasn’t the least bit 
                        hot, then fuck you, you’re lying.

           Jesse and Colin chuckle.  Suddenly, TWO POLICE CARS AND ONE 
           UNMARKED CAR speed toward them.... and zoom right by.

                                 COLIN
                        What the hell?

           A moment later, the last car, the unmarked car, SUDDENLY 
           STOPS.  It sits perfectly still as Colin watches it in his 
           rearview mirror.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Did either of you use a cell phone?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.

                                 JESSE
                        No.
                             (then, remembering)
                        Oh... fudge.  Did I forget to 
                        mention that the Cops called me?

           The unmarked car makes a hard turn, coming after them.  Chief 
           McNulty FLASHES HIS LIGHTS and speeds to catch up with them.

                                 COLIN
                        Yes you did.  Hang on. 

           Colin GUNS IT.  The car takes off. 

           BEGIN AWESOME CAR CHASE:

           McNulty is right on their ass, making moves to pull alongside 
           them.  Colin aggressively swerves to block.  Charlie flies 
           from one side of the backseat to the other.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing back there?!

                                 CHARLIE
                             (flying to one side)
                        Sorry never got my -
                             (flying to the other side)
                        Seatbelt on!

           They speed on when suddenly - THE TWO POLICE CARS APPEAR, ONE 
           BLOCK AHEAD, SPEEDING RIGHT AT THEM.  Nowhere to turn.  Colin 
           keeps driving full speed as the police cars close in.
                                 JESSE
                        Uh... Colin?  They’re not stopping.

                                 COLIN
                        No they aren’t.  And neither are 
                        we.

           Colin accelerates.  The two Cops get closer and closer, on a 
           direct collision course with us when... Colin SWERVES OFF THE 
           ROAD, INTO A FRONT YARD, and keeps going.  

           McNulty’s car is bearing down on the police cars - he calmly 
           SPEEDS RIGHT BETWEEN THEM, splitting them.  Both police cars 
           make a hard turn to avoid him and crash into a ditch.

           INT. POLICE CAR - SIMULTANEOUS

           OFFICER DAVIS - the black Cop Charlie shot in the ass - sits 
           behind the wheel of his car, stunned that McNulty just ran 
           him off the road.

                                 OFFICER DAVIS
                        What the fuck, McNulty?!

           He tries to back out of the ditch, but his tires just spit up  
           mud.  He thinks for a moment, pissed... then picks up his 
           cell phone - not his police radio - and makes a call:

                                 OFFICER DAVIS (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  It’s Davis.  Yeah, they’re 
                        here, but... McNulty’s lost it.  
                        Might be time for you to step in.

           BACK IN THE CHASE:

           Colin drives through front yards, tearing up lawns, weaving 
           through fountains and statues, a suburban obstacle course.

                                 JESSE
                             (freaking out)
                        Oh man - oh no - oh geez - oh dear 
                        oh dear - OH!  DEER!

                                 COLIN
                        You know what would help, Jesse?

           Colin PLOWS OVER a decorative family of DEER. They go flying.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        If you could get your inner-grandma 
                        to grab a quick nap.  Thanks.
           McNulty is pissed, laser focused as he speeds down the 
           street, keeping pace right alongside them.  

           Colin is approaching a massive brick wall between two yards, 
           no way around it.  And McNulty is blocking their access to 
           the street.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Colin, wall.  Wall.  Wall.  Wall!

           They get closer and closer to impact and -

           Colin makes a hard turn into the street, slamming into 
           McNulty and pushing onto the asphalt - McNulty pushes back.  
           Colin is now driving half on the road, half off, PLOWING OVER 
           MAILBOXES.  Then -

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Brick box!  Brick box!

           Charlie points to a BRICK MAILBOX in their path.  Colin slams 
           hard into McNulty, forcing his way onto the street.  

           The cars drive side by side, scraping each other.  Jesse 
           looks out his window - McNulty stares right back at him, 
           their faces a few feet apart.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        Hello, Jesse.

           McNulty POINTS HIS GUN at Jesse.  Jesse lets out a girly:

                                 JESSE
                        AHH!  GUN!

           Colin SLAMS McNulty as he FIRES, throwing off his aim.  The 
           bullet flies into their car and out the windshield.  Still 
           right alongside them, McNulty calmly takes aim again.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        MORE GUN!  MORE GUN!

           Colin SLAMS him, again throwing McNulty off as he FIRES.  
           McNulty calmly takes aim at Jesse a third time, when -

                                 CHARLIE
                        HEY SHIT-BIRD!  EAT LEAD!

           Charlie points his gun out the window at McNulty and FIRES - 
           but nothing happens.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh.  Guess that’s the fake gun.  
                        Where did I put the real one?
           Pissed, McNulty turns his gun on Charlie, aims and -

           COLIN SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.  

           McNulty didn’t realize they were nearing the end of the road - 
           a stop sign and a T-intersection.  His car flies through the 
           intersection, screaming toward a house.  

           He hits the brakes as his car tears into the yard and PLOWS 
           RIGHT INTO A FRONT PORCH.  He throws the car in reverse, but 
           his wheels spin.  Stuck.

           INT. BAD-ASS SPORTS CAR - SIMULTANEOUS

           The guys take a moment to catch their breaths.  As Colin 
           slowly turns the car around, they’re treated to a view of the 
           chaos and demolished yards they’ve left in their wake.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well then.  Fuck you, suburbia.

           INT. MCNULTY’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           He slams his fist, furious.  A moment later, his cell phone 
           RINGS.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        What?!

                                                           INTERCUT TO:

           INT. NONDESCRIPT OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

           KEVIN BEST, 50.  Colin’s boss calmly paces, phone to his ear. 
           He’s quietly intimidating, but is more conservative and 
           buttoned-up than we might have imagined. 

                                 BEST
                        My my, that doesn’t sound like a 
                        happy Chief.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        What is it, Best?

                                 BEST
                        I was hoping for a status update, 
                        but I think I just got it.  I take 
                        it our man has eluded you?

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        I’m working on it -
                                 BEST
                        Are you?  Because I told you 
                        exactly where Colin was tonight - 
                        all you had to do was walk in and 
                        get him.  And you fucked up.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        No, you fucked up!  The second you 
                        allowed your man to bug your office 
                        you fucked us both!

           Best takes a moment, absorbs this... then, perfectly calm:

                                 BEST
                        This is merely a courtesy call.  
                        Letting you know I’ve put my own 
                        people on this.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        Best, stay out of my way!  If you 
                        turn this into a big fucking mess 
                        that I have to clean up, I -

           CLICK.  The phone goes dead.  Best has hung up.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - MOMENTS LATER

           McNulty limps down the trashed street.  He passes one of the 
           ditched police cars.  An Officer stands outside, sheepish.

                                 COP
                        They, uh, got away, Sir.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        Hey, thanks.  Hadn’t noticed.  
                        Fucking idiot.

           INT. BAD-ASS SPORTS CAR - LATER

           The guys drive away from the scene of the chase, slowly 
           catching their breaths.  After a long moment of silence:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay, true or false: that was awe-

           AN SUV VIOLENTLY SMASHES INTO THEM. 
           It came screaming in like a guided missile, plowing into the 
           driver’s side of the car.  They go spinning, finally CRASHING 
           INTO A CEMENT POST in a gas station parking lot.

           The car is totalled.  For several moments the guys sit 
           silent, still.  Colin bleeds from his head.  He and Jesse are 
           barely conscious.

           Charlie, less hurt than the others, looks to the SUV twenty 
           feet away.  He glares, pissed.  Between coughs:

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Someone’s getting... a ticket.

           He opens his door to get out.  Colin tries to speak:

                                 COLIN
                        Ch-  Char-  Don’t -

           But Charlie is out the door.

           EXT. GAS STATION PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie limps over, a pissed off Cop.  The SUV’s windows are 
           tinted dark black - he can’t see inside as he angrily raps on 
           the driver’s window. 

           The window slowly rolls down...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do you have any idea how fast -
                             (seeing the driver)
                        You... are... wow.

           The FEMALE DRIVER is stunningly beautiful, 30s, with jet 
           black hair and bright red lips.  She gives a sexy smile.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Well hey there.  What’s got you all 
                        smiley?

           She beckons Charlie to come closer, then whispers, lusty:

                                 WOMAN
                             (a German accent)
                        Beiss.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m sorry - ice?

                                 WOMAN
                        Beiss...
                                 CHARLIE
                        You want rice?

           She waves a finger, seductively beckoning him closer.  
           Charlie leans in, their faces inches apart... she SHOUTS:

                                 WOMAN
                        BEISS!!!

           AN ATTACK DOG COMES FLYING OUT HER WINDOW. 

           IT KNOCKS CHARLIE ONTO HIS BACK.  A massive German Shepherd 
           stands on his chest, viciously snarling and snapping.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Agh!  No!  Bad dog!  Bad dog no!

           He has a hand on the dog’s neck, holding back its snapping 
           jaws, but the dog is strong and pushing closer, closer...

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        ZEETZ!

           The dog INSTANTLY SITS - perfectly calm, even cute.  
           Confused, Charlie looks to the source of the command.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Colin?

           The SUV door opens and THE WOMAN STEPS OUT.  Charlie’s eyes 
           go wide - she’s giant, six feet tall, hugely busty and wears 
           a skin-tight black outfit.  She’s like a Bond villain.

           Then, the SUV’s passenger door opens.  Charlie’s jaw drops.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Holy... fuck.

           Something inhuman steps out.  GIANT FOOTSTEPS march slowly 
           toward Colin and Jesse.

           INSIDE THE SPORTS CAR:

           Through the cracked windshield, Jesse sees the monster.

                                 JESSE
                        What the hell is that?!

                                 COLIN
                        My cousin.

           COUSIN MIKE, an absolute mountain, grabs a loose corner of 
           the windshield and RIPS IT CLEAN OFF THE CAR.
           With one hand, he lifts Jesse out of the car and tosses him 
           next to Charlie.  (We may recognize Mike as the assassin who 
           killed the Judge.)

           Colin’s door opens and Colin spills out, badly hurt.  He’s on 
           hands and knees, coughing.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Hey there... Mike...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Boss told me to bring you in, Cuz.

           Mike DRAWS A GUN.  Colin tries to stand, but can’t - he gets 
           halfway up but repeatedly falls.

                                 COLIN
                        Don’t much... want to go in... Cuz.

           Mike watches as Colin pathetically stumbles. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you could... cut me a 
                        break... let it slide... or even -

           COLIN EXPLODES UPWARD, CLOCKING MIKE IN THE JAW - a brutal 
           uppercut.  A beat... and Mike tips over like a tree.  He 
           lands with a THUD, out.  His gun falls to the ground.

           Colin stands.  Still hurt, but not as hurt as he let on.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes!  Fuck yeah, Colin!
                             (to the woman)
                        Suck it, lady!  He’s okay!  So you 
                        got noth-

           The TWO BACK DOORS OF THE SUV OPEN.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           TWO TOUGH-LOOKING ASIAN TWINS emerge from the SUV - as they 
           approach Colin, TWIN 1 calmly pulls out a gun and FIRES.  
           Colin dives out of the way as bullets nip at his heels.

                                 TWIN 1
                        Best has asked us not to kill you 
                        without the tape.

                                 TWIN 2
                        But we can blow your knees apart if 
                        you won’t hand it over.
           Twin 2 pulls out his own weapon.

                                 TWIN 1
                        We fire in three -

                                 TWIN 2
                        Two -

                                 TWIN 1
                        One -

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        FREEZE, ASSHOLES!

           The Twins turn - Charlie is standing behind the Giant Hot 
           Woman, an arm around her waist, HIS GUN AT HER HEAD.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Drop your guns.

                                 TWIN 1
                        No... why don’t you drop yours.

           He points his gun at Charlie - A RED LASER SCOPE appears 
           between Charlie’s eyes.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hmm.

                                 JESSE 
                        Actually, how ‘bout you drop yours.

           Jesse nervously points his gun - his fake gun - at Twin 1.

           A standoff.

           Muscles tense.  Eyes dart.  

           We may notice Colin HAS SPOTTED SOMETHING.

           Twin 1 glares at Charlie, studying his eyes.

           Jesse tries his best to look calm and cool.

           Charlie nervously grips Giant Hot Woman (GHW), a hand on her 
           stomach as he squeezes her tight.

           Colin stares at MIKE’S GUN - on the ground, a few feet away.  
           With the right distraction he could maybe -

                                 GHW
                        Ugh!  Pervert mother fucker!

           GHW angrily shifts away - Charlie’s BONER was poking her ass.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Sorry!  Weird time to get excited, 
                        I - 

           COLIN MAKES HIS MOVE, LUNGING FOR THE GUN.

           IN THE SPAN OF TWO SECONDS: Colin grabs the gun and SHOOTS 
           TWIN 2, dropping him.  Twin 1 turns, FIRING at Colin, as 
           Colin dives behind a gas pump.  GHW ELBOWS Charlie’s face, 
           sending him reeling.

           Colin and T1 fight at close range, throwing fists, trying to 
           raise their weapons for a clean shot.  

           GHW grabs Charlie, lifts him over her head and throws him - 
           he goes flying and CRASHES STRAIGHT THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW 
           OF THE SUV, landing inside the car.

                                 JESSE
                        Charlie!

           Jesse CHARGES, THROWING HIS SHOULDER INTO HER - and he may as 
           well have hit a brick wall.  He bounces off her and hits the 
           ground.  GHW pulls Jesse to his feet, looks him over, and 
           LAUGHS.  Pathetic.

           Pissed, JESSE REARS BACK AND PUNCHES HER IN THE FACE.  

           For a moment, he’s completely stunned - he can’t believe he 
           did that.  He punched a girl. 

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        I am so sor-

           WHAM!  She clocks him in the face, then unloads with an 
           onslaught of punches...

           Colin and T1 have both dropped their weapons, fighting now 
           with fists alone...

           INSIDE THE SUV:  

           Charlie lifts his head and finds himself staring at SOMETHING 
           VERY EXCITING - he grins.

           OUTSIDE THE SUV: 

           GHW savagely kicks Jesse’s ass, gets him on the ground, and 
           unsheaths a huge knife...

           T1 knocks Colin down and scrambles to his gun, grabbing it 
           and raising it...

           BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!  
           An eruption of gunfire.  Everyone turns.  

           Charlie stands tall, holding A BAD ASS AK-47 over his head.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sorry bad guys - this brawl is 
                        over.

           Colin takes a swing - sucker punching T1.  He drops.  

           Charlie holds his AK on GHW as our three guys back away...

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s been fun, sweetheart, but we 
                        should be going.  Oh, and if you 
                        were hoping to follow us?  You are 
                        shit -

           BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!  He fires a quick burst at the SUV. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Out of -

           BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!  Another burst.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Luck.

           BLAM-BLAM BOOM!!!

           The final bullet hits the SUV’s gas tank.  

           THE CAR EXPLODES, ERUPTING IN A MASSIVE FIREBALL.  

           The three guys and GHW are all VIOLENTLY THROWN BACK from the 
           explosion.

           After a long moment, Charlie, Colin and Jesse slowly sit up, 
           stunned as they stare at the flaming SUV skeleton.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        That was a bigger point than I 
                        intended to make.

           Our guys hobble off, leaving four knocked out baddies and a 
           total disaster behind them.  As they exit frame, the German 
           Shepherd calmly walks through, curiously sniffing. 

           INT. SARA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           At the kitchen table, Sara casually bites into a piece of 
           pizza and chews... and chews... then looks up, annoyed.
                                 SARA
                        Rude much?

           REVEAL Chief McNulty glaring at her.  Three other Cops are 
           also here.  McNulty is livid, he’s been at this a while.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        So you’re telling me you didn’t 
                        hear a word.  Not one mention of 
                        what they were doing, where they 
                        were going.  They were here in your 
                        home, openly formulating a plan, 
                        yet you somehow heard nothing.

                                 SARA
                        Nah.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                             (losing it, explodes)
                        Do you get that I’m a Cop?!  That 
                        lying to me is a serious -

                                 SARA
                        Dude - I said, “nah.”

           She takes another bite of pizza.  McNulty turns away, 
           struggling not to lose his shit.  He looks to his men, sotto:

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        I may shoot her. I know I shouldn’t 
                        but this is too much.  How is a 
                        teenage girl that snooty?  That 
                        entitled?  That -

                                 SARA
                             (between bites)
                        I can hear you, you know.  Just 
                        like, FYI, if you think you’re 
                        being covert.  You’re not.

           Trembling with rage, McNulty reaches for his gun -

                                 COP
                        Chief?

           McNulty turns.  The Cop has noticed something - an OPEN 
           LAPTOP COMPUTER.  A Facebook page is open on the screen.

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        I think I got something.
           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - LATER

           Colin, Jesse and Charlie hurry away from the gas station.  
           Parked cars line the quiet street, and Colin checks door 
           handles to find something they can steal.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay, true or false - 

                                 JESSE
                        Alright, true!  That was fucking 
                        awesome!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Right?!  Parking lot super brawl!

                                 JESSE
                        I was in a fight!  I got hit, and I 
                        hit back!  Yeah, I hit a girl, but 
                        fuck it - she was huge!

                                 COLIN
                             (still checking cars)
                        Am I the only one worried about how 
                        they found us?

                                 JESSE
                        Who cares, we whipped their asses!  
                        We were just like real Cops, 
                        rumbling and brawling!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did you see me pull out that gat?  
                        I was all -
                             (pulls the gun from his 
                              holster)
                        Back the fuck off or I’ll bust a c-

           BLAM!  CHARLIE SHOOTS JESSE.

           Waving his gun too excitedly - the gun he lifted from Officer 
           Davis - Charlie accidentally shoots Jesse in the shoulder.  
           All three guys go silent for a beat.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Uh-oh.

           Stunned, Jesse looks to his shoulder, then to Charlie, then 
           to his shoulder, and back to Charlie.  Finally:

                                 JESSE
                        WHAT THE FUCK, CHARLIE?!
                                 CHARLIE
                        I think this is the real gun.

                                 JESSE
                        You think?!  You shot me!

           Colin moves to check out Jesse’s wound, which doesn’t appear 
           bad - he’s still standing and fully conscious.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It was an accident!  This thing has 
                        an alarmingly sensitive firing 
                        mechanism.  Are you okay?

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah, totally.  No big deal at all, 
                        really.  I only got FUCKING SHOT!

                                 COLIN
                             (examining)
                        It’s not bad.

                                 JESSE
                        Not bad?  He shot me!

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m sorry, I was excited!  We were 
                        celebrating, had some good energy 
                        going...

                                 JESSE
                        Yes we did.  And then you SHOT ME!

                                 COLIN
                        You’ll be okay, he just grazed you.

           Colin tears off a piece his shirt and wraps Jesse’s shoulder.

                                 CHARLIE
                        See, just a graze.  No big deal.

                                 JESSE
                        Really, no big deal?  Tell you 
                        what, let me see the gun.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Uh... what for?

                                 JESSE
                        Just let me see it a second.  I 
                        want to show you something.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Um, that’s okay.  Maybe I’ll just 
                        hang on to it for now.

                                 COLIN
                        Settle it later, we have to move.  
                        Charlie, get a car while I patch 
                        this up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Get a car?  Like... commandeer one?  
                        Oh, I am fucking on this!

           Thrilled, Charlie jogs into the quiet street.  He calls back:

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry for shooting you, Partner!  
                        I’m about to redeem myself!

                                 JESSE
                        Have you ever met anyone so stupid?

                                 COLIN
                        Yes.  But it’s been a while.

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER

           Additional police cars have arrived at the scene of the car 
           chase.  Five of McNulty’s Officers are here.  The open laptop 
           from Sara’s house sits on the roof of a car as McNulty stares 
           at it, thinking.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        They brought up photos of the 
                        event, a map, directions, all to 
                        meet a girl... why?

                                 COP
                        You kidding?  Did you see her 
                        picture?

           The Cop chuckles at his joke - McNulty shoots daggers.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        This is insane.  It’s 3am, they’re 
                        running for their lives, and 
                        suddenly figure, “what the hell, 
                        let’s go to a rave.”  Are they that 
                        dumb?  Or is there some bizarre, 
                        high-level intellect at work here?

           McNulty considers... then shuts the computer.
                                 CHIEF MCNULTY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck it.  Let’s go.

           McNulty and his team get into their cars.

           As he walks to a car, OFFICER DAVIS TAKES OUT HIS CELL, makes 
           sure no one is watching, and stealthily types a text message.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - LATER

           Charlie stands in the middle of the quiet street.  A lone car 
           approaches from a few blocks away.  With nervous excitement, 
           he steels himself.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay, kids.  Welcome to Vehicle 
                        Commandeering 101.  This is some 
                        hardcore Cop shit, so pay 
                        attention.  Shoulders back, palm up 
                        and out, firmly proclaim:
                             (his authoritative voice)
                        Citizen!  Stop your vehicle!

           The car doesn’t slow down.  It flashes its headlights - get 
           out of the way.  Charlie is confused.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Uh... Stop the car!  Please!

           The car HONKS, not slowing down.  It may even be speeding up.  
           Charlie is growing nervous as THE CAR SPEEDS CLOSER AND 
           CLOSER...

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        They’ll stop.  Just testing me.  
                        I’m not backing down.  I’m a Cop.  
                        I’m not -

           Charlie DIVES OUT OF THE WAY as the car speeds by, narrowly 
           missing him.  

           He slowly gets to his feet, stunned as he looks to Jesse and 
           Colin.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        What the hell was that?!  They were 
                        supposed to -

           BOOM!  CHARLIE IS NAILED BY A VAN heading the opposite 
           direction.  He gets flattened, but the van managed to brake 
           enough that he isn’t dead.  He staggers to his feet, gasping:
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m okay!  I’m up!  Nothing major.  
                        Just got the wind kn-

           Charlie THROWS UP in the middle of the street.

           INT. PIECE OF SHIT VAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Colin starts the engine of a beat-up old hippie van, with 
           Jesse in shotgun and Charlie seated behind him.  The van 
           sputters and chugs, threatening to die at any moment.

                                 COLIN
                        Not an ideal vehicle.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, I tried to stop a Beamer, it 
                        almost killed me!  The Mystery 
                        Machine will have to do.

                                 COLIN
                        I still say we should have ditched 
                        these guys.

           REVEAL three 20 year old STONERS on the floor in the back of 
           the van, huddled together in fear, completely wigged out.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We couldn’t leave ‘em out there, 
                        they’d get eaten alive - look at 
                        them.

                                 STONER 1
                        Oh man... Can’t believe I hit a 
                        fucking Cop, man.  Oh man...

           INT. PIECE OF SHIT VAN - MOMENTS LATER

           The guys drive in silence.  Jesse stares straight ahead, 
           stone faced and furious as he holds a makeshift bandage to 
           his shoulder.  Charlie leans up from the back seat:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay, you know what?  You can only 
                        stay mad for so long before I come 
                        out and say it: you are being rude.  
                        And honestly?  A little childish.

                                 JESSE
                             (calm but emphatic)
                        You.  Shot me.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes, you’ve pointed that out 
                        several times now, I think it’s 
                        been sufficiently established - I 
                        shot you.  I took out a gun, and I 
                        shot you.  And for the thousandth 
                        time, I am sorry.

                                 JESSE
                        You know what the worst part is?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I swear, if you say that I shot 
                        you...

                                 JESSE
                             (turning to face him)
                        The worst part is that you shooting 
                        me isn’t the worst part.  If that 
                        was all you’d done, I could let it 
                        go.  But it’s just one small moment 
                        in a night that perfectly sums up 
                        our entire relationship: you are a 
                        human wrecking ball.  And your sole 
                        purpose is to destroy my life.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Whoa, c’mon.  I know you’re mad 
                        right now -

                                 JESSE
                        It’s not “right now,” Charlie!  
                        It’s always!  Every day with you is 
                        a new adventure in stunning 
                        stupidity!  And you keep dragging 
                        me into your mess!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Because I’m trying to help you.  To 
                        improve your life -

                                 JESSE
                             (laughs)
                        Really?!  Thanks so much!  How 
                        lucky am I?!  Getting life lessons 
                        from a guy who’s professional field 
                        is hamsters!  A guy who’s only 
                        impressive trait is an ability to 
                        somehow do the exact wrong thing in 
                        every single situation!
                             (then, explodes)
                        Who gets a boner in a Mexican 
                        standoff?!
                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, that chick was hot as shit!  
                        You would have chubbed out too!  Oh 
                        wait - no you wouldn’t, because you 
                        don’t have any balls!

                                 COLIN
                        Guys -

                                 JESSE/CHARLIE
                        Shut up!

           Colin goes quiet and turns back to the road.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know what, Jesse?  I give up.  
                        I’m through trying to help.  Go 
                        ahead and stay this way, keep 
                        living life as the world’s biggest 
                        pussy, see where it gets you!

                                 JESSE
                        I will!  And you keep being the 
                        world’s biggest idiot!

                                 CHARLIE
                        I wouldn’t stop if I could!

                                 JESSE
                        I know!  Because you suck!

                                 CHARLIE
                        I hate you!

           They simultaneously whip away from each other in a huff.  

           A long beat.  Stoner 2 leans in to his buddies:

                                 STONER 2
                        These Cops are weird.

           INT. POLICE CAR - LATER

           McNulty drives on the 405 when his cell phone rings.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        McNulty.

           INT. POLICE STATION - SIMULTANEOUS

           A DESK COP stares at his computer.

                                 DESK COP
                        Sir?  I’ve been doing some digging 
                        on this Kelly girl.  This may be 
                        nothing, but - her Uncle is Robert 
                        Marks.  As in Executive Director 
                        Robert Marks.

           A beat.  McNulty drops his phone and SLAMS ON THE GAS.

           EXT. GAS STATION PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           A burned out SUV smolders.  Mike, the Asian twins, and the 
           Giant Hot Woman are sprawled out where we left them.  

           A PHONE RINGS.  It rings again and again, until -  

           MIKE SITS STRAIGHT UP.  A monster awakened.  Groggy, he finds 
           his cell phone and puts it to his ear.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hmm.

           ON THE OTHER END:

           Kevin Best is in his office.

                                 BEST
                        Michael.  I have new information 
                        from our friend.  I’d like you to 
                        meet me somewhere.

           EXT. MASSIVE WAREHOUSE RAVE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Our guys step out of the van in a packed parking lot.  Colin 
           looks to the three stoners huddled in the back.

                                 COLIN
                        You good to hold down the fort?

                                 STONER 1
                        This is a van, Sir.  Not a fort.

                                 COLIN
                        I’ve enjoyed our time together.

           Colin shuts the door.  
           Dozens of young 20s kids in bizarre rave outfits stream 
           toward the building.  When the kids see Jesse and Charlie:

                                 RAVE KIDS
                        Boo! / You suck! / Go home, Pigs!

           Colin looks Jesse and Charlie over, considering...

                                 COLIN
                        You two are going to draw a lot of 
                        attention in those.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah?  Well I forgot to pack an 
                        overnight bag, Colin, so what 
                        exactly would you like me to do?

           SECONDS LATER:

           We hear a RIP!  Colin steps back, holding a piece of blue 
           fabric.  He stares at his creation:

                                 COLIN
                        Okay.  That looks... different.

           REVEAL Jesse and Charlie dressed like CHIPPENDALE COPS: the 
           sleeves have been torn off their cop shirts - which are now 
           unbuttoned to their stomachs - and their pants have been 
           ripped into TEENY SHORT-SHORTS.  Charlie turns to Jesse.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Pfft.  You look like America’s 
                        worst gay stripper.

                                 JESSE
                        You look like the world’s worst gay 
                        stripper.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well you look like the worst gay 
                        stripper in fucking... space!

                                 JESSE
                        Well you look like -

           Colin wraps an arm around both guys and pulls them in close:

                                 COLIN
                        Hey, guess what I have?  A special 
                        prize for the next person that 
                        talks.  Wanna know what it is?  
                        I’ll give you a hint: it’s a punch 
                        in the face.  You want the prize?
           The guys press their lips shut and shake their heads no.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Okay, then.  Let’s make this as 
                        painless as possible, shall we?

           Colin walks them to the warehouse.  From the back, we see 
           just how short their shorts are - a BIT OF ROUNDED ASS CHEEK 
           pokes out from the back of each tiny pant leg.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Colin?

                                 COLIN
                        Yes, Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE
                        My buns are cold.

                                 COLIN
                        Don’t talk about your buns, 
                        Charlie.

           EXT. MASSIVE WAREHOUSE RAVE - MOMENTS LATER

           A VERY GAY DOOR GAY looks Jesse and Charlie over.

                                 DOOR GUY
                        Whoa-ho.  Hope you Cops invited 
                        some Firemen, ‘cause you just 
                        started a blaze in my pants.

           Jesse and Charlie stand there for a long, uncomfortable beat.

                                 JESSE
                        Can we go inside, please?

                                 DOOR GUY
                        Can you?  I’m waiving your cover 
                        charge.  Rave on, little Hot Cops.

           He ushers them in, eagerly watching as they enter.  He then 
           turns back and looks Colin over, unimpressed. 

                                 DOOR GUY (CONT’D)
                        Ten bucks.

           INT. MASSIVE WAREHOUSE RAVE - MOMENTS LATER

           They enter a huge building filled with hundreds of costumed 
           ravers.  The atmosphere is electric - bumping techno music, 
           insane lights, smoke machines and elaborate decorations.
                                 JESSE
                        We should sweep from one side to 
                        the other til we find her.  
                             (pointing)
                        Let’s start by that giant dragon.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s a dumb idea.
                             (nods to opposite side)
                        Let’s start by that giant missile.

                                 JESSE
                        You’re just saying that to 
                        contradict me.  That’s not even a 
                        missile, it’s a ship.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know.  So is your face.

                                 JESSE
                        Really.  My face is a ship.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes.  A ship filled with farts.

                                 JESSE
                        You’re so stupid!

                                 CHARLIE
                        You have gross legs!

           They sneer at each other, then simultaneously charge in 
           opposite directions.  Colin tries to stop them, but -

                                 COLIN
                        Guys!  Don’t -
                             (trailing off)
                        Split up...  

           A beat.  Colin sighs, pissed.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        It’s Adventures in fucking 
                        Babysitting.

           LATER:

           - Jesse looks for Kelly as he pushes through the crowd, 
           hundreds of weirdos in weirdo costumes.

           - Charlie wanders the crowd and accidentally bumps into a 
           weird RAVE GIRL dancing by herself, entranced.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Sorry!  Didn’t mean to disrupt.  
                        Great moves by the way, very -

           She grabs Charlie’s face and LICKS HIM.  A beat.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m Charlie.

           - Colin searches for Jesse and Charlie, annoyed as shit as 
           ravers wave glow sticks and other weird objects in his face.

                                 COLIN
                        No.  Go away.  Hey, giant lollipop. 

           He grabs the giant lollipop from a raver and chucks it.  
           Colin hops up on a ledge for a better view, and looks out on 
           a dense sea of ravers.  This is hopeless.

           - Jesse reaches a bar area.  He stops and leans against it, 
           overwhelmed.  As he looks out on the huge crowd:

                                 GUY (O.S.)
                        Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Bro?!

           Jesse turns to see his CO-WORKER DAVE.  Dave is dressed as a 
           GIANT BABY: giant diaper, giant bonnet and giant baby bottle.  
           As ridiculous as he looks, he seems more shocked by Jesse.

                                 DAVE
                        What the fuck are you doing here?

                                 JESSE
                        Trying to find an ex-girlfriend 
                        with FBI connections so I can help 
                        a reformed felon take down a crime 
                        boss and some dirty Cops.  You?

                                 DAVE
                             (a beat)
                        I can see your balls!

           - Charlie dances with his rave girl, shouting over the music 
           to talk to her, even though she isn’t listening:

                                 CHARLIE
                        And he thinks I’m a mess?  He’s the 
                        mess.  I’m legit - I’m in charge of 
                        literally hundreds of hamst-  

           She jams her RING POP in his mouth - twisting it and making 
           him awkwardly suck.  When she finally pulls it out:
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Mmm.  Part of me is curious how 
                        many mouths that’s been in tonight, 
                        but -

           She grabs him and starts PASSIONATELY MAKING OUT WITH HIM.

           - Jesse is insanely annoyed as Dave, who’s drunk or tripping 
           or both, laughs and shouts in his ear:

                                 DAVE
                        Jesse from work, man!  It’s like a 
                        weird juxtaposition!  ‘Cause the 
                        party’s dope and bumpin’ and packed 
                        with titties!  And then you - 
                        you’re totally lame!

                                 JESSE
                        I’m... what?

                                 DAVE
                        Not in a bad way, bro!  I just 
                        meant - you’re Jesse.  You’re 
                        totally lame.  Not in a bad way.

                                 JESSE
                        I’m... lame.  But not in a bad way.

                                 DAVE
                        Exactly!  You get me, bro.

           He gives Jesse a friendly punch in the arm.  Jesse considers 
           this for a beat... then suddenly EXPLODES:

                                 JESSE
                        HOLY FUCK, YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE!  Look 
                        at you!  You’re ridiculous!  Why 
                        would someone like you ever get to 
                        push me around?

           Jesse shakes his head, disappointed in himself for ever 
           bowing down to this guy.  Then, newly emboldened:

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Here’s the sitch, Dave: on Monday, 
                        you and I are gonna straighten some 
                        things out.  And you’ll be seeing a 
                        new side of me.  You know why?  
                             (with fierce intensity)
                        ‘Cause I’m a Cop, you scumbag.  And 
                        yes, that’s largely metaphorical 
                        but - fuck it - I’m a Cop and I’m 
                        crazier than Dirty Harry and John 
                        McClane put together.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck with me again, and I’ll 
                        destroy you.  I’ll rip off your 
                        face and shit on your skull.  And 
                        when you go home to wash off my 
                        shit, guess what you’ll find in 
                        your bath?  A barracuda.  And it’s 
                        gonna eat your penis.  Later, bro.

           Jesse gives him a slap on the cheek and walks off, a big 
           confident stud.  His ass is half-showing, but he’s still a 
           stud.  Dave is speechless.

           EXT. MASSIVE WAREHOUSE RAVE - MOMENTS LATER

           A hundred dollar bill is slapped down before the Door Guy.  
           He looks up to see Cousin Mike, GHW and the Asian Twins (one 
           of whom is wounded from a gunshot, but still mobile.)

                                 MICHAEL
                        Four please.

                                 DOOR GUY
                             (into his phone)
                        Hi, Dr. Frankenstein?  I think your 
                        monster has gotten out again.

           Door Guy laughs at his joke - but gets no smiles from the 
           group.  He nervously clears his throat, then, all business:

                                 DOOR GUY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, so four times ten is forty...

           INT. MASSIVE WAREHOUSE RAVE - MOMENTS LATER

           His patience gone, Colin now forcibly grabs people from 
           behind who look like they could be Jesse or Charlie.  With 
           each turn, he sees an unfamiliar face.  

           SUDDENLY, Colin freezes.  Twenty feet away, ONE OF THE ASIAN 
           TWINS ROAMS THE CROWD.

                                 COLIN
                        Shit.

           - Jesse aggressively pushes through the crowd, determined as 
           he searches for Kelly.

           - Charlie sloppily makes out with his rave girl when he’s 
           grabbed from behind and spun.  Colin is there, looking very 
           concerned.
                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Charlie - come with me.  Now.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?  Why?  Did Jesse see me 
                        having an awesome time and send you 
                        to ruin it?  What a dick!

                                 COLIN
                             (eyes scanning the crowd)
                        No, just shut up and -

                                 CHARLIE
                        You tell him he can kiss my ass!  
                        And since my ass is hanging 
                        completely out of my shorts, he 
                        should have no tr-

           Colin GRABS CHARLIE, THROWS HIM OVER HIS SHOULDER, and 
           carries him off.  It happened so quickly, Charlie has no idea 
           why he’s suddenly staring at the floor.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Whoa.  Am I tripping balls?

           - A PRETTY GIRL in a sexy outfit dances.  She’s lost in the 
           music, oblivious to the mass of pervy guys trying to move in 
           on her.  Suddenly, she’s grabbed by the arm - she turns:

                                 KELLY
                             (shocked)
                        Jesse?

                                 JESSE
                        Hey Kelly.

                                 KELLY
                        What... what are you doing?
                             (then noticing)
                        What are you wearing?  Why are you 
                        here?  What are you -

           A DOUCHEBAG RAVE GUY steps in, playing hero for Kelly -

                                 RAVE GUY
                        Is this guy giving you a pr-

                                 JESSE
                        Fuck off.

           With one hand Jesse nonchalantly SHOVES THE GUY TO THE FLOOR.  
           Kelly is shocked.
                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        I need your help.  Listen 
                        carefully.

           He leans in close, talking directly into her ear.  She 
           listens intently, amazed at this new side of Jesse.

           -  Colin pushes through the crowd with Charlie slung over his 
           shoulder.  Charlie’s EXPOSED ASS IS RIGHT NEXT TO COLIN’S 
           FACE.  It’s like a wildly gay Officer and a Gentlemen moment.  
           As a group of GAY RAVERS see the homoerotic scene -

                                 RAVERS
                             (cheering)
                        Woo!  Take that ass on home!

                                 COLIN
                        Shh!  Shut up!  I’m trying to hide!

                                 RAVERS
                        Don’t be ashamed! / We support you! 
                        / Love is never wrong!

           They clap and cheer.  Colin has had enough.  He abandons 
           discretion and charges ahead, plowing over people, when 
           suddenly - he’s FACE TO FACE WITH A GUN.  

           Cousin Mike is on the other end, pressing his gun into 
           Colin’s temple.  KEVIN BEST stands next to Mike, hands in 
           pockets, perfectly calm.

                                 BEST
                        Hey, Colin.

                                 COLIN
                             (shaken)
                        Hey boss.  Didn’t expect to see you 
                        here.

           With a nod, Best and Michael back Colin - who still carries 
           Charlie - into an isolated corner of the warehouse, slightly 
           removed from the masses.

                                 BEST
                             (nods to Charlie’s ass)
                        Making new friends?

                                 COLIN
                        Trying to fit in.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (still upside down)
                        What’s going on?  Who are we 
                        talking to?
                                 BEST
                        Been a long time since I went out 
                        on an errand, Colin.  But this, I 
                        had to be part of.  Time to wrap 
                        this thing up.

           Colin considers his options.  He doesn’t have many.

                                 COLIN
                        Can I set this idiot down?

                                 BEST
                             (disgusted by Charlie’s 
                              ass)
                        I would prefer it.

           Colin slowly moves to set Charlie down.  As he does, we may 
           notice his hand STEALTHILY REACHING FOR CHARLIE’S BATON...

           In the blink of an eye Colin drops Charlie, grabs the baton 
           and CRACKS MIKE IN THE FACE.  Mike goes down, knocked silly -  

           But Best is fast - he already his own gun in Colin’s chest.

                                 BEST (CONT’D)
                        Dammit, man, is it not enough I’m 
                        at this zoo at 4 in the fucking 
                        morning?  I gotta deal with your 
                        bullshit too?  Why can’t you be 
                        more compliant?  Like your cousin?

                                 COLIN
                        My cousin’s an idiot.  I love him, 
                        but he’s an idiot.

                                 BEST
                        Good employee though.  Loyal.  Not 
                        like you.

           As Best glares into Colin’s eyes, his anger begins to rise...

                                 BEST (CONT’D)
                        I know we should do this someplace 
                        private, but staring at you now, 
                        I’m not sure I can wait.

           Best COCKS HIS GUN, about to pull the trigger -

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        Here’s an idea - let’s not commit 
                        murder before 1000 witnesses. 

           Best turns.  He’s surprised to see McNulty standing right 
           next to him.
                                 CHIEF MCNULTY (CONT’D)
                        For one, we still don’t have the 
                        tape.  And two, you can’t fire a 
                        gun in a huge crowd without a -
                             (THWIP!)
                        Silencer.

           McNulty’s silenced gun FIRES A BULLET INTO BEST’S GUT.  
           McNulty fires three more shots, and Best drops.  Dead.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY (CONT’D)
                        He can be so impulsive.  It’s 
                        frustrating.

           McNulty then presses his gun into Colin’s stomach.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s take a walk, boys.

           SOMEWHERE IN THE HUGE CROWD:

           Jesse leads Kelly by the hand as he works through the crowd, 
           scanning for Charlie and Colin.  Kelly follows him willingly, 
           but seems somewhat confused.

                                 KELLY
                        I understand why the Chief is after 
                        you... and I see why the criminals 
                        want you dead... but I’m still not 
                        getting the shorts.

                                 JESSE
                        I’m not sure I do either.

           SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE HUGE CROWD:

           Colin and Charlie walk side by side, slowly pushing through 
           ravers.  McNulty walks behind Colin, right up against him, 
           his gun stealthily pressed into Colin’s lower back.

           Charlie’s eyes dart about as he scans the area, searching for 
           a weapon, or an escape path, or -

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        Charlie, I swear to God, if you 
                        even blink I will shoot you in the 
                        testicles.  I will literally jam my 
                        gun in your crotch and explode your 
                        nuts.

           Horrified, Charlie immediately falls in line.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Yessir.  That is a very effective 
                        threat.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        Keep moving nice and slow.  When we 
                        get to the exit -

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        The exit?

           McNulty looks to see -

                                 JESSE
                        You just got here.

           Jesse stands before them, tall and defiant.

           With his gun still in Colin’s back, McNulty looks Jesse over 
           and laughs.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        This a joke, right?  Jesse, c’mon! 
                        You’re not going to save the day. 
                        You’re not a hero.  You’re nothing.  
                        Just a sad, helpless loser.

                                 JESSE
                        Actually - a sad, helpless loser -

           CLICK.  A GUN COCKS. 

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        With a gun.

           Jesse presses the gun hard into McNulty’s stomach.

           McNulty just grins, unflinching as he glares into Jesse’s 
           eyes.

                                 CHIEF MCNULTY
                        Of all the lame threats I’ve ever 
                        heard, this is the lamest - a 
                        pussy, dressed like a homo, with a 
                        fake gun.

           A beat.  Jesse nods, chuckles, then:

                                 JESSE
                        Maybe you’re right, McNulty.  Maybe 
                        it is fake.  Just a lame, fake gun 
                        from a lame, fake uniform.

           Jesse takes a step closer, and now with incredible intensity:
                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Or maybe, it’s the real gun we took 
                        from a real Cop.  And maybe the guy 
                        holding it has had a real bad day 
                        and is real close to losing his 
                        shit and blowing a very real hole 
                        in your gut.  So before you make 
                        your move, McNulty, ask yourself: 
                        is that a legit firearm jammed in 
                        my stomach?  Or is it...

           McNulty’s confidence wavers - as his eyes make a quick look 
           down to inspect the gun...

           WHAM!  JESSE THROWS A RIGHT HOOK TO MCNULTY’S JAW.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        A distraction?

           A beat.  McNulty blinks... his eyes roll back in his head... 
           and he slumps to the floor.  Jesse grabs McNulty’s gun.

           Colin and Charlie are speechless, jaws open.  Kelly, standing 
           a few feet behind Jesse, is equally stunned.  Finally:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jesse, holy shit!  That was 
                        awesome!

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah, well - guess I found my 
                        balls.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Good for you.  I think you’re 
                        really going to enjoy them.

           They chuckle.  A beat, then:

                                 BOTH GUYS AT ONCE
                        Charlie, I / Jesse, the -

           They both stop.  Then gesture to the other - okay, you first.

                                 BOTH GUYS AT ONCE (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted -

           Another beat.  They gesture again - you go.  No, let me.  No, 
           let -

                                 COLIN
                        For fuck’s sake! 
                             (quickly points)
                                 (MORE)
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                        You’re sorry, you’re sorry, you 
                        didn’t mean it, you’re still 
                        friends and you’re still idiots.  
                        Good?

           They nod - sounds about right.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Good.  Can we move?

                                 JESSE
                             (nod to Kelly)
                        Yeah, got what we came for.  Let’s 
                        get the hell out of here.

           Jesse takes Kelly’s hand and leads the way as Charlie and 
           Colin follow.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey Kelly.

                                 KELLY
                        Hey Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Great outfit.

                                 KELLY
                        Stop staring, Charlie.

           MOMENTS LATER, HALFWAY TO THE EXIT:

           The foursome struggles to push through the huge crowd, when 
           SUDDENLY, THEY SEE IT - a Giant Hot Woman ten feet away, 
           towering over the ravers.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Madame HugeTits!

           SHE SPOTS THEM.  As she reaches for a gun, they try to head a 
           new direction.  She WHISTLES - a shrill blast, signaling THE 
           ASIAN TWINS fifteen feet away.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Kung Fu Twins!

           The Twins REACH FOR THEIR GUNS and close in.  Jesse turns to 
           lead the group in a different direction, but -

           THEY SEE TWO COPS, McNulty’s guys, ten feet away.  The Cops 
           spot them and reach for their weapons...

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Dirty Cops!
           The foursome turns a different direction, but - 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Psycho Sasquatch!

           Cousin Mike is back on his feet, a huge, pissed off monster 
           plowing toward them, throwing ravers aside like ragdolls.

           Our guys stand helpless and trapped.  Four different enemies 
           push in from four different directions, guns drawn as they 
           search for a clean shot amidst the dense crowd and flashing 
           lights...

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Well... been a fun night, guys.

                                 COLIN
                        Yeah.  I guess it has.

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah.  In fact...

           Jesse pulls out the gun he lifted off McNulty...

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s keep it going.

           Raises it, and as he turns his body a full 360 degrees, he 
           FIRES - BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!  FOUR SHOTS IN RAPID SUCCESSION.

           He hits all four targets: FOUR GIANT SMOKE MACHINES located 
           in four corners of the warehouse.

           The machines ERUPT, SPEWING A THICK CLOUD OF SMOKE.  The 
           combination of smoke and gunfire creates -

           CHAOS.

           THE CROWD FREAKS.  Hundreds of spaced-out ravers lose their 
           shit and push for the exit.  The bad guys get knocked hard by 
           ravers, swept up in the crowd...

                                 COLIN
                        Go!

           Colin tucks Charlie under his arm and charges ahead, 
           bulldozing his way through the crowd.  

           Jesse follows close behind, riding Colin’s wake - he has an 
           arm around Kelly, protecting her.

           As they near the exit, they hit a bottleneck.  From various 
           angles, the baddies are still in pursuit.  Guns are drawn, 
           but no one can get a direct shot.
           GHW sees an opening, about to fire - but gets slammed by a 
           surge of ravers and drops her weapon.

           Cousin Mike is mere feet away, but can’t reach them in the 
           dense crowd.  He angrily lunges, his fingers brushing an inch 
           from Jesse’s face.

           A few feet from the door, Charlie spots -

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey!  Rave Girl!

           His weird rave girl is next to him, pushing to the door.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        How was your night?

           A push from the rear shoves our guys forward, through the 
           doorway to -

           EXT. WAREHOUSE PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           The crowd spills outside and flees in a panic, screaming. 

           Colin emerges, still protecting Charlie, who in turn protects 
           Rave Girl.

           Jesse and Kelly spill out a moment later.

                                 JESSE
                        Get to the van!

           The group charges through the lot, trying not to get 
           separated in the chaos, when suddenly - 

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Hey!  Look who it is!

           They stop and turn - OFFICER DAVIS is approaching.  He’s 
           positively gleeful as he DRAWS HIS GUN.  Our guys freeze.

                                 OFFICER DAVIS
                        The mother fucker who shot me in 
                        the ass.  You know what time it is, 
                        mother fucker?  It’s payback time.

           He raises his gun, his eyes locked on Charlie...

                                 OFFICER DAVIS (CONT’D)
                        Time for you to get shot in your 
                        ass.  Time for you to know the 
                        searing pain of hot lea-
           WHAM!  The PIECE OF SHIT VAN comes from out of nowhere and 
           FLATTENS OFFICER DAVIS.  

           Stoner 1 sits behind the wheel of the van.  He and his stoner 
           pals are completely freaked - this was not intentional.

                                 STONER 1
                        Oh shit, man!  I hit a fucking Cop, 
                        man!  Again, man!  Oh man...

           As Stoner 1 curls up into a ball, Colin runs to the door.

                                 COLIN
                        How ‘bout I drive.

           Colin shoves him aside and takes the wheel.  As Jesse and 
           Charlie help the girls into the van, Jesse notices Rave Girl 
           for the first time.

                                 JESSE
                             (sotto to Charlie)
                        Who is that?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (duh)
                        Rave Girl.

           Charlie hops in the van.  Jesse hops in after him.

           As they speed off, we follow the van from an AERIAL VIEW OF 
           THE PARKING LOT:

                                 RAVE GIRL (O.S.)
                        So is that, like, a real gun?

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        Nah, this one’s fake.  But it’s a 
                        perfect replica.  As a matter of 
                        fact -

           BLAM!

           A beat.

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Uh-oh.

                                 COLIN (O.S.)
                        CHARLIE!  WHAT THE FUCK!

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAWN

           A beautiful two-story family home in a quaint, quiet 
           neighborhood.  The sun is beginning to rise.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

           A 50ish MAN is asleep in bed next to his wife.  There’s a 
           loud BANG BANG BANG.  BANG BANG BANG.  Groggy and confused, 
           the man sits up.  He reaches for his glasses and a bathrobe.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - ENTRANCE FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           The BANG BANG BANG continues as he shuffles to the front 
           door, barely awake.

                                 MAN
                        Okay, I’m coming...

           The man, ROGER MARKS, opens the door to...

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DOORSTEP - CONTINUOUS

           The strangest collection of people he’s ever seen.

                                 ROGER
                        What the hell...?

           His niece Kelly is flanked by two fruity hot cops, a spaced-
           out rave girl, three goofball stoners, and a big bad-ass with 
           an angry look on his face.

                                 KELLY
                        Hey, Uncle Roger.  Can we come in?

           Roger Marks stares back in disbelief.  Charlie leans in to 
           Colin, who has a hand clamped onto his shoulder.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Honestly, it doesn’t look that bad.

                                 COLIN
                        Don’t talk to me.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - MONDAY MORNING 

           The sun is out, a beautiful morning. 
           INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Dave pours a coffee and skims an article in the LA TIMES.  It 
           reads: POLICE CHIEF, COPS CAUGHT IN MURDER RING.  He reads it 
           in amazement.

           Sensing something, Dave looks up from the paper - Jesse 
           stands next to him, calmly pouring a coffee.  Dave jumps.

                                 DAVE
                        Jesse!  Hey!  Hey.  How’s it going?

                                 JESSE
                        Fine, Dave.  You?

                                 DAVE
                        Doing okay.  Could be better - 
                        Mondays, right?
                             (chuckles nervously, then)
                        Hey, did I see you at that rave 
                        Friday?  I was pretty wasted.  
                        Barely remember a thing.

           Dave subtly looks away.  He seems to remember enough.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        But, um, I was thinking I might 
                        talk to Kratzer.  Let him know I 
                        stole your work.  Just seems like 
                        the right thing to do.

                                 JESSE
                        How nice.

                                 DAVE
                        Okay, cool then.  I’ll do that.  
                        Get it straightened out.  And maybe 
                        we could like, hang out sometime.

                                 JESSE
                        I don’t think so.

                                 DAVE
                        Yeah, definitely not.  Sorry. 

           Dave awkwardly shuffles out of the kitchen.  Jesse grins.

           INT. JESSE’S CUBICLE - LATER

           Jesse enters and takes a seat at his desk.  His office phone 
           is flashing with a voicemail.  He presses play, and over the 
           speaker phone we hear:
                                 KELLY (ON VOICEMAIL)
                        Jesse, hey.  It’s Kelly.  I tried 
                        your cell but I didn’t hear back.  
                        Thought I’d try you at the office.
                             (then, a bit awkward)
                        So, um... it was good to see you 
                        the other night.  But in all the 
                        confusion, we didn’t actually got a 
                        chance to talk.  And, well, I was 
                        thinking maybe we could get 
                        together.  Catch up.  Get a coffee 
                        or... I don’t know.  Whatever.  
                        So... call me, ‘kay?

           Jesse chuckles as he stares at the phone, hardly believing 
           the role reversal.

           INT. JESSE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jesse and Charlie are getting ready for something - for now, 
           we can’t tell exactly what they’re doing.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Colin’s in New York right now.  
                        Meeting his kid for the first time.  
                        Pretty crazy.
                             (then)
                        Wonder how long he’ll be there?  I 
                        mean, I assume he’s just visiting.  
                        As opposed to moving.  He should 
                        definitely come back.  It’s awesome 
                        here.  It’s where his life is.  
                        It’s where his friends are.
                             (then, small)
                        I miss Colin.

                                 JESSE
                        I know, buddy.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You think he’s still mad I shot 
                        him?

                                 JESSE
                             (delicately)
                        Yeah... probably.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah.  Think I should call him?

                                 JESSE
                        Let’s give it a few weeks.
           EXT. LOS ANGELES - LATER

           Jesse and Charlie walk through town.  At the moment we only 
           see them from the neck up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So what’s next with Kelly?  You 
                        going to start seeing her again?

                                 JESSE
                             (considers)
                        Actually, I don’t know.  Don’t get 
                        me wrong, she’s great, but... all 
                        that time I was hung up on her, I’m 
                        not sure if I was really in love 
                        with her, or just afraid to move 
                        on.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Love is indeed elusive.  Rave Girl 
                        and I didn’t last.  We had 
                        chemistry.  And I cared about her.  
                        I just... had no idea what her name 
                        was.  It got weird.

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah, I can see that.

           As they reach their destination -

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, onward and upward.

                                 JESSE
                        Yep.

           They push through a door to...

           INT. BAR - DAY

           They enter and stand in the doorway.  Everyone here turns, 
           checking them out.  Girls in particular seem especially 
           intrigued as Jesse and Charlie walk through and grab a seat.

           As they sit, they each set something down on the table before 
           them - a beautiful red HELMET.

           REVEAL JESSE AND CHARLIE DRESSED AS FIREMEN: blue t-shirts, 
           suspenders, yellow pants and boots - perfect replica costumes 
           of L.A. Firefighters.

           A CUTE GIRL at an adjacent table leans in, flirty:
                                 CUTE GIRL
                        So you guys are firemen?

                                 JESSE
                        What gave us away?

           Jesse gives a smooth grin and we...

                                                                  FADE OUT.

           OVER CREDITS:

           MONTAGE:

           - Jesse and Charlie enter a bar.  They’re dressed as AIR 
           FORCE PILOTS.  They bask in the attention as every woman here 
           stares at them.

           - Jesse and Charlie enter a bar. They’re dressed as HOSPITAL 
           SURGEONS.  They bask in the attention as every woman here 
           stares at them.

           - Jesse and Charlie enter a bar.  Everyone turns to look - 
           then immediately scatters, leaving the bar empty.  REVEAL the 
           guys dressed as members of the L.A. BOMB SQUAD.

                                 JESSE
                        We may not have thought this one 
                        through.

                                         THE END.
