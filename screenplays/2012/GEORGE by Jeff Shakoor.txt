                                 June 25, 2012
           FADE IN:

           BEGIN OPENING CREDITS 

           OVER BLACK, we hear DEAN MARTIN’s smooth tones as he sings 
           the upbeat “POWDER YOUR FACE WITH SUNSHINE”.

           INT. ROOM - NIGHT

           FADE UP on an OLD DRESSER covered with men’s GROOMING 
           PRODUCTS.  A HAND DABS some smoothing paste and runs across 
           thinning hair and then a COMB works its way through.  In the 
           mirror, we see SMITTY sitting on the bed, a very short, 
           adorable older man, swinging his feet excitedly, not touching 
           the ground.  

           Our man finishes combing his THIN MOUSTACHE, then reaches 
           into a cup and grabs his FALSE TEETH, putting them in.  

           Smitty jumps off the bed and grabs the man’s JACKET.  He hops 
           on to a small stool to put the jacket on the man. He grabs a 
           small BRUSH from his inner pocket and brushes away any lint.  

           REVEAL GEORGE KOSTER, sixties, meets Smitty’s gaze in the 
           mirror. Smitty smiles and George smiles back. George retains 
           his good looks, but you can see the years have taken their 
           toll. 

           Smitty jumps off the stool and walks to the door.  George 
           nods and Smitty opens it.  

           INT. HALLWAY OF A HALF WAY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           George steps through like a prince into the hallway filled 
           with DERELICTS and JUNKIES as Smitty follows closely behind.  
           George walks with his head high, oblivious to the scene 
           around him.   

           INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           George and Smitty keep their blinders on as they walk down 
           the stairs. GLADYS, a huge woman, and the halfway house’s 
           supervisor, yells at him from her office, behind a wire 
           grill. George SNAPS his fingers below the cage and Smitty
           sneaks a DO NOT FEED sign onto the bottom of the cage. George 
           smiles and strolls out with Smitty close behind. 

           EXT. HALFWAY HOUSE - NIGHT

           They exit past a sign: THE LAST HOPE HOME AND SHELTER.  

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           George and Smitty are in an alley with a MAN.  George is 
           holding up a handful of food stamps.  The Man gives Smitty
           cash, and George hands the Man the food stamps.  

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Smitty DANCES an Irish jig on the street with his HAT on the 
           floor in front of a small crowd.  
           George is standing in the back smiling while drinking from a 
           pint in a paper bag.  A few people drop bills into the hat.  

           INT. BAR - LATER

           George and Smitty walk into a rundown bar, a few BARFLIES 
           welcome them like celebrities with cheers and applause. 

           George and Smitty get drunk while George entertains the 
           patrons with stories of his exploits.  

           EXT. BAR - LATER

           A very drunk George gets thrown out by the same people.  

           INT. ANOTHER BAR - LATER

           George pulls it together and walks in as a nervous Smitty 
           waits by the door.  George walks up to the BARTENDER.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Give me five shots of bourbon 
                        please.  

           The Bartender lines up five shots as George looks over at 
           Smitty and winks.  George looks at the filled shots and 
           drinks one after the other very quickly.  

                                 BARTENDER
                        Jeez buddy slow down.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Believe me friend, you’d drink like 
                        this too if you had what I had.  

                                 BARTENDER
                           (concerned)
                        Whatta ya got?  

           George finishes the last shot and reaches into his pocket.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Four dollars.  

           George throws the money on the bar, smiles and starts to run 
           out.  

                                 BARTENDER
                        ELMO!  

           ELMO, a huge bouncer, steps in front of the exit as George 
           runs right into him, like hitting a wall. George looks up.

                                 GEORGE
                        Before you do anything you’ll 
                        regret, just know....

           George points to Smitty.  

                                 GEORGE
                        He’s with me.  
           Smitty smiles at Elmo.  

           END MUSIC CUE ON HIGH POINT

                                 DEAN MARTIN
                        ...when you wear a great big smile!

                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. NEWARK POLICE DEPARTMENT HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

           George is handcuffed to a bench, bruised and bloodied. AL, 
           fifties, on another bench in the cell, starts to laugh trying 
           to get George's attention.

                                 AL
                        Ask me what I’m laughing at.   

           George doesn't answer.

                                 AL
                        You, pretty boy, ask me what I'm 
                        laughing at.

                                 GEORGE
                        You know I can't resist you when 
                        you call me that.

                                 AL
                        So ask me. 

                                 GEORGE
                        What are you laughing at?

                                 AL
                           (satisfied smile)
                        Because I'm gonna kill her.

                                 GEORGE
                        Is that the punch line?

           Al nods.

                                 GEORGE
                        I guess I'll have to be there.

           OFFICER THALBERG, walks in and unlocks George's handcuffs.

                                 OFFICER THALBERG
                        Time for us to talk.

                                 GEORGE
                        You've got a hard act to follow.

           INT. OFFICER THALBERG’S DESK - MOMENTS LATER

           George tries to stay upright as the Officer types.

                                 OFFICER THALBERG
                        Name?
                                 GEORGE
                        I thought I was infamous. 

                                 OFFICER THALBERG
                           (typing)
                        George Arthur Koster.

                                 GEORGE
                        A Jewish Officer Thalberg?

                                 OFFICER THALBERG
                        Thalberg, Jewish. What of it?

                                 GEORGE
                        Your parents must be so 
                        disappointed you took the job of 
                        someone who should have a vowel at 
                        the end of their name. You should 
                        be defending me, not arresting me.

                                 OFFICER THALBERG
                        Maybe you shouldn't get arrested.

                                 GEORGE
                        We do what we do best. Like you and 
                        underachieving.   

           He continues to type.

                                 GEORGE
                        Why am I being arrested for getting 
                        the shit kicked out of me?

                                 OFFICER THALBERG
                        You start the fights George, it's 
                        not our fault that you can't win 
                        em. You at least get a shot in?

                                 GEORGE
                        Five actually, but they were 
                        bourbon. And they’re starting to 
                        wear off, so if you could give me a 
                        nip of whatever’s in your desk to 
                        help you mask the pain of killing 
                        your parents with your obvious lack 
                        of success, I’d be eternally 
                        grateful.  

           George tries to bow but almost falls over.

                                 OFFICER THALBERG
                        I think we're gonna send you to the 
                        hospital.

                                 GEORGE
                        Drugs.  Thank you.  I'll talk to 
                        your parents.

           INT. HOSPITAL - LATER

           NURSE EDIE, forties, African-American, heavy set, and not 
           attractive opens the curtain.
                                 NURSE EDIE
                        Aw fuck me.

                                 GEORGE
                        I can’t stress how important a 
                        proper greeting should be to you 
                        because of your appearance.

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        I don't wanna deal with your shit 
                        right now.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t have any to give you. It 
                        was all kicked out of me by an 
                        Elmo. Guess they don’t just tickle 
                        anymore.  

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        No talking.

           She slams down the stitch kit. He reaches up and grabs her 
           breast.  She slaps him across the face.

                                 GEORGE
                        Usually when women tell me not to 
                        talk it means they want me to...

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        George I’m not fucking kidding I'm 
                        having a bad night.

                                 GEORGE
                        Find a mirror?

           She gets in his face.

                                 NURSE EDIE
                           (intense)
                        I'll make it hurt.  And I'll give 
                        you Tylenol and have the orderlies 
                        throw you out cause you said 
                        "nigga."  What ever shit you do 
                        have left in you will be all over 
                        Bloomfield Avenue.  Along with four 
                        of the six real teeth you got left.  
                        You understand?

           George nods, and she starts to work on him again.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't feel good.

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        I'll get you some pills.

           He grabs her wrist and just looks at her with a serious face.  
           She understands. 

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        I'll have them run some tests.  
                        Gonna need blood and urine.
                                 GEORGE
                        Then I'm positive we're going to 
                        need to find Elmo. He has all that.

           INT. X-RAY ROOM - LATER

           George is having an X-ray.

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           George is trying to pee in a cup.

                                 GEORGE
                        Whoops.  Getting closer.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - LATER

           George is recovering in bed.  An ADMINISTRATOR peeks in.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        What're we doing with this one?

           Nurse Edie stares at George who pleads with his eyes.

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        We're admitting him.

           The Administrator leaves and George smiles at her.

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        Don't fucking smile at me.  It's 
                        just ‘til your tests come back and 
                        they tell me when you're dying so I 
                        can be done with your drunk ass.

                                 GEORGE
                        The Republicans are right, the 
                        health care industry is just fine.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           An attractive young NURSE WILSON is cleaning up his dinner.

                                 NURSE WILSON
                        Was it good?

                                 GEORGE
                        It will be once we've done it.

           She holds up the empty tray. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Of course, if it was the sex, you'd 
                        already have your answer. 

                                 NURSE WILSON
                        I could take a pretty good guess 
                        just looking at ya. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You're not looking at my better 
                        half.
           He pulls down the blanket but she pulls it back up.

                                 GEORGE
                        What happened? Nurses used to be 
                        sluts.

                                 NURSE WILSON
                        We still are, you just used to 
                        younger.

                                 GEORGE
                        Reach into my pocket.

                                 NURSE WILSON
                        I'm not dumb enough to fall for 
                        that one.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re a nurse in the Bronx working 
                        graveyard, you’re dumb enough to 
                        fall for all of them. My coat is 
                        over there. 

           She walks over and pulls out a picture of a young George.

                                 NURSE WILSON
                        Somebody you know?

                                 GEORGE
                        Used to.

                                 NURSE WILSON
                        Is this you?  You were hot.

                                 GEORGE
                        No slut, I was dashing. 
                        Sophisticated and educated even 
                        when I was inebriated. You know 
                        what I would’ve done to you back 
                        then?

                                 NURSE WILSON
                        Seeing as I was about six months 
                        old, cradled me?  

                                 GEORGE
                        I would've made you fall in love 
                        with me in the first five minutes 
                        and then gave you a quicky at the 
                        first place of convenience.  And 
                        then done the same to another an 
                        hour later.

                                 NURSE WILSON
                        That wouldn't have happened.

                                 GEORGE
                        It would've, know why, because it 
                        always did. And you would've wanted 
                        more. They all fell in love with 
                        me, they all wanted more.
                                 NURSE WILSON
                        Maybe I believe you.  Except for 
                        the part of them wanting more.

           She casually hands the picture back and turns to walk out.

                                 NURSE WILSON
                        Cause I'm already over it.

                                 GEORGE
                           (quietly)
                        She'll look back.

           She doesn't, and George looks at the picture.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

           George is sleeping with the picture by his pillow when the 
           light hits him in the face.  Standing in front of him is DR. 
           SILMAN, forties.

                                 GEORGE
                        Ah, Silman, bring me two poached 
                        eggs, the New York Times, and a 
                        sponge bath.  Did Obama get happy 
                        endings into the health care bill?

                                 DR. SILMAN
                        Got your tests back.

                                 GEORGE
                        How did I do?

                                 DR. SILMAN
                        You failed.

                                 GEORGE
                        Dad?

                                 DR. SILMAN
                        Your liver's at last call George.

                                 GEORGE
                        You just wanted to make that joke.

                                 DR. SILMAN
                        You're right, I did.  But it's only 
                        funny to me.

                                 GEORGE
                        You're exaggerating.

                                 DR. SILMAN
                        Can't exaggerate death.

                                 GEORGE
                           (serious)
                        I don't like your jokes Silman.

                                 DR. SILMAN
                        Your liver is failing.  You're 
                        gonna die.
           George gets serious. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Something can be done.

                                 DR. SILMAN
                        Something could've been done, last 
                        year. You could've done something 
                        instead of calling it bullshit.  

                                 GEORGE
                        There's transplants.

                                 DR. SILMAN
                           (laughing)
                        Bullshit. I'm not putting you on 
                        the list.  Six months, maybe. 
                        You've always lived like you're 
                        dying, now you got a reason.

                                 GEORGE
                        I thought you were supposed to be 
                        nice to me.

                                 DR. SILMAN
                        I'm supposed to tell you what's 
                        wrong with you.  It's my choice 
                        whether or not to be nice.  See I 
                        treat people who want to live, that 
                        take care of them....

           George puts up his hand.

                                 GEORGE
                        I have a long line of people 
                        waiting to give me a speech.  Your 
                        geography doesn't entitle you to 
                        jump to the front of the line.

                                 DR. SILMAN
                        Thanks for letting me save my 
                        breath.  I suggest you do the same.  
                        You don't have a lot left.

           Smitty is at the door with a big bag. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Go fuck yourself.

                                 DR. SILMAN
                        But you never listen.

           Silman leaves and Smitty walks in.  

                                 SMITTY
                        I know I came in at the end of that 
                        conversation, but it sounded like 
                        every one I’ve ever heard ya have. 

           Smitty laughs as he waddles to the bedside.
                                 SMITTY
                           (laughing)
                        You don’t listen. Almost as much as 
                        ya don’t learn. 

           George is looking at the picture. 

                                 SMITTY
                        Ya need anything?  

                                 GEORGE
                        A phone book. So I can see you, 
                        then hit you.   

           George notices a bag in his hand.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Why do you got my whole world in 
                        your hands?

                                 SMITTY
                        Gladys said you’re out of chances.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Seems to be today’s theme.   

                                 SMITTY
                        Gonna be tomorrow’s too.  

           Smitty hands George a note from the State of New York but he 
           doesn’t take it.  

                                 SMITTY
                        The state’s done with ya.  Looks 
                        like you’re living out of a locker 
                        or inside of Rikers.   

                                 GEORGE
                        Where can we go Smitty?  

                                 SMITTY
                        I can’t do we anymore George. All 
                        we do is take care of you. 

                                 GEORGE
                        In six months it’s all about you, I 
                        promise.    

           George gets serious as he looks at Smitty.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t have anywhere else to go.  

           Smitty takes off his hat and looks upset. 

                                 SMITTY
                        George, I’m going back home. 

                                 GEORGE
                        To Oz?  Can I click my heels lying 
                        down?  
           Smitty lowers his head and shuffles his feet. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re not serious?  

           Smitty can’t look at him.  

                                 SMITTY (O.S.)
                        I wasn’t gonna tell ya cause ya 
                        know I’d never leave ya, but with 
                        my sister dying a couple months 
                        ago, her house is just sitting 
                        there empty...  

                                 GEORGE
                        Where? 

                                 SMITTY
                        ...the half way house ain’t gonna 
                        be the same without ya so... 

                                 GEORGE
                        Where? 

                                 SMITTY
                        New Orleans. 

           George’s face changes, almost trance-like as he looks towards 
           the heavens.  

                                 GEORGE
                        New Orleans?  The pros. 

                                 SMITTY (O.S.)
                        My brother figures it would be a 
                        couple of years maybe until they’d 
                        foreclose or condemn or... 

                                 GEORGE
                           (to himself)
                        Drinking and fucking with the best. 

                                 SMITTY (O.S.)
                        I got nieces and nephews ya know, 
                        family.  Uncle Smitty. I’m Uncle 
                        Smitty somewhere to somebody.    

           Smitty laughs but stops when he mistakes George’s thinking 
           for sadness. 

                                 SMITTY
                        George listen I’m sorry but- 

                                 GEORGE
                           (snapping out of it)
                        I’m in!  

           Smitty stares back at George waiting for the punch line 
           before breaking into a laugh. 

                                 SMITTY
                        You better get drunk so you can get 
                        back to reality. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SMITTY (cont'd)
                        You’re on probation.  You leave the 
                        state and the state stops sending 
                        checks.  Whatta ya gonna live on?  

                                 GEORGE
                        How much would we need?  

                                 SMITTY
                        Keep the lights on, eat, drink. You
                        would need five hundred a month...  

                                 GEORGE
                        So your checks...

                                 SMITTY
                           (shaking his head)
                        Nah, nah, nah. You can come with 
                        me, but I ain’t taking ya.

           George looks at the picture again. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I’ll get the money.  

                                 SMITTY
                        Where? You don’t know anybody who 
                        wants to give ya anything but shit 
                        or a beating or both.  

                                 GEORGE
                        When’re you leaving?  

                                 SMITTY
                        Next bus.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Give me time Smitty.  

                                 SMITTY
                           (shaking his head)
                        It’d be easier if you’d just 
                        disappoint me now.  I ain’t got 
                        time to wait for it.  Eddie Romero 
                        already gave me five hundred for 
                        the other room.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Where did he get five hundred?!  

                                 SMITTY
                        Sold his Joe DiMaggio.  

           George looks surprised.  

                                 SMITTY
                        It’s a free house in New Orleans.  
                        You know that means a lot to a lot 
                        of the people we know.  Crawling 
                        distance from Bourbon Street. A 
                        whole town full of drunks, people 
                        just like us. 
                                 GEORGE
                        New women to fuck cause I haven’t 
                        fucked them over yet. 

                                 SMITTY
                        No rules, no curfew, no Gladys...

                                 GEORGE
                        No responsibility.  

                                 SMITTY
                        It’s like Heaven.  

                                 GEORGE
                           (to himself)
                        Or as close as I’m gonna get to it. 

           George looks away as he thinks.  

                                 SMITTY
                        I didn’t wanna get your hopes up. 
                        I’m sorry buddy.  I gotta look out 
                        for me on this one.  

           George snaps his head around. 

                                 GEORGE
                           (intense)
                        Give me time Smitty.  

                                 SMITTY
                        I was only staying cause of you.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Then do what you’ve been doing, for 
                        a little while longer. 

           George caresses his face and pleads with his eyes. 

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s the only thing I ever asked ya 
                        for that’s not gonna cost ya money. 

                                 SMITTY
                        Sunday. God’s day, cause it’s gonna
                        take a miracle. But I can’t see ya 
                        working your ass off on a day even 
                        God rests. 

           He pulls himself up to George. 

                                 SMITTY
                        I don’t know if I can miss ya. 

           Smitty gets emotional and kisses George’s forehead.  

                                 SMITTY
                        But I’ll miss the times. 

           Smitty gets down and gives him one last look.   
                                 SMITTY
                        I learned a lot, watching you never 
                        learn. 

           He puts on his hat, smiles and leaves. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Nurse Edie walks in with concern.

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        You okay?

                                 GEORGE
                        Edie except for providing you with 
                        the occasional breast grab, I 
                        haven't been very nice to you. The 
                        only thing I've ever been good at 
                        is fucking and pretending to 
                        apologize so I'll let you choose 
                        which you want me to do for you.

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        I'll take the apology.

                                 GEORGE
                        God bless your heart and mercy.   
                        Edie I'm sorry.

           She smiles at him.

                                 GEORGE
                        And I'd like to prepay you with a 
                        thank you cause I need a favor.

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        How big?

                                 GEORGE
                        As big as you are around.

           She gives him a look.

                                 GEORGE
                        I need you to make my wife feel 
                        sorry for me.

           INT. HOSPITAL OFFICE - LATER

           MYRA WHITAKER, late fifties, with a sweet, warm face, sits 
           across from Nurse Edie.

                                 MYRA
                        How bad is he?

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        Bad.

                                 MYRA
                        Is he going to die?
                                 NURSE EDIE
                        Yes.

                                 MYRA
                        How soon?

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        Three to six months if he takes 
                        real good care of himself.

           Myra exhales and shakes her head.  

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        Miss Whitaker this was my idea.  He 
                        begged me not to call you, but he's 
                        got no where else to go.  The half 
                        way house kicked him out after he 
                        was arrested again.  Nobody will 
                        take him.  He needs you right now. 
                        You're all he has.

           Myra nods as she thinks.  Slowly, Myra starts to smile, then 
           builds it into a laugh.  Nurse Edie looks confused. Myra is 
           laughing very hard now.

                                 MYRA
                        This is so great!

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           George is watching cleavage on the Spanish station when Nurse 
           Edie walks in and signals that Myra's with her. He quickly 
           pretends he's sleeping and very sick.  Edie plays along.

                                 NURSE EDIE
                           (quietly)
                        George?  George?

           He pretends to wake up and look weak.

                                 GEORGE
                        Who's there?

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        George it's me, Edie.

                                 GEORGE
                        Edie.  Oh my sweet Edie, I was 
                        dreaming about, Moses and uh 
                        Abraham, Sodom and Gomorrah.

                                 NURSE EDIE
                           (shaking her head)
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes him too. All the apostles.

                                 NURSE EDIE
                        Don't get angry but I called Myra.
                                 GEORGE
                        No!  I told you not to!  She 
                        doesn't deserve this!  I...

           He sees Myra.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I didn't want you to see me like 
                        this!  Edie, goddamn...

           Myra starts laughing again, breaking George out of his act.

                                 MYRA
                        You can cut the shit now George.

           George looks at Edie who shrugs.

                                 MYRA
                        When you have time to rehearse, ya 
                        suck.  Improv was your thing and 
                        you had to be drunk.  But you're 
                        not are you? Never seen it before. 
                        Like finding a goddamn unicorn.

           She looks at Edie.

                                 MYRA
                        I can only imagine how hard it was 
                        for you to be nice to him if you 
                        know him.

                                 NURSE EDIE
                           (wiping her forehead)
                        Actually broke out in a sweat.

                                 MYRA
                        I got it from here.

           Nurse Edie leaves.  Myra just laughs some more.

                                 GEORGE
                        I know this is hard for you Myra, 
                        but try and cheer up. 

                                 MYRA
                           (smiling)
                        I'm sorry. This is just awful.

           She laughs again.

                                 GEORGE
                        I can see you didn't have time to 
                        rehearse.

                                 MYRA
                        Oh no, I did.  I've been rehearsing 
                        this day for the last twenty three 
                        years.  All those nights when I 
                        cried and said, one day, one day 
                        he's gonna need me. Well sweety, 
                        here we are.

           She laughs again.
                                 MYRA
                        Feels so good.

                                 GEORGE
                        Depends on what side of the 
                        terminal hospital bed you're on.

           She just stares at him.

                                 GEORGE
                        You got old.

                                 MYRA
                        Maybe you should tell me that in 
                        six months, and then I'll tell you
                        how you look.  How would that be?

                                 GEORGE
                        You can't seriously be taking all 
                        this pleasure from me finding out 
                        I'm going to die?

                                 MYRA
                        That's not where I'm getting the 
                        pleasure.  I'm getting it from the 
                        fact that you need me.  It's the 
                        best orgasm I ever got from you.

                                 GEORGE
                        I gave you a lot of orgasms.

                                 MYRA
                        You gave me more headaches, more 
                        heartaches.  The pain was a boulder 
                        to your pebble of pleasure.

                                 GEORGE
                        I see you've been working on your 
                        metaphors.

                                 MYRA
                        Been working on a lot of things.

                                 GEORGE
                        I have a feeling I’m about to see 
                        how your “fuck off” has evolved. 

                                 MYRA
                        Practiced the whole way over.  

                                 GEORGE
                        All right, let’s hear it.

           He points to the Spanish soap opera.

                                 GEORGE
                        So I can find out if it really is 
                        Hector's baby.

                                 MYRA
                        What do you need from me?  What 
                        could I possibly give you that I 
                        haven’t already given you?
           George turns down the volume and looks at her. 

                                 GEORGE
                        The only thing I’ve ever given you.

                                 MYRA
                        Shit? 

                                 GEORGE
                        The ring.  

                                 MYRA
                        You gonna ask somebody else to 
                        marry you?  

           George just gives her a look.  

                                 MYRA
                        How did you go through all your 
                        relative’s money?  

                                 GEORGE 
                        My uncles and aunts had fuck ups of 
                        their own to support. I need it. 

                                 MYRA
                        You can’t have it.  

                                 GEORGE
                        What use do you have for it?  

                                 MYRA
                        A lot more now than when I was 
                        wearing it, cause it actually means 
                        something to you now.     

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s mine!  

                                 MYRA
                           (getting angry)
                        It was your mother’s! And she had 
                        to put it on my finger herself 
                        cause she knew you wouldn’t be able 
                        to find it! So romantic. But to 
                        your credit, you did pass out on 
                        your knees.    

                                 GEORGE
                        I could always find your finger. 
                        Your middle one anyway. It was the 
                        house I had trouble with.  

                                 MYRA
                        You don’t have one to find anymore. 
                        I'm surprised they never arrested 
                        you for arson, cause you burned 
                        every bridge you crossed.

                                 GEORGE
                           (pleading)
                        Please, no more metaphors.
                                 MYRA
                        Where ya gonna go?  

                                 GEORGE
                        Where you always told me too, Hell. 
                        I just need a waiting room. I’m 
                        dying. You won. All I’m asking for 
                        is something that means nothing to 
                        you and would mean everything to 
                        me.  

                                 MYRA
                        I can’t give ya what you want. That 
                        never helped anybody.   

                                 GEORGE
                        I was surprisingly okay with it.  

                                 MYRA
                        You want it, you have to earn it.  

                                 GEORGE
                           (looking around)
                        Who are you talking to?  

                                 MYRA
                        I’m gonna take you in.  

           George is shocked as she leans in. 

                                 MYRA
                        The kids, your kids, remember?  The 
                        little excuses that provided you 
                        with another reason to get drunk 
                        and leave right behind "the Yankees 
                        lost, I have to find out why" and 
                        "just because I feel like it."  How 
                        could anyone argue with that?

                                 GEORGE
                        But you still tried.

                                 MYRA
                        They're successful, and they have 
                        kids, and they're all staying at 
                        the beach house. Two wonderful 
                        families having the best time.  

                                 GEORGE
                        You need somebody to fuck that up?   

                                 MYRA
                        I want them to see that it wasn’t 
                        their fault. I want you to see what 
                        you missed and I want them to see 
                        what they didn’t. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m not... 
                                 MYRA
                        You’re not gonna do what this time?  
                        How’s not doing all those things 
                        worked out for ya sweety?    

           She smiles at him.  

                                 MYRA
                        They're gonna push you out into the 
                        street.  Take your chances with 
                        people who loved you once.

                                 GEORGE
                        People who loved you once, and 
                        don't love you anymore, hate you.

                                 MYRA
                        But they'll feed you. You feel 
                        worse, they’ll feel better and then 
                        you can go and die with strangers.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Do you have any other motivation 
                        other than revenge?

                                 MYRA
                        If I do, I'm not aware of it, yet.

           George stares at the television.  He turns up the sound.

           INSERT TV SCREEN

           A woman is holding a child.

                                 SPANISH WOMAN
                        Hector, es su nino.

           The man reacts.

                                 GEORGE
                        I guess it could be worse.

           He shuts off the TV and looks at a smiling Myra.  He grabs 
           his IV.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Fill this with scotch?  

           INT. MYRA'S CAR - LATER

           Myra's still smiling as she drives.  George puts his hands on 
           the glass longingly as they pass a liquor store.

                                 MYRA
                        So what've you been...?

                                 GEORGE
                        Could we put away the question 
                        marks til we get to the house?  I'd 
                        prefer to get them all at once in 
                        between what I'm sure will be a 
                        whole bunch of exclamation points.
                                 MYRA
                        The days of you getting what you 
                        prefer are over.  But I'll give ya 
                        this one cause you're not gonna get 
                        another.  You're welcome.

           They drive for a little.

                                 MYRA
                           (singing)
                        What do you say?

           He turns and sees how happy she is.

                                 GEORGE
                        Thank you.

           She's really happy and drum rolls the steering wheel.

           EXT. LONG BRANCH NJ BEACH HOUSE - LATER

           They pull in to the beautiful home right on the water.

                                 GEORGE
                        This is yours?

                                 MYRA
                        You married me for my money 
                        remember?

                                 GEORGE
                        But we only got to that point 
                        because of that wonderful thing you 
                        could do with your tongue.

                                 MYRA
                        I remember you telling my father 
                        that after your sixth drink at my 
                        brother's wedding.

                                 GEORGE
                        Fifth drink, I wanted him to know I 
                        actually meant it. 

           Myra starts to get out. 

                                 GEORGE
                        But before he hit me, I saw a great 
                        deal of pride in his eyes.  
                        Father's always appreciate the 
                        talent of their children.

                                 MYRA
                        I hope you enjoyed that.  That's 
                        probably gonna be the last joke you 
                        tell for a little while.

           She gets out of the car.

                                 GEORGE
                        It wasn't a joke. And never 
                        underestimate a dying drunk.
           INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Myra enters, holding the door for George who walks in slowly.  
           Enter LINDA, late 30s, loud, obnoxious and overweight.

                                 LINDA
                           (quick)
                        Oh hey!  Where have you been?  All 
                        we're getting round here is where's 
                        Myra, where's Myra?  Here you are!  
                        Where'd ya go?  Who's this? Pickup 
                        a guy at the market?  Hi I'm Linda.

                                 GEORGE
                        Please tell me this one isn't mine.

                                 MYRA
                        This is David's wife.

                                 GEORGE
                        You are one of the few women I've 
                        met, that I was glad my DNA wasn't  
                        inside of. This is who my son 
                        married?

                                 LINDA
                        Your son?!  Oh my good gravy and 
                        corn!  Save the bricks and build 
                        something with ‘em, cause you can 
                        knock me over with a feather!

                                 GEORGE
                        Use the bricks if we have them.

                                 LINDA
                        Oh my goodness, Myra?!

                                 MYRA
                        I know.

                                 GEORGE
                        But they don't? They don't know I'm 
                        here?

                                 MYRA
                        I honestly just thought I was gonna 
                        tell you to fuck off. 

           Linda gasps at Myra's language.

                                 MYRA
                        Sorry. It's hard to talk to him 
                        without cursing. You’ll see.  

                                 LINDA
                           (whispering)
                        This is going to upset David.

                                 MYRA
                        Everything upsets David.
                                 LINDA
                        Yeah but this is...  I mean...  
                        Kaboom!

           She does a fire engine sound.

                                 GEORGE
                        The bar!  My God, please the bar!

           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Linda makes a beeline for DAVID, 40, good looking, straight-
           laced.  He's throwing a football around with SAL, late 30’s, 
           big, strong.  LIZ, late 30s, very pretty, plays with her two 
           daughters, AVA, 7, and JULIA, 2. MICHAEL, 15, a bit awkward, 
           is reading a book on the swing. George steps out on the deck 
           with Myra, and takes in the beautiful scenery of the beach.  

                                 MYRA
                        Wouldn’t this be a great place to 
                        die?   

           George watches from the deck as Linda grabs David’s hands  
           and talks. David starts ranting as Sal tries to calm him. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Die yes, be murdered, not so much.   

           Linda throws them a glance, then runs over to Liz. They watch 
           as she points and explains who George is. 

                                 GEORGE
                           (to Myra)
                        Look at her go.  If we had a few 
                        more children, she could've staved 
                        off obesity.

           Myra sees that George is nervous and rubs his back. She stops 
           when David looks over. He stares at them, then starts to walk 
           over purposefully. Linda sees this and runs after him. 
           Michael, Liz and the girls follow. George looks scared but 
           straightens up.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Is David a righty or a lefty?  

                                 LINDA
                        I told them.  Is that okay?

                                 DAVID
                        What the...?

                                 LINDA
                        Language, girls!

                                 DAVID
                        ...is going on here?!  What's he 
                        doing here Mom?!

                                 MYRA
                        David, this is your father...
                                 DAVID
                        Yeah we met, briefly!  Did you 
                        bring my childhood back?!

                                 GEORGE
                        I could've sworn I left it with 
                        you.

           David charges at him but Sal holds him back.  Julia cries.

                                 LINDA
                        David!  People are crying!

                                 LIZ
                        Mom why did you do this?!  Why did 
                        you bring him here?!

           She's about to talk then stops. She looks at everyone, then 
           takes George by the arm and walks him inside.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She closes and locks the glass door as everyone looks.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I feel like I'm watching animals at 
                        the zoo.

                                 MYRA
                        It's actually the other way around 
                        George. I'm thinking about 
                        something.

                                 GEORGE
                        Too late for an abortion. Although, 
                        this is New Jersey...

                                 MYRA
                        What if we don't tell them you're 
                        dying?

                                 GEORGE
                        Won't that provide them with 
                        greater motivation to kill me?

                                 MYRA
                        It’s too much.  Let’s just say 
                        you’re here to reconnect. That you 
                        actually want to be in their lives 
                        without wanting anything in return.

                                 GEORGE
                        You mean lie to them?

           She slaps him across the face.

                                 GEORGE
                        What was that for?  

                                 MYRA
                        Because that should be the truth 
                        you miserable bastard!    
                                 GEORGE
                        You've changed. You hit harder.

                                 MYRA
                        Hell ya I've changed!  You've 
                        changed me!  I'm the best there is 
                        when you're on my side of the line, 
                        but cross over it and I'm the 
                        meanest bitch you'd ever wanna see!  
                        That slap will feel like a tap, so 
                        put a cap on your rap!

           George is stunned.

                                 MYRA
                        Michael taught me that one.  Your 
                        grandson.

           Myra points to Michael whose face is against the glass.

                                 MYRA
                        I'm not asking or begging. You need 
                        me just so you can die, okay? 
                        That’s where you’re at and that 
                        leaves you outta options. 

           She moves him to the center of the room. 

                                 MYRA
                        There. You're equal distance to 
                        both doors.  There's the front door 
                        and there's...

           They look at everyone is staring at them through the glass.

                                 MYRA
                        Stand here and decide which you 
                        wanna use. I'm not gonna tell them 
                        anything. It's on you. 
                        Responsibility all on you. You've 
                        avoided it for sixty three years, 
                        maybe you should try it, for once. 
                        Fucking shame it’s because you have
                        to.  

           She grabs his face and makes him look at her.

                                 MYRA
                        Don't believe everything you fear.

           He looks at her and then at his family outside.  David mouths 
           a couple of curse words and Linda reacts.  Myra opens the 
           door to exit - for a moment we hear yelling. The door closes.

           George looks at them and takes a breath. PAN DOWN to see his 
           dirty old shoes take one step towards the yard, then stop. He 
           takes two steps the other way, then keeps walking out of the 
           front door. 

           Outside, Myra walks away with David trying to talk to her.  
           Everybody else moves away, Michael being the last.  
           EXT. LONG BRANCH TRAIN STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           George is panhandling for train fare.   

                                 FARE COLLECTOR
                        All aboard!  Penn Station Train!

           George looks up at him.  

                                 FARE COLLECTOR
                        Whatta ya got?   

                                 GEORGE
                        Nine.

           He waves him on.  George gets on as the train starts moving. 
           He starts thinking as he looks at Long Branch. He jumps off 
           the train.    

                                 FARE COLLECTOR
                        Whatta ya doing?!   

                                 GEORGE
                        Gotta get something to go back for.  

           The train pulls away and George starts to walk.   

           INT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

           It’s a quiet and uncomfortable table as everyone sneaks 
           glances at each other.  David drops his fork. 

                                 DAVID
                        I think we should talk about what 
                        happened today.

                                 LIZ
                        Now's not the time.

                                 DAVID
                        That's what you said an hour ago.  
                        I think now is the perfect time...

                                 LINDA
                        Actually according to my watch it's 
                        time to talk about how delicious 
                        this chicken is.

                                 DAVID
                           (to Linda)
                        Well then your watch is fast.

                                 SAL
                           (confused)
                        Is there like an itinerary or..?

                                 DAVID
                           (to Myra)
                        Why did you bring him here?

                                 MYRA
                        He's your father.
                                 DAVID
                        For the last twenty years, you said 
                        we couldn't say that. You had a 
                        special spoon that you would hit us 
                        with when we asked about him.

                                 LIZ
                        The daddy spoon.

                                 LINDA
                        You hit the children?

                                 MYRA
                        Threatened. It was plastic.

                                 LIZ
                        Wooden.

                                 MYRA
                        It was plastic.  

                                 LIZ
                        After the wooden one broke. 

                                 DAVID
                        It was the only time you hit us.

                                 LINDA
                        I don't think we should be talking 
                        about this in front of...

                                 MYRA
                        He's gone okay?  It's over.  We 
                        don't have to talk about...

           She turns to the kids.

                                 MYRA
                        I never hit them where it would 
                        hurt.  Just to remind them not to 
                        talk about the miserable...

                                 LINDA
                        Language.

                                 MYRA
                        Then I can't describe him.

           She straightens up as David starts again but Myra...

                                 MYRA
                        Linda talk about the chicken.

                                 LINDA
                        Why don’t we go around the table 
                        and give an adjective that 
                        describes it.  Michael?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Exanimate.
                                 SAL
                        What does that mean?

                                 LINDA
                        What do we do when we don't know a 
                        word Sal?  We look it up.

                                 SAL
                        I thought that was for the kids?

                                 LINDA
                        It's for everybody.

                                 SAL
                        Mike what does it mean?

                                 LINDA
                        Sal, that's not the rule.

                                 SAL
                        But I'm eating it now.  I'd like to 
                        know what it is when I'm eating it.

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        It means it's dead.

           Everyone turns to see George. Michael smiles slightly.  
           George sits down at the other end of the table and takes a 
           piece of chicken. He starts to eat.

                                 DAVID
                        What do you think you're doing?

                                 GEORGE
                        If it's my time to provide an 
                        adjective, I'll go with dry.  
                        Hopefully it will compliment my 
                        martini.

                                 DAVID
                        You get the hell out of here!

                                 LINDA
                        Language.

                                 MYRA
                        David relax.

                                 DAVID
                        Stop telling me what to do when I’m 
                        telling somebody what to do!  Don't 
                        take another bite of that chicken!

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh, is there a sauce?

                                 LINDA
                        Don't yell like a child.

                                 DAVID
                        How else would he recognize me?! 
                        You get outta right now or I'll...!
                                 MYRA
                           (standing)
                        Whose house is this?!

           David stops and looks at Myra.

                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 MYRA
                        Whose house is this?  

                                 DAVID
                        It's ours.

                                 MYRA
                        Who’s ours?

                                 DAVID
                        When Grandpa died, it was you, me 
                        and Liz.

                                 LINDA
                           (correcting)
                        You, Liz and I.

                                 MYRA
                        Okay.  I'll buy that.  So this 
                        should be put to a vote.

                                 DAVID
                        Fine.  Liz, tell him to get the 
                        hell out of here.

           Liz looks at Myra and then at George.

                                 LIZ
                        Whose idea was this?

                                 MYRA
                        It was George's.  He called me.

                                 LIZ
                        Why?

                                 MYRA
                        Because he...

                                 LIZ
                        Let him tell us.

           George looks at Myra, then at everyone.

                                 GEORGE
                        Because.... I'm sorry.

           He stares at them for a bit then goes back to eating.

                                 DAVID
                        Sorry?  That's it?  That's what you 
                        think will get you back into this 
                        house?  Oh man, oh you are really..
           He laughs.

                                 DAVID
                        Sure, no problem, walks right in 
                        grabs the biggest piece of 
                        chicken... Liz, tell him...

                                 LIZ
                        Okay.

           Myra smiles and Liz goes back to eating her food.

                                 DAVID
                        OKAY?!

           Liz makes quick eye contact with George who gives her a 
           little smile.  David starts to say something.

                                 LINDA
                        Language.

                                 DAVID
                        Has everybody gone... language 
                        here?! Either he goes, or I go!

                                 MYRA
                        We voted and you lost.

                                 DAVID
                        Well then I'm a Republican and I'm 
                        going to do what I want anyway.  
                        Linda, get everything!  We're 
                        leaving!

           Linda doesn't move.

                                 DAVID
                        Linda?

                                 LINDA
                        There was a vote.  Michael's 
                        watching. We need to set a good 
                        example.

                                 SAL
                        Dave, come on...

                                 DAVID
                        Sal, do you even know this much 
                        about what's going on right now?!  
                        Get your vocabulary together first 
                        and then help fix the family!

                                 SAL
                        I was gonna look it up if he...

                                 DAVID
                        I'm out of here! Everybody made 
                        their choice!  And it never seems 
                        to include me!

           David walks over and gets right into George's face.
                                 DAVID
                        Say something!  Say one thing!  One 
                        thing!  Just give me an excuse to 
                        have to apologize to the girls 
                        later, and tell them why you 
                        shouldn't hit!

           George looks into David's eyes.

                                 GEORGE
                        You look good.

           David flings George's plate off the table and leaves. 
           Everyone is quiet.

                                 SAL
                        I don't get the thing about 
                        Republicans.

                                 GEORGE
                        Neither does the rest of the 
                        country.

                                 SAL
                        I’m really, really confused here.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Now you’re a Democrat. 

           George smiles at Michael.

                                 LINDA
                        There was a lot of things wrong 
                        about what happened here.  I'm 
                        going to type them up tonight, just 
                        facts, no opinions, no finger 
                        pointing...

                                 GEORGE
                        Thank you Liz for accepting my 
                        apology.

                                 LINDA
                           (annoyed at George)
                        No interrupting.    

                                 LIZ
                        I didn't accept it, George. You're 
                        here cause my mother wants you 
                        here, no other reason.

                                 GEORGE
                        It's definitely not for the 
                        chicken. Least he left the glass.  
                        Who here has the heaviest pour?

                                 MYRA
                        There's no alcohol in the house.

           George pauses for a second, looking stunned. He straightens 
           up, and puts the glass down gently.
                                 GEORGE
                        Care to rethink your vote Liz?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           George sits uncomfortably on a recliner, looking around at 
           ITEMS OF VALUE.  Liz is reading to the girls, Sal watches the 
           game, and Michael is reading out on the porch.  Myra tries to 
           calm Linda who is stabbing frantically at her cellphone. 

                                 LINDA
                        He's not answering his cell.

                                 MYRA
                        I'm sure he's fine.  He just needs 
                        time to...

                                 LINDA
                        Should we call the hospital? He 
                        doesn't have any of his anti 
                        anxiety... Michael honey?

           Michael seems emotionless as he continues to read.  

                                 LINDA
                        Baby it's gonna be okay, okay?  
                        Your Daddy is going to be fine!

           He doesn’t even look up. 

                                 LINDA
                        Oh my God, he's devastated!

                                 LIZ
                        Sal can go look for him.

                                 SAL
                        Absolutely, right after the game.

                                 LIZ
                        Sal.

                                 SAL
                        It's the seventh inning.  What's 
                        gonna happen to him, in two innings 
                        that hasn't happened in seven?

                                 LIZ
                        With the Yankees's bullpen?! Go!

                                 SAL
                        You’re always treating him like a 
                        kid, he’s a grown man.  

                                 LINDA
                        He has certain idiosyncracies that 
                        you just aren’t aware of!  

           Sal pauses and looks around. 
                                 SAL
                           (reluctant)
                        Mike what does idio... 

                                 LINDA
                        Look it up!  

           Everyone starts yelling. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I'm going to take a walk.

           The room goes quiet as everybody looks at George. He gives a 
           slight nod, and walks out.

           EXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           George walks out and sees Michael.

                                 GEORGE
                        What are you reading there sport?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It's about the...

                                 GEORGE
                        Sounds fascinating.  Do you have 
                        any money?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.  My Dad ...

                                 GEORGE
                        You had me at no.  Is the car open?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I think...

                                 GEORGE
                        I like those odds.

           George walks to the car and opens it.  He rumbles around in 
           the glove compartment, then notices Myra staring at him.  He 
           closes the door, whistles and strolls off. 

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

           George is counting up the small amount of money he has while 
           the CLERK looks at him.

                                 GEORGE
                        I know what you're thinking.

                                 CLERK
                        What am I thinking?

                                 GEORGE
                        You're thinking I'm going to ask 
                        you for something.
                                 CLERK
                        Everybody asks me for something.  I  
                        think you're gonna ask me for 
                        something else.

                                 GEORGE
                        You've peaked my curiosity.  What 
                        do you think I'm going to ask you 
                        for?

                                 CLERK
                        A favor.

                                 GEORGE
                        Currently out of stock?

           He nods.

                                 GEORGE
                        None in the back?

                                 CLERK
                        Sold out about four years ago after 
                        my divorce and don't expect to get 
                        any more in.

                                 GEORGE
                        Maybe I'll wait.

                                 CLERK
                        You'll die first.

                                 GEORGE
                        I really feel like you know me.

           David walks in and freezes when he sees George. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Looks like this apple hasn't rolled 
                        as far away as it would've liked.

           David panics and looks at the Clerk.

                                 DAVID
                        I need directions.

                                 GEORGE
                        Okay. Take out your money, put it 
                        on the counter and point to the 
                        Glenlivet.

           David just stares at him.

                                 GEORGE
                        I know why you're here.

                                 CLERK
                        Shit even I know why he's here.
                                 GEORGE
                           (to the Clerk)
                        Use this time to figure out why 
                        your ex wife isn't.

           He takes a step closer to David.

                                 GEORGE
                        We're here for the same reason.  
                        Let's achieve our goal together and 
                        you can hate me again once we're in 
                        the parking lot with Glen or Johnny 
                        or Cutty.

           David still doesn't move.

                                 GEORGE
                        Whatever you say to me after will 
                        be fine because you can blame 
                        whatever you regret saying or 
                        forgot to say on the scotch. That's 
                        the most wonderful thing about 
                        scotch, all the wonderful excuses 
                        inside every bottle.

           David walks to the counter.

                                 DAVID
                        Johnny Walker Black.

                                 GEORGE
                        So proud you're not a racist.

                                 DAVID
                        Pint.

                                 GEORGE
                        Pint's not nearly enough...

           George grabs David's arm.

                                 GEORGE
                        Please...

           David pulls his arm away.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh is that all it takes?  How about 
                        please don't leave us?  I remember 
                        Mom saying that and I remember what 
                        you told her.

           He takes the pint and leaves.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't.

           The Clerk stares at him.

                                 GEORGE
                        His change?
           The Clerk takes it and puts it in his tip cup.

                                 CLERK
                        Now whatta ya gonna do?

                                 GEORGE
                        What I always do, follow the 
                        scotch.

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS

           George sees David drinking in his car, pulling away. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You can't drive with an open 
                        container!  I'll punish you!

           David stops.  He drinks as George runs over to his window.

                                 GEORGE
                        Don't drive drunk David!  Drive 
                        with a drunk.

           David looks at him and throws the bottle on to the pavement.

                                 GEORGE
                        No!

           It doesn't break and George scoops it up.

                                 GEORGE
                        Thank God they don't make things 
                        like they used to!

           George finishes the bottle quickly.

                                 GEORGE
                        I can breathe again. Everything is 
                        back to...

           David comes out of nowhere and pushes George to the ground.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS

                                 CLERK
                        Saw that coming.

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS

           George looks up at an angry David. 

                                 GEORGE
                        ...normal. 

                                 DAVID
                        You're a sonofabitch!
                                 GEORGE
                        If I had a dime every time someone 
                        said that standing over me in a 
                        liquor store parking lot while I 
                        wiped blood from my mouth, I'd 
                        have...  Enough to buy a pint.  
                        Advance me?

           David takes a step towards him with his fist clenched then 
           stops.  He releases his fist, gives George a look, then walks 
           back to the car. 

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        David? Come on.

           David stops as George gets to his feet.

                                 GEORGE
                        Come on and hit me.

                                 DAVID
                        Fuck you!

                                 GEORGE
                        Words don't work anymore, I've 
                        heard them all. You've dreamt about 
                        this, I know that. Hit me.

                                 DAVID
                        You're crazy.

                                 GEORGE
                        I've taken a lot of beatings from a 
                        lot of strangers who I know 
                        wouldn't get anywhere's close to 
                        the satisfaction you will out of 
                        it.  Come on, hit me then buy me a 
                        fifth. Maybe after, the words will 
                        work again.

           David waves his hand at him and starts to walk.

                                 GEORGE
                        You pussy!  Get the fuck over here 
                        and hit me!

                                 DAVID
                        You're pathetic!

                                 GEORGE
                        Not as pathetic as your fat, cunt 
                        wife!

           David runs back and tees off on him.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS

                                 CLERK
                        Goddamn that must feel good.

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS

           George looks up at a very angry David.
                                 DAVID
                        I hate you!

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh good, back to words. Now let’s..

           David kicks him hard in the face, knocking him out.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER

           George wakes up to find the Clerk smiling above him.

                                 GEORGE
                        How bad is a man's life when he's 
                        woken up to worse?

                                 CLERK
                        Shit, that was something man.  
                        You're a good Dad.

                                 GEORGE
                        That's what everybody says.

                                 CLERK
                        That's the best present you can 
                        give your son. If more fathers said 
                        sorry like you, this world would be 
                        a much happier place.

                                 GEORGE
                        You frighten me.

           The Clerk gives him a fifth of scotch.

                                 CLERK
                        It's the cheap stuff, but it works.

                                 GEORGE
                        Is this a favor?

                                 CLERK
                        You earned it.

                                 GEORGE
                        I earned something?

           The Clerk nods.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well there's a first time for 
                        everything.  I believe Monmouth is 
                        the closest hospital.

                                 CLERK
                        You're from around here?

                                 GEORGE
                        No.  But whereever I go, I make 
                        sure to note the closest hospital.

           George opens the scotch.
                                 GEORGE
                        Tell them to take their time.

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Myra is waiting for George who is wheeled out with bandages 
           covering his face.

                                 MYRA
                        Deja vu.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Myra's driving.

                                 MYRA
                        You really have to be an asshole to 
                        get people in this tax bracket to 
                        hit you.

                                 GEORGE
                        Life is all about accomplishment.  
                        That's everybody.  I can die now.

                                 MYRA
                        How are you feeling?

                                 GEORGE
                        Like I'm going to die now.

           He looks in the rear view mirror.

                                 GEORGE
                        I used to look much better after 
                        much worse.

                                 MYRA
                        So who...?

                                 GEORGE
                        It was David.

                                 MYRA
                        David who?

                                 GEORGE
                        The one we made, on purpose for 
                        some reason. I told him to hit me 
                        and he did.

                                 MYRA
                        He wouldn’t do something like that.

                                 GEORGE
                        That's what I was betting on, but 
                        the sonofabitch,(points to Myra) 
                        meaning it literally, had enough of 
                        me and/or you in him to do it.

                                 MYRA
                        Why?  Besides all of the reasons.
                                 GEORGE
                        Because I told him too.

           Myra just looks over at George who's looking out the window, 
           discreetly rubbing his liver. 

                                 GEORGE
                        That was the first time I ever felt 
                        worse the night before than the 
                        morning after. I wanted to pass 
                        out, but there wasn't enough scotch 
                        to do it.

                                 MYRA
                        You didn't feel guilty did you?

                                 GEORGE
                        How dare you?!  Blasphemy! I owed 
                        him something, and I didn't have 
                        anything to give him. I knew that's 
                        what he really wanted.  Better than 
                        the bike on Christmas.

           Myra laughs.

                                 MYRA
                        Bullshit. You figured if he felt 
                        better or guilty he would buy you a 
                        bottle.  Hard to believe looking at 
                        you that it was still all about you 
                        getting what you want.   

           She laughs as George smiles slightly. 

                                 MYRA
                        You are so much more fun to watch 
                        when I don't care anymore.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well that's why I'm here Myra, for 
                        your amusement, correct?

                                 MYRA
                        Why else would you be here?

           Myra smiles at George who gives a quick one back.  

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           Myra helps George along the hallway.  

                                 MYRA
                        Let me get something for the pain.  

           She opens her door and George notices her jewelry box on her 
           dresser.  She walks out and closes the door.   

           INT. GEORGE'S ROOM - LATER

           Myra brings him into the room and puts him on the bed.
                                 MYRA
                        Want me to help you put on your 
                        pajamas?

                                 GEORGE
                        The clothes I go out with, are 
                        always my pajamas.

           Myra just looks at him for a bit.

                                 MYRA
                        I think you made the right choice 
                        to stay.

                                 GEORGE
                        I said the same thing when they put 
                        me in the ambulance. Give me the 
                        ring.  I don’t belong here.  

                                 MYRA
                        Not yet.  

                                 GEORGE
                        What do I have to do?  

                                 MYRA
                        Make them believe that.  

           She smiles and looks at him.  She starts to give him a kiss, 
           then remembers and pulls back. She leaves and closes the 
           door, leaving it dark.

                                 GEORGE
                        How hard can it be?  

           INT. KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY

           George stumbles down the stairs and sees Liz.

                                 GEORGE
                        Good morning.

                                 LIZ
                        It's two o'clock.

                                 GEORGE
                        When you're a drunk, two o'clock is 
                        the morning.

                                 LIZ
                        There's coffee. How do you take it?

                                 GEORGE
                        With brandy.

                                 LIZ
                        There's no alco...
                                 GEORGE
                        Please don't say it. There’s 
                        nothing worse then having a sleep 
                        full of nightmares and then waking 
                        up to worse.  

                                 LIZ
                        I'll make it like I take it.

                                 GEORGE
                        I hope you like yours with brandy.

           She puts it on the table in front of him and sits down.  She 
           just stares at him as he takes a sip.

                                 GEORGE
                        Black?

                                 LIZ
                        I don’t need a lot.  As long as it 
                        works. 

           He takes another sip.

                                 LIZ
                        So David kicked the shit out of you 
                        huh?

                                 GEORGE
                        Is he telling everyone?

                                 LIZ
                        No, Linda went around telling 
                        everybody not to tell anybody. 
                        What’d you say to make him hit you?  

                                 GEORGE
                        That his wife is a cunt.

                                 LIZ
                        That's a horrible word.

                                 GEORGE
                        Find a better adjective when it's 
                        your turn.

           She just continues to stare at George.  George notices and 
           stares right back.  Ava walks in and sees her. 

                                 AVA
                        What're you doing Mommy?

                                 LIZ
                        I'm staring at him.

                                 AVA
                        Why?

                                 LIZ
                        Cause I haven't seen him in a 
                        while.  He's my Daddy.
                                 AVA
                        Uncle David said no.

                                 GEORGE
                        What did Uncle David say I was?

                                 AVA
                        Aunt Linda said language before he 
                        could say.

                                 GEORGE
                        Do you know what Aunt Linda is?

                                 LIZ
                        George...

           George smiles and takes another sip of his coffee.

                                 LIZ
                        See his nose, if it was straight, 
                        it's just like my nose.

           Ava looks.

                                 LIZ
                        And see his eyes, they're the same 
                        color as mine.

           Ava looks into George's eyes and then into Liz's.

                                 AVA
                        They are.

                                 LIZ
                        And see, George smile.

           George smiles at Ava.

                                 AVA
                        There you are Mommy.

                                 LIZ
                        There I am.  So that's why I'm 
                        staring.

           They all stare at each other for a little while.

                                 LIZ
                           (to Ava)
                        What're you staring at?

                                 AVA
                        I'm trying to see me. I'm in there 
                        too right?

                                 LIZ
                        Somewhere. Hopefully not too much.  

           George gives Liz a look before meeting Ava’s gaze. She puts 
           her hand on his face and pushes everything back.
                                 AVA
                        There I am!

           Ava giggles as George looks at her.  He looks over at Liz who 
           breaks a slight smile. She taps Ava. 

                                 LIZ
                        Go get ready.

           Ava lets go of George's face and runs out.

                                 LIZ
                        Wanna come to the movies with us? 

                                 GEORGE
                        I have a lot of bleeding to do. 
                        It’s not as thin as usual so I'm 
                        going to have to work extra ...

                                 LIZ
                           (frustrated)
                        You know, you can just talk. I'm 
                        not gonna be impressed with your 
                        words.

           She gets up.

                                 LIZ
                        And you already know how I feel 
                        about your actions.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't know what else that leaves 
                        us with.

                                 LIZ
                        Me either.

           Liz walks out.  After a few beats David walks in.

                                 DAVID
                        Liz....?

           He stares at George.

                                 GEORGE
                        She just left.

           David starts to go, then stops.

                                 DAVID
                        I'm sorry about....

                                 GEORGE
                        No no. You did what your father 
                        told you to do. I believe that 
                        makes you a good boy.

                                 DAVID
                        I'm sorry about the kick, that's 
                        all.  It doesn't change anything.
                                 GEORGE
                        Except the placement of my nose.

                                 DAVID
                        You're not going to charm me okay?

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't charm men David, I 
                        antagonize them. Of all the liquor 
                        store parking lot beatings I've 
                        had, I have to admit, that was the 
                        most heart felt. 

                                 DAVID
                        It didn't mean anything to me.

                                 GEORGE
                        I have fourteen stitches that say 
                        it did. If it felt good you should 
                        say it. Words I've failed by.

                                 DAVID
                        It didn't.

           David leaves but as he does...

                         DAVID
                                                     GEORGE
                (quietly to himself)
                                             (quietly to himself)
           Yes it did.
                                           Yes it did. 

           Myra walks in.

                                 MYRA
                        There you are.

                                 GEORGE
                        Am I in a play?

                                 MYRA
                        We're going. Michael's staying.  He 
                        has a friend over. Maybe you could 
                        talk to him when his friend leaves. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I'll give it a try, how hard does 
                        he kick?

           Myra sits down.

                                 MYRA
                        He um, they're having some trouble 
                        with him.

                                 GEORGE
                        And you want me to pale in 
                        comparison?

                                 MYRA
                        Not anything bad, just nothing 
                        good.  He's just never happy.  
                        Maybe you can help him. 
                                 GEORGE
                        Absolutely.  He may miss his mother 
                        for the first couple months, but I 
                        think in the long run...

                                 MYRA
                        Asshole.

           She gets up and leaves.

                                 GEORGE
                        I will need help moving the body!  
                        Clueless piano movers maybe.

           George stands up and throws his coffee into the sink. He 
           looks at the calendar on the wall.  There are two days until 
           Sunday.  He turns and walks upstairs.  

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           George walks quietly to Myra’s door. It’s locked.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Goddamn smart woman.  And then she 
                        wonders why I left. What’s the 
                        point of being a smart man if 
                        you’re with a smart woman?   

           As he walks he sees the walls covered with pictures of 
           everybody over the years. He sees an old one of Myra and the 
           kids years earlier.  He looks closer and sees him in the 
           back, with a drink, talking to another woman. 

                                 GEORGE 
                        Which poses the question is a smart 
                        man smart if he stays with a smart 
                        woman? 

           He looks back at Myra and the kids, and then hears something 
           in another room.  George starts to open Michael's door.

                                 GEORGE
                        Michael, I'm going to give you one 
                        more chance to give me ....

           He opens the door and sees KEVIN, Michael's friend, 
           performing oral sex on him.

                                 GEORGE
                        ...my eye sight back.

           George slams the door and runs downstairs.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           George is tearing through the cabinets. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Please God, I would perform the 
                        same act on a barn animal for a 
                        wine cooler!
           He tears through the refrigerator as Michael walks in.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Grandpa?

                                 GEORGE
                        Now is when you decide to call me 
                        Grandpa for the first time?!  Paint 
                        this one Norman Rockwell!

           He pulls out a bowl of grapes and puts them on the table.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Can I talk to you about what 
                        happened?

                                 GEORGE
                        Don’t bother, I know how it ends!

           George starts pounding the grapes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What're you doing?

                                 GEORGE
                        Making wine!  Ferment! Ferment!

                                 MICHAEL
                        I can't talk to my parents about 
                        this.

                                 GEORGE
                        So you can't talk to their parents 
                        about it either!

                                 MICHAEL
                        But you've seen everything.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes!  Now I have!

                                 MICHAEL
                        Please, I don't know how to feel.  
                        I'm scared.

           George pauses and sees Michael's upset.  He stops pounding 
           the grapes and reluctantly sits down.  He pushes the other 
           chair out for Michael.  George stares at him before talking.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't know if I can help you 
                        Michael.  I'm as confident a 
                        heterosexual as there is. I always 
                        face a woman when I make love to 
                        her and I always make sure there's 
                        one around so I don't have to 
                        handle a penis.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You mean you never...?

                                 GEORGE
                        Not since teen suffixed my age.
                                 MICHAEL
                        That's amazing.

                                 GEORGE
                        It's expensive.

                                 MICHAEL
                        How do you pee?

                                 GEORGE
                        I wait til it's already out for 
                        something else.

           Michael is looking at George like a clueless puppy.

                                 GEORGE
                        So you're gay, hey?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don't know.

                                 GEORGE
                        It appeared as though you were 
                        certain.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I think Kevin knows better than I 
                        do.

                                 GEORGE
                        Kevin was the young man...?

           George motions with his hand and Michael nods.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes Kevin did appear pretty 
                        confident. How did you feel?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I didn't really feel anything.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well Kevin's young, he'll get 
                        better.  At least he's not a biter, 
                        I could tell you stories...

                                 MICHAEL
                        I mean, inside.  He asked me, well 
                        he's been asking me and I finally 
                        said yes.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well I guess the question is, why 
                        did you say yes?

           Michael thinks.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I guess because no one ever asked 
                        me before.
                                 GEORGE
                        You've never had the opportunity 
                        with a woman?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.

                                 GEORGE
                        How old are you?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Fifteen. And a half.

           George thinks then pounds the table.

                                 GEORGE
                        Okay! Do you need to clean up?

                                 MICHAEL
                        What do you mean?

           George motions to Michael's crotch and makes a sound. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh no, I didn't...

                                 GEORGE
                        Then it's not official!  Come on! 
                        We still have time!

           EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           George and Michael are running out to the car.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Do you know how to drive?

                                 GEORGE
                        I learned once. Just haven't done 
                        it in a while.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why not?

           They get in.

                                 GEORGE
                        Because there's a silly law that 
                        requires you to be sober.  Never 
                        had a big enough window in between 
                        drinks for that to happen.

           George starts the car.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Are you sober now?  

                                 GEORGE
                        Absolutely!  There's nothing to 
                        worry about.

           George runs into Sal's truck but keeps going.
                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        Looks like I have a note to write.

           INT. CAR- LATER

                                 MICHAEL
                        Would you have a problem with me 
                        being gay?

           George makes a face and a sound like he's trying to say what 
           he doesn't want to say.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You don't like gay people?

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't have any problems with gay 
                        people.  They're born a way and I'm 
                        born another.  I can't understand 
                        why a man would want what he's got 
                        instead of what he doesn't. The 
                        very definition of man is to want 
                        what he doesn't have.  But as far 
                        as you go, my blood is in your 
                        vein, so I feel invested to know 
                        where my blood is going in and out 
                        of. And since you have a piece of 
                        me in you, I don't want a piece of 
                        somebody else in you until we're 
                        sure it belongs there.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where are we going?

                                 GEORGE
                        To find out what everything I just 
                        fucking said really means!

           EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK - LATER

           They are driving through a bad neighborhood.

           INT. APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           PAMELA, forties, Hispanic, slutty opens the door.

                                 PAMELA
                        Georgie!  Ahh!

           She gives him a big hug.

                                 JACK (O.S)
                        Who's that?

                                 PAMELA
                        It's Georgie!

                                 JACK (O.S.)
                        Which Georgie?

                                 PAMELA
                        Old Georgie!
           She makes a sad face.

                                 PAMELA
                        I'm sorry Georgie.  We have a lot 
                        of Georgies.

                                 GEORGE
                        Is drunk Georgie taken?

           She nods.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well those are the only two words 
                        to describe me so, Old Georgie is 
                        here!

                                 PAMELA
                        Yay!

           She sees Michael as she closes the door.

                                 PAMELA
                        Who's this?

                                 GEORGE
                        Confused Michael. Is that name 
                        okay?

                                 PAMELA
                        Nobody who comes to see me is 
                        confused. Come in, I missed you!

           They walk in and see JACK, late thirties, fat, slob loser 
           playing video games.

                                 JACK
                        Hey Georgie.

                                 GEORGE
                        Has the Halo coming Jack?

                                 JACK
                        On Halo three now. Gotta keep up.

                                 GEORGE
                        Must I?

                                 PAMELA
                        So Michael why don't you go play 
                        with Jack while Georgie and I go in 
                        the other room and talk?

                                 GEORGE
                        Actually, Michael is going to be 
                        carrying the bulk of the 
                        conversation today.

                                 PAMELA
                        Whatta ya mean?
                                 GEORGE
                        You're going to be "talking" to 
                        Michael.

           George thrusts his hips back and forth.

                                 PAMELA
                        How old is he?

                                 GEORGE
                        Fifteen.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And a half.

                                 JACK
                        Extra.

                                 PAMELA
                        No extra, no way.  I don't do 
                        nothing weird George.

                                 GEORGE
                        Let me talk to you Pamela.

                                 JACK
                        You're supposed to talk to me 
                        George.

                                 GEORGE
                        And I will after the grown ups have 
                        finished.

           George takes Pamela into the bedroom.  Jack looks at Michael.

                                 JACK
                        First time?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I uh, I don't know.  There might be 
                        some debate.

                                 JACK
                        Better then masturbate.  You play?

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           George is sitting on the bed with Pamela. 

                                 PAMELA
                        Oh my God!  At least it wasn't the 
                        other way around.

                                 GEORGE
                        I haven't had time yet to process 
                        the lesser of two evils, but it's 
                        imperative that my grandson has the 
                        opportunity to become heterosexual 
                        as quickly as possible.

                                 PAMELA
                        I didn't know it was this serious.
                                 GEORGE
                        If he's gay, he's gay, we can blame 
                        it on his mother and everybody will 
                        understand. I just want his penis 
                        to able to say, I was there.

                                 PAMELA
                        Absolutely.

                                 GEORGE
                        I'll need you at your best.

                                 PAMELA
                        It'll be the best I ever done.

                                 GEORGE
                        You are the hooker with the heart 
                        of gold Pamela. Thanks for doing 
                        this.

           He gets up.

                                 GEORGE

           He starts to walk out then looks back.  She smiles and nods.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           George walks out and sees Michael.

                                 JACK
                        Perfect timing, hurry up, I'm 
                        almost up to the sloth!

                                 GEORGE
                        Please wait if you can. Watching a 
                        sloth die is on my bucket list.   
                        Michael, she's ready for you.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I'm scared.

           George puts his hands on Michael's shoulders and bends down.

                                 GEORGE
                        There’ll be a lot of fears in your 
                        life, but I promise you, this won't 
                        be one of them. The fear comes 
                        three weeks later at the clinic. 
                        Just clear your mind and let Pamela 
                        take care of the body. It'll tell 
                        your mind everything you need to 
                        know.  Everything's going to be all 
                        right, either way. I promise. This 
                        is what Grandpa's are for.

           Michael smiles and nods.

                                 GEORGE
                        Go on, your hooker's waiting.
           Michael walks to Pam and she walks him in.  George just 
           stares at him and then sits down as Jack continues to play.

                                 GEORGE
                        Jack, do you know a good fence?  

                                 JACK
                        What’re you looking to move?  

                                 GEORGE
                        Jewelry.  

                                 JACK
                        You’ll get fucked but you’ll get 
                        something out of it.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Spoken like a true pimp.   

           Jack pauses the game and looks at George lovingly. 

                                 JACK
                        Thank you for that.  

           Jack unpauses the game and describes the action. George looks 
           over at the door, and then sinks into his chair with a slight 
           smile on his face. He doesn't even notice that he's sitting 
           right next to a TABLE FULL OF LIQUOR.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           George has fallen asleep but wakes when Pam opens the door.

                                 PAMELA
                        Ya know that boy that went in there 
                        with me?  He's gone!

                                 JACK
                        I told ya that window!  I gotta 
                        chase the little bastard now?

                                 PAMELA
                        And now, he's a man!

           George stands up as a very happy Michael walks out. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Did you like it? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        It was the best thing of my life!

                                 PAMELA
                        I would be more emotional if I 
                        didn't hear it so much. 

           George walks over and puts his hand on his shoulder.
                                 GEORGE
                        Remember it, because from now on, 
                        all it's going to do is make you 
                        spend money and do things you don't 
                        want to do to keep getting it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don't care!

           George gets emotional.

                                 GEORGE
                        Now, you really are a man!

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Michael is smiling and George notices.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What're we gonna tell my parents?

                                 GEORGE
                        Whatever you want to.

                                 MICHAEL
                        They're gonna want to know where we 
                        were. We gotta come up with a good 
                        lie.

           George's smile fades.

                                 GEORGE
                        What happened to you today?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I...

                                 GEORGE
                        Not what you did, what you said you 
                        became.

                                 MICHAEL
                        A man?

                                 GEORGE
                           (nodding)
                        It's your first day as a man. Know 
                        what that means.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What?

                                 GEORGE
                        That's not a question.

           George looks over at him.

                                 GEORGE
                        Know what that means.
           INT. HOUSE - LATER

           David and Linda are arguing with Myra trying to calm them 
           down when Michael runs into the house with a huge smile.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh thank God!

                                 LINDA
                        Where were you?!  We were worried 
                        sick!  Are you okay?!

                                 MICHAEL
                        I love you both so much!

           He gives them both a big hug. David and Linda are confused.

                                 LINDA
                        Something's wrong!

                                 DAVID
                           (to George)
                        What did you do to him?!

                                 GEORGE
                        I didn't do anything to him.

                                 DAVID
                        Who did?!

                                 GEORGE
                        Two people. One, better than the 
                        other. 

           George knocks on the bannister and looks at a confused Myra 
           who is standing by the kitchen door.

                                 DAVID
                           (to Michael)
                        Why are you so happy?

                                 LINDA
                        I'm scared.  He's smiling!

           She starts to cry.

                                 LINDA
                           (crying )
                        My son is smiling, what could be 
                        wrong?! 

                                 DAVID
                        Are you on drugs?

                                 LINDA
                        Oh God, please no! Anything but 
                        that!

           Linda downs her glass of wine.

                                 GEORGE
                        There's wine?!
                                 DAVID
                        There's another beating coming if 
                        he's on drugs!

                                 MICHAEL
                        I'm not on drugs.

                                 GEORGE
                        But I will keep taking the trade 
                        off if you have more scotch to 
                        throw at me.

           David walks over to George.

                                 DAVID
                        What did you do with our son?!

           Sal walks in and sees Michael smiling.

                                 SAL
                        Hey, why's Mike smiling?  Whatta he 
                        get laid?

                                 LINDA
                           (screaming)
                        Language!

           Sal freezes with fright. David doesn't even turn around, he 
           just keeps his stare on George but his face changes.

                                 DAVID
                        You didn't.

                                 GEORGE
                        I have a feeling my scar is about 
                        to have some company. Should I 
                        assume the fetal position?

           David turns around and faces Michael.

                                 DAVID
                        You had sex?

                                 LINDA
                        No he...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes!  

           Linda screams. 

                                 DAVID
                        With a woman?

           Michael nods. Sal pumps his fist. 

                                 SAL
                        Yo! Your Dad was thinking you might 
                        be...

           They all look at Sal who turns his fist pump into a limp 
           wrist and moves it back and forth. 
                                 SAL
                        Am I all right saying "yo" there?

                                 GEORGE
                        Maybe you should look it up to be 
                        sure.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yo!

                                 LINDA
                        NO!

                                 GEORGE
                        Yo.

                                 SAL
                        High five?

                                 GEORGE
                        Had me, then you lost me.

                                 LINDA
                        My baby!  My baby is gone!

                                 DAVID
                        Linda relax!

                                 LINDA
                        Relax?!  Our son was molested!

                                 MICHAEL
                        No I wasn’t. I did most of it.

                                 GEORGE
                        Get what you paid for I guess.

                                 DAVID
                        You liked it?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I loved it!  It was, it was like 
                        poetry, and sunsets and waterfalls 
                        and rainbows.  It was just the most 
                        beautiful thing I've ever 
                        experienced in my life.

                                 LINDA
                        Who was it with?!

                                 GEORGE
                        A hooker on west one hundred and 
                        thirty fourth street.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I love her.

                                 LINDA
                        You took my son to a hooker?!
                                 GEORGE
                        No, I took him to sunsets and 
                        waterfalls and rainbows don't you 
                        listen?

           David continues staring at Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Dad it changed me. I know who I am 
                        now.

                                 LINDA
                        You might be someone with a 
                        venereal disease!  We have to get 
                        him to a doctor!

                                 DAVID
                        Who are you?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I'm a man.

                                 LINDA
                        Sex doesn't make you a man!

           Sal and George rolls their eyes at each other as David is 
           fixed on Michael. 

                                 LINDA
                        I'm calling the police! 

                                 DAVID
                        Shut up Linda.

                                 LINDA
                        What?!

                                 GEORGE
                        At least let her say "yo."  It's 
                        not fair if everybody else...

                                 LINDA
                        How dare you talk to me like...?!

           David turns to Linda. 

                                 DAVID
                        Look at him! Look at our son! 

           David looks back at a smiling Michael. 

                                 DAVID
                        He's happy.

           David just stares at Michael for a bit.  He gets a little 
           emotional and the two of them share a moment.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Can I go tell all my friends?

                                 LINDA
                        You are telling no one!
                                 DAVID
                        On the phone, no Facebook, no 
                        Twitter.

           He taps Michael on the shoulders and Michael starts to run 
           upstairs, then stops and runs back to George, hugging him.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Thanks Grandpa.

           George closes his eyes and squeezes Michael back. George 
           opens his eyes and sees Myra looking at him. He breaks off 
           and runs upstairs, high fiving Sal on his way.

                                 SAL
                        I knew I'd get one.

           David looks back at George then walks outside.

                                 LINDA
                        Can somebody explain to me what 
                        just happened here?!

                                 GEORGE
                        Absolutely.  When a man gets 
                        sexually aroused, blood enters into 
                        his penis giving him what we call 
                        an erection.

                                 LINDA
                        Here you motherfucking cocksucker!

           Just as Liz walks in with the girls.

                                 LIZ
                        Oh my God Linda, language.

                                 GEORGE
                        Linda, it appears as though your 
                        son just became a man.  And you got 
                        as close to it as you could without 
                        things getting weird. 

                                 LINDA
                        You stay away from me!

                                 GEORGE
                        And I was thinking this day 
                        couldn't get any better.

           Linda leaves.  George looks at Sal.

                                 GEORGE
                        What the hell.

           He runs over and gives Sal a high five.

                                 GEORGE
                        It appears we've found the 
                        relationship we're going to have.
           George looks for Myra who's already gone. He goes upstairs as 
           Sal notices George put a note in his hand. 

                                 LIZ
                        What's going on?

                                 SAL
                        Your father and I just had a 
                        moment. Oh and he took Michael to a 
                        hooker and made him a man.  

           Sal reads the note. 

                                 SAL
                        Shit!  

                                 LINDA (O.S.)
                        Language!  

                                 SAL
                           (to Liz)
                        There ain’t a chance George has 
                        insurance right?  

           Liz ignores him and sees David on the deck with Myra. 

           INT. GEORGE'S ROOM - LATER

           George is staring at himself in the mirror.

                                 GEORGE
                        Thank you Grandpa.  Who would've 
                        thunk it?

           Myra opens the door. 

                                 MYRA
                        Never wanna just dip you toe in 
                        huh?  Always gotta dive right in?

                                 GEORGE
                        It's what I do.  

                                 MYRA
                        You should try swimming sometime 
                        since you’re already in. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You know I can't swim.

                                 MYRA
                        The ocean's right there.  Maybe 
                        now's a good time to learn.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m a better drowner and I already 
                        have a way to die.    

           She shakes her head and close the door.  

                                 GEORGE
                        And you know I never learn.
           George hears yelling.  He gets up and opens his window.

           INT. DAVID AND LINDA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David and Linda are arguing as Linda's packing.

                                 DAVID
                        You're not taking him!

                                 LINDA
                        I'm taking him out of here and to 
                        as many doctors as I can find!  Do 
                        you understand a crime has just 
                        taken place?!  Our son was molested 
                        and your father facilitated it!

                                 DAVID
                        My father just made that kid smile 
                        for the first time in I don't know 
                        how long!  He did something we 
                        couldn't do!

                                 LINDA
                        Are you defending what he did?!  
                        The person you hate more than...

                                 DAVID
                        I'm not defending. I don't know 
                        okay?  I, I have a son but, I don't 
                        know.  I didn't have anybody to 
                        show me how to do things. I don't 
                        know what I'm doing.

                                 LINDA
                        Well I do, and...

                                 DAVID
                        You read fucking books!  I'm not 
                        talking about that!

           He calms himself and sits on the bed. 

                                 DAVID
                        I learned how to be a man from a 
                        woman. I've got problems.  I don't 
                        know what he needs a lot of times. 
                        And yes we all thought the story 
                        we'd be telling would be the big 
                        hit or catch or shot to win the 
                        game and not this, but this is what 
                        happened.  And this is what worked.  
                        And when you don't know what the 
                        fuck to do, I'll take this!

           He puts his head in his hands.

                                 DAVID
                        I don't know how to do things! 
                        Okay?! I need help! I needed help.

           He starts to cry and Linda comes over.
                                 DAVID
                        I don't know. He's happy, okay? My 
                        son is happy, that’s all I care 
                        about.  

           INT. GEORGE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           George is sitting on the bed with his head in his hands.

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           George walks out of his room. He’s passing Liz's room when he 
           hears her speaking French and peeks his head in.  He sees Liz 
           on the phone when Sal comes out of the shower.  He watches 
           Liz on the phone for a little while and then looks back at 
           Sal who holds up his shorts.

                                 SAL
                        Got ‘em.  Got ‘em babe.

           She gives him a mock thumbs up and continues her 
           conversation.  She pauses for a second when she sees George 
           and then talks much quieter. Sal walks out.

                                 SAL
                        Hey ya Georgie!

           He puts up his hand for a high five.

                                 GEORGE
                        Let's not abuse it.  Who is Liz 
                        talking to?

                                 SAL
                        Her boss.

                                 GEORGE
                        Her boss is French?

                                 SAL
                        Yeah, I guess.  Her company has 
                        "world" in the title so ya know, 
                        they deal with the world and French 
                        things and...

           George is smiling the whole time as he listens to her.

                                 GEORGE
                        What’s her boss's name?

                                 SAL
                        Phil Rosenthal.

                                 GEORGE
                        Phil Rosenthal, the Frenchman.

                                 SAL
                           (motioning to Liz)
                        Apparently.

           Liz sees George listening and tries to talk quieter.  Sal 
           moves towards the door.  
                                 SAL
                        Feel like taking a swim?  

                                 GEORGE 
                        Yes, but not in the ocean.  

           Sal looks confused as George smiles at Liz. 

                                 SAL
                        George, what can you give me for 
                        the dent? 

                                 GEORGE
                        Put up your hand.  

           Sal puts up his hand.  George gives him a high five and slams 
           the door closed.  He turns back around at Liz who quickly 
           ends the conversation.  

                                 LIZ
                        Hi.

                                 GEORGE
                        Ça va?

                                 LIZ
                        It's for my job.

                                 GEORGE
                        You know Elizabeth I speak French 
                        as well.

                                 LIZ
                           (scared)
                        Oh?

                                 GEORGE
                        Oui, oui, oui.  I heard everything 
                        you said to Monsieur Rosenthal.

           Liz freezes.

                                 GEORGE
                        You're having an affair.  And you 
                        went as far as to learn another 
                        language so you could do it.

                                 LIZ
                        I don't know what to say.

                                 GEORGE
                        I do.

           He walks towards her.

                                 GEORGE
                        I'm so proud of you!

           He gives her a big hug.

                                 GEORGE
                        We're so alike!
                                 LIZ
                        No we're not.

                                 GEORGE
                           (very happy)
                        Yes we are! The only difference is 
                        I never would've worked that hard 
                        for it!  You had to sit there, 
                        night after night, with those 
                        headphones on translating that John 
                        has a yellow pencil, just so Phil 
                        could use his yellow pencil on you!

                                 LIZ
                        George if Sal found out....

                                 GEORGE
                        But he won't cause he's an idiot!  
                        The plan is brilliant! Have an 
                        affair out in the open. Talk about 
                        whatever you want, oh my goodness 
                        Elizabeth, you are your father's 
                        daughter!

           He gives her another hug.

                                 GEORGE
                        This is such a wonderful moment I 
                        almost feel guilty tarnishing it 
                        with blackmail.

                                 LIZ
                        What do you want?

                                 GEORGE
                        I noticed Linda had wine and you 
                        have a checkbook.  

                                 LIZ
                        One or the other.  

           George breaks the hug, looks at her, then smiles. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The wine is flowing and the music is upbeat. The girls are 
           delighted as George joins in with their Wii Dance game. Sal, 
           Michael, and Myra are dancing along and having a good time. 
           Liz and David are sitting together watching.

           Linda is out on the porch, drinking. She slams the door shut. 

           Ava jumps on George’s lap as he sits to catch his breath 
           causing him to give a little yell.  Myra stands up concerned, 
           but George puts his hand up to her and forces a smile. He 
           takes a long look at a smiling Ava and pulls her in with a 
           hug. 

                                 GEORGE
                           (whispering)
                        Don’t be like me.  
                                 AVA
                           (whispering back)
                        I won’t.  I’ve seen you dance.  

           David and Liz watch with indifference.   

                                 DAVID
                        I need to hate him.

                                 LIZ
                        I know you do.

                                 DAVID
                        You do too.  We both need to keep 
                        hating him.

           They continue to observe as George borrows Michael’s cell 
           phone and walks outside. 

           EXT. HOUSE - LATER

           George is on Michael’s cell phone.  

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                           (obviously very drunk)
                        Who the fuck...?  What the...?  
                        fucking call me?  Who’s this?!  

                                 GEORGE
                        You must be the new receptionist.  
                        Smitty please.  

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Fucking Smitty!!!!

           George sees Myra looking at him cautiously. 

                                 SMITTY (O.S.)
                        Hello?  

                                 GEORGE
                        If the devil’s there, tell him to 
                        grab a jacket on his way home. 

                                 SMITTY (O.S.)
                        George! You’re alive! I lost money.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I’ll pay you back.  

                                 SMITTY (O.S.)
                        It’s funny every time.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Don’t leave without me.  

                                 SMITTY (O.S.)
                        Maybe I’ll just see ya down there 
                        someday.  There’s other places...   
                                 GEORGE
                        I can’t find you when we’re in the 
                        same room.  I’ve got the money.  

                                 SMITTY (O.S.)
                        What suckers did you stumble into 
                        George?  

           George looks at the family.  

                                 SMITTY (O.S.)
                        George?  

                                 GEORGE
                        I’ll see you soon.  

                                 SMITTY (O.S.)
                        You’ll see me tomorrow or you 
                        won’t. I can’t tell ya how much I 
                        wish this wasn’t bullshit.  It’d be 
                        something if ya did something you 
                        weren’t supposed to do.    

           George stares at Myra.  

                                 SMITTY (O.S.)
                        Maybe someone upstairs’ll fuck up 
                        the paperwork and I can see ya in 
                        the next one huh?    

                                 GEORGE
                           (assured)
                        You’ll see me tomorrow, in this 
                        one.     

           He hangs up the phone as he continues to stare at this 
           family’s smiling faces.   

                                 GEORGE
                           (conflicted)
                        Cause there’s no way they’re 
                        letting me into the next one. 

                                 AVA (O.S.)
                        George!  

           George turns around to see Ava standing there.  

                                 AVA 
                        Come on! You’re on my team!   

           She sticks her hand out.  George hesitates then slowly walks 
           over and grabs it. She looks up at him.  

                                 AVA
                        Don’t mess up this time okay?  

           George stares at her as she breaks into a smile.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Okay.  
           They walk in but we stay outside as we look in to see George 
           dancing with Ava. As the girls dance, George catches Myra’s 
           eye and she holds his gaze. Finally the girls notice, and 
           force them to dance together. Myra reluctantly takes George’s 
           hand and they dance briefly before Myra breaks it off.  

                                 MYRA
                        How about some dessert?  

                                 LIZ
                        We had dessert.  

           Myra walks into the kitchen. 

                                 MYRA
                        How about some more? 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Liz is taking the girls up to bed.  They look at Liz who 
           nods.  They run over and give George a hug. Liz looks at 
           George and then takes the girls upstairs. Michael gives 
           George a hug.

                                 MICHAEL
                           (whispers)
                        The best day of my life.

                                 GEORGE
                           (whispers)
                        A man always whispers the best day 
                        of his life.   

           Michael starts to walk away but George grabs him. 

                                 GEORGE
                           (whispering)
                        The best day of my life.    

           Linda walks in and slams the glass door.  She's very drunk 
           and has chocolate all over her face.  Michael smiles so only 
           George can see and runs upstairs.  

                                 LINDA
                           (crying)
                        There goes my baby.

           She gives George a dirty look and stumbles upstairs. David 
           locks the front door and looks back at George.  They share an 
           uncomfortable silence.  David looks like he's about to say 
           something but Myra walks in.

                                 DAVID
                        Good night Mom.

           He walks upstairs.

                                 MYRA
                        Were you two talking?

                                 GEORGE
                        In a way.
           Myra turns off some lights and sits down.  She pours herself 
           a glass of wine and George holds out his glass.

                                 MYRA
                        You shouldn't.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well that always stops me.

           He smiles and holds out his glass.  She fills it.  

                                 MYRA
                        A hooker, really?  Didn't think 
                        you'd ever have to pay for it.

                                 GEORGE
                        The wonder of getting older. Doing 
                        things we say we wouldn't do in a 
                        million years, a few years later.

           He looks over at her as she sits.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Are you waiting for me to say 
                        something?  

                                 MYRA
                        I guess, even though it’s never 
                        been anything I wanted to hear. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I always loved you.    

                                 MYRA
                        You only ever said that when you 
                        wanted something from me.    

           George starts to talk but she puts her hand up.  

                                 MYRA
                        But the good news is, you always 
                        wanted something from me so maybe 
                        that’s true, not that I’d ever get 
                        the truth from you.  

           She takes a sip of wine. 

                                 MYRA
                        I know you loved me George. Because 
                        I have to.  I have to be right 
                        about that because if I’m not, I 
                        gave up a big part of my life and 
                        cried a lot of tears for no goddamn 
                        reason. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Do you want to know the truth?

           She looks a bit nervous as she stares at him.

                                 MYRA
                           (matter of fact)
                        I don't really care anymore. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MYRA (cont'd)
                        I've had such a great life without 
                        you and loved a lot of men, and 
                        even more've loved me. You could 
                        tell me, but it wouldn't really 
                        matter..

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't know.

                                 MYRA
                           (intense)
                        I'm gonna kill you!

           She throws her glass at him.

                                 MYRA
                        Not when you're asleep, when you're 
                        awake and you see it coming!

                                 GEORGE
                        I want to tell you the truth.  

                                 MYRA
                        I'm too old for the truth!  And 
                        it's still about what you want!   
                        Fuck you for that! You just want me 
                        to hate you so I’ll want you to 
                        leave, cause you’re too stupid to 
                        know that’ll make me want you to 
                        stay so I can kill you! 

           Liz walks down the stairs concerned. 

                                 MYRA
                        It’s my turn to hate him!  There’s 
                        a line! 

           She throws her hands in the air towards Liz who runs quickly 
           up the stairs.  

                                 MYRA
                        You piece of shit! You’re gonna
                        walk in here now and try to give me
                        the truth?!  I’ve been dealing with 
                        the truth for years you sonofabitch
                        cause you didn’t wanna deal with it 
                        and you did grab the biggest piece 
                        of chicken and somebody called you 
                        Grandpa today! How did that feel?  

           George starts to say something.

                                 MYRA
                        Shut the fuck up!  

           Both her and George take big sips at the same time.  

                                 MYRA
                        And what did you do to earn it?  
                        You put in one day doing something 
                        you loved doing! Fucking and 
                        drinking. 
                                 GEORGE
                        I didn’t...

                                 MYRA
                        You did half of it and you fucked
                        Linda in the only way you would 
                        want to. 

           George smiles a bit. 

                                 MYRA
                        Now you got three young people who 
                        love you only because they can’t
                        hate you.  And that’s the only 
                        thing you can do. You have this 
                        ability to make people really wanna
                        love you, until they can’t anymore 
                        and your best thing you do is the 
                        worst thing you could do to anyone 
                        else!  

           George lowers his head a bit. 

                                 MYRA
                        Ya know what this coulda been 
                        George?  It coulda just been a 
                        Saturday.  As good as you feel 
                        right now, and I know you’re 
                        feeling good you sonofabitch when 
                        you should feel like shit for not 
                        having this be your life, this 
                        coulda just been a Saturday.  One 
                        of a thousand great Saturdays and 
                        you coulda felt like this every one 
                        of em.   My God, there’s men that 
                        have to work so hard for something 
                        like this and we did everything we 
                        could to just hand it to you.  

           She takes another sip.  

                                 MYRA
                        Goddammit, I didn’t think... I mean 
                        you’re dying that should be enough, 
                        but it’s not.  I’m actually sad.  I 
                        feel bad for you and I feel bad 
                        that I feel bad for you.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m either not drunk enough or too 
                        drunk to know whether to say thank 
                        you. 

           Myra pauses and shakes her head.  

                                 MYRA
                        Worst thing that ever happened to 
                        you was that you were funny and 
                        charming.  Worst thing because if 
                        you weren’t any of those things, 
                        you probably could’ve accomplished 
                        so many things in your life because 
                        you would’ve had to. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MYRA (cont'd)
                        I know you feel good right now you 
                        sonofabitch...    

                                 GEORGE
                        Used that one already....

                                 MYRA
                        But later, when this all sinks in, 
                        when tomorrow is better than today, 
                        and the day after is better than 
                        that one, I hope it fucking hurts.  
                        I hope you really hurt and realize 
                        what you had and what you lost. 

           George stares right back at an emotional Myra.  

                                 MYRA
                        Go ahead! Say your brilliant, 
                        quirky comeback.  You always get 
                        the last word in anyway.

           She pours another glass.

                                 GEORGE
                        Wanna fuck?

           Myra throws her new glass at him.

                                 GEORGE 
                        I don’t remember if that was a yes 
                        or no twenty two years ago. 

                                 MYRA
                        I wanted to ask it first! Not even 
                        ask it, tell you, now, I want it 
                        now!

                                 GEORGE
                        Could you at least aim for my 
                        mouth?

                                 MYRA
                        Now we can't!  The moment is 
                        ruined!  I have to ask it first!  
                        Goddamn you!

                                 GEORGE
                        We can pretend...

                                 MYRA
                        That's all I do with you! I've had 
                        arguments with you when you haven't 
                        even been there.  I almost divorced 
                        you four times because of what I 
                        thought you'd say when I was 
                        pretending to argue with you.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't think ethically, I can 
                        apologize for those.
                                 MYRA
                        You said some terrible things when 
                        you weren't here!  God I hate you.

           She sits down and slowly regains her composure. 

                                 MYRA
                        Wanna fuck?

           He starts to talk but she puts her finger to her mouth.

                                 MYRA
                        Shh.  You already said yes.  And 
                        you promised to go down on me til 
                        I'm satisfied. Didn't expect that.

                                 GEORGE
                        Me either.  That doesn't sound like 
                        me.  Are you sure I said that?

                                 MYRA
                        It's the only reason I agreed.

                                 GEORGE
                        I guess a man faced with death, 
                        will say and do just about 
                        anything.

                                 MYRA
                        You don't have to guess.  You were 
                        very assured.

                                 GEORGE
                        You're going to have to talk me 
                        through it.  I've only seen a 
                        vagina up close once before.

                                 MYRA
                        What'd you think?

                                 GEORGE
                        It frightened me. I felt like the 
                        bomb squad, I didn't know which 
                        wire went to where.

                                 MYRA
                        Try them all and I'll tell you when 
                        you got the right one.

                                 GEORGE
                        That's what I'm afraid of.  An 
                        explosion.

           She smiles at him and they start to walk upstairs.  George 
           holds out his hand and she takes it.  They walk upstairs.

                                 GEORGE
                        Did you say everything you wanted 
                        to say?  

                                 MYRA
                        Yes. But what are the chances you 
                        were listening?  
           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           There are moans coming out of Myra's room.  Liz opens her 
           door and starts to walk towards Myra's room.

                                 LIZ
                        Mom, are you...?

           Liz stops when she realizes what it is.

                                 LIZ
                        Oh my God.

           David walks out of his room and looks at Liz.

                                 DAVID
                        What's going...?

           He listens.

                                 DAVID
                        Is Mom...?  Oh my God.

           Linda walks out.

                                 LINDA
                        What...?  Oh my God.

           Sal walks out.

                                 SAL
                        Yo!

           Michael walks out.  Everyone is in the hallway listening.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I did that today.

                                 LINDA
                        Get in your room!  No you didn't!  
                        What's happening to all of us?

           Linda walks back into the room.

                                 SAL
                        I know what's happening to two of 
                        us.

           Sal gives a goofy laugh and walks back into his room.  Liz 
           looks at David as we hear Myra laughing.  Liz smiles at David 
           who gives her a little smile back.  They go into their rooms.

           INT. MYRA’S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           George gets out of bed quietly and moves towards the JEWELRY 
           BOX.  He slowly opens it up and sees the HUGE RING.  He looks 
           at it for a moment, then reaches for it, but stops when he 
           CATCHES HIMSELF in the mirror. 

           He regards himself for a moment. He reaches for the ring 
           again, just as he catches sight of Myra, who’s now awake and 
           looking at him in the mirror. He walks out, leaving the ring. 
           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           George walks slowly down the hallway, looking at the PHOTOS 
           of the life his family lived without him.  At the end of the 
           hallway he looks back at all the pictures. 

           He takes the SMALL PHOTO of himself from his pocket and 
           sticks it in the molding.  

           EXT. BACK PORCH - LATER

           David walks out just as the sun comes up.  

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        What do you think?

           David turns around to see George sitting. 

                                 DAVID
                        About what?

                                 GEORGE
                        We can start with the sunrise.

                                 DAVID
                        I don't get to see a lot. You? 

                                 GEORGE
                        Too many. Hate em. Means the night 
                        is over.  To everyone else, it's a 
                        beginning.  To me, always an end.

                                 DAVID
                        I don't know how you can't 
                        appreciate something like that.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes you do. 

           David continues to stare at it.

                                 GEORGE
                        Do you want to ask me questions?

                                 DAVID
                        There things you want to tell me?

                                 GEORGE
                        There's things I should tell you, 
                        but don't want to.

                                 DAVID
                        You ever do anything you don’t want 
                        to? 

                                 GEORGE
                        No. Yet all I have is regrets.

           David nods but still doesn't turn around.
                                 GEORGE
                        Always wondered if a man is happier 
                        when he does the things he needs to 
                        do rather than the things he wants
                        to do.  Because it makes everyone 
                        around him happier.

                                 DAVID
                        Why don't you start doing what you 
                        need to do and find out?

                                 GEORGE
                        Easier to keep wondering I- 

                                 DAVID
                        Cause I just don't want to hear it.

           He turns around and looks at George. 

                                 DAVID
                        I need to hear it.

           David keeps his stare on George and then looks towards the 
           door as Myra walks out.  

                                 DAVID
                        Morning Ma.  

           He gives her a kiss and glances quickly back at George.  

                                 DAVID
                        I’m gonna go for a swim.  

           David walks down towards the water.  

                                 MYRA
                        What were you talking about?

                                 GEORGE
                        Talking about it.

                                 MYRA
                        Why don't you join him?

                                 GEORGE
                        I have a fear of water. It dilutes 
                        the scotch.

                                 MYRA
                        Why didn't you ever learn how to 
                        swim?

                                 GEORGE
                        I haven't mastered walking yet, but 
                        I promise you, there's no better 
                        crawler. 

           Myra reaches in and puts a bottle of scotch in front of him.

                                 MYRA
                        I hate to say it but after last 
                        night, you actually earned it.
                                 GEORGE
                        Second thing I’ve earned and I keep 
                        getting the same thing.  

           Myra’s about to go inside.

                                 GEORGE 
                        I have to leave today.  

           Myra stops and looks at him.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I think we’ve all seen enough.  We 
                        all get it.  

                                 MYRA
                        No, no.  You need to...

                                 GEORGE
                        I need to go, or I can’t go.  I’m 
                        down to one last chance in my life, 
                        please don’t make me miss it.  

                                 MYRA
                        You have to leave here to get your 
                        last chance?  

           He nods.  She laughs and shakes her head.  

                                 MYRA
                        The door’s unlocked George.  
                        Congratulations. It must be some 
                        magical opportunity.  Dream come 
                        true. So much better than this.   

           She motions to the beach and the sunrise and David swimming 
           alone. She looks back at him and leaves.  

           George looks at the sunrise for a moment, then unscrews the 
           top of the bottle.  He’s about to take a sip when he stops, 
           puts the cap back on, and takes a walk.  

           INT. LIZ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           From her window, Liz sees George on the beach.  She quickly 
           changes her clothes.

           EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           George is walking as Liz jogs next to him.

                                 LIZ
                        Hey.

                                 GEORGE
                        An exerciser huh?

                                 LIZ
                        Yup. You exercise?
                                 GEORGE
                        Only when somebody's chasing me.  
                        Or I'm chasing somebody else. 

           George raises his eyebrow.

                                 GEORGE
                        I just realized that it's all I do.

                                 LIZ
                        Are you glad you're here?

                                 GEORGE
                        Are you glad I'm here?

                                 LIZ
                        You first.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't know if glad's the right 
                        word, but it might be a synonym for 
                        another.

           She doesn't answer him back.

                                 GEORGE
                        You don't want to answer?

                                 LIZ
                        I don’t think there’s a word for 
                        what I’m feeling.  I spent a lot of 
                        time wishing you never left.  I 
                        don't know how I feel that you came 
                        back.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't need an answer.

                                 LIZ
                        You don't care?

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't deserve to care.

           George looks at the water.

                                 GEORGE
                        I should become one of those crazy 
                        old men who pick shells all...

                                 LIZ
                        Did you ever miss me?

                                 GEORGE
                        I would think of you a lot. You 
                        were unique to me. The only woman 
                        in my whole life I had to think 
                        differently about. You never seemed 
                        like a child, just a tiny person 
                        who wanted to figure everything 
                        out. I don't think you ever used a 
                        period.  Question marks, always 
                        question marks.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE (cont'd)
                        Not an easy thing for somebody who 
                        doesn't have any answers.

                                 LIZ
                        Did I make you leave?

                                 GEORGE
                        You made me stay as long as I did.

                                 LIZ
                        How can you do that?  How do you 
                        just leave people who love you?

                                 GEORGE
                        Because I loved them. I knew they'd 
                        be better off without me.

                                 LIZ
                        But even that's bullshit.  That's 
                        the answer you have to give so you 
                        can say you did one thing for us so 
                        you're not a total piece of shit.   
                        I know you don't even believe that 
                        one.  You just wanted to get drunk.

                                 GEORGE
                        See you found all your answers.

                                 LIZ
                        It took me a while.  But as I got 
                        older, it wasn't that hard.  Why 
                        else would somebody leave somebody 
                        like us?  There was no reason for 
                        it.  Mom did everything for you. 
                        All you had to do was not hurt 
                        anybody but yourself.

           Liz just stares at him. He can’t look back. 

                                 LIZ
                        You ever think about how hard you 
                        had to work to not do anything?  
                        All the people you had to con and 
                        use?  When you could’ve just used 
                        us and let us use you?  It would’ve 
                        been easier ya think?  

           George throws a shell into the water.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I think.  

                                 LIZ
                        What're you thinking about now?

                                 GEORGE
                        I'm thinking the setting doesn't 
                        fit the conversation. Doesn’t look 
                        like a place for more questions. 

                                 LIZ
                        Did you hear everything I said?
                                 GEORGE
                        I've never listened to a woman 
                        more. I just don't know what to do 
                        now that I've heard it.

                                 LIZ
                        Fix it George.  Make the 
                        conversation fit the setting.  Tell 
                        me what this is supposed to be.

           Liz cracks for the first time.  George notices.

                                 LIZ
                        Okay, I'll do it.  Again, 
                        Somebody'll do something that 
                        you're supposed to do, cause you're 
                        too weak...

                                 GEORGE
                        All right I'll....

                                 LIZ
                        No!  Fuck that, you had your 
                        chance!  I'm already doing it!

           She composes herself and George looks her in the eye.

                                 LIZ
                        No question marks and I don’t need 
                        an answer.  I’m just talking cause 
                        you’re listening. 

           George nods.

                                 LIZ
                        I don't care what you did anymore. 

           George looks at her with surprise. 

                                 LIZ
                        That's big.  That's huge man, for 
                        both of us, mostly you, but I'm 
                        trying to get something too. I'm 
                        still my father's daughter.

           George smiles a bit.

                                 LIZ
                        The only thing I care about now is 
                        what you're gonna do.  I got a good 
                        life.  I'm a great mother, good 
                        daughter and maybe an okay wife.  
                        But I'd really like to see what 
                        else I need, cause I think I need 
                        something.

                                 GEORGE
                        What do you need?

           Liz's eyes tear up.

                                 LIZ
                        Somebody to call Dad again.
           She's very upset and standing there crying.  George slowly 
           reaches out and puts his arms around her.  He is still 
           reserved but she puts her head on his shoulders.  He closes 
           his eyes and pulls her in.

                                 LIZ
                           (crying)
                        That's a good deal George.  Take it 
                        this time okay?

           He holds her as they look at the ocean. George looks 
           conflicted. 

           EXT. HOUSE - LATER

           Liz runs ahead as George walks back to the house.  The girls 
           are there in little sailor outfits, forcing a complacent 
           George to force a smile. 

                                 AVA
                        Hi George.  

                                 JULIA
                        Hi George.

                                 GEORGE
                        Did you borrow these outfits from 
                        Michael's friend Kevin?

           The girls look confused as Sal walks out.  

                                 SAL
                        Hey Georgie.  Ya talk to Liz, like 
                        talk talk?

                                 GEORGE
                        We did.

                                 SAL
                        I'm not the best with things like 
                        this ya know?  I'm kinda like the 
                        outcast round here, like Gilligan.  
                        Everybody's smart, and you know I 
                        look at you like maybe we're close.  
                        Not that you're dumb, or me either 
                        but more like guy guys ya know?

                                 GEORGE
                        I'm sober enough to agree. 

                                 SAL
                        Yeah. The thing is, I know guys, 
                        you get to a point, and you hit the 
                        fence, and ya gotta go one way or 
                        the other.  I came from the city, 
                        so...  I lost people.  Once you get 
                        to a point and there's the fork, 
                        and you choose, you ain't finding 
                        your way back.  I mean you can. 
                        Some guys did but...
                                 GEORGE
                        I think you're saying I can talk to 
                        you if I need too?

                                 SAL
                        Absolutely. As long as Liz says 
                        it's okay.

           George smiles.

                                 GEORGE
                        It's refreshing to know there's 
                        another guy's guy, real man, I can 
                        count on.

                                 SAL
                        Always.  We're a dying breed ya 
                        know. Whenever you wanna throw 
                        down.

                                 GEORGE
                        And as long as Liz...

                          SAL
                                                     GEORGE
           ...says it’s okay.  
                                           ...says it’s okay. 

                                 SAL
                        See? We're finishing each other's 
                        sentences. We're right here.

                                 GEORGE 
                        Whether we wanna be or not. 

           George notices a very distinguished, older man JOHN, with a 
           captain's hat on, talking with Linda through the window.

                                 GEORGE
                        Who's that?

                                 SAL
                        Oh that's John. He's taking us out 
                        on his boat.

                                 GEORGE
                        Did we win a raffle?

                                 SAL
                        No he's uh....

           George sees Myra give John a big hug and kiss.

                                 AVA
                        He's Nana's boyfriend.

           George's face changes as Myra runs outside.

                                 MYRA
                        Come on girls, we have to get 
                        going.

           Everyone walks inside with Myra just staring at George. 
                                 MYRA
                        Good bye George.  

           She walks back in and the family is getting ready to go.  
           George looks conflicted.  

                                 GEORGE 
                        I always thought when a man says 
                        “fuck it” he takes the easy way 
                        out.  

           He looks at the family again and grabs the scotch.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Fuck it.

           He runs into the house. 

           INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           George bursts through the door taking a swig as he extends 
           his hand to John. 

                                 GEORGE
                        George Koster. Don't know if you've 
                        heard of me.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh yes.  Feel like I know you.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well take a couple of swigs of this 
                        and we'll both try and forget what 
                        we know about me so we can have a 
                        nice day.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh no, I'm the captain.

           John points to his hat.

                                 GEORGE
                        You actually put this outfit on 
                        sober?  

                                 MYRA
                        George...

                                 GEORGE
                        Does she yell at you?  

                                 JOHN
                        I try not to give her a reason.  

                                 GEORGE
                        We’re like brothers! It’s crazy how 
                        similar... No seriously, she really 
                        went another way here. 

                                 MYRA
                        George! 
                                 GEORGE
                        Need a first mate?  

                                 JOHN
                        Sure.

                                 GEORGE
                           (to Sal)
                        Gilligan, we found something for 
                        you to do! I hope Mr. Howell isn't 
                        taken. Liz can be Maryann, David 
                        the Professor, Myra can be Mrs. 
                        Howell who kept her name after the 
                        divorce, and Linda can be the 
                        island.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What about Ginger?

                                 GEORGE
                        Since Kevin's not here, hopefully 
                        we'll find a Ginger on the way! Or 
                        at the very least, audition a few. 
                        I'm going on a boat!

           George runs out of the house.  John looks at Myra.

                                 JOHN
                        He's everything you said he was.

           Myra is surprised as she watches George through the window. 

                                 JOHN
                        You okay?   

                                 MYRA
                        He never surprises me this way.  
                        It’s always the other way.  

           John looks confused.  

                                 MYRA
                        He’ll be a lot different on the 
                        boat. 

           INT. BOAT - LATER

           George CLUTCHES THE RAIL of a BEAUTIFUL 25 FOOT YACHT, as it 
           crests the waves. He wears a life vest, has a tube under one 
           arm, along with a death grip on his bottle of scotch.  Myra 
           takes his picture. It’s a perfect, sunny day. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You're welcome.

                                 MYRA
                        Jealousy or stupidity?  

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes. 
                                 MYRA
                           (smiling)
                        Want something to eat?

                                 GEORGE
                        Just take it and throw it over.  
                        That's where it's going anyway.

           She smiles and walks up to the wheel house. George sees Linda 
           enjoying his discomfort as she drinks her wine.

                                 GEORGE
                        Don't get too close to the edge 
                        Linda in case there's a whaling 
                        ship in the area.

           INT. WHEEL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           John is steering the boat with David when Myra comes up.

                                 JOHN
                        How's George doing?

                                 MYRA
                        We found his kryptonite.

                                 JOHN
                        You know he really shouldn't be 
                        drinking on the boat.

                                 MYRA
                        Whatever he had in his stomach is 
                        with the sea now.  Even George 
                        isn't dumb enough to waste his 
                        scotch.

                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. DECK - CONTINUOUS

           George is leaning over the side.

                                 GEORGE
                        Damn.

           INT. WHEEL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                 JOHN
                        How are the kids?

                                 MYRA
                        Okay.  Maybe a little bored.

                                 JOHN
                        There's fishing poles, bait in the 
                        cooler.

           Myra looks at David.

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, I'll give it a shot.
           David gets up and leaves.

                                 MYRA
                        I'm sorry about George.

                                 JOHN
                        Whatever you want, you know that.  

           He smiles and taps her on the knee.  She smiles at him. 

           INT. DECK - CONTINUOUS

           David walks down and smiles as George is struggling. 

                                 SAL
                        Hey George, somebody make ya angry? 
                        Cause you're turning green!

           Sal imitates the Incredible Hulk to the delight of the girls.

                                 DAVID
                        Anybody want to fish?

           Sal and the girls hop up and down in excitement. John and 
           Myra look down and George sees them arm in arm. He watches 
           Myra smile as John pulls her close.

                                 LIZ
                           (to David)
                        How do we do this?

                                 DAVID
                        I don't know. Never did it before.

                                 SAL
                        Your Dad never took you ...?

           They look over at George.

                                 SAL
                        I got it.  So we got Ava, Liz, 
                        Michael...

                                 GEORGE
                        I want to fish!

                                 LIZ
                        Seriously?

                                 GEORGE
                        Actually I just want to change my 
                        view.  Found something else to make 
                        me want to throw up. 

           George jumps over into one of the fishing chairs as Liz looks 
           up at Myra and John. 

                                 GEORGE
                        But it's the last thing I can't do 
                        that Hemingway did.
                                 MICHAEL
                        You write?

                                 GEORGE
                        Except write.

                                 DAVID
                        Or fight.

           Everyone is surprised by the joke.  George turns around and 
           gives him a slight smile but David looks away quickly. Linda 
           walks up to him and hisses a whisper.

                                 LINDA 
                        How about suicide?

                                 SAL
                        What kinda bait you want George?

                                 GEORGE
                        Whatever Linda used to catch David.

           George turns around again to see John and Myra, but they're 
           not there.  Sal puts a fishing pole in his hand.

                                 SAL
                        Hold this pole for a second.

                                 GEORGE
                        I had a cell-mate tell me the same 
                        thing once. But he used different 
                        bait.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I get so many more jokes now.  

           Sal casts off, takes his pole and hands George his.

                                 SAL
                        Okay man, you're ready to go!

                                 GEORGE
                        Okay!  Now what?

                                 SAL
                        This is it, you're doing it!

                                 GEORGE
                        I'm participating in a sport?

                                 SAL
                        Big time!

                                 GEORGE
                        Well if I'm going to be an athlete, 
                        I have to look like an athlete.  
                        Hand me my scotch.

           Sal hands it over.  Ava climbs up and puts her sailor hat on 
           his head.  Everyone laughs as Liz takes a picture. George 
           takes it all in. 
           The girls run over to Liz and Sal. David, Linda and Michael 
           look at something over the side. George is left all by 
           himself. He looks down at his bottle of scotch. 

           Suddenly his LINE STARTS TO SPOOL OUT very quickly.

                                 SAL
                        Grab your pole George!

           George grabs his pole with his left hand.

                                 SAL
                        Two hands!

                                 GEORGE
                        I've never grabbed something with 
                        two hands in my life!

           George tries to take a gulp of scotch but his pole JERKS him 
           forward, causing him to drop it.

                                 GEORGE
                        No!

           David comes out of nowhere to save it. George grabs the pole 
           with his other hand, but he’s struggling. 

                                 LIZ
                        Sal, help him!

                                 SAL
                        Hey ya got something big there, you 
                        better let me take this one.

           The line continues to reel out as George looks at everyone in 
           panic.  He looks up to see John has run out with Myra.

                                 GEORGE
                        No!

           George stops the line and puts his feet up on the boards. 

                                 SAL
                        Whatta ya doing?

                                 GEORGE
                        I'm going to catch a fish.

                                 SAL
                        But you don't know what you're 
                        doing.

                                 GEORGE
                        You just wrote my epitaph.

           Sal looks confused.  

                                 SAL
                        Mike what does ep...?  
                                 GEORGE
                        I've seen male enhancement and 
                        balding commercials on TV. They all 
                        show a guy catching a fish. If 
                        those bald, limp dicks can do it, 
                        so can I.

           George is just holding on.  He looks over at Sal.

                                 GEORGE
                        I have my hair and an erection, 
                        what do I do now?

                                 SAL
                        Start reeling.

                                 GEORGE
                        About what? Have a topic? Is Linda 
                        in play?  Oh, yes!

           George starts reeling but it's very difficult.

                                 GEORGE
                        He's not cooperating.  Now what?

                                 SAL
                        Make him cooperate.

                                 GEORGE
                        David, pour the scotch his way.

           David cracks a smile. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You can do it Grandpa!

           Everybody stops and looks at Michael.

                                 AVA
                           (to Liz)
                        Can we call him that?

           Liz looks at David.

                                 LIZ
                        Sure.

                                 AVA
                        Come on Grandpa!

           Julia says something close, trying to mimic Ava. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Okay! What am I up against?

           We see a huge fish jump out of the water and make a splash.

                                 GEORGE
                        Any idea?

                                 LIZ
                        That was him George.
                                 GEORGE
                        I thought that was another boat!

                                 SAL
                        George really, let me...

                                 GEORGE
                        No! I have to accept one challenge 
                        before I die if it kills me!

           Everyone stops smiling and looks at Myra.

                                 MYRA
                        You can do it George!

                                 GEORGE
                        Sal, take the hat off me. I want 
                        him to take me seriously.

           Sal takes the hat off.

                                 GEORGE
                        Okay.  Here we go!

           George takes a deep breath and begins to reel and pull, reel 
           and pull. He’s really struggling and it’s hard for anyone to 
           watch. David leaves the deck and George notices. 

                                 SAL
                        George...

                                 GEORGE
                        No!

           MINUTES go by. Liz takes the girls inside.

                                 LINDA
                        Michael, you're burning.  Take a 
                        break from the sun.

           Michael walks inside, calling over his shoulder.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You can do it Gramps.

                                 GEORGE
                        Shh. Don't let him know I'm your  
                        grandfather.

                                 LINDA
                        I wish somebody had done the same 
                        for me.

           Linda and Michael walk inside as John and Myra walk down.

                                 JOHN
                        There's lunch being served in the 
                        cabin.

                                 SAL
                        I gotta stay and...
                                 GEORGE
                        Go on Sal.  This is my mano y mahi
                        moment. Got him right where I want 
                        him.

           Myra gives George a little rub on the back, then follows the 
           others inside.

                                 GEORGE
                        Course, that's what he's probably 
                        telling his friends about me.

           George is just holding on.

                                 GEORGE
                        All right George, accomplish 
                        something.

           The line YANKS FORWARD and George tries to hold on. He winces 
           in pain and grabs his liver, but fights through it. 

                                 GEORGE
                        My whole life I spent trying to not
                        catch something, and now it's all I 
                        want to do.  One thing.  Let me 
                        just do this one thing and then you 
                        can take me.  Let me do something 
                        I'm not supposed to do.

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        Who you talking to?

           George turns around to see David behind him.

                                 GEORGE
                        Doesn't matter.  Nobody ever 
                        listens.

                                 DAVID
                        You don't believe in God?

                                 GEORGE
                        No.

                                 DAVID
                        Why not?

                                 GEORGE
                        Ask him, he started it.

           David stands next to George for a moment.  

                                 DAVID
                        John says we might have to go in 
                        soon.  Swells are kicking up.

                                 GEORGE
                        Tell John to start without us.  He 
                        won't be missed.

           David looks at George's red and swollen hands.
                                 DAVID
                        I'm grabbing a water, you want one?

                                 GEORGE
                        You mean a mixer?  Please. 

           David goes to the cooler and grabs a water.  He brings it 
           over to George who holding the pole with both hands.

                                 GEORGE
                        I can't take it.  Never mind.

           David goes to put it back, then stops.  He unscrews the cap 
           and puts it to George's lips.  George looks at him, before 
           opening his mouth.  David pours the water in, then pours some 
           over George's hands.

                                 GEORGE
                        Thank you.

           Distracted by the moment, George relaxes his grip.  The pole 
           FLIES out of his hand and David GRABS it.  Father and son 
           pull back hard and they see the fish JUMP out of the water.  
           David helps until George secures his grip again.  George 
           gives him a slight nod as Sal comes out.

                                 SAL
                        This fish is gonna be extinct by 
                        the time you get em in the boat!  
                        Time to get serious here George!

           George looks at Sal and then looks back for David who's gone.

                                 SAL
                        Come on man, let me get in there 
                        and get this sucker!

                                 GEORGE
                        Sal, I mean this in the nicest way. 
                        Fuck off.

                                 SAL
                        It actually came across that way.  
                        Only you, all right! Reel and pull!  
                        Reel and pull!  Everything you got!  
                        Every last bit of whatever you got 
                        in you, you gotta show it here.  
                        This is it!

           George looks back and sees everyone watching.

                                 JOHN
                        We've got to start heading in soon.

                                 MYRA
                        We're not going anywhere until he 
                        catches this fish.  Come on old 
                        man, pull!

                                 MICHAEL
                        Come on Grandpa!
                                 LIZ
                        You can do it George!

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s not my name.  

           He glances over at her quickly and gives her a smile.  We see 
           Sal and David looking over at her.  Liz smiles.

                                 LIZ
                        Come on Dad!

           Myra gets a little emotional and John notices. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Come on Mom.  Yell something.

                                 LINDA
                        Go fish!

           The girls are CHEERING LOUDLY.  George braces his feet and 
           puts his back into it, giving it everything he’s got. 

           The FISH JUMPS out of the water, and George is mesmerized for 
           a second at it’s beauty. Its scales SPARKLE in the sunlight, 
           and George’s grip relaxes for a moment, until the fish nearly 
           PULLS HIM OUT OF HIS SEAT. He yanks the pole and fights back. 
           Sal reaches over to help. 

                                 GEORGE
                        No!

           George continues to reel, grunting and grimacing from the 
           strain. Myra looks concerned.

                                 MYRA
                        George?

           George pulls back and looks at her upside down.  He quickly 
           leans forward and gives another strong pull and reel.  The 
           fish is very close now.

                                 JOHN
                        Get the girls out of there!.  
                        Everybody out of there!

           Liz takes the girls inside. George keeps pulling, breathing 
           hard. He grabs at his chest but holds on tight with the other 
           hand.

                                 MYRA
                        George stop!

                                 SAL
                        Pull George!  Pull!  Pull George!

                                 MYRA
                        No stop! Stop!

           Myra goes running over.
                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        Pull!

           David is poised, ready to help. George looks at him, then 
           squeezes his eyes shut and gives ONE LAST ALMIGHTY PULL! The 
           effort makes him dizzy and the world spins. The shouts from 
           his family sound muffled, and his HEART BEATS QUICKLY AND 
           LOUDLY IN HIS EARS. 

           George squints at the concerned faces of Myra, Liz and David, 
           and for a moment he sees them as their YOUNGER SELVES. 

           He closes his eyes tight again, until he’s shaken out of his 
           reverie by something smacking at his feet. 

           The family is CHEERING in delight. George opens his eyes and 
           stares in shock at the HUGE FISH FLOPPING on the floor. Sal 
           and David try to grab it. George is jubilant. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I did it!  I fu....

           He catches sight of the girls and checks himself. Sal has a 
           KNIFE in his hand. George looks down at the STRUGGLING FISH.

                                 SAL
                        Liz takes the girls over there 
                        while I...

           George GRABS Sal's arm.  Everyone's quiet as George kneels by 
           the fish, who has stopped struggling. He lifts its head off 
           the floor and WHISPERS something to him. George gives it a 
           kiss.

                                 GEORGE
                        He's going back.  

           George strokes the fish.

                                 GEORGE
                        Thank you friend.  Help me please, 
                        Sal.

           George goes to pick up the fish with Sal but David swoops in.

                                 DAVID
                        I got it.

           George maintains eye contact with the fish, as they throw it 
           back.  George watches it swim away.

                                 AVA
                        Why'd you let it go Grandpa?

                                 GEORGE
                        He might have a family to go back 
                        to.

           George looks at everyone.
                                 GEORGE
                        I got a new story.  And for the 
                        first time, it ends with me on my 
                        feet.

           He puts his hands in the air.

                                 GEORGE
                        I caught a fish!

           INT. MYRA’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER

           Everybody is eating and laughing.  George is telling a very 
           funny story and everybody laughs.  He makes eye contact with 
           David, who looks away bashfully after a brief smile.   

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

           Julia sits on George’s lap, playing a tickle game which has 
           her giggling uncontrollably. The conversation peters out as 
           the family watches them together. George looks up and takes 
           in the moment, which is broken when Julia spills food all 
           over his shirt. They all laugh. 

           INT. HALLWAY/BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           George runs up the stairs and into his room.  He is singing 
           and smiling.  He quickly changes his shirt, still singing as 
           he actually JOGS to the stairs. We pan back to see the 
           JEWELRY BOX sitting open and unattended on Myra’s dresser. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           George enters quietly, to see his family around the 
           television. He watches them as if he’s watching a TV show. 

           David and Linda are on the couch with their arms around 
           Michael, listening as he cracks a joke. 

           Sal and Liz talk quietly, each one has a drowsy daughter on 
           their lap. 

           We push in on George’s face. He seems to be trying to figure 
           something out. Myra touches his leg and pats the sofa next to 
           her. 

                                 MYRA
                        Let’s put the movie on.  

           Everybody settles in as X MOVIE STARTS TO PLAY. Myra snuggles 
           into George just a little bit.  He slowly reaches out and 
           puts his hand over hers. She doesn’t make eye contact, but 
           she smiles.  George feels very contented and happy.   

                                 SAL
                        I love Sundays, ya know.  So 
                        relaxing.  

           George’s face changes. He looks around at everybody again. He 
           suddenly becomes very uncomfortable and starts squirming. 
                                 MYRA
                        Are you okay?  

                                 GEORGE
                        Be right back.  

           He gets up.  

                                 LIZ
                        Want us to wait for you?  

                                 GEORGE
                        No. Seen it.  Know how it ends.  

           He walks up the stairs.  

           INT. MYRA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           George walks in and grabs the ring.  Like last time, he  
           looks at himself the mirror. This time, he runs out.  

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           George jogs down the hallway, purposely not looking at the 
           pictures.  He grabs his photo out of the molding and heads 
           down the stairs.  

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Myra is getting a drink when she catches sight of George 
           through the window, as he sneaks down the back stairs. 

           Their EYES MEET and George freezes. They stare at each other 
           as Myra takes a step towards the window.  After a moment, she 
           lowers the blinds and walks away.  

           EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           George peeks through the glass door and sees his family, 
           obliviously watching the TV.  We PAN DOWN TO HIS FEET. He 
           takes a step towards them.  Then he stops and turns the other 
           way.  

           INT. NEW JERSEY TRANSIT TRAIN - LATER

           George has his face pressed up against the window as it pulls 
           away from Long Branch.  

           INT. HALFWAY HOUSE - LATER

           George walks back in to similar scenes of chaos. Degenerates 
           pester him, asking him where he’s been, as Gladys yells from 
           behind the grill. He’s dejected, his head low.  

           INT. SMITTY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Smitty is sitting on his bed, in an old travelling suit. Bags 
           packed and ready. The door opens and George walks in. Smitty 
           lights up like a child. 

                                 SMITTY
                        George!  
           He runs over and gives him a hug but George seems 
           indifferent. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Are you ready?  

                                 SMITTY
                           (looking up)
                        I can’t believe I’m saying yes to a 
                        question you’re asking me! 

           Smitty takes a few steps back. 

                                 SMITTY
                        You forgot to pack your smile.   

           George just looks at him.  

                                 SMITTY
                        I got enough if ya wanna borrow 
                        some of mine.    

           Smitty smiles at him but George doesn’t smile back.  

           INT. HALFWAY HOUSE LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           George and Smitty pass by EDDIE, all dressed in Yankee.

                                 EDDIE
                        Fuck!  

           George ignores him and is about to hit the door when...

                                 OLD MAN
                        George!  Phone-call! 

           George turns around to see an OLD MAN holding out the phone.  
           George waves his hand and starts to walk. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        Says it’s important!  

           George stops, and sighs.  He starts to walk back.  

                                 SMITTY
                        George, ain’t nothing good ever 
                        come outta you talking on that 
                        phone ‘bout something important.  

                                 GEORGE
                        They can’t get to me on the phone 
                        Smitty.  

           George takes the phone. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah?  

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        Grandpa?  Grandpa?
                                 GEORGE  
                           (shocked)
                        Michael?  How did you get this 
                        number?  

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        You called it from my phone.  Why 
                        are you there and not here?  

           George closes his eyes and leans against the wall. 

                                 SMITTY
                        Ah shit.  

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        I don’t understand.

                                 GEORGE
                        Ask your father to explain it to 
                        you.  

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        He’s gone.  Nobody can find him.  
                        Everybody’s scared. 

           George looks at the receiver and is about to hang up. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m scared Grandpa.  

           Tears roll down George’s face as he looks at Smitty.   

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        Grandpa, I need you. 

           George quickly hangs up the phone.  Everyone is looking at 
           him.  He composes himself and walks towards the door.  

                                 SMITTY
                        George?  

                                 GEORGE
                        Just get me to my fucking dream 
                        come true. 

           INT. PAMELA’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Jack answers the door to George and Smitty. 

                                 JACK
                        Hey Georgie. Where’s your smile? 
                        Cat got it?    

           They walk in. LOUIS, a big African-American man is sitting on 
           the couch. He mouths off while playing a video game.

                                 LOUIS
                        Cat’s take tongues not smiles, you 
                        dumb motherfucker.  

                                 JACK
                        What takes smiles?  
                                 LOUIS
                        You when you ask me fucking 
                        questions while I’m trying to kill 
                        a motherfucking alien! 

           Louis steals a glance. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Shit.  You gotta be Old Georgie.

                                 SMITTY
                        Where’s Pam?

           Jack starts to answer but Louis...

                                 LOUIS
                        She in there fucking my boy.  
                        Fucking green motherfuckers!  

           He throws controller down as his avatar gets killed.

                                 LOUIS
                        Sorry if that sounded racist.  

           Jack laughs. Louis stands up, towering over George. 

                                 LOUIS
                        So whatcha got for me Old Georgie?
                        Something older then you but 
                        shinier I hope.   

           George continues to stare at him, then reluctantly reaches 
           into his pocket and pulls out the ring.  

                                 LOUIS
                        Whooo wee.  I thought you was 
                        leaning to the left.  

           Louis reaches out for it. George HESITATES, then drops it 
           into his hand.  

                                 JACK
                        Shit, George, I didn’t know you had 
                        nothing like that.  Where’d you get 
                        it?  

                                 LOUIS
                        I’ll take that answer. 

           The door opens and George sees Louis’s friend TJ walk out.  

                                 LOUIS
                           (to TJ)
                        It was like I told you it was, 
                        wasn’t it?  

                                 TJ
                        Nope.  Shit was better.  

                                 LOUIS
                           (to George)
                        The answer might help ya.  
                                 TJ
                           (motioning to Smitty)
                        What’s with the Lollipop gang? 

           Smitty nervously shuffles his feet. 

                                 GEORGE
                        It was my wife’s.  

                                 SMITTY
                           (laughing)
                        That’s where you were?  She gave it 
                        back to ya?  

                                 LOUIS
                        Shit nobody gives this back little 
                        man.  This is something you take.  

           George is stonefaced as Louis smirks at him. Louis holds the 
           ring up to the light. 

                                 LOUIS
                        What you got in your pocket TJ?  

                                 TJ
                        Bout two depending at what the ho
                        cost.  

                                 LOUIS
                        Give ya four.  

                                 JACK
                        Louis man, George is a friend.  
                        That’s worth a hell of a lot 
                        more...

                                 LOUIS
                        Your friend, not mine. I’m telling 
                        the man what I got.  If he don’t 
                        like it, he can wait for the sun 
                        and go to the motherfucking 
                        Hasidics. I’m telling him I’m 
                        fucking him...

           Louis looks at George. 

                                 LOUIS
                        I’m fucking you Old Georgie.  

           He looks back at the ring.  

                                 LOUIS
                        They gonna make it seem like it’s 
                        the other way.   

           TJ pulls a WAD of cash out of his pocket and hands it to 
           Louis, who adds it to a wad from his pocket. He’s about to 
           hand it over when Pamela walks out of the bedroom. 

                                 PAMELA
                        Georgie!  

           She gives him a big hug.  
                                 PAMELA
                        How is our new little man doing?  

                                 GEORGE
                        He’s...  He’s uh...

           George can’t speak as he looks at the ring in Louis’ hand. 

                                 SMITTY
                        George, we gotta go.  We’re gonna 
                        miss our bus.  

           George looks at the WAD OF CASH that Louis is holding.   

                                 SMITTY
                        Take the money, it’s enough, let’s 
                        go.   

           George rubs his face. Louis puts the ring on his pinky. 
           George closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, then opens them.

                                 GEORGE
                           (to Pamela)
                        He’s gonna be just fine.  

           George takes the money and quickly walks out.  

           INT. BUS - LATER

           George is emotionless as he sits with an excited Smitty.

                                 SMITTY
                        Even if my feet could touch the 
                        ground I don’t think they’d be 
                        doing it.  There’s so much I ain’t 
                        believing right now.  You and me 
                        heading to New Orleans.  You paying 
                        for you.  It’s like a dream ain’t 
                        it George?  Dream came true. Look 
                        at you.  

           Smitty motions to the window’s reflection.  George looks.  

                                 SMITTY
                        You’re in shock. Ya finally caught 
                        a break.  

           A distraught YOUNG MOTHER gets on with a YOUNG BOY, five, 
           who’s CRYING LOUDLY.   

                                 SMITTY
                           (to George)
                        Jeez, knew it couldn’t be perfect.  

           Smitty pulls faces at the Boy, trying to make him stop 
           crying. Instead, the Boy locks eyes with George as tears 
           stream down his face. Smitty tries to change the tone.  

                                 SMITTY
                        So how’d you get the ring from her?  
                        You romance it from her?  Ya still 
                        got it George?  You just see her or 
                        the kids too?  
           The Boy slowly stops crying as he stares at George.  

                                 SMITTY
                        They get big?  You a grandfather?  

           Smitty notices George is still staring at the Boy. The YOUNG 
           MOTHER notices too.  

                                 YOUNG MOTHER
                           (to George)
                        Can I help you?  

                                 SMITTY
                        Lotta questions George.  How bout 
                        answering one?  

           George pauses and thinks.  He looks around the bus, at 
           Smitty, at the Young Mother, and then the Boy. He tips his 
           head back against the seat and looks straight ahead. 

                                 GEORGE
                        She gave me the ring, I don’t still 
                        have it, I saw the kids, they’re 
                        big and beautiful and yes...  

           George gets emotional.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m a grandfather.  I’m a 
                        grandfather and I know what that 
                        means.    

           George grabs his bag. He turns to the Young Mother. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Miss, you did help me. Thank you. 

           He starts to leave.  

                                 SMITTY
                        Where you going?  

                                 GEORGE
                        Home.  

           George gets off the bus. Smitty yells through the glass.    

           INT. PAMELA’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           BANGING on the door. Jack opens it and George enters. 

                                 JACK
                        George, whatta ya doing?  

           George looks around and opens Pamela’s door.  

           INT. PAMELA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Louis is having sex with Pamela as George walks in. 
                                 GEORGE 
                        I see you’re not done fucking 
                        people today Louis.   

                                 LOUIS
                        Man, get the fuck outta here!  

           George puts the money on the bed as Louis rolls over.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I want the ring back.   

                                 JACK
                        George you’re making a big mistake.

                                 GEORGE
                        I made my last mistake.  

           Louis puts his pants on and gets up. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Gonna be your last everything if 
                        you don’t get the fuck out!   

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s hers.  

                                 LOUIS
                        It’s mine. 

           Louis holds up his hand with the ring on his pinky. 

                                 PAMELA
                        George, you got what you want, go!    

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m done getting what I want. It’s 
                        time to get what I need.  

                                 LOUIS
                        Old Georgie you about to get a new 
                        nickname.   

           Louis pushes him. George hits Louis in the face. Pamela looks 
           away.  Louis smiles as he knocks George to the floor. George 
           stumbles to his feet as TJ enters and laughs.     

                                 GEORGE
                        Give it to me.   

           George hits at Louis again.  Louis knocks him down again.

                                 PAMELA
                        Louis, please!  

           George fights to get up. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m not leaving without that ring.  

                                 LOUIS
                        We got that in common.  
           George throws a few more weak punches at Louis.  TJ comes 
           from the side and hits George hard.  George hits the floor, 
           almost out. Pamela tries to stop him from getting up again. 

                                 PAMELA
                        When are you gonna stop?!  

           TJ gears up for another punch, but Louis grabs his arm.  

                                 LOUIS
                        When he’s dead.  That’s the problem  
                        dealing with motherfuckers who 
                        ain’t got nothing to lose.  

                                 TJ
                        Man let’s just get outta here. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Ain’t gonna work. He just gonna 
                        follow, and I ain’t running from a 
                        motherfucker named Old Georgie.

                                 TJ
                        So make Old Georgie, Dead Georgie
                        and let’s get the fuck on. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Ain’t worth it.  

           Louis holds out the ring to George. He looks at Pamela.   

                                 LOUIS
                        The pussy’s on the house.  

           Pamela nods.  George takes the ring and holds it tight.  

                                 TJ
                           (to George)
                        Looks like we got something in 
                        common too. Both found bitches that 
                        are worth it.   

           George’s smile returns as TJ hits him hard across the face. 
           TJ looks down at George and smiles. 

                                 TJ
                        Sorry, that’s our return policy.  

           George is a bloody mess. He smiles, clutching the ring. 

           INT. BAR - LATER

           David is leaning over the bar drinking. The BARTENDER speaks 
           to the person next to him, off-camera. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Whatta ya having?  

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        Scotch and stitches please.   
           David looks over to see a bloodied and beaten George slouched 
           next to him.  He laughs a little. 

                                 DAVID
                        You have another son I don’t know 
                        about?  

           George smiles and shakes his head.  

                                 DAVID
                        You used to be much better at 
                        leaving.  

           David finishes his drink and motions for another.   

                                 DAVID
                        How do you live like you live?  

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t live. I just survive.  

           The Bartender gives them their drinks.  

                                 DAVID
                           (motioning to his face)
                        You got a good story about how this 
                        one happened?  

                                 GEORGE
                        They all have the same ending.    

                                 DAVID
                           (shaking his head)
                        Mom got her closure with ya, Liz 
                        got her closure with ya. Michael’s 
                        fixed, Sal gets his high fives.  
                        Fuck David, right?  

                                 GEORGE
                        You want close...?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know what I want, but I 
                        know I need things. 

           David looks at George.  

                                 DAVID
                        So I married a cunt.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m sorry about...

                                 DAVID
                        No. You’re not so many things man.  

           David finishes his drink and orders another one.
                                 DAVID
                        Why'd you marry her David?  I 
                        married her George because Mom was 
                        getting tired of taking care of me 
                        and I need somebody to take care of 
                        me.  But you're smart, educated, 
                        you can provide. Yeah I can 
                        provide.  The financials? No 
                        problem, and even if I couldn't, 
                        Grandpa made sure I could.  No, no.

           The Bartender slides another to him.

                                 DAVID
                        Money would always be there, but 
                        the emotionals. The emotionals not 
                        so much.

           He drinks and George watches closely.  

                                 DAVID
                           (laughing)
                        That “cunt” did your job for ya.  

           David gets serious quickly and looks at George. 

                                 DAVID
                        I'm not a tough guy George. You 
                        should’ve named me Sue. I could 
                        take care of the outside.  So I 
                        married a woman who...

           He takes a deep breath.

                                 DAVID
                        She would always check, how's the 
                        inside?  What're you feeling?  We 
                        don't do this around David, David 
                        can't handle that.  We have to 
                        protect...  See Liz was okay 
                        inside, you know after a while, 
                        after she figured it out, once she 
                        figures things out....

           David cuts the air with his hand.

                                 DAVID
                        So she married somebody who could 
                        protect her from the outside, not 
                        challenge her, at all, at all, on 
                        the inside. She's got all these 
                        things she wants to figure out, I 
                        guess on that one, she just needed 
                        to know on something. I mean you 
                        look at Sal, and you know. Ya know?

           George nods. 

                                 DAVID
                        Come on, drink! You got a legend to 
                        live up to. Legend sitting right 
                        here.  All the stories about my 
                        father.
                                 GEORGE
                        I'm sure they were exaggerated. The 
                        good ones anyway. 

                                 DAVID
                        I hope not.  I hope they were 
                        better cause I wanted to know that 
                        you were doing something better 
                        than staying with us. 

           David finishes another drink and orders another. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Maybe you should slow down.

                                 DAVID
                        No, you were right, the words are 
                        working now. Drink with me!

           David pounds the bar and the Bartender brings over another.

                                 BARTENDER
                        We okay over here?

                                 DAVID
                        We are now.

           David takes the drink.  

                                 DAVID
                        I remember you. I remember a lot.

           He looks away. 

                                 DAVID
                        I remember thinking you weren't 
                        that much older than me, cause you 
                        never acted like the other adults.  
                        And because Grandpa kept calling 
                        you a child and we would get 
                        punished together. Remember?  You 
                        and me in the corner?  

           George smiles as David reflects. 

                                 DAVID
                        My favorite times were right before 
                        the fight.  Right before Mom or 
                        Gramps would tell you to stop.  I 
                        knew it was coming, so I would try 
                        to get as much time in with you as 
                        I could.

           David starts to take a sip then stops.

                                 DAVID
                        You would talk to me, and listen to 
                        me, and show me things. Things 
                        nobody else would. Things I 
                        remembered, like how to treat 
                        people who treat you good. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVID (cont'd)
                        And what was good and what was 
                        wrong, and if I was gonna do the 
                        wrong, how to do it better than 
                        everybody else so maybe it looked 
                        right. But mostly..

           David laughs.

                                 DAVID
                        Mostly you would tell me, don't be 
                        like me. You'd hold up your drink 
                        and say, this'll kill ya or make 
                        somebody do it for ya. And then 
                        show me by making Grandpa so angry 
                        he almost killed you.

           George smiles.

                                 DAVID
                        And then right in the middle of it 
                        all, Grandpa yelling, somebody 
                        throwing you out, police putting 
                        handcuffs on, all this fucking 
                        madness, ten people there just 
                        trying to get you, and you would 
                        look at me and smile and say "see?"  
                        It was our little joke. Just us. 
                        Like you did it all for me.  Who 
                        cares what happened next, you did 
                        that for me.

           David looks over at George.

                                 DAVID
                        You were my friend. You were my 
                        best friend. You were everything to 
                        me.  I rooted for you.  I wanted to 
                        protect you.

           Tears start to roll down David's cheeks.

                                 DAVID
                        I wanna so bad, but I can't hate 
                        you.

           The Bartender comes over.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Hey, you gotta take it outside.

           George puts a hand on David and puts the other up towards the 
           Bartender, motioning at him to keep quiet. 

                                 DAVID
                           (crying)
                        Liz and I promised each other that 
                        we'd hate you, but I can't do it.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Yo! Take it outside!
                                 DAVID
                           (crying)
                        I don't care what happened.  Okay?  
                        I don't care.  I need you George.

           The Bartender motions to the Bouncer.

                                 DAVID
                           (crying)
                        Can you help me?  

           George just stares at him and puts his hand on his shoulder. 

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t have time to hate you cause 
                        I need you.  

           George gets emotional.  

                                 DAVID
                        Can you help me, Dad?

           The BOUNCER walks over as George stands up and caresses 
           David’s face and looks at him. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        Whatta ya got?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Get these two pussies outta here!

                                 GEORGE
                        I'll help you son.

           The Bouncer grabs George as George whispers in David's ear.

                                 GEORGE
                        Don't be like me.

           George smiles at David who smiles back. He takes the glass 
           and SMASHES it over the Bartender's head.  He turns and knees 
           the Bouncer in the groin. He turns to David.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Nostalgic?

           David grins back, and nods.

                                 DAVID
                        What happens now?

           George caresses David's face.

                                 GEORGE
                           (smile)
                        The rest of them come and kick the 
                        shit out of us. Together. 

           They smile at each other as the rest of the staff close in.  
           George puts himself in front of David and faces them.  He 
           yells as he goes after them.  
           EXT. NEW JERSEY BOARDWALK - MOMENTS LATER

           George and David are thrown out of the bar.  They look at 
           each other, faces smushed.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m never been thrown out of a bar 
                        before.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I’ve never walked outta one.  

           David nods and smiles.  

                                 DAVID
                        What do you wanna do?  

           George looks at all the rides, games and food.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I wish we were in a better place 
                        for a guy to start being a dad.   

           David laughs.  

           EXT. BOARDWALK - MONTAGE

           George smiles and waves at a drunk David each time he comes 
           around on kids’s carousel. He’s scrunched into a tiny car. 

           They gorge on hot dogs and funnel cake. David has a balloon 
           tied to his wrist.    

           George tries to win David a bike on one of the big wheels.  
           He’s not even coming close.  

                                 DAVID
                        Come on.  

                                 GEORGE
                        No!  I’m getting my son a bike!  

                                 DAVID
                        You can’t win at this game.  

                                 GEORGE
                           (whispering to David)
                        Who said anything about winning it? 

           David can’t help but smile.  

                                 GEORGE
                           (whispering to David)
                        I need you to do two things for me 
                        son.  

           David nods, eagerly.
                                 GEORGE
                           (whispering to David)
                        The first is jump on the back on 
                        this bike when I grab it and hold 
                        on for dear fucking life.  

           David’s face lights up with anticipation.  

                                 GEORGE
                        And the second thing is...

                                 DAVID
                        Don’t be like you.  

           They grin and George grabs the bike.  David quickly jumps on 
           the back and George starts pedaling.  

                                 WORKER 
                        Hey!  Stop those guys!  

           George and David are exhilarated as they SWERVE through the 
           people.  David YELLS and puts his arms in the air.  Two 
           policemen on bikes are chasing them.  David looks back. They 
           catch their reflection in a FUN HOUSE MIRROR as they fly by.  

                                 GEORGE
                        We’re ditching the bike!  

                                 DAVID
                        Where?!  

                                 GEORGE
                        Here!  

           George slams on the brakes and David goes flying overhead.  
           George helps him up and they run into the arcade. 

           INT. ARCADE - MOMENTS LATER

           The two policemen are running through the arcade as they pass 
           by the photo booth with the curtain closed.  We zoom in on 
           the pictures coming out and hear some commotion off screen.  
           The first picture drops out with David and George with their 
           arms around each other.  The second picture has them making 
           funny face.  The third picture is George kissing David’s 
           cheek.  The fourth picture is the policeman’s arm reaching 
           inside and grabbing George.  The fifth picture is both of 
           them being pulled from the booth.  George’s hand fights to 
           reach in and grab the photos.   

           INT. POLICE CAR - LATER

           A bleeding George is still cheerful as he’s handcuffed in the 
           back of a police car. Davis on the other hand is starting to 
           feel regretful, his head slumped against the window.    

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know what I’m gonna tell 
                        Michael.  

           George thinks for a bit.  
                                 GEORGE
                        David?  

           David looks over.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I know this conversation isn’t 
                        going to fit the setting but...

           We hear the front door open and someone get in.  

                                 POLICEMAN (O.S.)
                        Two fucking jerkoffs.

           A FINGER comes into frame.  

                                 POLICEMAN (O.S.)
                        Jerkoff number one, jerkoff number 
                        two!  Fucking gotta do paperwork on 
                        this bullshit on a Sunday night for 
                        a couple of drunks.  I should shoot 
                        both you pieces of shit in the head 
                        and dump yas in the swamp.  

           George ignores him. He looks at David lovingly.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m very, very proud of you.  

           David cracks a smile, but doesn’t meet his eyes.  

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re not your father’s son, 
                        you’re so much better.  I had 
                        everything you had and I couldn’t 
                        stay.  You stayed and you fought. I 
                        took beatings, you fought. You 
                        didn’t let not knowing stop you 
                        from trying.  Michael’s a smart 
                        kid, he knows that.   

           David nods.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Just be honest with him.  Be his 
                        friend.  Don’t be scared anymore 
                        because he loves you.  Lotta people 
                        do.  Ya earn that.    

           David looks at his father and puts his head on his shoulder.  

                                 GEORGE
                        A smart women told me once, don’t 
                        believe everything you fear.  

                                 POLICEMAN (O.S.)
                        Fucking fag bullshit.  

                                 GEORGE
                           (towards the Policeman)
                        Sir? Two brief corrections.  One, 
                        there’s only one drunk back here.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE (cont'd)
                        And two when I told you earlier to 
                        go fuck yourself, I want to 
                        apologize. I’m trying to be a 
                        better role model for my son and I 
                        wanna start teaching him the right 
                        way to do things.   

                                 POLICMAN (O.S.)
                        All right.  

           George kisses the top of David’s head. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I actually meant for you to go fuck 
                        your mother.  

           David breaks out in a big laugh. They both crack up, laughing 
           uncontrollably.  The car stops abruptly.  

                                 DAVID
                           (still laughing)
                        Why are we stopping?  

                                 GEORGE
                           (laughing)
                        They’re gonna beat the shit out of 
                        us again.  

           They double over with laughter as the door opens.  

           INT. POLICE STATION - LATER

           Myra is standing there with Linda.

                                 LINDA
                        I can't believe this!  He must be 
                        going crazy in there!  He can't 
                        handle something like this!  Oh my 
                        God, the horrors that must be 
                        taking place in there!  He's going 
                        to be scarred and I don't know if 
                        this one can heal...

           David struts out excited and smiles at Linda through his 
           beaten face. 

                                 LINDA
                        Are you okay?!

           He grabs her face and gives her a big kiss.

                                 DAVID
                        Best night ever!

           He looks at Myra.

                                 DAVID
                        Guess who got a story?

           David walks out and Linda following with a million questions. 
           Myra smiles as George joins her.
                                 MYRA
                        Are you concerned at all about the 
                        ways you bond with your children?

           They hold each other’s gaze as the Policeman hands back 
           George’s things.  She sees the ring inside the plastic bag.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m sorry.  

           Myra tears up a little.  

                                 MYRA
                        The first time you ever said you’re 
                        sorry is the first time you’ve ever 
                        did the right thing.  

           He puts his arms around her.  

                                 MYRA
                        What an asshole.  

           She hugs him back.  

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Myra is putting some dishes in the sink, when she sees David 
           outside telling Michael his story, very animated. Michael 
           cracks up, not believing his ears. 

           Myra looks at the refrigerator and sees strip of pictures 
           from the photo booth.  She smiles and shakes her head.  
           Outside, David throws an affectionate arm over Michael’s 
           shoulder. Contented, Myra walks upstairs. 

           INT. GEORGE'S ROOM - NIGHT

           George is lying in bed when Myra opens the door.

                                 MYRA
                        Awake?

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t wanna close my eyes. 

           George doesn’t look at her but extends his arm.  Myra closes 
           the door.  

                                 MYRA
                        I remember when awake was not my 
                        favorite time to be around you.

           Myra climbs into bed. 

                                 MYRA
                        When you passed out, you were 
                        perfect, cause you couldn't do 
                        anything to make yourself not.

                                 GEORGE
                        Soon I'll be perfect forever. I 
                        wonder if it's gonna hurt.
                                 MYRA
                        Scared of the pain?

                                 GEORGE
                        Pain’s a synonym for George Koster.

                                 MYRA
                        What are you scared about?

                                 GEORGE
                        What I'm always scared about.  
                        Doing something I don't know how to 
                        do.  I didn't learn because I never 
                        tried.  Being a father, being 
                        sober, swimming...

           They lay there for a bit.

                                 GEORGE
                        People’ve accepted me but never had 
                        them forgive me. I don't get it. I 
                        didn't lose anything but time.

                                 MYRA
                        You're not the bastard you think 
                        you are George.  You just weren't 
                        around enough to prove it.

                                 GEORGE
                        They want me back in their lives.

                                 MYRA
                        So do it.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't have enough life left.

                                 MYRA
                        Take the time you have...

                                 GEORGE
                        The time I have left is just enough 
                        to make them hurt even more when 
                        I'm gone. I don't think I can do 
                        that to them again.

           He hugs Myra tight.

                                 MYRA
                        What else can you do?

           They hold each other for a bit.  

                                 MYRA
                        I love you George.  

           George doesn't answer.  He just holds her tight.

           EXT. BACK PORCH - SUNRISE

           George watches the sun come up.
           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           George picks out shells with the girls.

           EXT. PORCH - DAY

           George and Michael discuss the book Michael’s reading.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           George is throwing a football around with Sal. He winces when 
           he catches it and grabs his right side, below his ribs. 

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Myra looks in and sees George talking with Linda.  She's 
           smiling and he's obviously apologizing.  Myra leaves them be.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Everyone is looking through old family photos and laughing.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           OLD HOME MOVIES play on a Super 8 projector.  George sits 
           between David and Liz.

           INT. KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Myra peeks into the living room and sees George in between 
           Liz and David, talking.  He puts his arm around both of them, 
           pulling them closer. Myra sees David hesitate a little then, 
           put his arm around George.  She hesitates, holding back 
           tears, then speaks.

                                 MYRA
                        Dinner.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Everyone is enjoying themselves.  The room is loud and people 
           are laughing.  Most of the conversation is regarding what 
           they have planned and how they want George involved.  He 
           politely nods but keeps quiet.  He looks at everyone and a 
           slight smile comes to his face.  

           Myra notices and he notices her looking at him. The two of 
           them share a moment and George gives her a contented nod.

           He gets up and walks over to her slowly.  He leans over to 
           whisper in her ear as he takes her hand. We PAN DOWN to see 
           the ring on her finger and then PAN UP to see her reaction. 
           They look at each other for a bit and then George slowly 
           starts to walk out.  

                                 DAVID
                           (to George)
                        Where you going?

           Everyone stops to look at him.  George gives a long look.
                                 GEORGE
                        For a swim.

           Everyone laughs but Myra who is now crying but nobody 
           notices.  George walks outside and closes the door.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           We see George’s picture is back in the molding.  

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           We see one of the photos of David and George is torn off.  

           EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           George is staring at the picture.  He puts it in his pocket 
           and looks at the ocean.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Gotta learn sometime.

           He takes a step into the water and keeps walking. 

                                 THE END
