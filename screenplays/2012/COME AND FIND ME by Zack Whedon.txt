           INT. CITY BUS - NIGHT

           The fluorescent lights overhead cast a sickly bright glow 
           over the scattered passengers.  We move to a young woman, 
           CLAIRE, 25, who sits alone, staring out the window.  She has 
           an effortless, chaotic cool.  We can hear muffled music 
           pulsing out from her headphones.  She carries her bag on her 
           lap, arms wrapped tightly around it.

           The bus wheezes to a stop.  A couple of people board, among 
           them a young man, mid-twenties, shaggy hair, t-shirt.  As he 
           moves down the aisle he makes eye-contact with Claire.  She 
           holds it for a split second then looks away.  He chooses a 
           seat across the aisle and one row back from her.  

           He sits, keeping his eyes on her.  She feels his gaze and 
           can’t help but look back.  Their eyes meet again and she 
           quickly looks away.  The young man smirks and turns his 
           attention out the window to the passing street scene.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           INT. CITY BUS - NIGHT

           The bus chugs along.  Claire tugs on the cord overhead and 
           rises as the bus slows to a stop. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Claire steps off the bus and looks around.  The streets are 
           pretty much deserted at this hour.  The bus doors close 
           behind her, as they do the young man squeezes out of the mid-
           body door.  

           Claire avoids looking at him and walks away.  He watches her 
           go.  After a few beats he begins to head in the same 
           direction.

           EXT. UNDERPASS - NIGHT

           Claire walks beneath the underpass.  She can feel the man 
           behind her.  She glances over her shoulder.  He’s about fifty 
           feet back, walking at her pace.  She keeps walking.  

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

           Claire is walking up a steep hill.  The man remains the same 
           distance behind her, keeping up but maintaining his distance.  
           She stops.  He stops.  She turns around.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Are you following me?

           The man stares at her blankly.  He begins walking toward her, 
           closing the gap between them.  Claire slips her hand into her 
           pocket, grabbing her keys.  

           He approaches casually, calmly, without malice and walks 
           right past her.  No, he wasn’t following her.  Claire, 
           exhales, relieved and continues on her way, now following 
           him.  

           He makes his way through a series of turns through this 
           neighborhood, Claire trailing him the whole way.

           He comes to a chain of bungalows, fenced in with a gate.  He 
           begins unlocking the gate.  Claire walks up behind him.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        You live here?

                                 DAVID
                        Yes.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m sorry.

           He unlocks it and holds the door for her.  Claire heads 
           inside and moves down the row of units to her bungalow.  
           David steps up right behind her.

                                 DAVID
                        What are you doing?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I live here.

                                 DAVID
                        I live here.

           Claire looks at the unit number.

                                 CLAIRE
                        No.  Four.  I’m in four.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m in four.

           He holds up his keys, “watch.”  He unlocks the door and heads 
           inside, flipping on the lights.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        See?
           INT. BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS

           Claire steps inside, confused.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        This is my apartment.

                                 DAVID
                        This is my apartment.

           Claire moves to the bookshelf where there is a photo of David 
           and Claire together, smiling, on top of the Empire State 
           Building.  She picks it up.

                                 CLAIRE
                        We know each other.

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Clearly you do.

           They stare at each other.

                                 DAVID
                        We must have lost our memories some 
                        how.

                                 CLAIRE
                        How do you think we get them back?

                                 DAVID
                        I think we have to make love ‘til 
                        dawn and just hope for the best.

           David takes her in his arms and kisses her.  She stops him --

                                 CLAIRE
                        Wait.  What if we’re brother and 
                        sister?

           David shakes his head.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re ruining this.

           He picks her up and carries her into the bedroom.  He drops 
           her on the bed and they both begin taking off their clothes.
           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           David stands at the stove cooking.  Claire enters from the 
           back with a pair of gardening shears and a handful of 
           flowers.  As she puts them in a vase, arranging them, David 
           hands her a forkful of food --

                                 DAVID
                        Taste.

           She does.  It’s clearly delicious --

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t know how you do that.

                                 DAVID
                        I can teach you.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (smiles)
                        No.  Thank you.  I like not 
                        knowing.

           She holds her finger to her lips, that’s a secret --

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Shhhh.

           David scrapes the skillet’s contents onto two plates and 
           carries them to the table.  They eat.

                                 DAVID
                             (re Flowers)
                        Those are pretty.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You’re pretty.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m handsome.

           Claire shovels food down.  She likes it.  David watches her, 
           smiling.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (mouth full)
                        Wha?

           She swallows.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        What?
           She moves the flower arrangement between them so he can’t see 
           her and starts shoveling more food down.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           David is lying on the couch watching television.  Claire 
           comes in the front door.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hey.

           She moves behind him, wraps her arms around him and kisses 
           his cheek.  She watches the television for a beat, then --

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna go to bed.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.  I’ll be in soon.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Come in now.

           She heads to the bedroom.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           David and Claire are lying in bed wrapped around each other, 
           about to drift off to sleep.

                                 DAVID
                        I love you.

           Claire considers him, sweetly.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I love you too.

           She kisses him.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        I really do.

                                 DAVID
                        Good.

           She rests her head on his chest as the temptation of sleep 
           overtakes them.
           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           David is tangled up in the sheets with a pillow bundled 
           around his head, his mouth agape.  He sleeps hard.  Sunlight 
           streams in through the blinds.  His eyes flutter open, he 
           sucks in air and adjusts his position, trying to stay in 
           whatever dreamworld he was inhabiting.  

           After a beat his eyes open again.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           David wanders in from the bedroom in sweats and a t-shirt and 
           stops.

                                 DAVID
                        Baby?

           He moves for the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           He wanders in.  It’s empty.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire?

           EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s a tiny plot of grass.  There’s an avocado tree and some 
           flowers planted in one corner.  David pops out of the house, 
           looking around.  There’s no one there.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           David moves to the couch and sits, flipping on the TV.  He 
           picks his cell phone up off the table, checking it.  No 
           activity.  He puts it down and changes the channel.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           David is dressed, showered.  He speaks on his cell phone.

                                 DAVID
                        Baby, what the fuck.  Where are 
                        you.  I can’t remember what you 
                        said you were doing today, umm, 
                        call me.
           He hangs up and stands there, not sure what to do with 
           himself.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           David’s on his cell again.

                                 DAVID
                        Hi, Darcy?  Hi, this is David 
                        Leight, Claire’s boyfriend.  Yeah, 
                        hi.  Have you spoken to Claire 
                        today?  Okay.  No, no I’m just not 
                        sure where she is.  I’m sure she 
                        told me and I’m just forgetting.  
                        Anyway, thank you, Darcy.  If you 
                        do hear from her... Thank you.

           He hangs up and stares at his phone.  He’s starting to get 
           nervous.

           EXT. GLOWING SUN DRY CLEANERS - DAY

           It’s a small storefront in a line of many small storefronts 
           each more unremarkable than the last.

           David crosses the street, cutting through traffic, heading 
           for the door.

           INT. GLOWING SUN DRY CLEANERS - CONTINUOUS

           David enters, finding there is no one at the counter.  He 
           rings the service bell.  Nothing.  He rings it again, over 
           and over, frantically. 

           MR. YANG, 50, owner and operator of the establishment storms 
           out of the maze of hanging garments, angry.

                                 YANG
                        Coming!

                                 DAVID
                        Hi, sorry, Mr. Yang.  I’m David, 
                        Claire’s boyfriend?  Is Claire 
                        working today?

                                 YANG
                        No.

                                 DAVID
                        Have you seen her today?
                                 YANG
                        She works tomorrow, not today.

                                 DAVID
                        And you haven’t seen her.

                                 YANG
                        No.

           David’s visibly disappointed.  

                                 DAVID
                        Thank you.

           He turns to go.

           INT. DARKROOM - DAY

           David storms in, letting in a wave of light, pissing off the 
           twenty-something photography student inside.

                          STUDENT
                                                          DAVID
           Hey!  What the fuck?
                                              Claire?

                                 DAVID
                        Sorry, I’m looking for Claire, have 
                        you seen Claire?

                                 STUDENT
                        You ruined my prints, man.

                                 DAVID
                        Have you seen her?

                                 STUDENT
                        No!

           David rushes out.

           INT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           David hurries in, hoping she’s returned while he was out.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire?  

           He moves through the rooms quickly.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Claire?
           She’s nowhere to be found.  David, full of nervous energy, 
           finally comes to a stop in the middle of the living room but 
           only because he has completely run out of ideas.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           David sits on the bed, freaked out.  He stares at his phone, 
           waiting for a call.  He types in a text message, the latest 
           of many.  It reads: WHERE ARE YOU?!?!

           He sits there, restless, terrified, helpless. 

           INT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

           In the bullpen of a Hollywood police station.  It is active, 
           clamor everywhere.

           David sits at a table filling out a missing persons report.  
           No one is attending to him.  He finishes, looks around for 
           someone to talk to.  Everyone is busy with something else.

           David rises and moves to a window where a uniformed police 
           officer is working behind a desk.

                                 DAVID
                        Excuse me.  I finished the missing 
                        persons report.

           The officer takes the paper from his hand.

                                 OFFICER
                        Do you have a photograph of the 
                        subject?

                                 DAVID
                        Yes.

           David pulls a photo from his pocket and hands it to her.

                                 OFFICER
                        Okay if you’ll have a seat someone 
                        will be with you as soon as 
                        possible.

           David nods and moves to the waiting area.  He sits down.  He 
           glances to his left.  There is a big bulletin board, covered 
           top to bottom in missing persons fliers.  He looks away.
           INT. POLICE PRECINCT - LATER

           David is slouched down in his chair, his head in his hands, 
           clearly he’s been waiting a while.  

           Finally, a detective, DYLAN MCKINNEY, 40s, approaches him.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Mr. Leight?

           David looks up.

           INT. POLICE PRECINCT - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           McKinney is having David fill in some details for him.  He 
           does this everyday and does it efficiently without seeming 
           insensitive.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Did you guys have a fight before 
                        she left?

                                 DAVID
                        No, everything was fine.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        And what about recently did you 
                        have any disagreements?

                                 DAVID
                        No.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Have you spoken to her family?

                                 DAVID
                        She doesn’t have any family to 
                        speak of.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        You called her friends.

                                 DAVID
                        Yes I called her friends.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Because sometimes people don’t even 
                        realize something was wrong.

                                 DAVID
                        Nothing was wrong.  We were happy.
                                 MCKINNEY
                        Okay.
                             (beat)
                        Says you last saw her at 
                        approximately four forty-five a.m.  
                        Tell me about that?

                                 DAVID
                        I woke up in the middle of the 
                        night, just for no reason, and she 
                        was there.  I looked at the clock 
                        because I was having trouble 
                        getting back to sleep.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        And she was?

                                 DAVID
                        Sleeping.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        And then you woke up at nine thirty 
                        and she was gone at that point.

                                 DAVID
                        Yes.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Is that unusual?

                                 DAVID
                        No, she always gets up before me 
                        and she’ll get coffee or go to the 
                        store but...

                                 MCKINNEY
                        She always comes back.  Where does 
                        she get coffee?

                                 DAVID
                        There’s a place a few blocks from 
                        us called, The Roast.  On Cahuenga.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        And the store?

                                 DAVID
                        Mayfair.  On Franklin and Gower.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        That’s good, that’s helpful.  We 
                        can start there.
                                 DAVID
                        What do I do?

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Anything helps.  Reach out to 
                        people who know her.  If this isn’t 
                        resolved in a few days we’ll give 
                        you a printout of the report, a lot 
                        of people flyer the neighborhood, 
                        you know, telephone poles and 
                        everything, people look at those.  

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Close on a telephone pole where David puts up the missing 
           person flyer.  It has a photo of Claire’s smiling face.  He 
           wraps the pole in packing tape, securing the flyer in place 
           and walks down the street to the next pole where he does the 
           same.

           We push in on Claire’s smiling face.

           INT. BUS - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           We find David who is a few years younger, shorter hair, clean 
           shaven, sitting in his seat watching the world go by.

           We find Claire, who also looks different.  Her hair is black 
           and chaotic, piled on top of her head in a careless, punk-
           rock kind of way.

           David sneaks a glance at her.

           EXT. BUS - NIGHT

           Claire gets off as do a few other passengers, the last of 
           which is David.  They head down the street in the same 
           direction, Claire ahead of David by about fifty yards.

           Everything about this plays out as it did in the first scene 
           except they are in a different part of the city.

           Claire begins heading down a darker, residential street.  She 
           stops and turns.  David stops.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Are you following me?

           David is caught off guard.
                                 DAVID
                        Wha - No, of course not.

           Claire shoots him a dead eyed glare, “bullshit.”  David walks 
           up to her and past her, putting up his hands as he passes.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’m not.

           He heads down the street.  Claire feels like an idiot.  She 
           follows after him.  

           David steps up to an apartment building, pulling out his 
           keys.  Claire reaches the steps.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Fuck, you live here?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I live here.

                                 DAVID
                        I should warn you, a number of 
                        other people live here too.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m sorry, I’m paranoid.  This shit 
                        happens to me all the time.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s all right.

           He heads inside, she follows.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           David heads through the entryway to the staircase and starts 
           heading up.  Claire does too.  As they climb the stairs.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m really sorry.

                                 DAVID
                             (amused)
                        It’s fine.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I thought you wanted to kill me and 
                        rape my corpse.
                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, I wouldn’t do that.

           They reach the second floor landing.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You’re probably a school teacher or 
                        something.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not but I am a pretty good guy.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I can tell that now.  I’m Claire.

                                 DAVID
                        David.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I just moved in, 203.

                                 DAVID
                        The Twisted Sister fan.

           She cocks her head to the side, “how did you know?”

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’m in 303.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh.  Sorry.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s a good album.  Why listen to 
                        it once when you can listen to it 
                        on repeat for like four hours.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I was decorating.  Can I make it up 
                        to you?  I’ll bring you something.  
                        A gift.

                                 DAVID
                        I was joking, it’s fine.  I mean, 
                        bring me gifts, by all means.  But 
                        don’t worry about it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Thank you, David.

                                 DAVID
                        Welcome to the building.

           They share a smile and then David heads off, up the stairs.
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Close on the flyer we saw David put on the telephone pole.  
           It is torn, all the text and the photo have faded to a point 
           of illegibility.  The tape is dry and yellowed, flaking 
           apart.  The tape finally gives out and the flyer drops away, 
           pushed down the sidewalk by the breeze.  

           We move across the street to find David carrying groceries 
           back toward his apartment.  His hair is shorter, he’s lost 
           weight.  

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The place is a mess.  Clearly David has fallen apart 
           psychologically over the intervening months.  He sits down at 
           his computer.  The groceries sit in bags, on the counter in 
           the kitchen.

           He pulls up a web page.  It is dedicated to Claire’s 
           disappearance.  It features a large photo of her, the date 
           when she went missing and contact information should you see 
           her.  There is a “DAYS MISSING” counter on the top of the 
           page.  It is at 380.

           David moves to the inbox of this page but has no messages.  
           He closes it.

           INT. BUNGALOW - KITCHEN - LATER

           David puts away the groceries.  There’s a knock at the door.  
           David moves to the front door, looks through the peep hole.  
           He looks away, takes a deep breath.  He opens the door.  

           It is his building manager, COLLEEN, 50.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Hi, David.

                                 DAVID
                        Hi, Colleen.

                                 COLLEEN
                        How are you doing?

           David’s not sure how to answer that.

                                 COLLEEN (CONT’D)
                        I really hate to do this to you 
                        but... I can’t really wait any 
                        longer.
                                 DAVID
                        How much do you need?

                                 COLLEEN
                        At least one month’s.  

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Do you think you could do that?

                                 DAVID
                        I can make some calls, maybe 
                        someone can help me out.

                                 COLLEEN
                        I’m so sorry.  If it were up to 
                        me...

                                 DAVID
                        I understand.

           INT. BUNGALOW - DAY

           Days later.  The shelves are cleared.  David is moving out, 
           most of his things are in boxes.  

           He moves into the bathroom with a trashbag, opens the 
           medicine cabinet and starts tossing everything in the trash.  
           He leaves behind a few bottles of prescription painkillers.  

           He takes the painkillers and consolidates them, pouring them 
           all into one bottle which he leaves on the sink. 

           He cinches the trash bag shut and drops it in the living room 
           amongst other trash bags.

           He picks up a stack of photographs, stopping momentarily to 
           flip through them.  Touristy photos of he and Claire in 
           various places in Chicago, in Venice, in Paris.

           He drops them in a box and seals it shut with packing tape.  
           That’s the last of it.

           The phone rings, he looks at the number on the caller ID and 
           answers it.

                                 DAVID
                        Hello?
           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           He’s sitting in a booth.  Across from him there is a big 
           duffel bag and a jacket, their owner, BUCK, 32, returns to 
           the table carrying two pints.  He hands one to David.

                                 DAVID
                        Thanks.

                                 BUCK
                        Sorry for dropping in without any 
                        warning, I didn’t think I was gonna 
                        be here more than an hour.

                                 DAVID
                        Well, selfishly, I’m glad your 
                        flight was cancelled.  It’s been 
                        too long.

                                 BUCK
                        I know.
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry about that.  I guess I 
                        didn’t know what to say.  I’m bad 
                        with that shit.  I’m not proud of 
                        it.  
                             (beat)
                        How have you been doing?

                                 DAVID
                        Same.  

                                 BUCK
                        It’s just, it’s too brutal, you 
                        know.  It’s unreal.

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.  Best case scenario is that 
                        she left.  Cops said that happens.  
                        That people are unhappy and no one 
                        knows it and that sometimes they 
                        just leave.  And that’s... That’s 
                        the easiest thing for me to 
                        imagine.  I mean the least painful.  
                        ‘Cause anything else is she’s 
                        killed or she lost her mind.  Least 
                        painful is that she just hated me.  
                        That she hated our life.  And that 
                        breaks my fucking heart.
                             (beat)
                        So, it’s a shitty situation.

                                 BUCK
                        Fuckin’ A, brother.
                                 DAVID
                        But it’s nice to see you.  You 
                        know, Claire didn’t have a lot of 
                        friends or people she felt close to 
                        from college or home or anything.  
                        Aside from you.  It’s nice to talk 
                        to someone who really knew her.

                                 BUCK
                        She was an awesome girl.

           David takes a beat.  He’s been wanting to ask this for a long 
           time.

                                 DAVID
                        Do you think it’s possible?  That 
                        she was just unhappy?

                                 BUCK
                        Fuck, man.  No, first of all, I 
                        don’t.  She was the happiest I’d 
                        ever seen her with you.  And she 
                        had, you know, some trouble here 
                        and there, I mean you know about 
                        it, she was complicated and I 
                        was... I’ll just say I was really 
                        happy for her when she introduced 
                        me to you.  You were a good match 
                        and with Claire I don’t think that 
                        was an easy thing to find.
                             (beat)
                        So there were never any leads or 
                        anything?

                                 DAVID
                        No.  

                                 BUCK
                        Shit.  Brutal.  I don’t know what 
                        to say.

                                 DAVID
                        There’s nothing to say.  It’s good 
                        to see you.

                                 BUCK
                        You too, Man.

           He holds up his glass, David clinks it with his.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        To Claire.  Drink to remember.  
                        Drink to forget.
           David nods, they drink.

           INT. BAR - LATER

           They are drunk now, playing darts, speaking loudly over the 
           din of the bar.

                                 DAVID
                        So what’s in New York?

                                 BUCK
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        You said you’re going to New York?

                                 BUCK
                        New York to London to Paris.  I’m 
                        going to the French Alps.  Friend 
                        of mine has an adventure guide 
                        service thing.  Take rich tourists 
                        climbing, camping.  Make it feel 
                        dangerous.  I’m gonna do a few 
                        trips with him, make some money 
                        then I’m thinking about going to 
                        South Africa for a while.

                                 DAVID
                        What’s there?

                                 BUCK
                        Don’t know.

                                 DAVID
                        Right.

                                 BUCK
                        You should come.

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.

                                 BUCK
                        I’m serious. 

                                 DAVID
                        Maybe I will.

                                 BUCK
                        You’re full of shit.

           David considers him.  
                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                             (re: darts)
                        Toss, brother.

           David fires off his darts in quick succession.  

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Buck and David are walking back to David’s place, crossing 
           over a pedestrian overpass that spans the freeway.  Cars whip 
           by beneath them.  Buck has his duffel slung over his 
           shoulder.  They’re both fairly drunk.

                                 BUCK
                        Thanks for lettin’ me crash, Man.

                                 DAVID
                        Of course.  Place is kind of a 
                        mess, I’m moving out.

                                 BUCK
                        No shit.  Where to?

                                 DAVID
                        Uh, I’m putting everything in 
                        storage, gonna just stay with 
                        friends until I find something new.

                                 BUCK
                        Right on.  You know me, as long as 
                        the place has a roof I’m cool.

           When they reach the other end, Buck starts heading down the 
           zig-zag stairs back down to street level but David stops.  
           After a beat he climbs up onto the railing, looking down at 
           the overgrown embankment twenty feet down.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        What’re you doing?

                                 DAVID
                        You think I can make it?

                                 BUCK
                        Not without breaking your neck, 
                        c’mon.

                                 DAVID
                        Dare me?

                                 BUCK
                        No.
                                 DAVID
                        You don’t think I’ll do it.

                                 BUCK
                        You’re being an idiot, c’mon before 
                        someone sees you.

                                 DAVID
                        Dare me.

           A long beat.

                                 BUCK
                        I dare you.

           David jumps, dropping through the air, his arms spinning.  He 
           SLAMS into the ground with a dull thud, rolling forward, 
           grabbing at his leg in pain.  He lies there for a while, 
           catching his breath, groaning in pain.

           Buck scrambles down the hill to him.  

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        David!  Jesus.  Are you okay?

           David looks up at him, grabbing his leg.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is wrong with you?

                                 DAVID
                        I hurt my leg.

                                 BUCK
                        Is it broken?

           David shakes his head “no”, laughing.  He keeps laughing, 
           harder until he suddenly begins to cry.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, Jesus.  C’mon, Man, let’s get 
                        you home.

           Buck helps David to his feet, supporting some of his weight 
           and they begin to move off.

           INT. DAVID’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           There’s an incessant knocking at the door.  David opens it.  
           It’s Claire.  He’s surprised to see her.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hi.
                                 DAVID
                        Hello.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Are you busy?

                                 DAVID
                        Not really.

                                 CLAIRE
                        A little busy.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not busy at all.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You wanna eat?  I owe you one, 
                        c’mon.

           She waves him out of the apartment, asking him to follow her.  
           David hesitates, then grabs his keys and goes.

           INT. CLAIRE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           They enter Claire’s apartment which is a bit of a mess.  
           There’s a couch with no legs, a mattress on the floor.  The 
           walls are decorated with dozens of unframed photos tacked up 
           in an artfully chaotic way.  There is a large, crudely spray-
           painted portrait of a man taking up one wall.  

           Claire kicks off her shoes and makes her way to the kitchen.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sorry about the mess.

                                 DAVID
                        No, I like your place.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Do you?  I like it.  Can I get you  
                        a beer?

                                 DAVID
                        Sure.  
                             (beat)
                        So what do you do?

           He follows her into the kitchen. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Right now I’m pursuing a career in 
                        Dry Cleaning.
                                 DAVID
                        Doing what?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I work at a Dry Cleaners.

           She grabs him a beer, opens it, takes a swig and hands it to 
           him.  She begins rifling through cabinets.  David looks at a 
           photo pinned to the wall.  The streets of Vancouver, a 
           businessman tries to tame his tie in the wind.

                                 DAVID
                        You take all these?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah, hobby of mine.

                                 DAVID
                        I like ‘em.  Where’s this?

                                 CLAIRE
                             (looking at it)
                        Uhhh, Vancouver.  What do you do?

                                 DAVID
                        Graphic design sort of stuff.  
                        Nothing that exciting.  What - What 
                        is that you’ve got there.

           Claire has pulled two Kraft Easy-Mac containers from her 
           pantry.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Dinner.  It’ll be ready in --
                             (checks the label)
                        -- three and a half minutes.  Wow.  
                        Not too long.

           David takes one from her.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire, this isn’t food.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sure it is.

                                 DAVID
                        No.  You shouldn’t eat this.  
                        You’ll be a fat person.  Come on.

           He takes her hand.
           INT. BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - MORNING

           David wakes up, groggy and rolls over, as he does so he 
           groans in pain.  He moves to the edge of the bed and rises 
           gingerly, moving to the mirror where he surveys the damage.

           There is a massive bruise around his ribs, covering his side 
           and some of his back.  The purple is coming in.  He has 
           scrapes on his face.  

                                 DAVID
                        Fuck me.

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           David wanders into the living room pulling on a t-shirt.  
           Buck is up, packing some things back into his duffel.

                                 BUCK
                        There he is.  How you feeling?

                                 DAVID
                        Sorry about last night.  I was 
                        drunk.

                                 BUCK
                        No shit.  You all right?

                                 DAVID
                        Bruised up but I’m fine.

                                 BUCK
                        Okay.  What’s your plan today?  My 
                        flight’s not until four.

           David rubs at his face trying to wake up, trying to remember, 
           there’s only one thing he has to do.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ve got a bunch of errands to run.  
                        I probably won’t be back before 
                        then but you can just lock the door 
                        when you leave.

                                 BUCK
                        Awesome.  Thanks, Man.

                                 DAVID
                        No problem.

           They stand there for a beat.  
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I guess I’ll head out.

           He grabs his keys and his backpack.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        It was great to see you.

                                 BUCK
                        It was great to see you too, Man.

           Buck moves to him and offers him an awkward hug.  They part.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Take it easy, all right, David?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.

           With that David exits.

           EXT. BUNGALOW - DAY

           David walks out to the street, squinting into the bright 
           sunlight.  It’s hot.  He looks back at his apartment.  He 
           doesn’t have anything to do.  He heads down the street.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           David waits at a bus stop.  The bus arrives and opens its 
           door.  

           INT. CITY BUS - CONTINUOUS

           David climbs on, pays the fare and finds a seat midway back.  
           He sits, looking out the window.  

           INT. CITY BUS - LATER

           The last couple of passengers get off the bus leaving David 
           alone.  The driver spots David in his rear-view mirror.

                                 DRIVER
                        End of the line.

           David looks up.

                                 DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        End of the line, Son.  Time to get 
                        off.
                                 DAVID
                        Can I just stay on for a while?

                                 DRIVER
                        This ain’t a shelter.  It’s for 
                        getting where you need to go.

                                 DAVID
                        Can I stay on until you hit Gower 
                        again?  I’ll get off there.

           The bus driver sighs heavily and shuts the doors.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           David gets off at his stop, thanking the driver as he goes.  
           He steps out into the sunlight and stands there for a bit, 
           not sure what to do with himself.

           EXT. BUNGALOW - DAY

           David walks up the street toward the bungalow.  He stretches, 
           testing the pain on his side.  It’s bad.  

           He walks up to the front door and unlocks it.

           INT. BUNGALOW - DAY

           He walks in and the place is in shambles.  Everything has 
           been torn out of the boxes, the drawers are all pulled out, 
           emptied.  Furniture has been shoved out of place.

           Standing in the middle of the mayhem is Buck, in his 
           undershirt.  He has a pick axe buried in the floor, he’s 
           tearing up the floorboards.  Buck, sweating and out of 
           breath, looks up, almost amused --

                                 BUCK
                        You’re back early.  You said you’d 
                        be gone all day.

                                 DAVID
                        What are you doing?

                                 BUCK
                        Oh, man.  Sorry, David. 

           Buck takes off his work gloves and approaches him.
                                 DAVID
                        What the fuck is this?

                                 BUCK
                        I’m just... looking for something.  
                        That’s all.  I can’t find it.
                             (laughs)
                        You weren’t supposed to come home.

           David looks to him for some kind of answer. 

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t understand.

                                 BUCK
                             (shakes his head)
                        I do apologize, David.

           Buck swings something, David can’t make out what until it’s 
           inches from his temple.  It’s a hammer.

           INT. DAVID’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           David and Claire sit on the floor on opposite sides of his 
           coffee table.  His apartment is neater than Claire’s.  

           He’s made a tasty looking meal which Claire has just taken 
           her first bite of.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Boulder wasn’t my cup o’ tea.  Sort 
                        of a ski bum, beer pong, douchebag 
                        situation.  So I didn’t really make 
                        a ton of friends. 
                             (re food)
                        Holy shit this is good.

                                 DAVID
                        Where did you grow up?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Salt Lake City.  Pretty happenin’ 
                        spot.

                                 DAVID
                        Birthplace of Jazz.

           Claire looks at him, “huh?”

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Nothing.  Does your family still 
                        live there?
                                 CLAIRE
                        Family’s not really in the picture.  
                        Where are you from?

                                 DAVID
                        San Jose, California.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t know anything about San 
                        Jose.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s where computers come from.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’ve heard of those.  Do your 
                        parents still live there?

                                 DAVID
                        My mom does.  My dad died when I 
                        was a kid, dot dot dot, of cancer!
                        Which is a hilarious thing to talk 
                        about... long story short my mom, 
                        after he died, found umm... Jesus.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m familiar.

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, well apparently he was in San 
                        Jose of all places and uh, she 
                        started collecting these little 
                        baby figurines, like baby - 
                        anything that’s a baby sculpture or 
                        anything you know -- she likes 
                        babies, anyways now the house is 
                        like wall to wall little babies, 
                        angel babies and stuff and it’s 
                        just creepy.  And the whole place 
                        is just kind of depressing, not 
                        just my house, I mean San Jose.  
                        Lots of people have rocks, red 
                        rocks in their front yard instead 
                        of grass.  Which I guess is 
                        responsible like with droughts and 
                        everything but it just seems like a 
                        poorly conceived alien planet, you 
                        know, “And the lawns are made of 
                        rocks!” It’s a boring place and I 
                        don’t like it there.  I go there 
                        sometimes but not as often as I 
                        should and...

           Claire crawls around the table toward David.  
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Is there something wrong with the --

           She kisses him on the lips, pulls back. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sorry.  I wanted to do that.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s okay.

           She moves on top of him and they topple to the ground, 
           kissing.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m still chewing my food.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s gross.

           They keep kissing. 

           INT. DARK SPACE - NIGHT

           It’s pitch black, very tight.  A thin ribbon of light cuts 
           through the space.  We can make out David’s face, caked with 
           dried blood.  He comes to, his eyes opening.  He reaches for 
           his head, groaning with the unbearable pain.   

           He begins to look around, he can’t see anything.  He begins 
           to panic.  

                                 DAVID
                        Help!  Help me!

           The ribbon of light is coming from between two small doors at 
           his feet.  He begins kicking at the doors violently, 
           screaming.  He slams both his feet into the door and it rips 
           off its hinges, more light comes pouring in.  He kicks again, 
           tearing it open further and begins to wriggle out.

           EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

           David crawls out of a small metal tool shed in his own 
           backyard.  He gets to his feet and looks around, realizing 
           where he is.
           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           David is sitting on the edge of a piece of overturned 
           furniture speaking to a police officer.  He has an ice-pack 
           pressed to his head.

           Buck clearly continued his search after David was 
           unconscious.  The place is torn apart.  Floorboards are 
           ripped up, every box has been emptied, the light fixtures are 
           pulled out, the walls have been torn open in places.  It’s a 
           huge mess.

                                 DAVID
                        Buck.  Coleman.

                                 OFFICER
                        He’s a friend.

                                 DAVID
                        A friend of my girlfriend, from 
                        college.  They went to Boulder 
                        together.

                                 OFFICER
                        Is your girlfriend here?  Can I 
                        speak with her?

           David takes a deep breath.

                                 DAVID
                        She disappeared a little over a 
                        year ago.  She’s missing.

                                 OFFICER
                        I see.
                             (beat)
                        Do you know if this guy has any 
                        history of mental illness?

                                 DAVID
                        No, not that I know of. 

                                 OFFICER
                        Do you have any idea what he could 
                        have been looking for?

                                 DAVID
                        No idea.
                             (off a look from the cop)
                        I have no idea.
                                 OFFICER
                        Does he have reason to think that 
                        you would have a lot of cash on 
                        hand?

                                 DAVID
                        No.

                                 OFFICER
                        Any idea where he could be now?

                                 DAVID
                        He was just passing through, said 
                        he was flying out at four.  New 
                        York to London to somewhere, I 
                        don’t know.

           INT. HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

           The place is quiet in the middle of the night.  David sits on 
           a chair, his jacket in his hands, waiting, groggy.  His head 
           is bandaged properly.  

           An ER doctor finally returns.  

                                 DOCTOR
                        Sorry for the wait.  How’s the 
                        pain?  Did the percocet help?

           David nods.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Well your cat scan looked good, no 
                        swelling, no bleeding.  You’re just 
                        going to have a nasty welt and a 
                        pretty bad headache too.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           David exits the examination room and makes his way down the 
           hall.  Detective McKinney is sitting in the hall, waiting for 
           him.  He stands.  David stops.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Hey, David.

                                 DAVID
                        Detective McKinney.
                                 MCKINNEY
                        I heard your name over the scanner. 
                             (beat)
                        You all right?

                                 DAVID
                        My head hurts.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        I bet.
                             (beat)
                        Listen, reason I’m hear is I 
                        figured, rather than lettin’ you 
                        get the runaround from god knows 
                        who, I’d take a look at things.  
                        Feel like I owe you one.

                                 DAVID
                        Thanks.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        It’s no problem, listen, I did that 
                        and your pal Buck never flew out 
                        yesterday, not under that name at 
                        least.

           Beat.  David considers him.

                                 DAVID
                        What do you mean under that name?

                                 MCKINNEY
                        I was trying to dig up some 
                        background on the guy, see if he 
                        had any priors but, uh, couldn’t 
                        find anything.  You said he went to 
                        University Colorado at Boulder, is 
                        that right?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, that’s where Claire met him.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        No record of him there.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s got to be a mistake.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        I don’t think it is, David.  

                                 DAVID
                        Why not?
                                 MCKINNEY
                        On a hunch I checked and... Claire 
                        didn’t go there either.
                             (beat)
                        David, you can tell me honestly, do 
                        you know what he was looking for?

                                 DAVID
                        No.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        So you don’t know if he found it 
                        either.

           Off David, his mind racing --

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           David enters the apartment and looks around.  It’s chaos.  He 
           doesn’t know where to start.  He spots a flashlight amongst 
           the junk on the floor and picks it up.

           He moves into the bedroom and stops, trying to think of where 
           to look.  He moves into the closet and climbs up on an 
           overturned box, reaching for a panel above.  He pushes it in 
           and pulls himself up to see into the crawl space.   

           He shines the light around.  There’s nothing.

           He moves back into the living room and pushes through the 
           debris to the box marked “CLAIRE” which has been torn open 
           and emptied.  He throws it aside and looks at the photos at 
           his feet.  He and Claire in happier times.

           We jump cut around as he looks in different places, tearing 
           apart couch cushions, sifting through his things on the 
           floor.

           He moves back into the bedroom and starts tearing the end 
           tables apart, looking for something hidden within but finds 
           nothing.  

           Amidst the debris in the living room David sits, exhausted, 
           his head pounding.  He pulls out a prescription bottle and 
           pops another percocet.  He has reached a dead end.  

           He lies on his side, resting his head on a bundled up 
           sweatshirt.  
           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           David’s eyes flutter open.  He’s lying on the floor where he 
           fell asleep.  He looks across the dusty, cluttered floor into 
           the kitchen where a vase is shattered on the linoleum.

           David pushes himself up, the move is very painful for him.  
           He leans against the wall, staring at the vase, turning 
           something over in his mind.

           He gets to his feet and moves through the room, sifting 
           through his belongings with his foot until he finds what he 
           is looking for.  He looks down at it.  It’s a gardening 
           spade.

           He reaches for it.

           EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           David steps out into the backyard.  He looks at the tool 
           shed, its mangled door lying beside it.

           He looks to the small garden beside the avocado tree.  He 
           moves over to it and drops to his knees.  He tears into the 
           soil with the spade, scooping it away.

           We watch as a pile of dirt begins to form next to him.

           EXT. BACKYARD - DUSK

           David has dug a trench two feet deep where the garden used to 
           be, creating a huge pile of dirt on the lawn.  

           He sits down in the trench, exhausted, filthy, staring up at 
           the tree in front of him.  He takes in its details, its scars 
           and knots.  

           His eyes drift along the roots, following the line of the 
           trunk up into the canopy.  He follows one branch as it 
           stretches up, out and then in response to some long-past 
           natural influence, parts from the other branches and arcs 
           back down, pointing at the ground.

           David looks to the spot the branch would seem to be 
           indicating, beside him.  He raises his arm and drives the 
           spade down into that spot.  Clink.  There’s something there.  

           He begins to dig at the ground, uncovering the hidden object.  
           He clears away the dirt revealing a small, red box.  He pulls 
           it out of the ground and holds it in his lap for a beat.
           He opens it.  There is a plastic bag bundled up inside.  He 
           pulls out the bag and unrolls it.  

           He reaches inside the bag and pulls out a roll of 35mm film.  
           He stares at it.  This is where it begins. 

           INT. DARKROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           David wanders into the red lit room from the blackness of the 
           entryway carrying a brown lunch bag.  He sees Claire hovering 
           over a print.  She turns.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You found me.

                                 DAVID
                        This place is cool.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah, when I’m rich and famous I’m 
                        going to have my own darkroom.

           She points to the brown bag.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                                 DAVID
                        I made you some lunch.

                                 CLAIRE
                        That’s very sweet of you.

           He shrugs.  She takes it from him and opens it.  She pulls 
           out a note from inside, unfolds it and reads it.  She smiles, 
           puts it back inside.  She pulls him close and kisses him.  

                                 DAVID
                        I can barely see you, are you 
                        happy?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m very happy.

                                 DAVID
                        Good.
                             (beat)
                        Show me what you’re working on.

           He peers over at the tray where a print is developing.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’ve been looking at that all day.
                                 DAVID
                        I haven’t, let me see.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You can see when I do something 
                        good.

           David goes for the tray, she holds him back, lovingly.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        When I’m done, okay?

                                 DAVID
                        Fine.

           She wraps her arms around his neck and climbs up on him.

           INT. PHARMACY - DAY

           David is at the counter picking up his developed photos.  
           He’s wearing a knit cap, covering his bandaged head.  The 
           woman returns with a photo envelope and hands it to David.  
           He hands her some cash. 

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           David enters and moves to the overturned couch.  He flips it 
           back over, sits and pulls the envelope from his bag.  He 
           takes a deep breath and opens it.

           He pulls out the stack of photos.  The first is of him, in 
           the kitchen, huddled over the stove, unaware of the camera’s 
           presence.  In the second he turns and sees the camera.  In 
           the third she has moved closer and he is staring at her 
           deadpan.  Then it’s him at the beach.  Claire at the beach.  
           The two of them trying to look as serious as possible.  Back 
           home on the couch in sweatpants, lounging.  They look 
           content.  David can’t help but be moved. 

           He flips to the next photo.  It is taken from far off with a 
           telephoto lens.  It is of an auto body shop.  It is rundown 
           and looks to be in some industrial area.  There are walls of 
           corrugated tin on either side, no other businesses.

           He flips through, there are several of these.  People 
           standing outside the auto body shop.  Cars leaving.  Close 
           ups of license plates. 

           He flips through and it goes back to being photos of the two 
           of them, this time on a hike, up at the top of a mountain. 
           He finishes going through them.  There’s a CD with digital 
           scans of the photos included.  He contemplates it for a beat.

           INT. BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - DAY

           David sorts through the mess and picks up his computer off 
           the ground.  He sets it on the desk. 

           He plugs it in.  He finds the keyboard and mouse and sets 
           them up.

           He inserts the CD of photos into his computer.  He opens it 
           and selects all the photos.

           He flips through them.  He reaches the auto repair photo.  He 
           studies the sign.  All it says is “AUTO BODY.”  

           He zooms in tight and moves all around the picture looking 
           for some detail, some piece of information to work with.  A 
           black cadillac is parked in the entrance.  A man in a suit, 
           walking with a cane, gets out of the car, his back to us.

           He flips to the next one, a black Cadillac is pulling out of 
           the shop.  He searches the image for some revealing detail.  
           Nothing.  

           He flips to next.  The Cadillac is stopped at an intersection 
           in the foreground.  He zooms in and scans the photo.  In the 
           windshield of the Cadillac a street sign is reflected.  He 
           zooms in on it.  It is reversed and warped in the reflection 
           but it can be made out: Bandini.  

           David opens the internet and searches for “Bandini.” A map 
           pops up with a marker on it.  It is in Central Los Angeles.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

           David walks down the alleyway behind his bungalow trying to 
           look nonchalant.  He’s carrying a hacksaw.  He looks around, 
           there’s no one there.  Just trash cans and stray cats.  

           He moves over to a fence where a ten speed bike is locked up 
           with a cable lock.  He looks around once more and begins 
           sawing through the cable vigorously.  He’s making quick work 
           of it.
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           David gets off a bus at a big intersection in Central LA.  He 
           moves around to the front and pulls his new bike off the rack 
           on the front of the bus.  It is smoggy and oppressively hot 
           here.

           He looks up at the street sign above: Bandini Blvd.  He hops 
           on his bike and starts riding.  

           He cruises down Bandini looking for the place from the 
           photograph.  He passes through block after block of bland 
           industrial sprawl.  Tire centers.  Dump truck repair shops.  
           A crematorium.  Massive low slung factories that last a full 
           city block.

           Eventually the buildings thin out on the other side of the 
           street and give way to a train yard.

           Finally he slows to a stop and there it is, the body shop, 
           just as in the photos.  

           He moves to the other side of the street, looking at it from 
           where the photos were taken.  He contemplates it for a moment 
           and then rides toward it.

           He rides up the driveway of the shop and hops off his bike.

           EXT. AUTO BODY SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           This place is all dirt and grime.  A huge lot fenced in by 
           fifteen feet of corrugated tin, it’s an auto body shop and 
           scrap yard.  From the looks of it, an illegal one.

           An unpaved road runs deep into the lot past a small structure 
           which serves as an office.  

           There are discarded car parts stacked a story high on all 
           sides.  Further in there are cinder-block repair garages 
           where a couple of mechanics sit in folding chairs talking.  

           David leans his bike against a rusted-out car frame and moves 
           to the small office.  

           INT. AUTO BODY SHOP - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           He steps inside.  There’s a metal desk, some file cabinets 
           and a whole lot of clutter.  Pink carbon copy receipts are 
           piled everywhere.  It’s a mess. 
           A thick Albanian man, FISNIK, sits behind the desk smoking a 
           cigarette and watching an action movie on his iphone.  He 
           looks up.

                                 FISNIK
                        No business.  Closed.  Full up.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not here for my car, I just had 
                        a quick question for you.

                                 FISNIK
                        What question?

           David reaches into his pocket and pulls out a photograph of 
           Claire.  He shows it to the man.

                                 DAVID
                        Do you know this girl?

                                 FISNIK
                        I don’t know any girl.

                                 DAVID
                        Can you look?

           He holds it out.  Fisnik looks at it.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen her?  Do you 
                        recognize her?

                                 FISNIK
                        I don’t know her.  Why would I know 
                        her?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know.  She’s lost.

                                 FISNIK
                        She is lost?

           He reaches for the photo and takes another look.

                                 FISNIK (CONT’D)
                        I’ve no seen this girl in my life.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay, okay.  Thanks for your time.

           David moves for the door as Fisnik returns to his movie.
           EXT. AUTO BODY SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           David moves out into the middle and glances down the way 
           toward the mechanics lounging outside.  He didn’t come all 
           this way not to ask.  He summons his courage and heads down 
           that way.

           He reaches the mechanics.

                                 DAVID
                        Excuse me.  Sorry to bother you.

           They look his way, coldly.  He holds out the photo.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Do you recognize this girl?  Have 
                        you seen her?

           They shake their heads, disinterested.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Are you sure?

           They don’t even look at him.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

           The two men get up from their seats and move back into the 
           shop, returning to work stripping a car.

           After a beat David walks past the garage, going further into 
           the lot.

           It a massive maze of stripped cars, piles of scrap metal and 
           junk car parts.  There’s no one around.  He walks down a line 
           of single car garages, all of which are closed and look not 
           to have been opened in years.  

           He comes to the only one that is open and peeks inside.  
           There is a card table set up.  Four men, well dressed, sit 
           around it playing a card game.  

           A hand slams down on David’s shoulder and he spins around.  
           It’s Fisnik from the office.

                                 FISNIK
                        You’re not allowed back here.  This 
                        is off limits.  

                                 DAVID
                        I’m sorry I was just looking 
                        around.
                                 FISNIK
                        You get out of here now.

           A man steps out from inside the garage, REZART, 50.  

                                 REZART
                        What’s going on?

                                 FISNIK
                        Nothing.  

                                 REZART
                        Who is this?

                                 FISNIK
                        This is no one, he is confused.

           Rezart looks to David, amused.  

                                 REZART
                        Are you confused?

                                 DAVID
                        I suppose.

           Fisnik grabs David by the arm to lead him away.

                                 REZART
                        Wait, wait.  Is there something we 
                        can help you with?

                                 DAVID
                             (pulls out the picture)
                        Have you seen this girl?  Do you 
                        recognize her?

           Rezart stares at the picture.  His expression tells us 
           nothing.

                                 REZART
                        Fisnik, let the poor boy go.

           Fisnik lets go of David’s arm.  Rezart dismisses him with a 
           nod and he reluctantly walks away.

                                 REZART (CONT’D)
                        This girl, how do you know her?

                                 DAVID
                        She’s my girlfriend, she was.  She 
                        disappeared.  

                                 REZART
                        I see.  That is very sad.  
                                 DAVID
                        Do you know her?

                                 REZART
                        No.  Why would I know her?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know.

                                 REZART
                        Was she in the automobile industry 
                        like myself?

           David shakes his head.  Rezart gestures for David to follow 
           him and walks back toward the garage.

                                 REZART (CONT’D)
                        Why do you come here looking for 
                        this girl, huh?

                                 DAVID
                        I uh... I’m looking everywhere.

           They walk into the garage.  The other men are seated, 
           watching them.  Rezart turns around and looks David in the 
           eye.

                                 REZART
                        But why do you come here looking 
                        for her.

                                 DAVID
                             (getting nervous)
                        She, uh - She spent time in this 
                        area.

           Rezart nods, smirking.

                                 REZART
                        What is your name?

                                 DAVID
                        David.

                                 REZART
                        Now you have a problem, David.

                                 DAVID
                        What do you - What’s my problem?

                                 REZART
                        I don’t believe you.
           Rezart nods to one of the men at the table.  He’s the 
           youngest there, 30 maybe, and has dead eyes.  He stands, 
           moves to the front of the garage, reaches overhead and pulls 
           down the roller door.  It rattles down the track, slamming to 
           the ground loudly.  It is dark, just a single bare light-bulb 
           overhead.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey, wait --  

                                 REZART
                        David, David, look at me.

           He does.

                                 REZART (CONT’D)
                        You have to convince me now.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m telling you the truth.

           The other men laugh heartily at this.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I think I should just go home.

                                 REZART
                        What do you do, David?  What is 
                        your job?

                                 DAVID
                        I’m... unemployed right now.

                                 REZART
                        But what is your trade.

                                 DAVID
                        I do graphic design.  I design 
                        websites.

           Rezart looks to the other men, pretending to be impressed.  
           He turns back to David.

                                 REZART
                        I believed that.

           The young man who closed the door has moved up behind David.

                                 REZART (CONT’D)
                        Sit down.

           He gestures to an open chair.  David, with no other obvious 
           options, takes it.  Rezart pulls up a chair and sits across 
           from him.
                                 REZART (CONT’D)
                        Now, the truth.  

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know what to say.  

           David watches as the man near the door opens a bag on the 
           ground and pulls out a cattle prod.

                                 REZART
                        Don’t pay attention to him, pay 
                        attention to me.

                                 DAVID
                        What do you want?

                                 REZART
                        Why did you come here.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m looking for --

                                 REZART
                        I am losing patience with you, 
                        David.  I know you are looking for 
                        this lady.  Why here.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m looking everywhere.

           Rezart reaches back behind him, the man hands him the cattle 
           prod.  He jabs David in the throat.  He convulses violently, 
           falling out of his chair.  One of the other men picks him up 
           and puts him back in the chair.  

           David clutches at his throat, tears spilling out of his eyes.  
           He has a pretty nasty burn.

           Rezart hands the cattle prod back to the man by the door and 
           stares David down.

                                 REZART
                        Well?

           David is barely able to speak.

                                 DAVID
                        I found this address written down --

           He begins coughing violently, doubling over.  He takes a 
           minute to recover.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I found the address written on a 
                        piece of paper, in her writing, I 
                        was cleaning out her things.  I 
                        just came here hoping, I don’t 
                        know...

           Rezart considers him carefully.  Ultimately, he’s satisfied 
           with the answer.

                                 REZART
                        What is her name?

           He taps the photo.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire.

                                 REZART
                        Claire.  Maybe it would be better 
                        for you if you stopped looking for 
                        her.
                             (beat)
                        Maybe you don’t like what you find.

           Rezart touches his own throat to indicate David’s.

                                 REZART (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry about this.

           He nods to the man by the door who pulls it up with a loud 
           clatter.  

                                 REZART (CONT’D)
                        Now go away from here and don’t 
                        show me your face no more.  Okay, 
                        David?

           David nods.  One of the other men helps him to his feet and 
           shoves him toward the door.  David stumbles away.

           The men emerge slowly from the garage and watch him go.  

           EXT. STREET - DUSK

           David peddles hard, the cool night wind whipping past him.

           INT. BUS - DUSK

           David gets on board, deposits his fare, and stumbles back 
           through the bus, finding a seat in back.  He sits, staring 
           out the window, a hand on his throat, tears in his eyes.
           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The bus pulls away from the stop and heads off into the night 
           followed by a black Cadillac.

           INT. BUNGALOW - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           David showers.  

           Out of the shower he dries himself off.  

           David stands, looking in the mirror at himself, looking at 
           the burn mark on his throat which is red and blistering.  He 
           digs in a box at his feet and pulls out a first aid kit.  He 
           pulls out some antibiotic ointment and applies it to the 
           wound.  

           He bandages it with a square of gauze, taping it in place.

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           David, dressed, digs in the pockets of a discarded pair of 
           jeans.  He pulls out a business card -- DET. DYLAN MCKINNEY -- 
           reaches for the phone and dials the number.

                                 DAVID
                        Detective McKinney?

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Yeah.

                                 DAVID
                        This is David Leight.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Hey, David.  Is everything all 
                        right?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, I was wondering if you could 
                        do me a favor.  I was hoping you 
                        could check on a few things for me.

           He stares down at the ground where there is a picture of he 
           and Claire in front of Cloud Gate, the enormous, mirrored 
           sculpture at Millenium Park in Chicago.  

           He zeroes in on her smiling face. 
           INT. BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           David lies in bed, staring up at the ceiling, wide awake.  
           His mind is racing.  He gets out of bed and walks out of the 
           room.  A few moments later he returns, carrying something and 
           crawls back into bed.  It is a hammer.  He places it under 
           his pillow, turns off the bedside light and curls up, closing 
           his eyes. 

           INT. DAVID’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           David and Claire are lying in bed together, staring up at the 
           ceiling.

                                 DAVID
                        Can I ask you a question?

           Claire sighs, turns and gets a glass of water from the side 
           table.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sure.

                                 DAVID
                        You always change the subject when 
                        I ask you about your family or 
                        anything.

                                 CLAIRE
                        That’s not a question.

                                 DAVID
                        Why can’t we talk about it?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I just don’t want to.

           He starts rubbing her back.

                                 DAVID
                        Why don’t you want to talk about 
                        it?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why are you so interested in it?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know, because I’m in love 
                        with you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You are?
                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.
                             (beat)
                        Should I not be?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I don’t know.

                                 DAVID
                        Well, it’s out of my control so...

           Claire rubs at her face, she’s been dreading this moment and 
           now it’s here.  After a long beat --

                                 CLAIRE
                             (struggling through it)
                        The truth is that I had a brother 
                        and two sisters and my mom and dad 
                        drank a lot.  And they... were a 
                        lot of fun but one time... They 
                        took us to a holiday party at their 
                        friends house and they got really 
                        drunk and my mom drove us home.  
                        She launched us off a freeway 
                        interchange going about fifty miles 
                        an hour and we landed upside down.  
                        The car caught on fire.  They all 
                        died.  I was the youngest... and 
                        the paramedics didn’t even see me 
                        there.  They thought everyone was 
                        dead and they were pulling bodies 
                        out of the car and found me 
                        underneath my brother and sisters.  
                        I was hurt but I lived.  And so... 
                        I don’t like to talk about that.
                             (beat)
                        I had an aunt who was alive and 
                        living in France but she and my mom 
                        were estranged so I was put in a 
                        group home.  And that’s... that.

           David pulls her back into bed.  He climbs on top of her, 
           brushing the hair from her face.  He has tears in his eyes.  
           They both do.

                                 DAVID
                        You’ll never get hurt again.  Not 
                        as long as I live.  Okay?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay.

           He wipes the tears from her face.
           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           We look through the bedroom door in on David’s sleeping form.  
           We hear a soft clicking sound and move over to the front 
           door, pushing in on the knob which jitters slightly.

           We hear the tumbler click and the door knob turns, open.

           INT. BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Close on David.  His eyes pop open.  He grabs the hammer from 
           under his pillow, tears the sheets back, hops out of bed, 
           moves to the dresser which is next to the door and climbs up 
           on top of it, crouching down.

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A man, carrying a canvas bag, walks through the living room 
           carefully, quietly.  He puts the bag down and pulls a pistol 
           from his coat pocket.  It has a silencer attached.  He moves 
           to the bedroom door.

           INT. BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David crouches on top of the dresser, the hammer raised over 
           his head.

           The door is pushed gently open.  The man takes one step into 
           the room and David brings the hammer down hard onto his 
           skull.

           INT. BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - DAWN

           Cool, pale light is beginning to fill the room.  The man, who 
           we now can see is the younger man from the garage, is seated 
           in a chair.  His name is ALEKSANDER.  His arms and legs are 
           bound to the chair with an excessive amount of plastic zip 
           ties.  There is a thick stream of dried blood on one side of 
           his face.

           His eyes begin to struggle open, as they do a wave of pain 
           hits him.  He groans. 

           David is standing across from him holding his pistol.  The 
           man’s bag is open on the bed.  This is where the zip ties 
           came from.

           The man looks out from under his brow, angry.  He pulls at 
           his restraints but they don’t budge.  He’s stuck.  
                                 DAVID
                        Does your head hurt?

           The man nods.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I have Percocet.  It helps.  You 
                        want some?

           He nods again.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I want you to answer some questions 
                        first and then I’ll give it to you, 
                        okay?
                             (beat)
                        Why did you come here?

           He spits at David.  David recoils.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck was that.  I’m being 
                        polite.  I offered you medicine.

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        I’m not going to talk to you.

           David points the gun at him.

                                 ALEKSANDER (CONT’D)
                        You’re not going to use that.

                                 DAVID
                        How do you know?

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        It doesn’t matter how I know.

                                 DAVID
                        But I’m curious.

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        It’s just a feeling you get.  

                                 DAVID
                        What feeling?

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        Fear.

                                 DAVID
                        And you’re not scared right now?
                                 ALEKSANDER
                        No.

           David lowers the gun.  He thinks about that.  After a beat he 
           reaches into the man’s bag and pulls out the cattle prod.  
           The man’s demeanor changes.  David considers him.

                                 DAVID
                        What about now? 

           The man is nervous.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Do you know how much this hurts?

           Aleksander shakes his head.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I do.  
                             (beat)
                        Why did you come here?

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        For information.

                                 DAVID
                        What information.

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        Anything I could find. 
                             (nods to the cattle prod)
                        Or get out of you.

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know anything.  

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        You’d be surprised what you know.

                                 DAVID
                        Do you know what happened to 
                        Claire?

           Aleksander shakes his head, smiling in disbelief.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Did you do something to her?

           He laughs.  David puts the cattle prod right in front of his 
           face.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Tell me!  Why are you laughing?
                                 ALEKSANDER
                        You think I know something.  We are 
                        the same, David.  We are both 
                        looking for the same thing.

                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        Her.

           David stands back considering him.  There’s a knock at the 
           door.  They both glance in that direction.  

           David grabs a roll of duct tape out of the bag and quickly 
           wraps it around Aleksander’s head several times, muzzling 
           him.

           He walks out of the room, closing the door.

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David opens the front door and sees Detective McKinney. 

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Hey, David.

                                 DAVID
                        Detective McKinney.  Hello.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Can I come in?

           David’s a deer in headlights.  He can’t think of a plausible 
           reason why not.

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.

           They both move into the living room.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about the mess.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        I did some digging around like you 
                        asked.  Called in a few favors.

                                 DAVID
                        And?

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Why don’t you sit down, David.
           He sits down on the edge of the coffee table.  McKinney picks 
           up a chair and sits across from him.

                                 MCKINNEY (CONT’D)
                         She was lying to you.  

           David had guessed this much.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        She didn’t go to school at Boulder.  
                        She didn’t grow up in Salt Lake 
                        City either.  I found no record of 
                        her parents there...

                                 DAVID
                        Why would Claire lie about that?

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Frankly, David, I’m not sure Claire 
                        was even really her name.

           That hurts.  David gets lost in his own head.

                                 MCKINNEY (CONT’D)
                        I mean I’m looking into it but...  
                        Listen, this girl was fucked up.  
                        Clearly.  She was part of something 
                        or she just wasn’t who you thought 
                        she was.  It’s not unheard of, 
                        people doing things like this.  Did 
                        you give her a lot of money or 
                        anything?

           David thinks about it.

                                 DAVID
                        Not really.  I paid for a lot of 
                        stuff but nothing... I mean she 
                        just didn’t make a lot.  

           McKinney shrugs, that could be it.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        All right.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        I think the best thing for you to 
                        do is put her out of your head.  
                        Move on.
                                 DAVID
                        I feel like an idiot.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Don’t.  

           There’s a crash from the bedroom.  McKinney looks that way.

                                 DAVID
                        Fucking... cat.  

           McKinney studies David, skeptically.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Clumsy.

           After a beat McKinney rises.  David shakes his hand.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for your help.

                                 MCKINNEY
                        Sure.  If anything else pops up 
                        I’ll let you know.

           They move to the door.

                                 MCKINNEY (CONT’D)
                        Take care of yourself.

                                 DAVID
                        You too.

           McKinney leaves.  David closes the door behind him and 
           presses his forehead to the wall, catching his breath.

           After a beat he peeks out the window and watches McKinney as 
           he walks to his car.  He stops, taking a look back at David’s 
           place, seemingly bothered by something.  Finally he turns, 
           goes to his car, gets in and leaves.

           INT. BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David steps into the room.  Aleksander managed to rock the 
           chair over, falling on his side.  David pulls him back 
           upright.

                                 DAVID
                        Sorry, that was my police man 
                        friend.  I told him you were a cat.

           David unwraps the duct tape from Aleksander’s head.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        How do you know Claire? 

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        I don’t know her.

                                 DAVID
                        Then why are you looking for her?

           Aleksander considers David for a beat.

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        Open my shirt.

                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        Open my shirt.  You want to know 
                        why, open my shirt.

           David reaches over and unbuttons his shirt.

                                 ALEKSANDER (CONT’D)
                        Pull it open.

           David pulls it open.  There are five scars on his torso from 
           bullet wounds.

                                 ALEKSANDER (CONT’D)
                        It was my brother she wanted.  He 
                        wasn’t as lucky I was.  She didn’t 
                        expect me to live but I did.  Big 
                        fucking mistake, you hear me?  
                             (beat)
                        You can do whatever the fuck you 
                        want.  Shoot me.  Go ‘head.  

                                 DAVID
                        You’re wrong.  
                             (beat)
                        You made a mistake.  Claire 
                        couldn’t do that.

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        Simone is what she called herself.

           David shakes his head in denial.

                                 ALEKSANDER (CONT’D)
                        My brother picked her up in a bar 
                        in Chicago.  Drake hotel lobby. 

           This triggers something for David.  Aleksander sees it.
                                 ALEKSANDER (CONT’D)
                        You know it.  Nice hotel.  It’s 
                        also the place to go if you’re 
                        looking for a high-end whore... and 
                        he was.  
                             (beat)
                        She put a knife in the base of his 
                        skull.  

           They stare each other down.  After a moment David reaches for 
           the Percocet bottle, opens it and taps three into his hand.  

           He moves to Aleksander who opens his mouth to receive them.  
           David gives him the pills and tilts a glass of water into his 
           mouth.  He swallows the pills.  After a beat --

                                 DAVID
                        What are you going to do if you 
                        find her?

           Aleksander stares at him, expressionless.  They both know 
           what he’s going to do.

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        What are you going to do?

           David leaves the room, closing the door behind him.

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           David moves into the living room and stands considering the 
           photos on the floor.  He picks up the one of himself in front 
           of the sculpture in Chicago.  It’s framed oddly, favoring the 
           sculpture rather than him.  He looks at it more closely.  

           We push in on it and in the reflected surface of the 
           sculpture we can clearly make out two people among the crowd 
           of tourists.  One we do not recognize.  The other is 
           Aleksander.

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           David unpacks the box of photos, some framed, some loose.  He 
           lays them out on the ground, examining them.  They show David 
           and Claire in better times, all over the world.  Among them 
           there are several that are similar to the Chicago photo, with 
           odd framing that favors a stranger in the background.  

           David’s eyes dart over these unfamiliar faces, his mind 
           racing.  His gaze locks on the photo of the businessman in 
           Vancouver, taken before he and Claire met.  He focuses on it.
           EXT. BUNGALOW - BACKYARD - DUSK

           David throws all the photos into a metal trash can in the 
           backyard.  He dowses them all with lighter fluid, strikes a 
           match and drops it in.  The fire is quickly roaring, 
           consuming the photos.  He tosses more in, destroying the 
           evidence.

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           David packs stacks of film negatives, a negative scanner and 
           his laptop into a duffel with some clothes.

           INT. BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           David enters to find Aleksander struggling against his bonds.  
           He moves to the bed where Aleksander’s jacket is laying.  He 
           picks it up and digs through the pockets.  

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        What are you going to do to me?

           David pulls out a rubber-banded roll of cash.  Hundred dollar 
           bills.

                                 DAVID
                        How much is this?  

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        My people are going to come looking 
                        for me soon.

                                 DAVID
                        Good.  They can cut you loose.

           David pulls out a set of car keys from the jacket.

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        They’re not going to be happy with 
                        what you’ve done.

                                 DAVID
                        Well maybe you can put in a good 
                        word for me.  I’m going to take 
                        your car, it’s outside?

           Aleksander nods.  David stands there for a beat.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Let’s hope we never meet again.

           With that he’s gone, closing the door behind him.
           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           David goes to the duffel, drops the gun and the hammer 
           inside, zips it up and slings it over his shoulder.  He 
           leaves.

           EXT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           David stops at the street and points the key at the street, 
           pushing the unlock button.  A black Cadillac down the street 
           flashes.  David heads in that direction.

           INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

           David gets in and adjusts the seat, the mirrors.  He settles 
           in.  This is a nice car.  He starts it up and pulls away.

           David drives through the night.  

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           David parks the car on a dark seedy street bordering a 
           freeway somewhere east of downtown Los Angeles.  A grizzled, 
           happy drunk leans in an abandoned doorway drinking a nip of 
           vodka.

                                 DRUNK
                        Nice car.  Mine’s in the shop.

           He wheezes out an enthusiastic laugh at his own joke.  David 
           smiles politely.  He moves to the trunk to get the duffel.

                                 DRUNK (CONT’D)
                        Fucking Lindsay Lohan stole it from 
                        me.  Bitch is everywhere... on the 
                        magazines.  I go to rehab there she 
                        is.  I get out, boom!  

           Another hardy laugh.  David closes the trunk, walks up to the 
           drunk and hands him the keys.

                                 DAVID
                        Here.  It’s yours.  Have fun.

           David walks away.  The drunk stands there confused.  He looks 
           to the keys in his hand.

                                 DRUNK
                        What the fuck.
           EXT. UNION STATION - NIGHT

           David weaves through waiting taxis, making his way to the 
           entrance.

           INT. UNION STATION - CONTINUOUS

           David wanders through the impressive lobby of the building, 
           finding his way to a ticket window where a disinterested 
           employee waits behind cloudy bullet-proof glass.  

                                 DAVID
                        I want a ticket to Vancouver.

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK

           The place is clean, empty and the walls are painted a hideous 
           mustard-yellow color.  We hear a key fumbling in the lock.  
           The door swings open and Colleen, the landlord, enters 
           followed by Claire and David.  She’s showing them the place.

                                 COLLEEN
                        Here you are.  Lots of light.  We 
                        just painted.

                                 DAVID
                             (lying)
                        It’s wonderful.

           He and Claire share a look.  Claire takes the camera slung 
           around her neck and starts snapping pictures.   

                                 COLLEEN
                        These were built in the twenties.  
                        We bought them ten, fifteen years 
                        ago and fixed them up.  Take a look 
                        around. 

           Claire moves off to the bathroom and we follow David into the 
           kitchen.  He glances around, tests out the faucet.  Good 
           water pressure.  He moves out through the back door to the 
           yard.  

           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           David steps down into the yard and looks around.  It isn’t 
           much but it’s nice.  There’s no garden underneath the avocado 
           tree, just grass.  

           He takes a deep breath.  He likes it here.  He hears a 
           snapping and turns around.
           Claire is standing in the doorway taking pictures of him.  
           She moves toward him snapping away.  She gets right up close. 
           Snap.  Snap.  Snap.

                                 DAVID
                        What do you think?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I like it.

                                 DAVID
                        Does the fireplace work?

                                 CLAIRE
                             (shakes her head)
                        Bricked in.

           David bares his teeth, “go like this.”  Claire bares hers.  
           He picks a poppy seed out from her teeth.  

                                 DAVID
                        There.  Back to perfect.

           She smiles and snaps another photo of him.

           INT. TRAIN - BEDROOM - DAWN

           David wakes up in bed and squints at the morning light coming 
           in the window.  He turns over and looks out at the scenery.  
           Northern California at dawn, the early morning mist beginning 
           to burn off, it’s beautiful.

           INT. TRAIN - BEDROOM - DAY

           David sits at the table scanning negatives into his computer.  
           He feeds the strips of film through the scanner and opens 
           them on the computer, sorting them into files by location, 
           Vancouver, Chicago, New York, D.C. and so on.

           He opens the photos of the Auto Body shop again, the scans of 
           the negatives allow for much closer examination.  He looks at 
           the man with the cane.  His face is obscured.

           He flips to the photo of the Cadillac under the street sign.  
           He tweaks some of the levels, adjusting the contrast and is 
           suddenly able to make out the face of the person in the 
           passenger seat.  It’s BUCK.  He stares at the photo, unsure 
           of its meaning.
           He opens the Vancouver folder and flips through the images.  
           He zooms in on a man in the background, selects that portion 
           of the photo and saves it to a folder.  He goes through other 
           Vancouver photos and finds this man over and over again.  

           In one of the photos the man is walking into a downtown 
           office building, the sign out front indicates that it houses 
           a law firm, Bates Kaplin Moorehead and Ames.

           INT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           David gets off the train.  It’s cold.  David opens his bag, 
           pulls out a jacket and heads for the exit.

           INT. TAXI - DAY

           David rides in back looking up at the Vancouver skyline.  

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           David gets out of the taxi looking up at the skyscraper 
           before him.  He heads for the entrance, passing the sign we 
           saw in the photo, Bates Kaplin Moorehead and Ames.

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           David makes his way through the busy lobby, looking around.  
           He makes his way over to the security desk which is manned by 
           a few uniformed guards.

                                 GUARD
                        Can I help you?

                                 DAVID
                        Maybe, maybe, I’ve got sort of a 
                        strange question.
                             (pulls his laptop from his 
                              bag)
                        Just a second.

           He opens it up and clicks on a few of the cropped photos of 
           the mystery man.  He turns it around for the guard to see.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Do you recognize this man?  Do you 
                        know who he is?

           The guard shrugs, no.  He taps another guard, an older man.  
           He glances over.
                                 GUARD
                        You know who this guy is?

           His eyes narrow looking at the image on the screen.

                                 OLDER GUARD
                        What’s this about?

                                 DAVID
                        I - These photos I found on an old 
                        camera I bought, I was just 
                        curious, thought maybe I could get 
                        them back to their rightful owner.

           The older guard studies David.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Any idea?

                                 OLDER GUARD
                        That’s Mr. Ames.

                                 DAVID
                        Mr. Ames.  He works here?

                                 OLDER GUARD
                        Used to.  Mr. Ames passed five 
                        years ago.  Good man.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, I’m so sorry.  Thank you.

           David closes the computer and walks away.

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           David sits at a table with his laptop, researching Ames.  We 
           see on his screen and obituary for Richard Ames, an attorney 
           turned venture capitalist.  We pick up words from the 
           obituary: “heart attack”, “survived by his two children, Mary 
           and Oliver and his wife Evelyn.”

           David searches Evelyn Ames.  

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MORNING

           David wanders through a very upscale neighborhood.  The lots 
           and the houses on them are enormous.  Aside from the 
           occasional luxury car drifting past it is quiet.  

           He glances over his shoulder to see a black town car moving 
           slowly down the street behind him.  
           He nervously picks up his pace.  He can’t resist and gives it 
           a second look, eyeing it suspiciously.  As he does it turns 
           down another street and disappears.  He takes a deep breath, 
           calming himself.  He’s getting paranoid.  After a beat he 
           keeps walking.

           David approaches a massive home set far back on a big piece 
           of land and wanders up the winding brick path to the front 
           door.  He rings the bell.  After a moment a maid answers.

                                 DAVID
                        Hello.

                                 MAID
                        Hello.

                                 DAVID
                        Is Mrs. Ames home?

                                 MAID
                        Can I tell her who is asking?

                                 DAVID
                        My name is David.  I wanted to ask 
                        her something about Mr. Ames, 
                        Richard.  It’s difficult to 
                        explain.  I came all the way from 
                        Los Angeles and I just wanted to 
                        ask her a question.

           The maid looks David over.  He smiles.  She holds up a 
           finger, “one minute”, and closes the door.  After another 
           minute Mrs. Ames opens the door.  She’s a stately woman, not 
           so much cold as guarded.  The maid stands by, looking on.

                                 MRS. AMES
                        Are you a reporter?

                                 DAVID
                        No, no, absolutely not.  I -- this 
                        is hard to explain, my girlfriend 
                        disappeared a little over a year 
                        ago and I -- since then I -- I’m 
                        sorry.  She spent a lot of time 
                        here in Vancouver before I knew 
                        her.  I know she was very 
                        interested in your husband and I’m 
                        grasping at straws here but --
                             (pulls out her photo)
                        -- do you recognize her?  

           Mrs. Ames considers him then takes a look at the picture.  
                                 MRS. AMES
                        She seems familiar. 

                                 DAVID
                        She does.

                                 MRS. AMES
                        But I couldn’t tell you why.  I met 
                        a lot of people with Richard.  I’m 
                        sorry. 

                                 DAVID
                        Her name was --

                                 MRS. AMES
                        I don’t know her.  I’m very sorry.  
                        Good luck.

           She closes the door.  David stands there for a beat before 
           turning to go.  

           He walks down the brick path to the street.  After a few 
           moments, the maid exits the house and hurries down the path --

                                 MAID
                        Mr. David!

           He turns as she reaches him.  She indicates the photo in 
           David’s hand.

                                 MAID (CONT’D)
                        I know this girl.  

                                 DAVID
                        You do?

                                 MAID
                        Rosalyn.  She worked here with me 
                        before Mr. Richard passed.  

                                 DAVID
                        Worked here?

                                 MAID
                        She was -- like me -- a maid here. 

                                 DAVID
                        For how long?

                                 MAID
                        Oh, two months, three months.  
                        After Mr. Richard died she left.
                             (hushed)
                        She didn’t like Mrs. Evelyn.  
           She puts a hand on David’s arm, comforting him.

                                 MAID (CONT’D)
                        She was a nice girl.
                             (beat)
                        I hope you find her.

                                 DAVID
                        Thank you.

           After a beat the maid turns and heads back to the house.  
           David watches her go.  He looks to the picture in his hand.  
           Rosalyn.  He tucks it into his jacket pocket and begins 
           walking down the street again.  

           As he rounds the corner we see, about a hundred yards behind 
           him, the black town car parked on the street.  It pulls out 
           and begins slowly cruising down the street, trailing him.  

           David glances over his shoulder, sensing the town car’s 
           presence.  He turns back, trying not to panic, trying to 
           appear calm.   

           He turns another corner, the road winds down through thick 
           woods on either side.  He resists the urge to glance back.  
           The town car rounds the corner behind him, keeping its 
           distance.  

           David feels it there.  His heart is pounding.  There aren’t 
           any houses in sight now.  The tires chirp as the town car 
           SUDDENLY RACES FORWARD. 

           David cuts right, running into the woods, hauling ass through 
           the thick foliage.  We see behind him the town car screech to 
           a halt and a man, who could be a Secret Service agent, jump 
           outs, he follows David into the woods as the car peels out.

           David glances back, sees the man chasing him.  He’s 
           terrified.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           He digs in, pumping his legs as hard as he can.  The woods 
           suddenly slope down a steep hill, David leaps, landing 
           halfway down and sliding the rest of the way on his butt.  He 
           gets himself up and keeps running.

           He trips over a vine and slams to the ground.  As he gets up 
           he sees his pursuer coming down the hill behind him.  He 
           scrambles up and sprints forward, down another long hill.  He 
           jumps off a large boulder protruding from the hill, lands and 
           crouches down against it, taking cover.
           THE MAN -- comes over the lip of the hill and charges down, 
           slowing a bit, trying to spot David.

           DAVID -- crouches by the boulder his bag unzipped at his 
           feet.  He looks at the options inside.  The gun and the 
           hammer.  He grabs the hammer.

           THE MAN -- scurries down the hill, coming down around the 
           side of the boulder.  

           DAVID -- holds the hammer close, trying to stay silent, 
           listening as the man’s footsteps crunch closer and closer.  
           He’s very near.  Only a few feet now.  David takes a deep 
           breath.

           He jumps out, swinging the hammer and slams it right into the 
           man’s shin, crushing it.  The man drops to the ground 
           screaming, looking up at David who is now over him.  

           He pulls a handgun from a shoulder holster.  David swings the 
           hammer down and shatters his knuckles, knocking the gun 
           loose.  

           David grabs the gun, tosses it deep into the woods, picks up 
           his bag and takes off running again.  

           The man tries to get to his feet but drops immediately in 
           pain.

           David chugs through the woods, hammer in hand, his lungs 
           burning.  He hits a worn path and takes it, hurrying toward 
           where the woods thin out ahead.

           He reaches the opening and is on the side of a busy road.  
           Across it there is a lake.  He stumbles into the road, trying 
           to stop a passing car -- It swerves past him blaring its horn 
           -- two more pass before he gets in front of one, making them 
           screech to a halt -- He runs to the passenger door, pulling 
           the handle, banging on the window --

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Help me!  I need a ride please 
                        please just let me in --

           The driver pulls away, spinning David to the ground -- As he 
           gets up he sees the town car speeding down the road, pulling 
           around another car -- He starts to run but a black Suburban 
           skids sideways, blocking the road -- He turns to see the town 
           car do the same on the other side -- 

           Men in suits leap from the cars, their guns drawn -- David 
           puts his arms up over his head as the men move in on him, 
           throwing him to the ground --
           I/E. SUV - DAY

           David sits in the back of the SUV flanked by two of the 
           suited men as the vehicle speeds down a busy road.

           The truck makes its way over a series of bridges, out into 
           the country.  Driving down a two-lane road through endless 
           grassland, the vehicle cuts left onto a dirt road.  

           The dirt road winds through tall evergreens, eventually 
           coming to a stop in a clearing.  The clearing looks out over 
           a massive gorge.  It’s beautiful.  No one in the car does 
           anything.  They stay put.

                                 DAVID
                        What are we --

                                 AGENT
                        Keep your mouth shut and wait.

           David does as he’s told.

           EXT. CLEARING - LATER

           The sun has dropped down some in the sky, slowly approaching 
           the horizon.  Finally, a matching SUV pulls up into the 
           clearing and parks.  A man, ANTHONY BREYER, 45, steps out.  
           Breyer has an odd manner to him, friendly but somehow just a 
           little off, possessing the kind of peculiarity that 
           accompanies genius.  He appears incredibly fit but doesn’t 
           dress quite as well as his counterparts, his suit seems one 
           size too small. 

           He moves to the other SUV as the agents escort David out of 
           the vehicle.

                                 BREYER
                        David.  How do you do.  Anthony 
                        Breyer.  
                             (dismissing the agents)
                        Thanks guys.

           They peel off, releasing David from their grasp.  Breyer 
           gestures for David to join him, walking away from the trucks.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        I apologize, we must have 
                        frightened you.  You really did a 
                        number on Agent Jackson I hear.

                                 DAVID
                        He was chasing me.  He had a gun.
                                 BREYER
                        You’re not in any kind of trouble, 
                        David.

                                 DAVID
                        What do you want?

                                 BREYER
                        I want to talk to you.

                                 DAVID
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 BREYER
                        I work for the Government.  
                        Defense.

           Breyer looks out at the gorge.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        I tell ya’ I don’t usually go in 
                        for this nature shit but goddamn.   
                        This is something, huh?

           Breyer walks to the edge, looks down the steep rocky cliff.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        Take a look at that.  It makes your 
                        heart go.

           David keeps his eyes on Breyer.  Breyer turns back.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        You’re looking for your ex-
                        girlfriend.

                                 DAVID
                        We didn’t break up.  She 
                        disappeared.  Claire.  

                                 BREYER
                        That’s right.  Claire.  

                                 DAVID
                        You knew her I guess?

                                 BREYER
                        Yes.  
                             (beat)
                        She worked for me.  I trained her 
                        actually.  We were very close.  
                             (beat)
                        I’m here to answer a few of your 
                        questions.

                                 BREYER (CONT'D)
                        The ones I can at least.  Give you 
                        some closure.  But none of this is 
                        going to be easy to hear. 

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.

                                 BREYER
                        Claire worked for us in a variety 
                        of capacities.

                                 DAVID
                        Like what?  

           Breyer looks at him, that’s not one he is going to answer.

                                 BREYER
                        It was required that she establish 
                        a cover.  A life.  One that would 
                        allow for a great deal of travel.  
                        One that wouldn’t draw a lot of 
                        attention.

                                 DAVID
                        Is she alive?

                                 BREYER
                        July of last year she was called in 
                        for an operation overseas.  She was 
                        killed in action thirty-six hours 
                        later.
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry, David.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re lying.  That doesn’t make 
                        sense.

                                 BREYER
                        I’m really am sorry to tell you.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re lying.

                                 BREYER
                        I’m not.  I wish I was.

                                 DAVID
                        No, why didn’t she make up a lie 
                        then when she left, if she thought 
                        she was coming back, why did she 
                        just disappear.  It doesn’t make 
                        sense.
                                 BREYER
                        When she returned from the mission 
                        she was going to be relocated.  To 
                        a different city, a different life.

                                 DAVID
                        Why?

           Breyer’s reluctant to answer.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Why?

                                 BREYER
                        It was her request.  I’m sorry.

           David drifts off, considering that, thinking it all over.

                                 DAVID
                        Do you have proof?  Of any of this?

           Breyer just stares at him.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You’re so interested in giving me 
                        closure.

           Breyer takes a deep breath.  He reaches into his inside coat 
           pocket and pulls out an envelope.  He hands it to David.  

                                 BREYER
                        Open that if you have to.  But I’ve 
                        seen what’s inside and I wouldn’t 
                        if I were you.  I mean it.

           David takes the envelope, tentatively and looks at it.  After 
           a beat of contemplation he opens it and pulls out three 
           photos.  Suddenly weak, he drops to his knees.  

           We see glimpses.  Cold, clinical autopsy photos of Claire’s 
           naked body.  Her chest, neck and face are riddled with bullet 
           holes.  Her hair is matted with blood.

           David drops the photos, in shock.  Breyer reaches down and 
           picks them up.  David begins to cry, shaking.  A year’s worth 
           of pent up dread is released.  

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        We need you to stop digging around 
                        her past, David.  She handled 
                        sensitive material, sensitive 
                        situations that don’t need stirring 
                        by your inexpert hands.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        It’s dangerous.  For you.  For all 
                        of us.

           Breyer considers the gorge before them.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        Let it go.  Okay?  You’re still on 
                        the outside.  Stay there.  I can’t 
                        guarantee your safety otherwise.

           David glances at him, was that a threat?  Breyer looks over 
           the edge of the gorge, spits.  He turns and heads back to the 
           cars.  

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        Take your time.

           David kneels, staring out at the horizon, his face streaked 
           with tears, broken --

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           David and Claire have moved all their stuff in.  There are 
           boxes and furniture taking up the center of the room.  The 
           perimeter is all lined with plastic drop sheets.  They’re 
           painting the walls white, covering the mustard yellow.  

           They each have a roller and are working on opposite walls.  
           David paints in a methodical, orderly and expert fashion, 
           making his way up and down the wall.  

           Claire is haphazard in her approach, going for wild sweeping 
           strokes at odd angles, creating a tangle of white amidst the 
           yellow.  David glances over his shoulder and sees what she is 
           doing.  He puts down his roller and moves over to where she 
           is working.  He gets behind her and takes the roller in his 
           hands, showing her how to do it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What are you doing?

                                 DAVID
                        I’m showing you how to do it right.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I like how I do it.  

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah but it’s wrong, it’s not gonna 
                        look as good.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I know how to paint.
                                 DAVID
                        Do you?

                                 CLAIRE
                        You’re gonna be an asshole?

                                 DAVID
                        I’m never an asshole.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Right now you are.

                                 DAVID
                        Not really, I’m just being sort 
                        of... normal.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Agree to disagree I guess.

                                 DAVID
                        We just have a lot to do.  The 
                        ceiling is gonna take forever.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’ll do the ceiling, okay?  Relax.  

                                 DAVID
                        You can’t do the ceiling.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why not? 

                                 DAVID
                        It’s gonna be all messy and bad.  
                        Like that wall, which sucks.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Watch me.  I’ll do the ceiling 
                        right fucking now.  And it’ll be 
                        perfect.

                                 DAVID
                        If you say so.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why don’t you go get a beer, you’re 
                        getting a little worked up about 
                        the paint job.

                                 DAVID
                        Word.

           He leans over and gives her a kiss, heads for the kitchen.
           INT. BUNGALOW - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           David goes to the fridge, retrieves two beers, opens them.

                                 CLAIRE (O.C.)
                        All done!

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David walks in and stops.  Claire is standing on a chair in 
           the middle of the room with a big thick black marker in hand.  
           She has been writing something on the ceiling.

           David looks up.  It says, “DAVID IS AN ASSHOLE.”  Claire 
           smiles innocently.  David reaches for the marker.

                                 DAVID
                        You mind?

           She hands it to him and steps down.  David puts down the beer 
           and climbs up.  He begins scribbling a response.

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           David and Claire are lying side by side on the floor looking 
           up at the ceiling.  They’ve covered a significant area with a 
           back and forth in black marker.  

                                 DAVID
                        This is going to be a bitch to 
                        paint over.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Tomorrow.  

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.

           Claire sits up and pulls David’s arm into her lap.  She 
           starts writing on it.  She finishes and lies back.  David 
           looks at his arm.  She’s drawn a heart and the words “DAVID 
           AND SARAH FOREVER”  David looks at it quizzically.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I don’t get it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Huh?

                                 DAVID
                        Sarah?
           Claire looks at his arm, laughs.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It’s a joke.  Sarah.  Isn’t that 
                        the name of the waitress you have a 
                        crush on at what’s it called?

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, what, Sunshine Cafe?  Is her 
                        name Sarah?  

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah, right?  It’s a joke.

           David stares at it.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s incredibly hilarious.

           She sits up, takes his arm again, crosses it out and writes 
           “CLAIRE”.

                                 CLAIRE
                        There.  That’s better.

           She curls herself around David as he stares up at the 
           ceiling.

           INT. SUV - DUSK

           The truck speeds back toward the city.  David sits staring 
           out the window.  Breyer is looking at his blackberry.

                                 DAVID
                        What was her name?

           Breyer looks up.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Was her name Claire?

                                 BREYER
                             (shakes his head)
                        Sarah.

                                 DAVID
                        Sarah what?

           Breyer shakes his head, he can’t tell him.  David gets it, he 
           turns back to the window.
                                 BREYER
                        Can I ask you a question?  What 
                        brought you to Ames’ house?

                                 DAVID
                        Photos.  Old photos Claire had from 
                        before I knew her.  He was in a 
                        bunch of them, Ames.  I didn’t ever 
                        notice it until... recently.

           Breyer nods, interesting.  

                                 BREYER
                        Regular Philip Fucking Marlowe, am 
                        I right?  You’ve got a knack for 
                        this shit, Dave.

                                 DAVID
                        Who was he?

                                 BREYER
                        You tell me.

                                 DAVID
                        Billionaire, venture capitalist.  

                                 BREYER
                        That’s right.
                             (beat)
                        Weekends he liked to put on a red 
                        hood and convince disenfranchised 
                        teens to join the Aryan 
                        Brotherhood.  He put enough money 
                        in the right pockets to keep that 
                        fact quiet.  He was a huge 
                        financial lifeline for the 
                        movement.

                                 DAVID
                        So you killed him.

                                 BREYER
                             (yup)
                        Richard Ames died of a heart 
                        attack.

           Breyer crosses his legs.  His pant leg gets pulled up a bit 
           revealing the hint of a nasty scar on his leg.  David notices 
           it, Breyer sees him notice it.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        Had a run in with some Columbian 
                        mercenaries a couple years back. 
           He pulls up the pant leg revealing a horrifying scar that 
           runs up past his knee, clearly the result of many surgeries.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        More metal than man at this point.

                                 DAVID
                        Must’ve taken a while to recover.

           He pulls it back down, covering the scar. 

                                 BREYER
                        Two years of physical therapy 
                        before I stopped walking like a 
                        zombie from a bad horror movie, you 
                        know?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, so you were like on crutches 
                        for a long time?

           Breyer stares at him a beat, smirks.

                                 BREYER
                        A cane.

           David nods.  After a long beat, casually --

                                 DAVID
                        Who’s Buck?
                             (beat)
                        Friend of Claire’s who she 
                        introduced me to.  

                                 BREYER
                        Right, he was part of her cover.

                                 DAVID
                        He came to my place looking for 
                        something.

                                 BREYER
                        I apologize for that.  Buck was 
                        decommissioned a while ago, he 
                        washed out.  After Sarah died he 
                        was convinced she left something 
                        behind, his behavior became erratic 
                        as I guess you witnessed.  The job 
                        got him, it happens. 

                                 DAVID
                        I see.
                                 BREYER
                        He won’t bother you again.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.

           There is a long beat of silence.  Conversation has run out.

                                 BREYER
                        You said you have those pictures of 
                        Sarah’s on your computer.  Mind if 
                        I take a look?

                                 DAVID
                             (beat)
                        Did I say that?

                                 BREYER
                        Yeah mind if I take a look?

           David’s pulse quickens.

                                 DAVID
                        No. 

           He unzips the bag on the floor and pulls out the computer.

                                 BREYER
                        Thanks.

           Breyer opens it up, starts clicking through the photos 
           intently.  He looks up and smiles at David.  We watch the 
           screen as he comes to the photos of the auto body shop.  He 
           stops.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        I’m asking myself why’s he so 
                        interested in my rehab and then I 
                        realize... You haven’t been 
                        completely honest with me have you.

           David is sweating.  Breyer flips the screen around, showing 
           David the image of the chop shop.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        Where are the negatives?

           David can’t meet his eye, his heart is pounding.  He glances 
           at the bag at his feet.  Breyer looks at it, then to David.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        No.  Really?
           He reaches down and pulls it open, sees the stack of 
           negatives.  He looks up at David, pleased.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        Sonofabitch.  

           He turns and whispers something to the driver.  David reaches 
           down into the bag.  Breyer turns around and David has the gun 
           inches from his face.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        Oh my gosh.  Where’d you get that?

                                 DAVID
                        Let me out.  Here.  Driver!  Pull 
                        over!

                                 BREYER
                        Don’t pull over, Michael.

           David pulls the hammer back on the gun.  Breyer’s hands flash 
           out at David, disarming him expertly in a split second.  He 
           puts the gun on David.  

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        What a mess.  This whole thing.  
                        Nothing’s gone as I intended.  Not 
                        one thing.

           They hit a small bump, David dives forward into Breyer’s mid-
           section.  They struggle for the gun.  They spin around.  
           David gets his hands around Breyer’s hands and is able to 
           PULL THE TRIGGER -- FIVE QUICK SHOTS -- Brain matter 
           splatters across the windshield -- The driver slumps forward 
           against the wheel, dead.  

           David grabs a seatbelt, pulls it across his body and clicks 
           it in just as they drift off the road and SMASH INTO A 
           CONCRETE BARRIER -- Breyer flies across the car, smashing his 
           head on the ceiling.  

           David’s hurt, maybe broke some ribs in the collision, he gets 
           free, grabs the bag from his feet and climbs from the 
           wreckage.  

           He runs away, trying to put some distance between himself and 
           the car.  

           Breyer climbs out, his head bleeding.  Another agency SUV 
           speeds up to the wreck, screeching to a halt.  Breyer pulls a 
           9mm from his shoulder holster and fires at David.
           THE BULLET MISSES HIM BY AN INCH -- David cuts around a 
           corner and heads down an alley, coming face to face with a 
           chain-link fence, razor-wire at the top.  David scrambles up 
           it, taking whatever damage the razor-wire can inflict and 
           throwing himself over the other side.

           EXT. WATERFRONT CEMENT FACTORY - CONTINUOUS

           Large trucks rumble by sending up clouds of chalky rock dust.  
           David runs through the maze of machinery, trying to get away.

           As he wanders through, trying not to draw attention he sees, 
           one hundred yards away, the agency SUV speed through the 
           entrance, narrowly missing workers, weaving between trucks --

           David sprints the opposite direction, toward the water.  

           The SUV is coming for him -- David runs around the back of a 
           line of massive, storage towers and is at the edge of the 
           water.  Giant barges are lined up, taking on loads of cement.

           David leaps down onto one, tumbling to a stop.  He gets up, 
           runs to the edge and LEAPS TO THE NEXT ONE JUST AS IT PULLS 
           AWAY -- David climbs in with the cement, hiding himself --

           The barge heads into the waterway, leaving the factory 
           behind.  As it heads under the Granville Bridge it passes a 
           marina.  David climbs out, runs to the edge and JUMPS OFF, 
           into the icy water and starts swimming for the marina.  

           David reaches the boats and snags the ladder hanging off the 
           back of a small yacht.  He climbs up onto the rear deck and 
           moves for the sliding glass door to the cabin. 

           INT. YACHT - CONTINUOUS

           David yanks the door open and moves inside, shaking.  He 
           strips off all his clothes, pulls the blanket off the bed and 
           wraps it around himself.

           He curls up on the floor, freezing, trying to get warm.

           INT. BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           The apartment is now completely setup and lived in.  David 
           sits at his computer working on a poster for a concert at a 
           local club.  He’s got music playing, helping him work.

           We hear the front door open and close.  Claire hurries past, 
           headed to the bathroom.
                                 DAVID
                        Hey.

           We hear the bathroom door shut.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Baby?

           The shower turns on.  David rises and moves for the door.

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David stands outside the bathroom door.  He taps.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire?
                             (beat)
                        Claire.  Can I come in?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’ll be out soon.

                                 DAVID
                        What’s wrong?

           David tests the knob.  It’s locked.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Claire?  Are you okay?

           He puts his ear to the door.  He hears something that sounds 
           like sobbing.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?  Claire, answer 
                        me.
                             (beat)
                        Claire!

           Nothing.  He tests the knob again.  Locked.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Open the door.  Claire, open the 
                        door.

           He’s shifts around, anxious then slams his shoulder into the 
           door.  There’s a crack.  He does it again and nearly gets 
           through.  He rears back one more time and slams all his 
           weight into the door -- 
           INT. BUNGALOW - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David stumbles into the bathroom and sees Claire curled up on 
           the floor of the shower, naked.  She has a massive contusion 
           along her ribs.  A faint stream of blood winds toward the 
           drain.  David rushes into the shower, taking her in his arms.  

                                 DAVID
                        Claire, baby, what happened?

           She looks up.  She’s got a fat lip, blood in her mouth.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I got mugged.  I was stupid.  I 
                        tried to stop them.

                                 DAVID
                             (through tears)
                        Jesus.

           She wraps her arms around him.  They sit on the floor of the 
           shower, embracing each other. 

           INT. YACHT - NIGHT

           David is asleep, his arms wrapped around the duffel bag.  A 
           flashlight finds him and he startles awake.

           There’s a marina security guard standing over him.  He looks 
           up at him, shaking, helpless and puts up his hands.

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           David sits in a chair being addressed by a police officer.  
           He stares out from under his brow, spent emotionally and 
           physically.  He looks like hell.  

           The sounds drops out as David watches the officer’s mouth 
           moving but paying little attention to what is being said.

           The officer drones on, clearly annoyed and completely 
           disinterested in David.  He’s just a nuisance, the latest 
           nuisance at the end of a long night. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           David is let out, into the lobby of the police station.  He 
           stands there, lost, unsure what to do with himself.  He moves 
           to a row of seats and sits down, dropping his head in his 
           hands.
           He sits up, wiping tears from his eyes.  An older woman 
           crosses in front of him, moving to the far end of the lobby.  
           David glances her way, watches as she moves to the bulletin 
           board, clearing away some of the clutter of missing persons 
           fliers and putting up a new one.  

           David rises and moves to the board slowly, scanning it.  He 
           focuses in on a flier, partially obscured by another, just a 
           sliver of a face.  He reaches out, pushing the other papers 
           aside, revealing CLAIRE’S FACE on a missing persons report.  
           She’s younger but it’s clearly her.  She’s smiling, happy.

           David tears the flier off the bulletin board.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           David stands across the street, watching the building.  After 
           a few moments he crosses over, heading for the front door.  
           Before going inside he moves over to a postal box and drops 
           in an envelope.  

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

           David makes his way down the hall and knocks on an apartment 
           door.  The door opens revealing, CHARLIE.  He’s about David’s 
           age.  He looks a bit disheveled, wearing sweats, a t-shirt 
           and slippers. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey.

                                 DAVID
                        Hi, my name’s David Leight.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay.

                                 DAVID
                        I wonder if I could talk to you for 
                        a minute.  About Dana?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        What do you know about Dana?

                                 DAVID
                        I saw the missing person flier at 
                        the police station.  
                             (beat)
                        I know a lot about her.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Come in.
           Charlie opens the door further, inviting David in.

           INT. CHARLIE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           David moves inside, taking in his surroundings.  The place is 
           a mess.  This guy has given up on any semblance of a normal 
           life.  There are photos of Claire everywhere, stacks of 
           research, dead ends, this guy has dedicated his life to 
           finding her.

           Charlie grabs a pile of junk off of a chair, moving it aside.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Have a seat.

           David does.  Charlie pulls his desk chair away from his 
           computer set up which is clearly where he spends most of his 
           time.  David notices on the screen there is a web-site up, 
           not unlike the one he created for Claire but this one is for 
           Dana.  Charlie sits, looking at David expectantly.

                                 DAVID
                        Dana was your... girlfriend?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah.

                                 DAVID
                        And she disappeared five years ago.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Vanished.  

                                 DAVID
                        You guys were happy?

           Charlie searches for an answer to that, clearly it’s pretty 
           complicated.

           David reaches into his pocket and pulls out his picture of 
           Claire.  It has been roughed up by his activities over the 
           past few days.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I met her about five years ago.

           Charlie takes it, his hand trembling slightly.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where?

                                 DAVID
                        Los Angeles.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Is she --

                                 DAVID
                        She left a little over a year ago.  
                        Disappeared.  Like for you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Were you two...?

                                 DAVID
                        We were friends.  But I’ve been 
                        looking for her, looking into her 
                        past since then.  Which brought me 
                        to you.

           Charlie covers his mouth, he’s got tears in his eyes. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to let you know that I 
                        found her and... she’s gone.  
                             (this is hard)
                        She was in a car accident.  A year 
                        ago.

           Charlie leans back in his chair, staring off, as tears spill 
           down his cheeks.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  But I wanted to let you 
                        know that you could stop looking.  

           Charlie doubles over, crying pretty hard.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m sorry, it’s just -- this has 
                        been five years.  

                                 DAVID
                        I understand.  But I thought you’d 
                        want to know.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did she talk about me?  Did she say 
                        why she left?

                                 DAVID
                        She didn’t let me in that far.  She 
                        didn’t tell me the truth about her 
                        past.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I was an asshole.  I was such an 
                        asshole.  I didn’t think she’d go.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                        How could I have known?  I was 
                        just... I didn’t realize.  I didn’t 
                        know how much I loved her.  And she 
                        hated me.

                                 DAVID
                        No.  She didn’t.  I promise you.  
                        She didn’t hate you.  I think she 
                        was probably in a situation she 
                        didn’t know how to... resolve and 
                        decided to make a clean break.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who does that?

                                 DAVID
                             (shrugs)
                        Dana, I guess.  I’m certain that 
                        she loved you though.  I believe 
                        that deep, deep down.  You can’t 
                        fake that shit.

           Charlie, regaining his composure, considers David and his 
           curious passion on the subject of Dana’s feelings -- 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        That’s just what I think.

           INT. CHARLIE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           David is going to the door, about to leave.  

                                 DAVID
                        You mind if I use your bathroom?

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s down the hall, second door on 
                        the left.

           David heads down the hall.  As he does, he does a double 
           take, noticing some framed photographs on the wall.  He 
           stops, examining them.  Charlie notices.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Dana took those.

           David looks at them.  Landscapes, candid photos of them on 
           various trips.  David comes to one taken in Los Angeles, 
           ostensibly of the Capitol Records building but David focuses 
           in on the corner of the photograph, on a pedestrian walking 
           down the street, unaware of the camera or the photographer.  
           He’s looking at HIMSELF.  He steps back from it, composing 
           himself.  
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        You all right?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, yeah I’m fine.

           He looks away.  He turns to go into the bathroom and comes 
           face to face with a large photo of Charlie, Claire and BUCK.  
           Arm in arm.  All smiles.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah.

                                 DAVID
                        This guy here...

           Charlie comes down the hall, looks at the photo.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Kyle.  Dana’s friend from home.

                                 DAVID
                        You guys keep in touch?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Not really after she left, we 
                        talked a few times but you know.

                                 DAVID
                        Have you got a number for him?  I’d 
                        like to reach out to him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, I think I do in my phone.  
                        I’ll write it down for you.

                                 DAVID
                        Thanks.

           Off David, staring at Buck’s smiling face --

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           David stands at a pay-phone, the receiver pressed to his ear.  
           It rings and rings and rings.  Finally we hear Buck’s voice --
                                 BUCK
                        Hey, this is Kyle, I’m out doing 
                        what I’m doing but leave me a 
                        message and I’ll hit you back.  
                        Peace!

           Beeep.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey, Kyle or Buck or whatever the 
                        fuck your name is, this is David 
                        Leight.  Yeah, I got your phone 
                        number, Fuckshit.  Listen, that 
                        thing you were looking for at my 
                        place, well guess what?  I got it.  
                        If you want it, meet me on the 
                        Southwest corner of Franklin and 
                        Gower, the morning of the 6th at 
                        3am.  Okay?  Come alone.  And 
                        bring, I don’t know, a million 
                        dollars with you.  If not, the 
                        pictures are going everywhere and I 
                        have a feeling that means you end 
                        up in a ditch someplace, am I 
                        right?  See you Friday.

           He hangs up the phone and walks off.

           INT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           A train begins drifting down the tracks, pulling out of the 
           station.  David trots after it, grabbing a handle and hopping 
           on board.

           EXT. UNION STATION - MORNING

           David walks out of the train station and hails a cab.  

           EXT. ARMY SURPLUS STORE - DAY

           David gets out of the cab and heads inside.  

           INT. ARMY SURPLUS STORE - CONTINUOUS

           David walks in and scans the shelves.  We see quick cuts of 
           him getting supplies.  Night vision monocular.  Stun gun.  
           Camo paint.  Black sweatshirt.  Black jeans.  Ski mask.
           INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY

           David walks the tight aisles of this tiny store, packed to 
           the ceiling with hardware.  He grabs some zip ties and some 
           black spray paint.

           EXT. RENT-A-WRECK - DAY

           David is in the lot, picking out a car with the manager of 
           the joint.  

           He pays the manager twenty dollars in cash.

           He gets in a maroon 1981 Lincoln Town Car that is beat to 
           shit.

           EXT. INTERSECTION OF FRANKLIN AND GOWER - DAY

           We pull off the street sign to find the maroon Town Car 
           driving past.  We follow it up the street a block where David 
           parks it. 

           INT. TOWN CAR - LATER

           The front seats are folded all the way forward, creating more 
           room in back where David is wearing a painter’s respirator 
           mask, spray-painting the windows black, covering every inch.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           A series of quick cuts:

           David enters, throws his stuff on the bed. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           David, out of the shower, pulls on the black jeans and the 
           black sweatshirt.

           He spreads black face-paint around his eyes.

           He tears open the packaging of a pre-paid cell phone.  

           David grabs the desk chair and drags it over to the window.  
           He sits, looking down at the street below, scanning it, 
           observing.
           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           David is sitting alone on the couch watching TV.  He glances 
           at his watch.  It’s 1:45 a.m.  Claire comes in through the 
           front door, drops her keys.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hey.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey.

           She moves into the bedroom.  He turns off the television and 
           follows her in.

           INT. BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She’s undressing.  He starts to also.

                                 DAVID
                        I tried calling the darkroom.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I had headphones on.

                                 DAVID
                        How was it?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Fine.

                                 DAVID
                        You bring anything back?

                                 CLAIRE
                        No.  There wasn’t anything worth 
                        saving.

                                 DAVID
                        Is something wrong?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m just tired.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s the end of it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m tired, David, you want to have 
                        a whole conversation about that?  

                                 DAVID
                        I haven’t seen you all day.
                                 CLAIRE
                        I was working.

                                 DAVID
                        I know.  But you’ve been working 
                        every night for three weeks.  I 
                        haven’t seen you.  I’m sorry if I 
                        want to have a conversation with 
                        you when I do.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And I’m sorry if I want to sleep 
                        when I’m tired.

           A beat.  David takes a deep breath, calmly --

                                 DAVID
                        You’re being a bitch right now.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What?  Fuck you.

                                 DAVID
                        Does this have to do with what 
                        happened?

                                 CLAIRE
                        What are you talking about, does 
                        what have to do with it?

                                 DAVID
                        The fact you won’t fucking speak to 
                        me.  That you’re a million miles 
                        away and I can’t bring you back.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Don’t be a fuckin’ drama queen, I’m 
                        right here.

                                 DAVID
                        Then why do I feel like as close as 
                        I get to you, I’m never --

                                 CLAIRE
                             (cutting him off)
                        I don’t know.  Maybe I’m broken 
                        that way.  Maybe it’s impossible.

                                 DAVID
                        It sure fucking seems that way.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Great.  We’ve figured it out.  Now 
                        can we sleep?
           David shakes his head, grabs a blanket and walks out of the 
           room.  

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.  Goodnight.

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David wraps himself in the blanket and lies down on the 
           couch.  He stares out across the room, pissed, hurt.  

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           David turns out the lights and sits by the window with his 
           night-vision monocular.  He glances at the clock.  It’s two 
           a.m.

           He watches the street.  We see it through his night vision 
           POV.

           A man walks down the street, glancing around, surreptitiously 
           checking things out.  He makes a call on his cell phone as he 
           moves to the bus stop bench and takes a seat.  

           Moments later a black SUV parks on the street a half block 
           away.  No one gets out.  We can make out figures inside.  

                                 DAVID
                        Shit.

           David gets out his cell phone and makes a call.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Hello.  This is David Leight.  If 
                        you want to know where Simone is, 
                        she’s in a black SUV parked on the 
                        south side of Franklin, a half 
                        block east of Gower.  She’s all 
                        yours.

           He hangs up and watches.  

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER

           We come off the clock which tells us it is three a.m.  David 
           still sits by the window.  He spots someone coming down the 
           street.  It’s Buck.  He looks different.  He’s clean shaven 
           and he wears expensive clothes.  He has a briefcase in hand.  
           He walks to the corner and checks his watch.
           David gets up from his seat, grabs his bag and heads out the 
           door.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           We watch a distant street corner where suddenly two black 
           Cadillacs screech around the corner, flying down the street.  
           They converge on the black SUV.  

           Buck looks around, watching this with concern.

           Aleksander gets out of the Cadillac with some of his men, 
           their guns drawn.

                                 ALEKSANDER
                        Out of the fucking car!

           Their hood lights up with machine gun fire from the SUV, they 
           duck down behind their car, firing back.

           Another two SUVS emerge from neighboring streets and converge 
           on the melee.  Agents pouring out of each of them, a massive 
           gun fight erupting.

           Buck watches all of this, concerned.

                                 BUCK
                        Fuck me.

           His phone vibrates.  He glances at the text.  It reads: THROW 
           YOUR PHONE IN THE GUTTER THEN WALK UP GOWER.  THERE IS A CAR 
           PARKED WITH THE DOOR OPEN.  GET IN.

           Buck looks around then, reluctantly, tosses his phone down 
           and starts heading up the street.

           We follow him as he makes his way up the unlit sidewalk.  He 
           tries searching the shadows for someone but it’s impossible 
           to see.

           He spots the beat up town car up ahead, it’s rear passenger-
           side door is open.  The windows are blacked out.  He can’t 
           see inside.  He walks up to it carefully, looking around.  He 
           steps up to the open door.

           In the darkness behind him we spot David, dressed head to toe 
           in black, lurking in the shadows.  With the ski mask and 
           black hood, he’s virtually invisible.

           Buck bends down, looks in the open door and David charges out 
           of the darkness, slamming Buck in the back, tackling him into 
           the car.  He jabs him with the stun gun repeatedly, sending 
           him into convulsions.   
           David pulls the door shut, zip ties his hands and flips him 
           over.  He pulls the gun from Buck’s waistband and presses it 
           to his forehead.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey there, Buddy.

                                 BUCK
                        Look at you.

           David slams the handle of the gun into Buck’s forehead.  He 
           yells, blood spills from the wound.  David again trains the 
           gun on his face.

                                 DAVID
                        I want to be left alone.  I have 
                        what you’re looking for but you’ll 
                        never find it.  If I die, everyone 
                        finds it.  Understood?

           David shoves the barrel of the gun down Buck’s throat.  He 
           gags.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I just want to live my life.  I’ll 
                        go away.  You’ll never hear from me 
                        again.  Okay?

           David pulls out the gun, Buck coughs violently.

                                 BUCK
                        That’s not how this works.

                                 DAVID
                        How does it work.

                                 BUCK
                        You’re just a scared guy who threw 
                        me into the back of a blacked out 
                        town car.  We’re something else.  
                        We’re a different category of 
                        person.  You want to keep those 
                        pictures as an insurance policy but 
                        people like I work for can’t live 
                        with that in the world.  We’ll hunt 
                        you down.  We’ll kill you.  It’s 
                        only a matter of time.

                                 DAVID
                        If you kill me they get out.

                                 BUCK
                        To who, David?  You haven’t thought 
                        this through.  The New York Times?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BUCK (CONT'D)
                        They won’t know what the fuck they 
                        are.  Sarah was a threat.  You?  
                        You’re an obstacle.  An 
                        inconvenience.  

           David’s confidence wavers.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        You’re dead.  You’re not even 
                        alive, man.  There’s a bullet 
                        coming your way right now.  It’s 
                        cutting through the world and it 
                        can only end up one place.  You 
                        can’t outrun it, David, it’s 
                        hungry.

           David shakes his head.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ll find a way.  You underestimate 
                        me.  You have every step of the 
                        way.

                                 BUCK
                        Not this time, man.  Look.

           Buck reaches up to his ear and pulls out what looks like a 
           hearing aid.  It’s a bluetooth device.  David’s heart drops.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                             (smiles)
                        You’re just a scared guy in the 
                        back of a blacked out town car.  

           Buck covers his head.  David drops down just as gunfire tears 
           through all the windows.  The doors are ripped open as a swat-
           looking black ops team floods in every door, grabs David and 
           rips him out of the car.  

           He’s dragged into the street screaming until an agent slams 
           the butt of his gun into David’s face and everything goes 
           black.

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - MORNING - FLASHBACK

           David is asleep on the couch, wrapped in the blanket.  
           Exactly where we left him after his fight with Claire.  His 
           eyes struggle open, he squints into the light.  After a beat 
           he looks down at the floor beside him.  

           Claire is sleeping on the ground right beside him, wrapped in 
           a blanket.  She bubbles awake, looks at him.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Are you mad?

                                 DAVID
                        C’mere.

           He scooches over and Claire squeezes onto the couch with him.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m sorry.
                             (beat)
                        Have I really been a million miles 
                        away?

                                 DAVID
                        Maybe even more.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I got lost.  It happens every now 
                        and then.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You can’t just leave me out there 
                        though.  You have to bring me back. 

           She whispers something into his ear.  He looks her in the 
           eye.

                                 DAVID
                        I always will.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        You promise?

                                 DAVID
                        No matter what.  

           She nuzzles into him closer.

           INT. GREY ROOM - NIGHT

           David sucks in air, gasping awake.  

           He looks like hell.  His nose is broken.  He has a nasty gash 
           across the bridge which has been cleaned and bandaged.  
           Remnants of the black camo paint streams down his face.  He 
           closes his eyes, trying to fight off the throbbing pain.

           He is bound to a metal chair which is bolted to the floor.  
           It is the only thing in this grey room.
           Across from him there is a metal door.  On either side of the 
           door there is a long, wide window.  The windows are thick, 
           dense, impenetrable.  They completely block out the sound on 
           the other side.  Beyond them is a boring white hallway with 
           other doors.  A tad dingy.  Every now and then a person walks 
           by.  Some in suits, others in street clothes.  The place 
           looks busy and efficiently run... whatever it is.

           After a beat a man in a suit crosses by the window.  A moment 
           later the door opens.  It is several inches thick, like the 
           door of an enormous safe.  The man enters, closing the door 
           behind him. 

           As he approaches David and comes into focus we see it is 
           Agent Breyer.

                                 BREYER
                        David.  We meet again.

                                 DAVID
                        Agent Breyer.

                                 BREYER
                        Where’s the film.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not going to tell you.

                                 BREYER
                        Okay, I thought you’d say that.  
                        I’m gonna send some people in here.  
                        It’s their job to get information 
                        from reluctant sources.  Usually 
                        they’re working with trained 
                        operatives who have been prepared 
                        for such treatment and who believe 
                        that if they give up the 
                        information it will cost many of 
                        their countrymen their lives, not 
                        to mention compromise their place 
                        in the afterlife.  You, on the 
                        other hand, are protecting the 
                        whereabouts of a roll of film, the 
                        significance of which you do not 
                        understand, for a dead girl who 
                        lied to you, used you and made a 
                        fool of you.  
                             (beat)
                        Anyway, I’m gonna walk out, they’re 
                        gonna come in and I promise you two 
                        minutes later they will leave with 
                        what they came for.  Or you could 
                        tell me now and spare yourself 
                        the... discomfort. 
           David won’t meet his eye.

                                 BREYER (CONT’D)
                        All right.  You’re very brave, 
                        David.  Truly.  I admire it.

           With that he turns and heads for the door.  He punches in a 
           code, it opens.  He walks out and closes it behind him. 

           David sees Breyer talking to two very plain men outside.  One 
           of them has a push cart with some tools on it.  The men nod, 
           understanding.  Breyer walks away, heading down the hallway, 
           out of view.

           David stares at the door, waiting.  Any second now his 
           torturers will enter.  He swallows deeply, terrified.  The 
           door stares back at him, somehow menacing in its complete 
           lifelessness.

           There’s activity in the hallways beyond the windows, a sudden 
           stirring.

           Then --

           A MASSIVE EXPLOSION sends a door flying down the hallway 
           beyond.  The shockwave shakes the dense windows.  There’s 
           smoke and debris everywhere.   

           David watches all this from the safety of the grey room.  

           Everyone pulls guns, a few black ops agents pour into the 
           hallway firing at something beyond David’s field of view 
           through the window.  

           Then everything slows down as, out of the smoke, a figure 
           emerges, firing a gun.  This person is dressed in all black, 
           like the agents.  The figure picks people off with 
           frightening efficiency.  

           The ammo runs out and the figure swings the rifle like a bat, 
           taking out another agent.  The figure moves through the 
           crowd, taking people out in hand to hand combat, breaking 
           arms, legs, necks.  Two agents bear down on the figure who 
           deftly sweeps the legs out from one, using his gun to fire on 
           the other.  It’s like a horrific, ugly ballet and the figure 
           at its center can only be described as a killing machine.

           The figure makes its way through the hallway taking out all 
           the agents, beating impossible odds, destroying everyone in a 
           sloppy, chaotic fashion.  The final agent goes down and the 
           figure stands there, panting, it’s done.

           After a beat the figure disappears from sight, behind the 
           door.   
           David cranes his head to see.

           The keypad inside the room explodes inward.  David flinches, 
           looking away.  The door swings open and the figure enters, 
           cutting through a cloud of smoke, pulling off the mask.

           It’s CLAIRE.  She extends her hand to David.

                                 CLAIRE
                        We have to go.

           David reaches out and takes her hand...

           And they’re off.  They run from the room, Claire leading the 
           way.  An agent comes into the hallway, Claire drops, grabs 
           the sidearm of one of the downed agents and pops off two 
           shots, taking out the agents knees. 

           They’re back up and Claire leads them to a door which she 
           kicks open.

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           They enter the stairwell and Claire shoots an agent coming 
           down.  She grabs his rifle and starts reloading it as she 
           starts climbing the stairs, she can’t meet David’s eye.

                                 DAVID
                        Claire, wait!

                                 CLAIRE
                        What the hell happened to you?  Why 
                        did they pick you up?

                                 DAVID
                        I found this roll of film, they 
                        know I have it --

                                 CLAIRE
                        You have it?  I need that film.  
                        Where is it?

                                 DAVID
                        Why?  What is it?

                                 CLAIRE
                        It’s proof.  That Breyer was 
                        working with some bad people.

                                 DAVID
                        At the chop shop.  The guy you 
                        shot.  Whose brother you killed.
           As strong as she is we can see that she never wanted David to 
           know any of this.  She’s ashamed of it all.

                                 CLAIRE
                        How do you know about that?

                                 DAVID
                        Why did you shoot him?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Because when he walked in the room 
                        I had a knife in his brother’s 
                        neck.  That whole fucking family is 
                        psychotic.  Child-raping, drug-
                        dealing, human traffickers.  If I 
                        could I would’ve killed every one 
                        of them.
                             (beat)
                        The job should have gone fine but 
                        someone tipped them.  I didn’t know 
                        who until I took those pictures.  
                        Breyer was taking money for their 
                        protection.  He sold me out.  I 
                        tried to walk away, those photos 
                        were my only protection.  I didn’t 
                        think they’d come after you.  I’m 
                        sorry.  

                                 DAVID
                        Claire --

                                 CLAIRE
                        Listen, I did a lot of different 
                        things for these people and some 
                        times that meant doing things that 
                        you would find unacceptable but I 
                        didn’t ever kill anybody that 
                        didn’t need killing.  I know you 
                        have a lot of questions, but we 
                        don’t have any time.  We need to 
                        get out of here or they’re going to 
                        murder us.
                             (beat)
                        Okay?

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.

           They reach a door.  She hands the pistol to David.

                                 CLAIRE
                        You know how to use this?
                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, sure.

           He takes it.  Claire kicks open the door.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           They burst into the hallway, Claire starts firing at oncoming 
           agents.  She points to a doorway behind them, at the end of 
           the hallway.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        There!

           They begin heading that way, firing behind them.  David 
           tumbles to the ground, gets himself up and keeps running. 
           David reaches the door and opens it, stumbling into --

           INT. STOREROOM - CONTINUOUS

           It looks like any small storeroom, it’s filled with cleaning 
           supplies, a small desk, a ratty couch.  David stops, confused 
           by his surroundings.

           Claire runs through, grabbing him and pulling him toward a 
           door on the other side.  They burst through into --

           INT. GLOWING SUN DRY CLEANERS - CONTINUOUS

           They are in the back of the dry cleaners.  It’s dark, 
           shuttered for the night.  Claire leads them to the front --

                                 DAVID
                        Claire wait!

                                 CLAIRE
                        There’s no time.

           She unlocks the door and they spill out onto the street --

           EXT. GLOWING SUN DRY CLEANERS - CONTINUOUS

           Claire looks around, gun at her side.  A suburban screeches 
           around the corner.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        Shit.
           She raises the rifle, fires three shots and the suburban’s 
           tires explode, it swerves and barrel rolls, smashing into 
           parked cars on the street --

           Claire heads to a parked motorcycle, hops on and makes quick 
           work of the ignition.  She starts it up and looks to David --

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Come on.

           She looks in her side view mirror as three more suburbans 
           round the corner, speeding towards them.  David is just 
           standing there in shock --

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Come on!

           David climbs on the back of the motorcycle and they peel out, 
           tires smoking.  They squeal around the corner, rocketing down 
           the street, they cut down an alley and have lost the tails 
           already --

           They speed through the night, David clutching to Claire for 
           dear life.  The speed is incredible.  The streets are empty.  
           It’s peaceful, beautiful.

           They speed onto the 101 Freeway, cutting through what little 
           traffic there is.  The pre-dawn horizon of Los Angeles 
           twinkles in the background.

           David reaches back and touches his lower back.  He pulls back 
           his hand, looking down at it.  It’s covered in blood.  He 
           holds onto Claire tighter as they rocket down the freeway.

           EXT. BUNGALOW - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

           The motorcycle speeds down the alleyway and comes to a stop.  
           Claire gets off and heads for the back gate.  David follows.

           EXT. BUNGALOW - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Claire hurries across to the back door, picks the lock and 
           enters.  David is not far behind her.

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Claire makes her way through the apartment.  It is completely 
           empty.  They’ve gotten rid of David’s things and are, from 
           the look of it, mid-way through fixing it up.  They’ve 
           patched the holes in the walls, done some repainting.
           David shuffles in behind Claire.  He looks a little pale, 
           weak.  He glances around at their apartment.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Where is it, David?  

           He just looks at her.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        The roll of film, David, where is 
                        it?

                                 DAVID
                        It should be in the mail.

           Claire hurries to the mailbox, opens it and sorts through the 
           junk, finding the envelope.  She tears it open, pulls out the 
           negatives and stuffs them into her coat.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Let’s go.  

                                 DAVID
                        Claire, wait.

                                 CLAIRE
                        David.

                                 DAVID
                        I haven’t seen you...

                                 CLAIRE
                        Are you hurt?  David?

           He holds out his hand.  She goes to him as he lowers himself 
           to one knee.  

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Where?  David?

           She touches his back, finds the wound.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Shit.  I’m going to put pressure on 
                        it, you’re going to be fine, okay?

                                 DAVID
                        Claire.  Who are you.

           Everything slows down.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m a lot of different people.
                                 DAVID
                        I looked for you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I know you did.

                                 DAVID
                        Why did you go away?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I had to.

                                 DAVID
                        Why didn’t you take me with you?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I didn’t think you’d understand.  I 
                        didn’t think you’d love me if you 
                        knew the truth.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ll always love you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I see that now.

                                 DAVID
                        I came for you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I know, I know.

                                 DAVID
                        Did you love me?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah.

                                 DAVID
                        Did you?

           She nods.  She unzips her jacket and reaches into the inside 
           pocket, pulling something out.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I took this with me.

           She shows it to him.  It is the note he wrote her and put in 
           her lunch years ago.  He takes it. 

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take you with me, David, but 
                        we can’t ever come back.
           David nods, that’s okay.  We hear the sound of tires 
           screeching out front.  Claire kills the lights and runs to 
           the front window.  Out front she sees Aleksander and his 
           thugs approaching with guns drawn.

           She runs to the back door and sees agents pouring in the back 
           gate.

           She hurries back to David.  

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Bad news, baby.  We’re surrounded.

                                 DAVID
                        What do we do now?

                                 CLAIRE
                        We fight, okay?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.

           Claire goes to the fireplace and lies down on her back.  She 
           kicks up at the bricked in chimney with her boot heel.  After 
           a few kicks it begins to crumble apart.  She pulls out the 
           remaining bricks, reaches up into the chimney and pulls down 
           a duffel bag, throwing it out into the middle of the room

           She unzips it and it’s full of guns, grenades, ammo, 
           everything.  She loads an automatic rifle and hands it to 
           David.  She takes one for herself.

           She moves to the window when gun fire tears through from the 
           outside.  She drops down.  She gets on one knee and returns 
           fire, driving them back.  

           She moves over to where David is lying down, staying low.  
           Another spray of bullets tears through the room and she drops 
           down next to him.

           They stare up at the ceiling, catching their breath.  
           Claire’s eyes narrow.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Look at that.

           Reverse on the ceiling to see that the faint remnants of 
           their marker exchange can be seen in this light.  

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t realize you could still 
                        see it.
                                 DAVID
                        Me neither. 

           They smile.  David looks to Claire.  

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Where are we going to go?

           On Claire, her face is bathed in sunlight and we realize we 
           are --

           INT. BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Claire and David are lying in the exact same positions on the 
           floor, looking at each other, smiling.  Warm sunlight pours 
           in the windows, blanketing them both.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        Anywhere you want.

                                 DAVID
                        I want to go some place amazing and 
                        exciting and fun.  Where it’s warm 
                        and the water’s warm and you feel 
                        good all the time.

                                 CLAIRE
                        And there’s like just lightly 
                        flavored refreshing drinks. 

                                 DAVID
                        Exactly.

                                 CLAIRE
                        When do we go?

                                 DAVID
                        Let’s go right now.

           WE CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT -- On Claire, moonlit --

                                 CLAIRE
                        Pick your poison.  Breyer’s men out 
                        back.  Aleksander and his guys out 
                        front. 

                                 DAVID
                        What do you think our best chances 
                        are?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I think they’re pretty lousy either 
                        way.
                                 DAVID
                        You choose.

           SUNLIT FLASHBACK --

                                 CLAIRE
                        You.

                                 DAVID
                        South America?

           Claire reaches over and kisses him.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Are we really going to do this?

                                 DAVID
                        We have to. 

           BACK TO THE PRESENT --

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay.

           She grabs his hand, squeezes it.  They crawl over to the 
           window, they’re leaning against the wall beneath it.  

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Ready?  On three.  

                                 DAVID
                             (wait)
                        Hey baby?  I love you.  Let’s live.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (smiles)
                        Yeah.

           David reaches over, takes her head in his hands and kisses 
           her one last time.  

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.

           A deep breath, “ready?” --

                      DAVID (CONT’D)
           One.  Two.  Three.
                                                         CLAIRE
                                              One.  Two.  Three.
           EXT. BUNGALOW - DAY - FLASHBACK

           David and Claire head out the front door, bags in hand, 
           happily hurrying off on their adventure.

           As they make their way down the street, on their way to 
           paradise.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
