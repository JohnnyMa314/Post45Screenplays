                                This is a true story.

                 During the late 19th century, a group of 
                 industrialists known as the "Robber Barons" amassed 
                 the largest fortunes in human history.  The most 
                 powerful among them was Cornelius Vanderbilt, who 
                 built the railroads.  

                 In this era, which Mark Twain dubbed "The Gilded 
                 Age", the majority of Americans were cast into 
                 devastating poverty.  Nowhere was the divide between 
                 the ultra-rich and the poor as extreme as New York.  
                 From top to bottom, it was a thieves’ paradise.

           INT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - DAY

           Morning light streams into a large Romanesque atrium that 
           feels like a cathedral.  The camera glides across the floor 
           toward a giant open steel door.  We press inside the vault, 
           which is littered with bonds that appear to have been churned 
           out by a violent twister.      

           Passing over the money, we see a bullet-hole in one of the 
           notes, then drops of blood.  Finally, a long smear of dried 
           blood streaking toward the wall.

           SUPER:  NEW YORK - 1878

           THOMAS “THIRD DEGREE” BYRNES (mid-30s, built like a 
           locomotive) moves toward a podium on the steps of NYPD 
           headquarters, where a throng of REPORTERS awaits him.  Though 
           this is the biggest day of his professional life, there is 
           something joyless about the occasion.  He hesitates, 
           uncertain where, or how, to begin.    

                                 BYRNES
                        The New York City Police Department 
                        has identified the man responsible 
                        for the largest heist in U.S. 
                        history.

                                 REPORTER
                        Inspector Byrnes, did he rob more 
                        than Jesse James?

                                 BYRNES
                        For the last ten years, he was 
                        responsible for 80% of all bank 
                        robberies.

                                 REPORTER
                        In the city or the state?!

           Byrnes pauses, still in shock himself.
                                 BYRNES
                        In the entire country.

           The news sends a shock-wave through the crowd.  Over the 
           CLANKING of chains...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

           SUPER: OHIO - TEN YEARS EARLIER

           A CHAIN GANG twelve deep hauls a back-breaking section of 
           train rail on their shoulders in a forced march across a 
           bridge under construction.  The men sweat and grunt in the 
           mid-day sun, straining to keep upright.

           At the front of the line is GEORGE LESLIE - silent, but with 
           a deep anger lurking beneath the surface.  The youthful 
           glimmer has long since left his eyes, replaced by something 
           dark and urgent and chaotic.  He wears a filthy, tattered 
           prison uniform, his skin weathered from hard days in the sun 
           and brutal beatings.  Behind him...

                                 WHITE CONVICT
                        I fought in the Civil War and now 
                        I'm the slave.  Someone explain 
                        that to me.

                                 BLACK CONVICT
                        Carnegie sells the steel,  
                        Rockefeller supplies the oil, and 
                        Vanderbilt runs the trains.  Only 
                        ones not making a buck is us.

           The men drop the rail and begin hammering it into place as a 
           GUARD smashes a convict to the ground with his rifle.

                                 GUARD
                        You the son of a bitch that stole 
                        my watch?!

           At the front of the chain, George squats by the edge of the 
           bridge.  In the distance, a train WHISTLE sounds.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           The wheels of a train THUNDERING along the tracks.

                                                              BACK TO: 
           The black convict behind George watches curiously as George 
           withdraws the stolen watch, then drops a stone off the side 
           of the bridge...measuring the ticks of the second hand as the 
           pebble cascades to a train track that crosses beneath.

                                 BLACK CONVICT
                        You checkin’ the time?

                                 GEORGE
                        Not time.  Distance.

                                 BLACK CONVICT
                        Gotta be 30 feet.

                                 GEORGE

                                 GUARD
                        No talking!

           George rises to his feet and brazenly raises the watch for 
           the guard to see.

                                 GEORGE
                        You lookin’ for this?

           The guard swings up his rifle at George, who dangles the 
           watch over the edge of the bridge.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           The train driving forward...

                                                               BACK TO:

           The guard peers down his sights.  He hesitates, knowing he’ll 
           lose the watch.  The TRAIN WHISTLE blares, closing fast...

           The prisoners stop their work, all eyes on the dead man 
           walking as the train rumbles closer on the tracks below.  

           As George inches his toes to the edge of the bridge, the 
           guards look at him - no way.  

                                 BLACK CONVICT
                        Fall would kill you.

           The black convict nervously eyes the chain connecting him to 
           George.  

           George looks down to see the train roaring past and...JUMPS.  
           The 10 feet of slack chain snaps taut, slowing George’s fall 
           as the black convict is dragged clawing and scratching into 
           the abyss.  One by one, the convicts fall like dominos.

           George crashes onto the top of the train, dragging a daisy 
           chain of prisoners with him, smashing onto the roof.

           George scrambles along the top of the train as the bullets 
           from the guards PING around him.  He slips down between two 
           of the cars and dangles upside down, hooking a section of the 
           chain attached to his leg onto the underside of the car.  

           George gives the chain a tug to make sure it’s secure, then 
           jumps off the moving train.  As George hits the ground, the 
           chain connecting him to the train slips under the wheels and 
           severs, releasing George as he tumbles on the embankment.

           Without a moment of hesitation, George bolts into the dense 
           woods, branches whipping and clawing at him as he sprints 
           deeper and deeper.  Running for his life.  Never looking 
           back...ROLL TITLES.

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY

           SUPER:  NEW YORK

           Thomas Byrnes eats a sandwich at the counter in his clean-
           pressed police uniform.  He is young and unbroken.  His hat 
           is removed, politely sitting in front of him with the 
           formality of a soldier.  Byrnes tunes out the bustle of the 
           city as he savors his chow.  

           TWO ROUNDSMEN enter.  They approach the YOUNG WOMAN who works 
           behind the counter.  Byrnes watches with complete situational 
           awareness as they exchange quiet words. He lowers his 
           sandwich and wipes his mouth, anticipating.  One of the cops 
           suddenly seizes the woman’s arm violently. 

                                 COP #1
                        If your father doesn’t have the 
                        money, we can arrange something.

           Byrnes approaches.  The cop notices Byrnes’ badge.

                                 COP #1 (CONT’D)
                        You’re in the wrong precinct, boyo.  

           The second cop gets in Byrnes’ face.

                                 COP #2
                        Walk away.
           Without a word, Byrnes puts the toe of his boot in COP #2’s 
           shin, then smashes his face against the counter.  COP #1 
           swings at Byrnes, who dodges and strikes back, sending him 
           tumbling out into the street...

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Murder in his eyes, Byrnes grips the man’s larynx and plunges 
           his head into a muddy puddle, nearly drowning him before 
           pulling the man up, gasping.  A stunned crowd gathers.

                                 BYRNES
                        I live in this precinct, you son of 
                        a bitch!

           INT. TAILOR SHOP - DAY

           A TAILOR in a small Ohio town measures George as he makes 
           adjustments to a dark suit.  George takes note of his wrists, 
           which have deep lacerations from his bindings.  He tugs his 
           cuffs down, then looks at himself in the mirror, taking 
           measure of the man staring back at him.

                                 TAILOR
                        How will you be paying?

           George hands him the stolen watch.  The tailor inspects it.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’ll need a pair of shoes, too.

           EXT. GRAVEYARD - SUNSET

           Dressed in his suit, George places a bouquet on the ground 
           before a pair of headstones - John and Carol Leslie.  George 
           rises, eyes catching the last sliver of the setting sun.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WALLING’S OFFICE, THE TOMBS - DAY

           Hat propped stiffly under his elbow, Byrnes enters an office, 
           finding a middle-aged man filling out a report.

                                 BYRNES
                        You Inspector Walling?
           INSPECTOR WALLING (50s) takes off his spectacles.  Byrnes is 
           uncomfortable as Walling studies him.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        Thomas Byrnes - you sent for me.

                                 WALLING
                        Are you out of your mind, son?  You 
                        know what happened to those cops 
                        you rearranged?  Not a damn thing.  
                        There’s a way this precinct 
                        operates. 

           Byrnes seethes.  Walling has him right where he wants him.

                        I bet a dumb Irish ape like you 
                        grew up in the Five Points.  
                        Everyone down there is thieves and 
                        murderers.  How’d you get out of 
                        that God-forsaken sewer?  You on 
                        the take?

                        I fought in the war.

                                 WALLING
                        Drafted, huh?  So much for luck of 
                        the Irish.

                             (read ‘fuck you’)
                        I volunteered.

                                 WALLING
                        Where’d you fight?

                                 BYRNES
                        Bull Run.

           The admission of the bloody battle catches Walling off guard.

                                 WALLING
                        You lost a lot of men.

                                 BYRNES
                        It was a noble cause.

                                 WALLING
                        How badly do you want to keep your 
                        badge, son?
                                 BYRNES
                        If you’d fire me over beating a 
                        couple crooked leatherheads, it 
                        isn’t worth the tin it’s made from.  

           Walling has the confirmation he was looking for - eases off.

                                 WALLING
                        Bullshit - Scotland Yard.  NYPD is 
                        just a bunch of bruisers.  Scotland 
                        Yard...they make cases.  It’s time 
                        to bring New York into the modern 
                        age.  I’m starting a detective 
                        bureau focused on major cases.  You 
                        heard of “The Shadows”?

                                 BYRNES
                        No.  

                                 WALLING
                        That’s because we don’t exist.  If 
                        we did, those corrupt Tammany 
                        bastards in City Hall would shut us 
                        down.  I don’t need a bunch of 
                        thick-headed Irish roundsmen.  I 
                        need smart, uncompromising 
                        sonsofbitches who want to make 
                        cases.  Most of the boys fought in 
                        the war like yourself.  

           Byrnes perks up at the revelation.

                        You might even say it’s evolving if 
                        you’re a Darwin man.  We need to 
                        evolve too.  No more uniforms.  No 
                        more rules.  You make cases no 
                        matter what it takes.  Only 
                        connection you’ll have to the NYPD 
                        is this gold shield.

           Walling slides a gold badge toward Byrnes.
                                 WALLING (CONT'D)
                        Is that something that would 
                        interest you, Mr. Byrnes?

           EXT. FARM - NIGHT

           Tall, dry corn stalks occlude our view in every direction.  
           We’re running, whipping past the crumpling leaves...

           ...emerging on a farmhouse, it’s roof ablaze.  The SHRIEKING 
           of livestock can be heard from the burning barn.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY

           George wakes up from the dream to find himself slouched in a 
           seat.  He is dressed in his dark suit, armed only with an 
           architecture tube and a Jesse James dimestore novel.  He 
           looks out the window at the skyline as the train glides into 
           Manhattan, a gleaming metropolis of ten-story buildings. 

           EXT. WALL STREET - DAY

           George steps off a streetcar and makes his way toward the 
           palatial Grand Opera House.  He takes note of a delirious 
           amputee sleeping in a nook in a tattered blue overcoat.  The 
           man has a tin cup and a sign that says “Union Army Veteran.”  

           INT. OPERA HOUSE - DAY

           George passes an enormous bronze bust of Shakespeare as he 
           makes his way up a large spiral staircase with plush red 
           carpeting and gold banisters.  

           He moves down the cavernous hallways draped with luxurious 
           red curtains and gilded door frames.  Two bare-foot, half-
           naked, giggling SHOWGIRLS flit past wearing Japanese kabuki 
           masks, drunk on champagne.   

           INT. JIM FISK’S OFFICE - DAY

           George enters the opulent offices of “JUBILEE” JIM FISK, a 
           pudgy, gregarious Wall Street speculator who loves to party 
           as much as he loves making money.  

           Fisk reads the newspaper in a raised, gold-trimmed throne 
           behind a massive oak desk devoid of any paperwork.  
           In this innermost circle of garish decor, the room is adorned 
           with expensive Persian rugs, gilded mirrors, and hand-painted 
           urns with frolicking nymphs in pornographic positions.

                                 GEORGE
                        Offices in an opera house.  A bit 
                        eccentric, even for you Fisk.

           Fisk lowers his paper, lighting up at the sight of his old 
           friend.

                                 FISK
                        What can I say - I have flare for 
                        the dramatic.  Christ, George - I 
                        haven’t seen you since college.  
                        Where have you been the last 6 
                        years?!

           George blends in effortlessly in this moneyed world, a skill 
           he cultivated in college.

                                 GEORGE
                        Working in Ohio.

                                 FISK
                        And now you’ve come to New York?

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s where the money is.

                                 FISK
                        I’ll say.  Did you know that if you 
                        adjust for today’s dollars, of the 
                        10 richest people in the history of 
                        the world, 5 of them are here now?

                                 GEORGE
                        How about the poorest?  

                                 FISK
                        You can find them all down in the 
                        Five Points.  

           Fisk opens a bottle of champagne.

                                 FISK (CONT’D)
                        Without wealth there can be no 
                        Maecenas.

           George tries to mask his distaste for patrician society.

                                 FISK (CONT’D)
                        Your letter said you want to open 
                        an architecture business.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FISK (CONT’D)
                        Building garish mansions on the 
                        East Side, I imagine.    

                                 GEORGE
                        Banks.  
                             (off Fisk’s curiosity)
                        All that money’s got to go 
                        somewhere.

                                 FISK
                        I invest mine in champagne and 
                        oysters.

           George winds his way to his true purpose of the visit.

                                 GEORGE
                        Can you make some introductions for 
                        me?

           Fisk hands a glass of champagne to George.

                                 FISK
                        Anything for a friend - they’re a 
                        scarce resource in this city.

                                 GEORGE
                        I want to meet Vanderbilt.

                                 FISK
                             (surprised)
                        I’m afraid I can’t help you with 
                        the Commodore.  We had a falling 
                        out over the Erie Railway deal.  He 
                        tried to do a hostile takeover, but 
                        I watered down the stock to fend 
                        him off.  He can muscle a lot of 
                        people, but not me.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Where can I find him?

                                 FISK
                        He surveys his kingdom from an 
                        elevated gold train orbiting the 
                        city - thinks he's too good for us.  

           A voice can be heard approaching the office.

                                 JOSIE (O.S.)
                        Jimmy, darling.  What time are we 
                        going to Del’s for dinner?
           George looks up to see JOSIE MANSFIELD, the “Cleopatra of 
           23rd Street.”  A former showgirl from San Francisco, Josie 
           had infiltrated New York’s society, offering her good looks 
           and talents to the highest bidder.  Josie is a woman that can 
           be rented, but never owned.  Josie wears only a kimono which 
           dangles open, narrowly concealing her breasts.  She makes no 
           effort to cover herself.

                                 FISK
                        George Leslie, meet Josie 
                        Mansfield, the star of the show.

           Josie can sense the darkness in George’s eyes, and is both 
           drawn to it and threatened by it.  He won’t be as easily 
           dominated as the others.

                                 JOSIE
                        Pardon the interruption.  I’ll 
                        leave you two boys to your fun.  

           As Josie departs.

                                 GEORGE
                        I thought you were married.

                                 FISK
                        My wife has a permanent residence 
                        in Boston.  Besides, Josie is just 
                        an amusement.
                             (changing topic)
                        Where are you staying?

                                 GEORGE
                        I was hoping you could help me out 
                        with that.  My bags were stolen 
                        with everything I had.  I wired 
                        home for money, but until it comes 
                        I can’t even afford a place to 
                        stay.

                                 FISK
                        Stay at the 5th Avenue Hotel - 
                        anything less is uncivilized.  

           Fisk withdraws some gold troy ounces from his desk.

                                 FISK (CONT'D)
                        And watch out for pickpockets.  The 
                        streets are crawling with them.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Gold?
                                 FISK
                        I’ve got a deal going with Grant’s 
                        brother-in-law.  Price of gold has 
                        gone up 30% since he took office.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Thanks, Jim.  I’ll pay you back. 

                                 FISK
                        Spend ‘em quick, George.  In a 
                        month they’ll be worthless.
                             (off George’s confusion)
                        Welcome to Wall Street.

           EXT. TENEMENTS - DAY

           Byrnes and “The Shadows” run down a THIEF through the 
           tenements.  Identifiable only by their gold shields and dark 
           overcoats, they look more like undertakers than detectives.  
           Byrnes is a force of nature, demolishing everything in his 
           path... 

           ...smashing through doors...racing across narrow wooden 
           catwalks connecting the buildings as the thief gets tangled 
           in the laundry lines known as the ‘flags of the tenements’...

           ...the thief emerges on the street, looking back as he 
           sprints.  From nowhere, Byrnes blindsides him, tackling him 
           through a glass storefront.  

           The man pulls a knife and lunges, but Byrnes decks him in the 
           jaw - out cold.  As the other Shadows arrive, Byrnes dusts 
           the glass off his coat.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL - DAY

           The hotel room is littered with disassembled safes.

           George wears magnifying goggles at a desk as he dissects a 
           pocket-watch.  He uses a pair of tweezers to place one of the 
           gears inside a flat disk with a hole in the center as he 
           creates some type of small mechanized device.  He compares 
           his work to an engineering blueprint with a compass and 
           protractor resting on it.

           Satisfied, George places a second disk over the one he was 
           working on and clasps them together, revealing the device 
           appears to the naked eye like a Chinese coin.  We’ll come to 
           know this device as the ‘Little Joker’.
           George pries the dial off one of his safes and slides the 
           coin’s rectangular hole onto the metal shank that was holding 
           the dial.  George then replaces the dial, which fits 
           perfectly over the device.

           George rises, removing the Little Joker from behind the dial 
           and placing it in his wallet.  Leaving to play with fire... 

           As he steps in the hallway and shuts the door, he wedges a 
           match in the top of the door-frame.

           EXT. FULTON STREET - DAY

           George stands across the street from the Ocean Bank, tuning 
           out the hectic combustion of Wall Street - BUSINESSMEN, 
           STREET RATS hocking penny papers, etc. - as he studies the 
           pattern of life.  He checks the time on a clock as the GUARD 
           puts a closed sign in the bank window.

           George turns to see UNIFORMED COPS exit the 15th Precinct 
           beside him, directly across from the bank.  He is suddenly 
           approached by a beautiful 10-year-old girl, dressed in rags 
           and covered with soot. The girl, BABE, looks up at George 
           with sad blue eyes.

                                 BABE
                        Mister, you wanna buy an apple?  

           George looks down to see the girl holding a rotten apple.

                                 BABE (CONT’D)
                        Only two pennies.

           George hands her a dollar from his wallet.

                                 GEORGE
                        You can keep the apple.

           Babe clutches the dollar bill like a precious doll.  As the 
           girl departs gleefully...

           ...George looks up, spotting Vanderbilt’s red and gold train 
           car circling the elevated tracks.

           He suddenly feels a tugging at his jacket and looks down to 
           see a skinny, filthy, 15-year-old boy named JOHNNY IRVING 
           holding out the dollar bill indignantly.  Babe stands 
           guiltily at his side.  

                                 JOHNNY
                        Hey, did you give this to my 
                        sister?  Do we look like beggars to 
                        you?!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Our parents didn’t raise us to take 
                        charity.  So you can take your 
                        dollar and stick it where the sun 
                        don’t shine.

           George is taken aback by the young man’s speech as Johnny 
           tosses the bill at him and departs with Babe.

           George picks up the bill, but when he goes to return it to 
           his wallet, his wallet is gone.  George scans the crowd 
           curiously, but the little pickpockets have disappeared.  He 
           turns to leave, surprisingly unperturbed by the robbery.

           INT. JIM FISK’S OFFICE - DAY

           George enters Fisk’s office, where Fisk commands his 
           UNDERLINGS.  

                                 FISK
                        Wait until gold hits twenty, then 
                        dump it.

           Fisk sees George, sensing George’s urgency. 

                                 FISK (CONT’D)
                             (to underlings)
                        Excuse us, please.  

                                 GEORGE
                        You got connections in the police?

                                 FISK
                        What’s wrong?

                                 GEORGE
                        I need some discrete cops.  

                                 FISK
                        You in trouble?

                                 GEORGE
                        My wallet was pickpocketed by a 
                        young girl on Fulton Street.  

                                 FISK
                        Money comes and goes, George.  It's 
                        best not to call on those 
                        relationships for matters of this 
                        microtude.  
                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t care about the money.  
                        There was something in it I need 
                        back, and I can’t go through 
                        official channels.

           Fisk loves a good mystery...

                                 FISK
                        A love letter?

                                 GEORGE
                        A Chinese coin.

           Fisk can tell there is more, but George doesn’t want to talk.

                                 FISK
                        I’ll see what I can do.  Go back to 
                        the hotel and have a drink.  I’ll 
                        send someone.  

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL - EVENING

           George returns to his room, finding the match he wedged in 
           the door now resting on the floor.  Nerves on edge - the game 
           beginning...

           George stacks the disassembled safes in his closet.  He 
           paces, searching for any other evidence.  Suddenly, a KNOCK 
           at the door.  George spots his diagram on the desk and stuffs 
           it in the closet as well before going to the door.  Opening 
           it to find...

           ...no one there.  On the floor is his wallet.  George opens 
           it.  Empty, except for a formal invitation that reads:  “Ms. 
           Marm Mandelbaum cordially invites you to an evening of 
           bacchanalia at 79 Clinton Street.  Black tie attire.”

           INT. BASEMENT, THE TOMBS - DAY

           The thief Byrnes tackled is bound to a chair in the 
           windowless stone room as he is interrogated by an aggressive 
           young cop - JOHN “CLUBBER” WILLIAMS.  

                                 CLUBBER
                        We know you’re guilty, Joe!  We 
                        found the rock sewn into your coat!  

           Clubber grabs the thief’s face, frustrated.
                                 CLUBBER (CONT’D)
                        You think this is good times.  I’m 
                        just the opening act.

           The large iron door swings open and the silhouette of a 
           hulking figure enters...Thomas Byrnes.

                                 BYRNES
                             (to Clubber)
                        I’ll take it from here.

           Clubber wipes his sweaty brow, exhausted, as he departs.  
           Byrnes lowers himself to eye level with the convict.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        You know I grew up at an orphanage 
                        in the Five Points like you, and if 
                        I stole a 3-carat diamond, I 
                        wouldn’t know what in the hell to 
                        do with it.  Can’t be more than a 
                        couple fences in the city who could 
                        move that kind of swag.   

           Byrnes gets right in the man’s ear, whispering.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        I don’t care about you, Joe.  Just 
                        tell me who you work for.

           The thief maintains his silence.  Byrnes changes tack.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        You know there’s a thousand ways to 
                        make a man talk.  

           Byrnes withdraws a small Japanese chopstick from his pocket.

                                 BYRNES (CONT'D)
                        Ever seen one of these before?
                             (off the thief’s silence)
                        I heard in ancient Japan, if they 
                        wanted a man to talk, they’d take 
                        one of these and stick it in his 
                        dick, then light it on fire and let 
                        it burn down until they got a 
                        confession.  In all history, no man 
                        ever reached the end of the stick.  
                             (holding it eye-level)
                        So I'll ask you politely for the 
                        last time - who do you work for?

                                 THIEF
                        Marm.
           Byrnes looks back to Clubber, who hasn’t heard the name.

                                 BYRNES
                        Who’s Marm?

           EXT. CLINTON STREET - NIGHT

           Byrnes and Clubber stand in an alley, cloaked in shadows as 
           they surveil “Mandelbaum’s Dry Goods and Haberdashery”, which 
           is situated on a dark commercial block on the Lower East 
           Side.  The store appears to be shuttered for the night, save 
           for the parade of wealthy fashionistas in lounge suits and 
           fur coats that look like they just stepped off 5th Avenue.

                                 CLUBBER
                        Half the people going in there are 
                        known crooks.  

                                 BYRNES
                        The other half are the people 
                        they’re robbing.  Bankers, 
                        politicians...

                                 CLUBBER
                        Jesus - that’s the mayor.  We 
                        shouldn’t be here.  

           Clubber smokes his pipe nervously, the glowing cherry 
           floating in the darkness.  Byrnes’ binoculars find George 
           walking along the sidewalk in black tie.

           George searches for the right address as he anxiously scans 
           the shadows.  

                                 BYRNES
                        Who’s this one?

                                 CLUBBER
                        Never seen him.  Probably just some 
                        Wall Street bloke.

           Byrnes is intrigued - tracking George as he nears the door.

                                 BYRNES
                        Not him, rich people are oblivious. 

                                 CLUBBER
                        Then a common thief.

                                 BYRNES
                        Thieves keep their eyes down.  
                        Don’t want to be noticed.  This one 
                        has his eyes up, like a predator.
           George pauses and faces the display window of the dark store.

                                 CLUBBER
                        What’s he looking at?

           Byrnes realizes George is doing counter-surveillance...

                                 BYRNES
                        Us.

           ANGLE ON:  George watching the reflection of the street in 
           the window, seeing the cherry of Clubber’s pipe in the dark.

           Byrnes barks at Clubber.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        Put that out.

           As George reaches the door, he turns, staring into the inky 
           shadows across the street, looking right at Byrnes but unable 
           to see him.  

           AN ENORMOUS MAN with a shock of fiery red hair suddenly opens 
           the door...”RED” LEARY, the ugliest, meanest Irishman to ever 
           crawl out of the sewers of the Five Points.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I received this invit--

           Before George can withdraw the letter, Red cuts him off.  

                                 RED
                        This way.

           INT. MANDELBAUM STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Red guides George through the dark store by lantern as the 
           floorboards creak beneath their feet.  George casts a furtive 
           glance over his shoulder, sensing he is being led to his 
           execution.  They head up a staircase.  George balls his 
           fists, preparing to fight for his life if necessary.

                                 RED
                        Watch your step.

           The muted sounds of talking can be heard as they approach a 
           door.  Red solemnly opens the door to...

           ...an explosion of revelry.  The greatest party on earth in 
           its day.  A mixed-race band hammers out MUSIC.  White-gloved 
           waiters pass caviar and oysters and champagne.  And beautiful 
           women everywhere.
           George saddles up to the bar, where JERRY THOMAS, the Jupiter 
           Olympus of bartending, makes his famous ‘blue blazer’, 
           tossing a flaming arc of whiskey from one shaker to the next. 

           George looks two seats down the bar to see Fisk’s mistress, 
           Josie Mansfield, tip a flaming sugar cube off a silver spoon 
           into a green glass of absinthe, igniting it.

                                 JOSIE
                        La fée verte - the green fairy.

                                 GEORGE
                        Heard that stuff makes you crazy.

                                 JOSIE
                        Mad as a hatter.  We’re all mad 
                        here, George.  

                                 JERRY THOMAS
                        What can I make you?

                                 GEORGE
                        Bourbon - neat.

           George knocks back the drink to numb his anxiety.  Wondering 
           what in the hell kind of bizarre world he has ventured into. 

                                 JOSIE
                        You should come see my show at the 
                        opera house.  It’s called the 
                        Twelve Temptations.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I prefer the blood and thunder 
                        thrillers.

           Josie isn’t accustomed to rejection - is intrigued by him.  

                                 JOSIE
                        You’re a dull boy.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m here on business...suspect you 
                        are too.

           Josie would prefer to keep it about him...

                                 JOSIE
                        Fisk says you’re the smartest man 
                        he ever met.  Says if it weren’t 
                        for you he couldn’t have cheated 
                        his way through college.  
           George scans the mirror behind the bar, casing the room.  He 
           didn’t come here to flirt. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah, well, knowledge is knowing 
                        where to look.

                                 JOSIE
                        Bet he doesn’t know you were in 
                        prison.
                             (off George’s surprise)
                        Those scars on your wrists - didn’t 
                        get those from gold bracelets.

           Josie studies George, sizing him up.

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        I know your type.

                                 GEORGE
                        What type is that?

                                 JOSIE
                        My type.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re Fisk’s girl.

                                 JOSIE
                        I’m no one’s girl.  He takes what 
                        he wants and I do the same.

                                 GEORGE
                        So you are here on business.  Who’s 
                        your target?

                                 JOSIE
                        End of the bar.

           George spots a DAPPER MAN in a silk stovepipe hat.

                                 GEORGE
                        Big hat?

                                 JOSIE
                        Name’s Ned Stokes.  You don’t tell 
                        Fisk my secret and I won’t tell him 
                        yours.

           Josie looks over George’s shoulder, sensing trouble.  She 
           rises to leave, playing coy.
                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my ears and whiskers - how late 
                        it’s getting.

           As Josie departs, a hand SLAPS down on the bar.  The hand 
           pulls away, revealing the Little Joker.  George looks up to 
           see MARM MANDELBAUM (50s, maternal), the Queen of the 
           Underworld.  

                                 MARM
                        Mr. Leslie, I’m so glad you 
                        received my invitation.

                                 GEORGE
                        Ms. Mandelbaum, the belle of the 
                        ball.

           George holds her eyes as he ceremoniously lifts her gloved 
           hand, kissing it.

           INT. MARM’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Marm leads George into her office, which is decked out in 
           enough stolen finery to rival Versailles. 

                                 MARM
                        Watch out for that girl, Josie.  
                        She’s a waste of ammunition.  

           Marm examines the Little Joker in her hand.

                                 MARM (CONT’D)
                        I’ve seen Chinese coins before, but 
                        never one like this.
                             (inspects the characters 
                              on both sides)
                        ‘Life’ and ‘death’ - how poetic.

           George remains silent, playing it close to the vest.

                                 MARM (CONT’D)
                        Do you believe in fate, Mr. Leslie?

                                 GEORGE
                        I believe in design and 
                        calculation.

                                 MARM
                        We both know what this is - the 
                        Little Joker - the Holy Grail of 
                        bank robbing.  Records the turns of 
                        a bank dial.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        In all of history dating back to 
                        Ali Baba himself, no one’s been 
                        able to figure out how to make one.  
                        A lot of men have gone to jail 
                        trying.

                                 GEORGE
                        I met a few of ‘em.

                                 MARM
                             (feeling George out)
                        What are the odds that a man so 
                        brilliant could make such an 
                        obvious error losing this?

                                 GEORGE
                        A Chinese coin is worthless to a 
                        pickpocket unless it goes through a 
                        fence.  And a good fence would know 
                        that coin isn’t real.

                                 MARM
                        So you were looking for me?

                                 GEORGE
                        I need someone who knows how to 
                        move scores.  Someone knowledgeable 
                        enough to appreciate that device.

           A young white-gloved waiter brings a tray of oysters on ice.  

                                 MARM
                        God works in mysterious ways.

           Marm slurps an oyster off the half-shell as George recognizes 
           the waiter as Johnny, the teenage pickpocket who stole his 
           wallet.  

                                 GEORGE
                        God’s not the only one.  

           Marm opens a closet, revealing an enormous safe.  She tugs 
           off the dial, placing the Little Joker over the rod.  She 
           then replaces the dial.

                                 MARM
                        Must’ve taken months to make.

                                 GEORGE
                        Three weeks - imported the parts 
                        from Geneva.

           With her back to George, Marm carefully enters the 
           combination.  
           As Marm turns the dial, we ZOOM INSIDE THE LOCK, where the 
           gears inside the Little Joker click, registering each turn.  

                                 MARM
                        Let’s see if you’re as smart as I 
                        think you are.

           George removes the Little Joker, examining it’s intricate 
           gears, then twists the dial, entering the combo.  KACHUNK.  
           The safe opens, revealing bricks of cash piled high.

                                 MARM (CONT’D)
                        How do you read it?

                                 GEORGE
                        It uses a code only I know.

                                 MARM
                        I’ll give you ten thousand for it.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s worth ten times that.

                                 MARM
                        Fine - a hundred thousand.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t want your money.

                                 MARM
                        I take it you don’t plan on using 
                        that thing for chastity belts.  
                        Who’s your target? 

                                 GEORGE
                        Vanderbilt and anyone else who has 
                        it coming.  

                                 MARM
                        So you fancy yourself a modern day 
                        Robin Hood?

                                 GEORGE
                        No, I plan to keep it all for 
                        myself.

                                 MARM
                        Thank God.  The last thing I need 
                        is a Marxist bank robber.  That 
                        bank you’re planning won’t be easy.

                                 GEORGE
                        You don’t know which bank I’m 
                        hitting.
                                 MARM
                        You were pickpocketed at the corner 
                        of Greenwich and Fulton.  Means 
                        you’re planning to hit the Ocean 
                        Bank.  Two crews have already tried 
                        and failed.

                                 GEORGE
                        I read the reports.  They were 
                        sloppy.

           Marm lets George get away with the insult - agrees with him.

                                 MARM
                        You know where Gotham gets its 
                        name?  It was a medieval town that 
                        was legendary for its stupidity.  
                        This town is ripe for the taking, 
                        but you gotta know how to seize the 
                        opportunity.  When you start 
                        talking banks, you’ll need a crew 
                        to help you get in.  And you’ll 
                        need a way to move the score once 
                        you’re out.  For a 50% cut, I can 
                        provide all that.  

           George considers.

                                 MARM (CONT’D)
                        You knock off the banks, I’ll take 
                        care of everything else.

                                 GEORGE
                        What about the cops?

                                 MARM
                        There’s an old Russian saying - he 
                        who has money has no fear of the 
                        law.

           INT. BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHT - NIGHT

           Marm confers with George as two desperate fighters annihilate 
           each other in the ring.  The steady DIN of cheering is 
           sporadically interrupted by calls for blood.  

                                 MARM
                        If you’re successful, this’ll be 
                        the biggest score this city’s ever 
                        seen.  

                                 GEORGE
                        When do I meet the crew?
                                 MARM
                        You’ll be taking over Shang 
                        Draper’s gang.  They're a ruthless 
                        bunch of sonsofbitches, but they're 
                        good at what they do.  They’ll need 
                        someone with your brains to pull 
                        this off, though.  

                                 GEORGE
                        One rule - no one gets killed.

                                 MARM
                        If you do your job right, no one 
                        will.

                                 GEORGE
                        Who’s Shang?

                                 MARM
                        Pimp, thief, take your pick.  Runs 
                        a brothel in the Bowery.  Generally 
                        undesirable fellow but he’s light 
                        on scruples, which can be a plus in 
                        this business.

           INSERT:  A john humps away at a prostitute who feigns 
           pleasure.  Unbeknownst to the john, a panel in the wall opens 
           and SHANG DRAPER emerges, emptying the man’s wallet from his 
           discarded pants.  Shang is a thin, greasy, hateful man who 
           exerts power over the weak to compensate for low self-esteem.

                        Red Leary.  Muscle.  Killed sixteen 
                        men that I’m aware of, most of whom 
                        had it coming.

           INSERT:  Red Leary, a leathery, red-haired throat-slitter 
           dumps a large sack with a body off a rowboat.  The same man 
           who led George into Marm’s party.

                                 MARM (CONT’D)
                        Charlie Bullard.  Best damn piano 
                        player in New York city.  Can play 
                        anything, including a safe’s dial.

           INSERT:  “PIANO” CHARLIE BULLARD hammers out a tune at Marm’s 
           party, his fingers dancing with preternatural speed.

                        Abe Coakley and Jimmy Hope.  Most 
                        knowledgeable engineers in the 
                        business.  
           INSERT:  ABE COAKLEY and JIMMY HOPE tirelessly toil away at a 
           safe, methodically hammering wedges to get it open.

                        And Johnny Irving, whom you’ve met.

           INSERT:  The young pickpocket JOHNNY IRVING serves George at 
           Marm’s party - the same one who took his wallet with Babe.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m gonna need money to gain access 
                        to the bank and a place to train 
                        the crew.

                                 MARM
                        Whatever you need, handsome.

           Marm leans into George, serious.

                                 MARM (CONT’D)
                        Remember, the artist is nothing 
                        without the gift, but the gift is 
                        nothing without the work.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           The Shang Draper gang is gathered around a large safe that is 
           covered in chunks of mortar and brick.  Abe Coakley and Jimmy 
           Hope drill the lock as Marm and George watch.

                                 MARM
                        They took it from a bank last week, 
                        but still can’t get it open.  

           George examines the safe, spinning it on its wheeled dolly.

                                 GEORGE
                        This is a Yale Imperial - can’t be 
                        drilled.

                                 MARM 
                        Gentlemen, meet George Leslie.

           Shang is exasperated.

                                 SHANG
                        I say we nitro the damn thing.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Nitro is fool’s gold.  You’d need 
                        enough bang to blow up everything 
                        inside as well as yourself.
                                 SHANG
                        You got any better ideas, smartass?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah, toss it out the window.

           Shang turns his back on George, angry.

                                 SHANG
                        Get this niminy piminy jackass out 
                        of here --

                                 GEORGE
                             (cutting him off)
                        The Imperials use a spring locking 
                        mechanism.  If you drop the safe 
                        hinge-side down, you’ll create 
                        enough kinetic energy to compress 
                        the springs.

           George positions himself against the safe like a rugby player 
           in the scrum, then runs, shoving the safe across the room on 
           the dolly and toppling it out the second-story.

           The crew gathers at the window to see the safe lying on its 
           side on the cobblestone below, spilling out cash.

                                 MARM
                        From now on, George calls the 
                        shots.

                                 SHANG
                        This is my crew.

                                 MARM
                        No, this is my crew.  Don’t any of 
                        you forget who you work for.

           INT. UPSCALE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           George stencils a sign on a foggy window to an indoor office.  
           The sign reads, “GEORGE L. LESLIE, ARCHITECT”.  George takes 
           a step back, admiring his new life.

           The pick-pocket Johnny Irving appears next to him, like the 
           terrier to George’s pitbull.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Almost look like a respectable 
                        society man.

           George pushes in, circling an architecture desk where he has 
           a diagram in process.
                                 GEORGE
                        Johnny, I got a special job for you 
                        on this one.    

                                 JOHNNY
                        What kind of job?

                                 GEORGE
                        Honest work.

                                 JOHNNY 
                        Why me?

                                 GEORGE
                        I need someone I can trust.

           George puts on his coat to leave.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Now give me my wallet back.

           Johnny smiles, pulling George’s wallet from his pocket and 
           returning it, having deftly robbed him a second time.

           INT. OCEAN BANK - DAY

           George sits across from a bookish bank manager - ED SCHELL.  
           George drops a large suitcase on the desk.

                                 ED SCHELL
                        May I ask what kind of work you’re 
                        in?

                                 GEORGE
                        Architecture.

           Ed looks in the case - full of money.

                                 ED SCHELL
                        And a talented one from the looks 
                        of it.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I plan on making a bunch more 
                        deposits that size.

                                 ED SCHELL
                        They say everyone comes to New York 
                        for a different reason...  
                             (smiling)
                        But we’re all here to make money.
                                 GEORGE
                        Actually moved here to look after 
                        my nephew.  He’s had trouble 
                        getting back on track since his 
                        mother died.  His boss gave away 
                        his job as a janitor.

           ACROSS THE ROOM:  Johnny Irving plays the role of bored 
           teenager as he steps across the flagstones on the floor of 
           the lobby, mumbling under his breath as he counts his steps.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Thirty-one, thirty-two...

           Johnny terminates at the vault, admiring the large door.

                                 ED SCHELL
                        What a shame.  Shall we get started 
                        with the deposit?

                                 GEORGE
                        I got few more banks to interview 
                        before I make a decision.

           George rises to leave.  Ed panics, trying not to lose him.

                                 ED SCHELL
                        What if I could get your nephew a 
                        job here?  

           INT. GEORGE LESLIE’S ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY

           George draws a diagram as Johnny huddles over him.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I counted 32 stones.  

                                 GEORGE
                        At 24 inches each...

           Johnny examines the diagram.

                                 JOHNNY
                        You did all this from memory?!  
                        That’s impossible.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s something I was born with.  
                        When I close my eyes, I remember 
                        everything like the picture is 
                        painted on my eyelids.
           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           George rolls out a diagram in front of his crew in a 
           warehouse on the docks.

                                 GEORGE
                        ...the room is 68 feet by 80 feet.  
                        Two doors off the main lobby.  Door 
                        on the left is the bank president’s 
                        office - one on the right’s the 
                        vault.  The walls of the vault are 
                        solid steel lined with stone.  

                                 JIMMY
                        If digging into the vault isn’t an 
                        option, how will we get in?

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. OCEAN BANK - DAY

           Johnny Irving works sweeping up.  He approaches the vault and 
           pulls the Little Joker from his pocket, surreptitiously using 
           a small chisel to jimmy off the dial.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           George’s crew builds a reconstruction of the bank as George 
           talks with Charlie Bullard beside a tall safe.

                                 GEORGE
                        The Little Joker will tell us how 
                        many turns in each direction, but 
                        it doesn’t tell us where to start, 
                        so we’ll need to be prepared to hit 
                        up to fifty combos.  Let’s see how 
                        quick those fingers dance.

           Charlie’s fingers whir as he rifles through combinations.  
           Charlie finishes, clenching his trembling fingers in a fist.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                             (checking stopwatch)
                        3 minutes.  Keep at it.

           George sees the young street urchin Babe watching from her 
           perch atop a crate.  He pulls Johnny aside. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you have parents?
                                 JOHNNY
                             (uncomfortable)
                        Father, but he drinks too much.

           George notices bruises on Babe’s arms - doesn’t have the 
           heart to send her home.

                                 GEORGE
                        Just keep an eye on her.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           As the crew works, George hands Babe a present.  Babe eagerly 
           unwraps a copy of Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures In 
           Wonderland.  Babe flips backward through the illustrations.

                                 BABE
                        A book about a rabbit!

           George smiles sadly, realizing she can’t read.  He is 
           approached by Jimmy Hope.

                                 JIMMY
                        I found an office for rent across 
                        from the bank.

           George walks with Jimmy, surveying the mock-up of the bank.

                                 GEORGE
                        Good - rent it under the name Jack 
                        Howard.

                                 JIMMY
                        Who’s that?

           INT. OCEAN BANK - DAY

           George hands Ed a bag of money.  As Ed enters the combination 
           in the dial to put the money in the vault, we PUSH INSIDE the 
           lock, where the Little Joker records the turns.  

           The door opens...  

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           George’s replica of the vault in the warehouse, spatially 
           perfect, though built from a hodge-podge of stolen furniture.  
                                 GEORGE
                        Welcome to the Ocean Bank vault.

           Behind him the crew looks on skeptically.

                                 SHANG
                        If Johnny’s working the night of 
                        the robbery, they’ll know he was in 
                        on it.

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s why he won’t be working.

                                 RED
                        Then how are we getting into the 
                        lobby? 

                                 GEORGE
                        Getting in isn’t the problem.  
                        Problem is the windows.  The bank 
                        is located across from the police 
                        station.  

           The crew guffaws at the proposition.

                                 SHANG
                        You want to rob a bank while a 
                        dozen cops are looking right in the 
                        window?!

                                 JIMMY
                        The second they see light, we’re 
                        cooked.

           George is two steps ahead, as always.

                                 GEORGE
                        There won’t be any light.

                                 ABE
                        What’s the plan?  Paint the windows 
                        black?

                                 GEORGE
                        We rob it in the dark.

           The crew trades a look - he can’t be serious.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Darkness... 
                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        One.

           George lifts the shutter on a “dark lantern” (metal lamp with 
           a circular opening) revealing the crew in various positions 
           around the vault as they dial in their split second timing.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Good.

           George shutters the lantern.  Blackness...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Two.

           He lifts up the shutter, revealing the men in new positions.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Shang, you’re a foot off.  You’re 
                        responsible for the jewelry in that 
                        lock-box.
                             (beat)
                        Start over.

                                 SHANG
                        For Christ’s sake, we been at this 
                        for hours!  

           Shang points at one of the walls.

                                 SHANG (CONT’D)
                        Look at this - we’re leaving an 
                        entire wall of boxes untouched!

           George covers the lantern.  Blackness.  When he appears again 
           he is standing before the lock boxes.

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s because those are registered 
                        securities.  Not only are they 
                        worthless to us, but they can also 
                        be traced back to the heist.  

           George extinguishes the light, appearing behind Shang.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        You rob these and you’re signing 
                        your death warrant. 

           Shang spins, but before he can find George, all is dark.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        We only want things we can move - 
                        cash and jewelry.  
           George appears, standing before the crew.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        We don’t hit the bank until every 
                        one of you has the vault memorized.  
                        Run it again.

           George extinguishes the lantern, casting the crew into 
           darkness.

           INT. OCEAN BANK - DAY

           SUPER:  OCEAN NATIONAL BANK - JUNE 2, 1869

           FADE UP on the ocean bank vault, a perfect match for the 
           warehouse, only the vault has been turned inside out.  Byrnes 
           scans the crime scene, taking in the magnitude of the heist. 

                                 CLUBBER
                        They made off with eight hundred 
                        thousand in cash and jewelry.  Left 
                        another five hundred thousand in 
                        securities untouched.

                                 BYRNES
                        They knew exactly what they came 
                        for - didn’t take anything that 
                        could be traced.  Any luck with the 
                        witnesses?

                                 CLUBBER
                        A dozen people passed by the bank 
                        last night.  No one saw or heard a 
                        thing - including the security 
                        guard who was standing at the front 
                        door the entire time.  

           Byrnes struggles to grasp the scope of what George’s crew 
           pulled off.  Walling approaches.

                                 WALLING
                        How did they get in?

           Byrnes leads Walling to a hole in the ground outside the 
           vault, which is flanked by two halves of a giant flagstone.  

                                 BYRNES
                        They dug 120 feet, then used a 
                        jackscrew to split this stone.  

           Walling examines the rabbit-hole leading into the center of 
           the earth.
                                 WALLING
                        Where’s it go?

                                 BYRNES
                        Leads to an office across the 
                        street.  Registered to one Jack 
                        Howard.  We’re looking into it.

                        Looks like we’ve got a new breed of 
                        criminal operating in our city.  I 
                        want you to run this case.  

                                 BYRNES
                        Yes, sir.

           Walling taps his temple, coaching his young protege.

                                 WALLING
                        Don’t forget your greatest weapon. 

           INT. MANDELBAUM STORE - DAY

           Marm’s crew uses a scale to divide up the mountains of cash.  
           Marm approaches George with a wooden box.

                                 GEORGE
                        What’s this?

           George opens the box to find a shiny revolver.

                                 MARM
                        You’ve got a target on you now, 
                        kid.  People on both sides of the 
                        law will be gunnin’ for you.  

           EXT. CATHOLIC BOARDING SCHOOL - DAY

           George speaks with a NUN.  Babe stands at his side wearing a 
           new dress and holding a suitcase.  Johnny is there as well. 

                                 GEORGE
                        How much is an education here?

                                 NUN
                        $100 per year.

           George hands the nun a leather duffel full of money.
                                 GEORGE
                        This should get her through 
                        graduation.  Consider the rest a 
                        donation.

           The nun looks in the bag, dumbfounded.

                                 NUN
                        God bless you, sir.

           Through the doorway, Babe can see all the children in their 
           uniforms playing.  She hides behind George. 

                                 BABE
                        I don’t want to go in there.

           Johnny steps in - the only one Babe trusts.

                                 JOHNNY
                        You’ll be safe here, Babe.  

           George casts a glance at Johnny as the nun leads Babe away.

           INT. WALLING’S OFFICE, THE TOMBS - DAY

           Byrnes debriefs Walling in his office.  

                                 BYRNES
                        The lock showed no sign of 
                        tampering.  No gunpowder, no  
                        drilling.  Talked to a dozen 
                        locksmiths.  No one’s ever seen 
                        anything like it. 

                                 WALLING
                        Probably an inside job - someone 
                        who knew the combo.  

                                 BYRNES
                        Only one man knew the combo and his 
                        alibi is solid.  

                                 WALLING
                        So we got nothin’?

                                 BYRNES
                        I noticed one thing in the bank 
                        records.  Ten people made deposits 
                        in the week leading up to the 
                        heist.   

                                 WALLING
                        Follow up on them.
                                 BYRNES
                        Already did.

           INSERT SURVEILLANCE MONTAGE:

           The Shadows tail various men on the list, crossing them off. 

                                 BYRNES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        All checked out except one.

           One of the Shadows grinds a piece of chalk in his hands.  As 
           he walks past a man on a crowded street, he touches the man’s 
           back, leaving a small mark. The Shadow continues on his way, 
           where he passes Byrnes, whispering...

                                 SHADOW
                        White chalk.

           Byrnes pushes through the crowd, finding the dark suit with 
           the white smudge up ahead.  As the man approaches an office 
           building, he looks back over his shoulder, revealing...George 
           Leslie.  Byrnes double-takes at the familiar face, then 
           circles the name on his list.

                                                               BACK TO:

                                 BYRNES
                        Guy’s an architect.  

                                 WALLING
                        You think he’s connected?

                                 BYRNES
                             (confident)
                        I also saw him entering one of 
                        Marm’s parties a month ago.    

           The mention of Marm Mandelbaum carries weight for Walling.

                                 WALLING
                        Keep him under surveillance.

           INT. GEORGE LESLIE’S ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY

           George enters his architecture office and hangs up his coat.  
           He pauses, noticing the small white chalk smudge on the 
           fabric.  George runs his fingers over it - suspicious. 

           INT. MANDELBAUM STORE - DAY

           Red wheels a crate through Marm’s store as George enters.
                                 RED
                             (to Marm)
                        Just got this shipment from a crew 
                        in England.  Where do you want it?

                                 MARM
                        Take it in back.

           Marm hands George a folder. 

                                 MARM (CONT’D)
                        New target.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Vanderbilt’s money?

                                 MARM
                        Some of it...Johnny can’t put the 
                        Joker in this time - the cops will 
                        make the connection.

                                 GEORGE
                             (unfazed)
                        Then we’ll break in twice the same 
                        week - once to install the Joker 
                        and once to rob it.

                                 MARM
                        Impossible.

                                 GEORGE
                        Wanna bet your half?

           Marm smiles, likes his attitude.

                                 MARM
                        Son, you have some iron balls.

           INT. BANK - DAY

           George walks through a busy bank, taking inventory of the 
           room - especially the various locks.  His mind’s eye overlays 
           architectural schematics and notes on everything he sees.

           The camera PULLS UP high above George, offering a top-down 
           view.  DISSOLVE TO...

           INT. GEORGE LESLIE’S ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY

           A diagram perfectly matching the bank as George sketches...
                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Excuse me.  
                             (re: sign)
                        Says Mr. Leslie’s an architect?

           George looks up to see a YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE 
           standing in the doorway.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        We’re looking for someone to build 
                        us a house.

           George hesitates, surprised to have a real client.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m George Leslie.  Please, have a 
                        seat.    

           George slides into the role of architect effortlessly.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                             (re: pregnant wife)
                        Looks like you’re gonna need a 
                        couple bedrooms. 

                                 WIFE
                        We were thinking something simple 
                        like you get in Cape Cod.  I grew 
                        up there.  

                                 MAN
                             (embarrassed)
                        We don’t have much money.

                                 GEORGE
                        That won’t be a problem.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Byrnes watches from an adjacent rooftop as George Leslie 
           burns the midnight oil drawing an architectural diagram as he 
           sips a glass of whiskey.  Clubber peers through a telescope.

                                 BYRNES
                        Where’d you fight in the war, 
                        Clubber?

                                 CLUBBER
                        I didn’t - I was in college.  My 
                        old man paid 300 bucks to buy me an 
                        exemption.  So I quit school and 
                        became a cop to piss him off.     
           Clubber lowers his telescope, taking a seat behind the low 
           wall on the roof.

                                 CLUBBER (CONT’D)
                        We’re barking up the wrong tree.

           Clubber lights his pipe.  Byrnes takes note, annoyed, but 
           doesn’t say anything this time.

                                 BYRNES
                        He’s connected.  We just need to 
                        watch and wait.

           The light goes out in George’s office.  Byrnes sees George 
           exiting the building - snaps to action.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        He’s moving.

           EXT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

           Byrnes and Clubber tail George as he enters the opera house, 
           where the marquee advertises The Twelve Temptations. 

                                 CLUBBER
                        Let’s flash our badges and go in.

           Byrnes take note of the wealthy theater patrons.

                                 BYRNES
                        Look at those people.  We’ll stick 
                        out like balls on a bulldog in 
                        there.

           Clubber pulls his collar up, shivering.  Byrnes can sense his 
           frustration.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        Go home and get some rest.  

           INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

           George watches the show in a box with Fisk.  Fisk holds his 
           theater glasses in one hand and pretends he’s conducting the 
           orchestra with the other.  

           As Josie sings a number on stage, George surreptitiously 
           checks his pocket-watch, then leans in to Fisk.  

                                 GEORGE
                        You’ll have to excuse me - I’m not 
                        feeling well.
           George rises to leave...

           INT. RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           George washes his hands beside another theater patron.  As 
           the man departs, George opens the window and slips out.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           George drops out the window onto the street.  He checks his 
           surroundings, then his watch, as he rushes away.

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           George arrives at an alley beside a bank, where his crew is 
           already waiting.  Red Leary places a chisel in the door and 
           hammers it, breaking the lock.  As the crew silently presses 
           inside, Abe Coakley is already pulling out a duplicate lock 
           and installing it...the operation tuned like a Swiss watch.

           INT. BANK - CONTINUOUS

           The crew drills the lock on the outer vault door, catching 
           the metal splinters on a cloth.  As they bust through, Shang 
           wraps up the cloth with the evidence.  Charlie Bullard 
           reaches in the hole with a knitting needle, picking the lock 
           and opening the vault door.  As the crew presses inside the 
           vault, Jimmy Hope begins filling the hole with black putty.  

           George races to the giant safe inside, where Johnny is 
           already using a crowbar to pop the dial.  George slides the 
           Little Joker into place, then replaces the dial.

           EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           The crew floods out as Abe finishes repairing the lock...

                                 GEORGE
                        Joker’s in place.  We come back 
                        Sunday.

           ...sealing the door behind them like they were never there.

           INT. OPERA HOUSE - LATER

           George returns to his seat in Fisk’s booth, where Fisk stands 
           as he obliviously conducts the orchestra.
                                 FISK
                        You’re just in time - this next 
                        number’s rollicking good fun.

           INT. BYRNES APARTMENT - DAY

           Byrnes splashes water on his face, taking note of the dark 
           circles under his eyes in the mirror.  His wife, OPHELIA, 
           enters behind him.  She is eight months pregnant and 
           beginning to wonder if this is life.

                                 OPHELIA
                        It’s six in the morning.  

                                 BYRNES
                        I need to shave and go back to 
                        work.

                                 OPHELIA
                        How was your night?

           Byrnes reaches for his razor, overwhelmed by exhaustion.

                                 BYRNES
                        Fine.

           Ophelia waits for more, then mimics the conversation she’d 
           like to have had.

                                 OPHELIA
                        ‘Fine sweetheart, how was yours?’  

           Byrnes catches her eye in the mirror.

                                 OPHELIA (CONT’D)
                        If you don’t care, you could at 
                        least pretend.  

                                 BYRNES
                        I do care - I’m just exhausted.

                                 OPHELIA
                        I saw Pete Bingham’s wife 
                        yesterday.  They just moved into a 
                        big place on 14th.  Didn’t know you 
                        could live there on a cop’s salary.

                                 BYRNES
                        You can’t.  
                             (beat)
                        Is that what’s upsetting you - 
                        money?   
                                 OPHELIA
                        I don’t care that we’re broke.  I 
                        don’t care that you never take me 
                        out for a nice dinner or that we 
                        live in a small apartment.  But I 
                        need you.  

                                 BYRNES
                        I’m doing the best I can. 

           Ophelia hands Byrnes a wrapped present.

                                 OPHELIA
                        Happy birthday.

                                 BYRNES
                        What is it?

                                 OPHELIA
                        For your office.

           Byrnes opens the present, finding a framed studio photograph 
           of Ophelia and his daughters.  

                                 OPHELIA (CONT’D)
                        If you can't be with us, at least 
                        we can be with you.

           Ophelia places a loving hand on his back.

           INT. JIM FISK’S OFFICE - DAY

           SUPER:  BLACK FRIDAY - SEPTEMBER 24, 1869

           George reads the paper as he moves down Fisk’s hallway.  The 
           headline reads “JACK HOWARD GANG STRIKES AGAIN.  LARGEST CASH 
           HAUL IN NATION’S HISTORY.”  

           Fisk stands on his desk, belligerently intoxicated by his own 
           success.  He is flanked by showgirls and business associates 
           in tuxedos as he uses a saber to slash open a bottle of 
           champagne, which he pours on the girls below.  He sees George 
           in the doorway.

                                 FISK
                        Mob’s rioting in the street!  
                        Apparently they weren’t too keen on 
                        gold losing 50% of it’s value.  

           George takes note of the ornate military uniform Fisk is 
           wearing.
                                 GEORGE
                        Why are you dressed like a Mexican 
                        general?

                                 FISK
                        If Vanderbilt’s the Commodore, then 
                        I’m the god-damn Admiral!  $11 
                        million in one day.  The pharaohs 
                        can kiss my ass!

           George shakes his head, amused, as a cocktail finds its way 
           into his hand.

           EXT. FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL - NIGHT

           The party has moved to the Fifth Avenue Hotel, where George 
           and Fisk split a bottle of whiskey at the bar with their ties 
           undone.  The room is peppered with Fisk’s frayed drunken 
           entourage.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Where’s all that money come from?

           Fisk blows a cloud of cigar smoke, cavalier.

                                 FISK
                        It’s all one big parlor game, 
                        George.

                                 GEORGE
                        But the money has to come from 
                        somewhere...

           Fisk makes sure no one is listening.

                                 FISK
                        Taxpayers.
                             (off George’s confusion)
                        The government keeps the tax money 
                        as gold.  I flood the market with 
                        shiny metal - my money doubles.  
                        Taxpayer money gets cut in half.  

                                 GEORGE
                        You stole public tax money?

           Fisk raises a glass, smiling mischievously.

                                 FISK
                        To the greatest country on earth.  
                             (swallowing)
                        Christ, I’m drunk.
           Fisk stumbles out, leaving George to chug his drink alone, 
           processing Fisk’s confession.

           Josie arrives next to him, lighting a cigarette.

                                 JOSIE
                        Why the long face, George?

           George realizes his best friend is no different from the 
           robber barons he’s targeting.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Fisk’s a thief...

                                 JOSIE
                        Everyone’s working an angle and if 
                        you say you’re not, you’re a damn 
                        liar.

           George slams another glass of whiskey - calls the bartender.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hit me.

                                 BARTENDER
                        I think you’ve had enough.

           George slaps down a $20 bill and seizes the bottle out of the 
           bartender’s hand.  George departs.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Piss drunk, George staggers out into the street, swaying the 
           bottle of whiskey.  Josie follows him as he heads up the 
           stairs to the elevated rail.  

           EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN PLATFORM - NIGHT

           Josie calls after George as he hops down on the tracks.

                                 JOSIE
                        George, where are you going?

           As George wanders into the night on the elevated tracks, 
           Josie follows, careful not to trip as she steps fearfully 
           from slat to slat.  The twinkling lights of the city stretch 
           out like the night sky beneath them.

           George mutters under his breath as he counts the slats.

                                 GEORGE
                        72, 73, 74...
                                 JOSIE
                        George, what are you doing?

                                 GEORGE
                        This is Vanderbilt’s rail.

           CLOSE ON the steel rail, trembling.

                                 JOSIE
                        Why’ve you got so much lead in your 
                        pistol for Vanderbilt?!

                                 GEORGE
                             (ignoring, wasted)
                        84, 85...

           Josie suddenly spots a train approaching as she nears George.

                                 JOSIE
                        George, there’s a train coming!  We 
                        need to go.

                                 GEORGE
                        You won’t make it.  250 feet to the 
                        station.

           The rumbling builds, a DEAFENING RATTLE in the still night.

                                 JOSIE
                        George!

           Moments from impact, Josie grabs George’s arm.  He spins, 
           kissing her.  She kisses him back as he pulls her to the 
           tracks, the train roaring over them.  

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL - NIGHT

           George rips off Josie’s clothes as she claws at him, both of 
           them giving into their animal impulses.  Her nails dig into 
           George’s back as she bites him, tattooing his body.  George 
           grips her hair as they both climax.  Bodies collapsing into 
           each other.

           George catches his breath as Josie embraces him, looking over 
           his shoulder.

                                 JOSIE
                        We should do that again sometime.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM, FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL - MORNING

           Red Leary steps into George’s hotel room, where George stands 
           shirtless and hungover.  Red casts a glance in the bedroom, 
           meeting eyes with Josie sprawled in the sheets.  She covers 
           herself as George closes the bedroom door so she can’t hear 
           their conversation.

                                 RED
                        Nice place.  Real fancy.

                                 GEORGE
                        What’s wrong?

                                 RED
                        Shang’s been talkin’.  He isn’t 
                        happy about you moving in on his 
                        turf.  Asked me if I’d be willing 
                        to kill you.

           George sees his gun resting on the desk.  A mile away.

                                 GEORGE
                        That why you’re here?

                                 RED
                        I work for Marm, and for now she 
                        wants you protected.  Shang causes 
                        trouble, I’ll slit his throat.  See 
                        you Sunday night.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           George returns to the hotel room, where he dresses in the 
           mirror as Josie watches from the bed.  

                                 JOSIE
                        There’s a bare-knuckle fight in the 
                        Bowery tonight.  The Boston Strong 
                        Boy’s fighting.

                                 GEORGE
                        I got work.

           Josie is not accustomed to rejection.

                                 JOSIE
                        What kind of work is that, George?

           Josie waits for more of an explanation - doesn’t get one.
                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        Fine - I’ll find someone else to 
                        take me.

           INT. BANK - DAY

           SUPER:  ATLANTIC BANK - SEPTEMBER 27, 1869

           The Shadows scour every inch of a bank vault that’s been 
           robbed.  In the middle of the floor is a gaping hole.  The 
           safe is open at the end of the vault.

                                 SHADOW
                        Boss, check this out.

           Byrnes approaches a Shadow, who points to a small 
           discoloration on the outer vault door where George drilled.  
           Byrnes rubs it, black putty coming off on his fingers.

                                 SHADOW (CONT’D)
                        Doesn’t make sense, the crew dug 
                        through the floor and opened the 
                        safe.  Why drill the outer door?  

           Byrnes pieces it together, the truth even more confusing...

                                 BYRNES
                        They broke in twice..?

                                 SHADOW
                        Why the hell would they do that?

           INT. DRESSING ROOM, OPERA HOUSE - DAY

           George confronts a half-naked Josie in the dressing room 
           filled with Japanese masks and other theater props. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Seein’ if you want to grab dinner 
                        tonight?  You pick.

           Josie is cold.

                                 JOSIE
                        I got dinner plans.

                                 GEORGE
                        Fisk?

                                 JOSIE
                        Ned Stokes.
                                 GEORGE
                        The guy with the big hat?  

           Josie doesn’t show any weakness.

                                 JOSIE
                        Big hat and deep pockets.  
                             (off George’s silence)
                        Go ahead - call me a whore.  I know 
                        you’re dyin’ to.

                                 GEORGE
                        At least a whore’s honest about her 
                        work.

           Josie snaps.

                                 JOSIE
                        I got one thing of value in this 
                        world, and you can be sure as hell 
                        I’m gonna use it to get what I can.  
                        And who are you to ride your high 
                        horse?  
                             (mocking)
                        George Leslie, the brilliant 
                        architect.   

           Off George’s silence...

                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        I saw all the money in your pocket 
                        the day after the Ocean Bank 
                        robbery...and the safes in your 
                        closet.  You think I’m stupid?  I 
                        know you’re working for Marm.  I’m 
                        the only one who can see that 
                        you’re a damn lunatic masquerading 
                        as a sane person.

                                 GEORGE
                             (simmering)
                        You have no idea who I am.

                                 JOSIE
                        I can tell you this - whatever 
                        screwed-up piece of you is missing, 
                        you aren’t going to find it in a 
                        bank vault.

           George leaves, slamming the door behind him.
           INT. BYRNES’ OFFICE, THE TOMBS - DAY

           A MIDDLE-AGED MAN in an expensive suit enters as Byrnes 
           studies the case files.

                                 MAN
                        Excuse me, Detective Byrnes.  I’d 
                        like to speak with you about the 
                        bank robberies.

                                 BYRNES
                        Who are you?

                                 MAN
                        I represent Mr. Cornelius 
                        Vanderbilt.  His money was in all 
                        three of those banks.  He’s 
                        concerned he’s being targeted.

                                 BYRNES
                        I’m aware of the connection, and 
                        his concern is noted.  If he wants 
                        to speak further about the case, he 
                        can come down here himself.  

                                 MAN
                        Mr. Vanderbilt is a very busy man, 
                        but he would like to offer you any 
                        financial assistance required to 
                        catch the thief.  He’s willing to 
                        make a check out to you personally 
                        if that will accelerate things.    

           Byrnes fumes at the implication.

                                 BYRNES
                        Get the hell out of my office.

           As the man departs, Clubber enters.

                                 CLUBBER
                        I just got a telegram back from the 
                        lock company.  They said an 
                        identical model to the one in the 
                        Ocean Bank was delivered to a 
                        warehouse on the docks two weeks 
                        before the robbery. 

                                 BYRNES
                        Do they have a name on the order?

                                 CLUBBER
                        Jack Howard.
           Byrnes grabs the telegram from Clubber’s hand.

                                 BYRNES
                        Same alias - who else knows about 
                        this?

                                 CLUBBER
                        Just you.

           Byrnes snatches his revolver from his desk and begins 
           thumbing in rounds.

                                 BYRNES
                        Have the men load up.  Don’t tell 
                        them where we’re headed until we 
                        get there.  We’re not letting this 
                        one slip through our fingers.

           INT. ATTIC, MANDELBAUM STORE - DAY

           George enters a large attic above Marm’s store, light 
           streaming through the filthy glass.  Marm hovers over a 
           THIEF, who is restrained by Marm’s thugs in a chair.  

                                 THIEF
                        I swear - his wallet only had $100.  
                        I gave you half.  

                                 MARM
                        A little bird in a precinct said 
                        the police report registered $400 
                        missing.  

           The man falls silent.

                                 MARM (CONT’D)
                        You know what science is?  It’s the 
                        knowledge of consequences.      

           Red Leary places the thief’s right hand on the table and 
           passes his knife over the thief’s fingers, taking inventory.

                                 RED
                        Which piggy’s it gonna be?  The one 
                        who went to market?  The one who 
                        had roast beef?  
                             (re: ring finger)
                        The one who had none?

           The thief swallows his horror, barely able to speak...

                                 THIEF
                        The one who went wee wee wee.
           Marm approaches George, the threat not lost on him as the 
           thief SCREAMS off-camera. 

                                 MARM
                        I need some fresh air.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Marm and George walk past vendors selling fruit and 
           vegetables.  Marm feels a red apple, seeing if it’s ripe.

                                 MARM
                        I told you to stay away from Josie.  
                        Not everything with a hole’s meant 
                        to be picked.

                                 GEORGE
                        She’s not your business.

                                 MARM
                        No, but you are my business, and my 
                        merchandise is in jeopardy.  The 
                        cops have a special unit assigned 
                        to you - there’s too much heat.  
                        I’m sending you out of town. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You can’t.  I’m prepping a job.

                                 MARM
                        I’m calling it off.  Besides, a 
                        young man’s meant to see the world.   

           George is frustrated - what the hell is she talking about?!

                                 GEORGE
                        I’ll lay low until things cool off.  
                        We got a whole city full of banks 
                        to rob.  

                                 MARM
                        You gotta think bigger, George.  We 
                        got a whole country full of banks. 

                                 GEORGE
                        What are we talking about?

                                 MARM
                        Manifest destiny.  Talent like 
                        yours shouldn’t be restricted to 
                        one town.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        I do business with dozens of crews 
                        all over the country and they all 
                        got one thing in common.  They 
                        don’t have you.  

           George pieces it together.

                                 GEORGE
                        You want me to be your gun for 
                        hire.  

                                 MARM
                        I line ‘em up, you knock ‘em down.  
                        Split 50-50 with the local crews.  

           George casts a glance at the city - reluctant.

                                 MARM (CONT’D)
                        You can still do your architecture 
                        business between jobs - it’s a good 
                        cover - but no New York banks until 
                        things blow over.

                                 GEORGE
                        This wasn’t the deal.

                                 MARM
                        Name one thing in this city you 
                        can't walk away from.  You live out 
                        of a suitcase in a hotel room you 
                        pay cash for.

                                 GEORGE
                        Vanderbilt’s money is here.

                                 MARM
                        What about Rockefeller, Morgan, 
                        Carnegie?  You gotta think bigger. 

           Marm goes for the coup de grace.

                                 MARM (CONT’D)
                        You wanna target one man, or the 
                        entire system?

           I/E. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Byrnes and his armed crew of Shadows rush silently to the 
           door of the warehouse where George preps his jobs.  
           Byrnes kicks in the door, flooding through with his team.  
           Finding the space completely empty...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BANK - DAY

           SUPER:  SAN FRANCISCO - 1870

           George leads a local crew of FOUR ARMED CROOKS into a bank in 
           the middle of the day.  Two of the men fan out, splashing 
           buckets of quicklime and water across the floor near the 
           walls, which instantly creates steam, fogging the windows.

           A CROOK approaches George in the lobby as George inspects the 
           door to the vault room.  

                                 CROOK #1
                        The guy we paid to unlock the outer 
                        vault didn’t show.  What do we do?

                                 GEORGE
                        Which one’s the bank manager?

           The crook nods at the BANK MANAGER, who stares back 
           defiantly.

                                 CROOK #1
                        Over there - we tried bribing him 
                        but he isn’t game.

           Another CROOK interjects as he nervously swings his rifle 
           across the terrified hostages.

                                 CROOK #2
                        I say we kill one to let ‘em know 
                        we’re serious.

           George notes the HOSTAGES panicking at the suggestion.  He 
           scans from the restrained bank manager to a young terrified 
           FEMALE TELLER, forming his play.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I’ll handle it.  

                                 CROOK #2
                        What do you mean, you’ll handle 
                        it?!  Cops will be here any minute.

           George grabs the barrel of the crook’s rifle, forcing it to 
           the ground.  He gets in the crook’s face, his voice measured.
                                 GEORGE
                        Remember, calm is contagious.  

                                 CROOK #2
                             (seething)
                        You got two minutes, then I handle 
                        it.

           George glances at the clock as he approaches the female 
           teller, who is tied to a chair and being held at gunpoint.  
           George squats, meeting the woman at eye level.  He addresses 
           her quietly, intimately.

                                 GEORGE
                        This your first robbery?

           The woman nods, shivering with fear.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        You’re doing great.  

           The sound of George’s voice has a calming effect on her.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me - I need you to stay 
                        calm.  Uncertainty causes panic, 
                        and panic causes problems.  So just 
                        relax and enjoy the show.

           The woman’s eyes linger on George, who turns and departs.

           A member of George’s crew shakes the manager, threatening to 
           hit him.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Easy.

           George approaches the bank manager, who stares at him in 
           defiant hatred.  

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        You’re that crook Jack Howard, 
                        aren’t you?

           George snaps open his revolver, demonstrating it’s loaded.

                                 BANK MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got a family.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m not going to hurt you.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        You’re not?
           George whispers so only the bank manager can hear him.

                                 GEORGE
                        If I threaten you and you open the 
                        door, it makes you look like a 
                        coward.  And you don’t strike me 
                        like a coward.  But what I am going 
                        to do if you don’t help me is shoot 
                        that young woman over there in the 
                        heart.  So you’ve got two choices - 
                        either sacrifice a young woman’s 
                        life for some fat-cat’s money and 
                        live out the rest of your life in 
                        shame, or save her life and be the 
                        hero.  You got 5 seconds to decide.   

           INT. BYRNES’ OFFICE, THE TOMBS - DAY

           Byrnes reads the cover story on the New York Times:  “HOWARD 
           GANG PULLS OFF LARGEST HEIST IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY - FEMALE 
           TELLER KIDNAPPED.”

           EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

           George steps out of a hotel room, suitcase in hand.  He casts 
           a glance back at the teller sprawled on his bed, her nude 
           body covered in fig leaves of cash.

           INT. BYRNES’ OFFICE, THE TOMBS - DAY

           As Byrnes sets down the paper, he picks up the next one:  
           “BANK ROBBERY IN DENVER BELIEVED TO BE INSIDE JOB”.  Byrnes 
           uses a sharp buck-knife to carve out the article.

                                 CLUBBER
                        Howard’s not our problem anymore.  
                        I thought Marm’s organization was 
                        our priority.  

                                 BYRNES
                        My wife says I need a hobby.

           Byrnes places the clipping in a drawer overflowing with 
           articles about bank robberies.

           EXT. BANK - NIGHT

           SUPER:  CHICAGO - 1872
           A lookout at the end of the snowy block flashes a lantern 
           twice at George, who paints a large circle of clear jellied 
           alcohol around two wooden handles adhered to a bank window.   

           George ignites the jelly, which burns faintly.  He then grabs 
           the handles and nods to a man next to him.  The man splashes 
           a bucket of cold water on the window, extinguishing the 
           flames.  George tugs, and the circle of glass clicks out as 
           if it were removed with a diamond cutter.

           The shadowy crew pours through the hole into the dark bank.

           INT. BANK - NIGHT

           SUPER:  BOSTON - 1875

           A NIGHT WATCHMAN whistles as he wanders through the bank by 
           lantern-light.  He suddenly stops whistling at the sight of 
           the vault door open.  

           The man nervously enters the silent, pitch-black vault.  His 
           light falls on FOUR MEN STANDING PERFECTLY STILL in various 
           states of robbing the vault, staring back at him.  The 
           watchman fumbles for his gun.  CLICK...

                                 GEORGE
                        I wouldn’t do that.

           The man looks to see George squatted over a sack of cash, 
           pointing his revolver at the watchman.

           INT. BYRNES APARTMENT - DAY

           Exhausted, Byrnes struggles to eat breakfast as his daughters 
           eat oatmeal at the other seats, making a mess.  Byrnes’ 
           oldest daughter sees him rubbing his eyes, concerned for him.

           Ophelia enters, tossing a paper on the table next to him.

                                 OPHELIA
                        You see they found Boss Tweed 
                        hiding out in Spain?

           Byrnes perks up as Ophelia cleans up the youngest daughter.  

                                 BYRNES
                        How’d they know it was him?

                                 OPHELIA
                        Spanish authorities recognized him 
                        from a Thomas Nast cartoon.  
           Byrnes looks at the cartoon featuring a morbidly obese Boss 
           Tweed swallowing up New York City.

           INT. WALLING’S OFFICE, THE TOMBS - DAY

           Byrnes aggressively tries to sell Walling on an idea.  

                                 BYRNES
                        We’re cutting heads off a hydra.  
                        No matter how many arrests we make, 
                        the crooks can disappear back on 
                        the streets.  Jack Howard walked 
                        into a bank in San Francisco in 
                        broad daylight and not a single 
                        person can identify him.

                                 WALLING
                        That’s life in the big city, Tom.

                                 BYRNES
                        Doesn’t have to be.  

                                 WALLING
                        What are you proposing?

           Byrnes withdraws the photograph his wife gave him.

                                 BYRNES
                        Photography.  We make their faces 
                        known so they can’t hide.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BASEMENT, THE TOMBS - DAY

           Byrnes directs a nervous CAMERA OPERATOR as the Shadows 
           restrain Johnny Irving for his picture.  Johnny wrestles for 
           dear life to hide his face.  

           Clubber socks him in the gut as another Shadow yanks Johnny’s 
           hair back, revealing his face.  FLASH.

           INT. “ROGUE’S GALLERY”, THE TOMBS - DAY

           A Shadow escorts a WEALTHY WOMAN down a hallway lined with 
           mug shots - “The Rogue’s Gallery”.  We see the familiar faces 
           of George’s crew - Shang Draper, Red Leary, Abe Coakley, 
           Jimmy Hope, and Charlie Bullard.  But no George Leslie.

           The woman points to the photo of Johnny.
                                 WEALTHY WOMAN
                        That’s the man who pickpocketed me.

           INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

           SUPER:  PHILADELPHIA - 1876

           George drinks coffee with TWO CROOKS who wear ill-fitting 
           clothing.  He observes through the glass storefront as a 
           SECURITY GUARD stands watch outside a bank across the street.  

                                 CROOK
                        The guard we bought is on duty this 
                        Sunday.

                                 GEORGE
                        There’s only twenty grand in the 
                        vault.

                                 CROOK
                        How the hell do you know that?

                                 GEORGE
                        Because every Friday, the manager 
                        sends a telegram with the bank 
                        holdings to the insurance company.

           INSERT:  George hangs off a telegraph pole with a belt and 
           spiked boots as he eavesdrops on the Morse Code, marking down 
           the slashes and dots.

                                 CROOK
                        To hell with that - you already 
                        have the combo to the vault.  Give 
                        it to us.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Marm explained my services.  You 
                        brought me in because I’m the best.

           George hands the men the bag with his equipment.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Monitor the cables until the score 
                        is right.  

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           George walks down a residential street, when a young boy 
           emerges, pretending to shoot George with a wooden gun.  
           George buckles over, feigning a dramatic death.  
           He collapses on the ground in his expensive suit, then looks 
           up at the barrel of the wooden gun pointed at his forehead.  

                                 GEORGE
                        You got me, Sheriff.

           The boy runs away and George looks up to see a pretty young 
           woman in her 20s - MOLLY - sitting on the steps outside a 
           large home.  Her plain cotton dress is at odds with the 
           affluent neighborhood.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you know any good restaurants 
                        in this city?

                                 MOLLY
                        I hear the Tavern’s good, but I’ve 
                        never been.

           George dusts himself off, taking a second look at Molly.

                                 GEORGE
                        You waitin’ for a train?

           Molly laughs.

                                 MOLLY
                        The boy’s mother locked us out. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Locked you out?

                                 MOLLY
                        She falls asleep when she drinks 
                        too much.

                                 GEORGE
                        What kind of locks they got on this 
                        place?

                                 MOLLY
                             (confused)
                        What kind of locks?

                                 GEORGE
                        Chain lock?  Dead bolt?  Warded 
                        lock with a key?

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s got a chain and a key lock.

                                 GEORGE
                        Come on.  
           George walks past her up the steps. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        What’s your name?

                                 MOLLY
                        Molly.  What are you doing?

           George examines the lock.

                                 GEORGE
                        Can I see your hairpin?

           Molly hands George a pin, watching nervously as he bends it 
           and inserts it in the lock, feeling for the tumblers.  

                                 MOLLY
                        You a thief?

           George fidgets with the lock, which releases.  The door opens 
           two inches, stopped by a chain.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Architect.  

                                 MOLLY
                             (suspicious)
                        They teach locks in architecture 
                        school?

                                 GEORGE
                        Same principles.

           George feels through the crack, touching the bolted chain... 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        If I can open this door, you have 
                        to join me for dinner at the 
                        Tavern.  

                                 MOLLY
                        If you’re a thief, I’m going to 
                        scream.

                                 GEORGE
                        Got any thread?

           Against her better judgement, Molly hands George a spool of 
           thread from her purse.  George ties the thread around the 
           hairpin, then feeds the thread over the top of the door.  He 
           snags the pin underneath the chain, then uses the thread like 
           a fishing line to drag the bolt to the opening.  Click...
                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be by at 7.

                                 MOLLY
                        Wait, what’s your name?

           George stumbles on the question, wondering which life she 
           will inhabit - Jack Howard or George Leslie.  Then...

                                 GEORGE
                        George Leslie.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Inside the window, George and Molly eat dinner at a cozy 
           candle-lit restaurant.  Molly smiles and touches her hair.  

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           George watches Molly as she eats.

                                 GEORGE
                        Were you born here?

                                 MOLLY
                        Ireland - my parents came over 
                        during the Famine when I was six.  
                        My father read about the Gold Rush - 
                        he thought we were gonna go to 
                        California and be rich.   

                                 GEORGE
                        Where are they now?

                                 MOLLY
                        They got typhus on the boat over.  
                        They’re buried down the road.     

                                 GEORGE
                        Sorry to hear that.

                                 MOLLY
                        What’s past is past.  I have plenty 
                        to be thankful for.
                             (beat)
                        You ever been out west, George?

                                 GEORGE
                        Been to Seattle, San Francisco, Los 
                        Angeles, Denver, Salt Lake...
                                 MOLLY
                        You went to all those places?

                                 GEORGE
                        A few others as well...

                                 MOLLY
                        Don’t gather much moss, do you?

                                 GEORGE
                        I’ve got nothing tying me down.

                                 MOLLY
                        I used to dream of going to San 
                        Francisco.  See the waves...see the 
                        sun melt in the Pacific.  Guess 
                        life had other plans.  

                                 GEORGE
                        You can still go.  What’s stopping 
                        you?

                                 MOLLY
                        Money.

           George pulls his wallet out and places $200 on the table.

                                 GEORGE
                        Now what’s stopping you?

           Molly eyes the money with concern, doesn’t take it.

                                 MOLLY
                        Some things are best left as 
                        dreams.

                                 GEORGE
                        You really believe that?

                                 MOLLY
                        Not all of us were born with a 
                        silver spoon.

                                 GEORGE
                        I showed up in New York with 
                        nothing but the clothes on my back.  
                        I earned everything I’ve got.  

           Molly can see George is upset.  Smiles. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Perhaps we should stick to less 
                        controversial topics.
           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           George walks Molly home.  She wears his coat over her 
           shoulders.

                                 MOLLY
                        How about you, George?  Do you have 
                        dreams?

                                 GEORGE
                        I do what I want, when I want.

                                 MOLLY
                        Come on - you must have some 
                        fantasy.  Someone you’d like to be -
                        - something you’d like to see.

           George considers.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’d like to see the corn fields 
                        again.

                                 MOLLY
                             (laughing)
                        Corn?!

                                 GEORGE
                        Where I grew up, the corn was so 
                        tall you could disappear in it.  My 
                        family had a farm.  I still see it 
                        in my sleep. 

                                 MOLLY
                        What happened to it?

           George stumbles on the painful memory.

                                 GEORGE
                        It's gone now.

           Molly stops outside her door, taking his hand.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Someday you’ll see the corn again, 
                        George.

           She kisses George on the cheek, then turns to go inside.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I want to see you again.

                                 MOLLY
                        What’s stopping you?
           As Molly slips inside the door, George catches a glimpse of 
           numerous women sleeping in bunkbeds.  The door shuts, sealing 
           him out. 

           INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

           George looks out the window, lost in thought as a young 
           family walks past.   

           The moment is interrupted as the crooks approach George’s 
           table, sliding a scrap of paper with Morse Code scrawled on 
           it.   

                                 GEORGE
                        Not yet.  

                                 CROOK
                        What are we waiting for?

           George pauses, his mind elsewhere.

                                 GEORGE
                        The score’s not right.

           EXT. MOLLY’S RESIDENCE - DAY

           Molly opens the door to find a box on the stoop with a note.  
           She opens the box, withdrawing an elegant dress.

           INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

           Molly sits beside George in a box, watching La Traviata.  As 
           Molly watches, she slides her hand on top of George’s.  
           George turns, but Molly is focused on the show.

           INT. PHILADELPHIA MUSEUM OF ART - DAY

           George and Molly enter the Impressionist exhibit.  George 
           looks up at the ceiling, infatuated with the vaulting 
           architecture of the new museum.  Molly elbows him playfully, 
           forcing his gaze to a Monet on the wall.

           EXT. CAFE - DAY

           George any Molly play chess at a cafe.  Molly tips George’s 
           king, uncertain if he let her win.  
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           George approaches a kid at a newspaper stand as Molly thumbs 
           through periodicals on display.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hey sport - you got the new 
                        Scientific American?

           As the kid digs for the paper, George spots the front page of 
           the Philadelphia Inquirer:  “CORNELIUS VANDERBILT BUILDING 
           HIS OWN BANK IN NEW YORK”.  

           George casts a glance at Molly, forced to make a choice.  

           INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

           George sips a cup of coffee as he studies the article, having 
           finally found his white whale.  The frustrated crook slides a 
           folded scrap of paper to George.  

           Without opening it, George lowers the newspaper, ready to 
           return to New York.

                                 GEORGE
                        We go Sunday night.

           EXT. FAIRMOUNT PARK, PHILADELPHIA - DAY

           George lies on his back in the grass underneath the cherry 
           blossom trees, tossing an apple to himself, as Molly rests 
           her head on his stomach, reading Around the World in Eighty 
           Days by Jules Verne.

           George is lost in thought.

                                 GEORGE
                        My job here is almost finished.  
                        I’m gonna have to go back soon.

           Molly tries to hide her heartbreak.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Maybe you can send me a letter.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m thinking about making a change.  
                        No more travel - just focus on my 
                        work in New York.
                                 MOLLY
                        Start gathering moss like the rest 
                        of us?

           George hesitates on his next question, then...

                                 GEORGE
                        What if I took you there?

           Molly rolls over next to George on her stomach - doesn’t want 
           him to think she’s that easy.  She mocks him...

                                 MOLLY
                        Dashing young architect come to 
                        sweep Cinderella off her feet.  Is 
                        that what this is?

           George touches her hair.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hell no.  I’ll put you to work as 
                        my housekeeper.  Long hours and 
                        shit for pay.  

           Molly smacks George with her book as he rolls on top of her.  
           He pauses, looking into her eyes.  

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Come with me to New York.  

                                 MOLLY
                        My life is here...

                                 GEORGE
                        Name one thing in this city you 
                        can’t walk away from.

           Molly pulls George close, kissing him.

           INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

           George and Molly stand before a judge in his empty chambers.  
           George is wearing a suit and Molly is in a simple white 
           dress.  George slides a gold band on her finger.

           INT. TRINITY CHURCH - DAY

           Byrnes sits between his wife and his daughters in the pews.  
           He stretches his bloody knuckles, stiff from late nights 
           knocking against the jaws of men.

           A REVEREND recites from the Book of John in the background.
                                 REVEREND
                        If we claim we have no sin, we 
                        deceive ourselves, and are not 
                        living in the truth...

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. BASEMENT, THE TOMBS - NIGHT

           A CRIMINAL looks up from the interrogation chair to see 
           Byrnes approaching.  

                                 REVEREND (V.O.)
                        If we confess our sins to him, he 
                        is faithful and just to forgive us, 
                        and to cleanse us from our 
                        wickedness...

           Byrnes begins hammering the man in a series of QUICK SHOTS.

                                 REVEREND
                        If we say that we haven’t sinned, 
                        we make him a liar, and the Lord’s 
                        word is not in us.

           The man lies unconscious sprawled on the floor, still tied to 
           the chair as Byrnes stands over him...

           INT. TRINITY CHURCH - DAY

           Byrnes looks down at his daughter, who takes his hand in 
           hers, loving him unconditionally.

           EXT. MANSION - DAY

           George picks the lock on the door of a large mansion on Fifth 
           Avenue as Molly watches nervously.

                                 MOLLY
                        George, what are you doing?!

           George opens the door and pushes inside.  Molly follows, 
           finding the home empty...except for dozens of roses.  

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Whose house is this?

           George withdraws a key with a bow from his pocket.

                                 GEORGE
                        Ours.
           INT. LESLIE MANSION - DAY

           Molly oversees as the finest furniture money can buy is 
           delivered to the Leslie Mansion.

           INT. MANDELBAUM STORE - DAY

           Marm welcomes George into her store, walking through the 
           hallways of the pilfered Versailles.

                                 MARM
                        Congratulations on the marriage.  
                        I’d like to meet her sometime.

           George doesn’t like Marm discussing his personal life.

                                 GEORGE
                        I saw Vanderbilt’s consolidating 
                        his money in a new bank.  

                                 MARM
                        It’s because of you - everyone 
                        knows the existing banks aren’t 
                        safe with Jack Howard on the loose.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I read it’s gonna house the largest 
                        fortune in history.

                                 MARM
                        It’s impenetrable.  Besides, we had 
                        a rule about operating in New York.  
                        Only do your legitimate business 
                        here. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Vanderbilt’s where this started.  
                        I’m taking that bank - then I’m 
                        finished.

           Marm considers...  

                                 MARM
                        If you’re going to do this, there’s 
                        something you should know.  There’s 
                        a cop here whose been following the 
                        Jack Howard robberies - and he 
                        thinks you’re connected.  

           Marm hands George a dossier with a photograph of Byrnes.

                                 GEORGE
                        We’ve dealt with cops before.
                                 MARM
                        Not like this.  Decorated war hero.  
                        The man takes scalps.  They even 
                        got a name for the bruises he gives 
                        people when he tortures confessions 
                        out of them - “Third Degree Burns” - 
                        pun on his last name.  Might be the 
                        only man more dedicated to 
                        excellence than yourself, and he‘s 
                        under the misguided impression that 
                        New York can be an honest town.  

                                 GEORGE
                        What’ll he cost?

                                 MARM
                        Unlike everything else in this 
                        city, he’s not for sale.

           INT. BYRNES APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Byrnes enters the apartment, taking his coat off as his 
           daughters prepare for bed.

                                 GIRLS
                        Daddy’s home!

                                 OPHELIA
                        Don’t normally see you before the 
                        girls go down.

           Byrnes plays it cool, as if this isn’t the biggest day of his 
           life.

                                 BYRNES
                        Got off early.  Inspector Walling 
                        got promoted to Superintendent.  

                                 OPHELIA
                        Who’s going to run the Detective 
                        Bureau?

                                 BYRNES
                        Me.

                                 OPHELIA
                        Are you serious..?

                                 BYRNES
                        We’ve got a reservation at 
                        Delmonico’s tomorrow to celebrate.

           Ophelia is speechless as Byrnes turns to his daughters.
                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        Come on, girls.  You want daddy to 
                        read you a bed-time story?  

           Byrnes sits in the arm-chair as the girls pile on top of him.  
           His three-year-old girl approaches holding a book.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Read this one.

           INT. BYRNES APARTMENT - LATER

           Ophelia washes dishes as she listens to Byrnes read a story 
           to the girls.  In spite of his many shortcomings as a father, 
           Byrnes is a natural at bed-time stories. 

                                 BYRNES
                        ...and then Robin Hood went to the 
                        Sheriff of Nottingham and said, 
                        “Sheriff, my Merry Men and I would 
                        like to apologize for our criminal 
                        ways.”  They realized then that the 
                        Sheriff was just trying to clean up 
                        Sherwood Forest from low-life 
                        bandits like Robin.

           The girls realize their dad is changing the outcome.

                                 OLDER DAUGHTER
                        Dad!!  That’s not how it goes!  

           Ophelia smiles in spite of herself. 

           INT. BYRNES APARTMENT - LATER

           Ophelia comes out to see Byrnes sound asleep in the armchair 
           under a pile of sleeping girls and stuffed animals.  She 
           considers putting them to bed, then extinguishes the lantern.

           INT. DELMONICO’S - NIGHT

           Waiters dressed in white waistcoats and gloves move like 
           choreographed dancers, balancing trays filled with food and 
           expensive bottles of wine.  This is America’s first fine 
           dining establishment, and the finest in the world in its day.

           Byrnes and Ophelia are shown to their table by a waiter.  All 
           of the other tables are filled with the boisterous, 
           intoxicated upper-class of New York who effortlessly inhale 
           fortunes of food and wine.  
           Ophelia takes note of the pretty young women draped in 
           diamonds and their May-December romances with the wealthy 
           patriarchs of the city.  

           Byrnes reaches to pull Ophelia’s chair out for her, but the 
           waiter steps in.

                                 WAITER
                        Allow me, sir.

           Byrnes is uncomfortable, not knowing the rules of this world 
           as the waiters pull both their chairs, seating them.

           The waiter then places a napkin on Byrnes’ lap.  Byrnes 
           doesn’t like being fussed over.

                                 WAITER (CONT’D)
                        Would you like something to drink?

                                 OPHELIA
                        Red wine please.  Whatever’s the 
                        least expensive.

                                 WAITER
                        And for you, sir?

                                 BYRNES
                        Have you got beer?

                                 WAITER
                        No, but we have champagne on ice.

                                 BYRNES
                        Ice - it’s August?

                                 WAITER
                        Imported from Norway.

                                 BYRNES
                        Water’s good.  

           Byrnes realizes even that might break the bank - clarifies...

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        No ice.

           The waiter departs.

                                 OPHELIA
                        Are you sure we can afford this?

                                 BYRNES
                        I’m quite certain we can’t.
           They take note of the vast array of cutlery of every shape 
           and size laid our before them - weapons of class distinction 
           made of delicately etched sterling.

                                 OPHELIA
                        Which ones are we supposed to use 
                        first?

                                 BYRNES
                        I don’t know - I feel like I’m in a 
                        torture chamber.

           A waiter arrives with a bottle of Moet Imperial champagne.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t order this.

                                 WAITER
                        From the man in the corner.  He 
                        wanted to congratulate you on your 
                        promotion.

           Byrnes turns to see George and Molly eating dinner.  His mood 
           darkens at the criminal lavishing expensive gifts on him.

                                 OPHELIA
                        Should we go thank them?

                                 BYRNES
                             (to waiter)
                        Send it back.

                                 OPHELIA
                        Tom...

                                 WAITER
                        The gentleman insisted.

           The waiter departs.  Byrnes seethes.

                                 BYRNES
                        I’m an officer of the law.  Do you 
                        know what this looks like?

           Byrnes tosses his napkin on the table in front of him.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        It’s bad enough that I’m eating in 
                        a place like this.

           Ophelia can sense her husband’s mood darkening.

           ACROSS THE ROOM:  George sits with Molly, dissecting a giant 
           rib-eye slathered in hollandaise.  
           Byrnes appears, placing the bottle of champagne on the table.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        I can’t accept this.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re too humble, Inspector.  You 
                        should be celebrating.

           Byrnes is visibly uncomfortable as George puts on the charm.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I’d like you to meet my wife --

                                 BYRNES
                             (cutting him off)
                        Molly.  A pleasure.

                                 GEORGE
                        You must be Ophelia.  

           Byrnes turns, perturbed to see his wife standing next to him.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Glad to see you got a night away 
                        from the girls.  

                                 OPHELIA
                        How do you two know each other?

                                 GEORGE
                        Tom’s been inquiring about my 
                        services.

                                 OPHELIA
                        What line of work are you in?

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m an architect.  

                                 BYRNES
                        Banks mostly.  

           Ophelia tries to break the awkward moment of silence.

                                 OPHELIA
                        Any recommendations for food?

                                 MOLLY
                        Everything is delicious, but it’s 
                        all French so you’ll need a cart to 
                        get home.
                                 OPHELIA
                        How often do you come here?

                                 MOLLY
                             (embarrassed)
                        A lot.

                                 OPHELIA
                        You must have a good nanny.

           The question strikes a nerve with Molly.

                                 MOLLY
                        We don’t have any children.  

                                 OPHELIA
                        You’re still young.

                                 MOLLY
                        We’ve tried.

           Ophelia can sense Molly’s sadness.  Both women could use a 
           friend.

                                 OPHELIA
                        Would you care to join us?

           George interjects, knowing this will not end well.

                                 GEORGE
                        We’d hate to meddle in your 
                        affairs.

           George raises a glass, meeting eyes with Byrnes.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        To New York’s finest.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Johnny Irving lies on a mattress on the floor with a cord 
           wrapped around his arm and a needle on the table next to him.  
           The room is filled with drowsy prostitutes who share his 
           taste for escape.  Though Johnny is only in his early 20s, 
           years of living hard and shooting up or smoking anything he 
           can get his hands on have aged him prematurely.   

           Johnny opens his eyes to see George sitting in a chair, 
           watching him.  One of Johnny’s eyes is black and blue.

                                 GEORGE
                        What happened to your face?
           Johnny rises, scratching his head as he gets his bearings.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Bastard Byrnes.  Papers say you 
                        been busy.
                             (resenting George 
                              abandoning him)
                        Must be nice.

                                 GEORGE
                        Where’s Babe?  I heard she stopped 
                        going to the school.

                                 JOHNNY
                        She’s working for Shang.

           George’s heart sinks.  As he turns to leave, he snaps his 
           hand down, catching Johnny’s hand in his pocket.  

           The two men meet eyes, both aware Johnny has lost his edge.

                                 GEORGE
                        Get yourself cleaned up.  We got a 
                        job. 

           EXT. BOWERY - NIGHT

           SUPER:  FIVE POINTS

           George cautiously walks through the Bowery section of the 
           Five Points, the worst neighborhood in the history of 
           America.  A nightmarish Gomorrah conjured up by a feverish 
           brain.  Victims of the grinding poverty fulfill the only 
           destinies they could given their birth.  

           George passes soot-covered, hollow-faced families cooking in 
           the doorways of tenements and scraping out their squalid 
           existence against the soundtrack of raucous taverns, 
           dogfights, and nightwalkers plying their trade. 

           INT. SHANG DRAPER’S BROTHEL - NIGHT

           George enters Shang Draper’s brothel, internalizing for the 
           first time the ugly face of the Faustian bargain he made when 
           he partnered with his crew.  

           Shang is nowhere to be seen.  Spotting the dapper young 
           architect, the working girls in the lobby perk up.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m looking for Babe.
           One of the prostitutes nods toward the stairs.

           INT. SHANG DRAPER’S BROTHEL - MOMENTS LATER

           George walks up the lamp-lit staircase, approaching a closed 
           door.  Inside, he can hear the GRUNTS of a john.  George 
           opens the door to see Babe (now 17) lying unconscious on the 
           bed as a man twice George’s size hammers away at her.

                                 MAN
                        Get the hell out...

           No sooner do the words leave his mouth than George is on him, 
           tossing the man across the room, smashing against the wall. 

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        Son of a bitch!

           The man pulls his pants up, attacking George.  They trade 
           blows in a chaotic, frenzied fight that quickly goes the 
           floor as Babe lies motionless in the bed.  

           The large man overpowers George, straddling him as he chokes 
           the life out of George.  George claws at the man’s arms, his 
           face going red.  

           At the last moment, George yanks the man’s unbuckled belt 
           from his pants and slaps it around the man’s neck.  George 
           yanks to the side, smashing the man’s head into a table.   

           As the man rises, George kicks him in the face, sprawling him 
           in a bloody mess.

           Adrenaline coursing through his veins, George covers Babe.  
           He takes note of the tattered copy of Alice’s Adventures in 
           Wonderland next to a bottle on the bedside table.  George 
           checks the bottle’s label - LAUDANUM.  Babe can barely speak, 
           half in another world.

                                 BABE
                        Where’d you go, George?

           INT. SHANG DRAPER’S BROTHEL - MOMENTS LATER

           George helps Babe down the stairs.  As he passes through the 
           lobby, he is confronted by Shang, who wields a knife.

                                 SHANG
                        That’s my business you got there.

           George reaches in his coat.  Shang raises the knife.
                                 SHANG (CONT’D)
                        Easy, boyo.

           George withdraws a stack of bills, slapping them on a table.  
           He pushes past Shang without a word.

                                 SHANG (CONT’D)
                        She’ll be back.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL - NIGHT

           George tucks Babe under the covers.  She grabs his shirt.

                                 BABE
                        Don’t leave me.

           George places a stack of money next to her.

                                 GEORGE
                        This is two thousand dollars.  
                        In the morning, I want you to leave 
                        New York.  Don’t tell anyone where 
                        you’re going.  Find a new life 
                        somewhere far away. 

                                 BABE
                        I can’t go anywhere else.  New York 
                        is my home.

           George looks at her sadly.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m sorry.

           George closes the door, leaving Babe more alone than ever.

           INT. JIM FISK’S OFFICE - DAY

           Fisk paces madly in his admiral costume, fidgeting to light a 
           cigar as he has a total melt-down.  

                                 FISK
                        Thoreau had it right.  We should 
                        all fuck off and live in the woods.

           George sits on the couch, confused by Fisk’s behavior.

                                 GEORGE
                        What’s going on?
                                 FISK
                        Josie - that black widow.  She and 
                        that grifter Ned Stokes are 
                        blackmailing me.

                                 GEORGE
                        Blackmailing you?

                                 FISK
                        They’re going to publish love 
                        letters I wrote to Josie in the 
                        newspaper.  They aim to ruin my 
                        reputation.  

                                 GEORGE
                        What are you gonna do?

                                 FISK
                        I already paid them half a million.  
                        Now they want more.  Finally had to 
                        tell the cops - they’ve got a 
                        warrant out for Ned’s arrest.  I 
                        should have never gotten involved 
                        with that gold-digging bitch.   

           Suddenly, a rock smashes through the window.  Fisk races to 
           the window and looks down. 

                                 FISK (CONT’D)
                        Son of a bitch Ned Stokes!

           Fisk seizes his saber off the wall and heads downstairs.

                                 GEORGE
                        What the hell are you doing?

           George follows as Fisk rushes downstairs.  BANG!

           EXT. TRINITY CHURCH - SAME TIME

           Byrnes steps out of church with his family, hearing the 
           GUNSHOT in the distance.  Byrnes trades a look with Ophelia, 
           then takes off toward the sound as Ophelia watches, afraid 
           for her husband.

           INT. LOBBY, OPERA HOUSE - SAME TIME

           George arrives to see Ned holding a smoking gun.  Fisk 
           staggers toward Ned, staining Ned’s shirt with bloody hands 
           as he collapses at Ned’s feet.  Ned bolts.
           George rushes to Fisk’s aid.  Fisk gushes blood on the carpet 
           like a harpooned seal.

                                 FISK
                        I put on a bloody good show, didn’t 
                        I?  

           Anger welling inside him, George draws the gun Marm gave him 
           and takes off after Ned.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           George sprints after Ned, who knocks pedestrians as he flees. 

           INT. LOBBY, OPERA HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Byrnes rushes into the doorway to see showgirls crying over 
           Fisk’s body.  

                                 BYRNES
                        Which way did he go?

           EXT. DOWNTOWN - CONTINUOUS

           Byrnes runs down the street.  Though he is built like a bear, 
           he has the ground speed to match.  Byrnes reads the panicked 
           crowd, trying to divine which way the killer went.  

           Ned slams off a wall as he cuts into an alley.  George is in 
           hot pursuit.

           George loses sight of Ned.  When he emerges from the alley, 
           Ned is gone, but the newly constructed Grand Central Depot 
           towers before him.

           George dodges a streetcar and heads for the depot.

           INT. HEAD HOUSE, GRAND CENTRAL DEPOT - NIGHT

           Ned barges through the ornate train depot, bowling over 
           passengers.  He looks back in panic to see George leaping 
           over seats, looking more like a cop than an architect.

           INT. TRAIN SHED, GRAND CENTRAL DEPOT - NIGHT

           George rushes into the train shed, where the rows of giant 
           steel trains snort out bursts of steam like sleeping beasts. 
           The room is covered by a vaulting metal and glass ceiling.  
           George catches the flicker of a man’s shadow in a plume of 
           steam and chases after it. 

           INT. HEAD HOUSE, GRAND CENTRAL DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Byrnes rushes against the tide of screaming and fleeing 
           citizens as he enters the train station.

           INT. TRAIN SHED, GRAND CENTRAL DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           All is silent except George’s breath and the gusts of steam 
           as he hunts for Ned.  George drops to his belly and scans the 
           undercarriage of the trains, spotting a pair of feet several 
           rows over.  George fires a shot, which PINGS off a train.

           Byrnes hops down onto the tracks, hearing a SHOT ring out.  
           He raises his gun, complete situational awareness.

           George follows the CLICKING of Ned’s boots on the stone.

           Ned slips between a gap in the cars.  He looks back to see 
           George in pursuit and fires a wild SHOT.

           Byrnes rushes through the steam as he closes in on his prey.  
           Byrnes hears a burst of steam and turns to see the silhouette 
           of a man holding a gun at the end of his row.  He brings in 
           the slack on his trigger as the smoke clears, revealing...

           ...George Leslie, gun aimed at Byrnes.  George lowers his 
           gun, but Byrnes doesn’t.  

           Suddenly, George feels the cold steel of Ned’s gun pressed to 
           the back of his head.  Byrnes was aiming at Ned, not George. 

                                 NED
                        Drop your gun!

           Without hesitation, Byrnes pulls the trigger, ending Ned as 
           blood flecks George’s face.

           George meets eyes with the reaper - smoke still curling from 
           Byrnes’ pistol.  

           INT. GEORGE LESLIE’S ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - LATER

           Byrnes takes a seat in George’s office as George uses a 
           marble basin and mirror against the wall to wash the dried 
           blood from his face, his hands unsteady.  In the reflection, 
           he catches Byrnes taking inventory of the architectural 
           diagrams that paper the walls of the office.
                                 BYRNES
                        You make all these?

           George dries his face, playing it cool in spite of the fact 
           he knows this man is hunting him.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah.

                                 BYRNES
                        Romanesque?

                                 GEORGE
                        Beaux-Arts mostly.  New York wants 
                        to look like Paris, and Paris wants 
                        to look like ancient Greece.

           Byrnes is out of his depth - tries to get the conversation 
           back on his terms.

                                 BYRNES
                        Nice girl, Molly - better than that 
                        whore Josie.  That girl was dirty 
                        as a theater seat.  We've got her 
                        under arrest for extorting Fisk. 

                                 GEORGE
                        She’s not my concern.

           George takes a seat across from Byrnes.  Silent - seeing what 
           play Byrnes is going to make. 

                                 BYRNES
                        I know you’re working for Howard. 

                                 GEORGE
                             (re: diagrams)
                        As you can see, I’m too busy to rob 
                        banks.

                                 BYRNES
                        A man can live two lives.

                                 GEORGE
                        You speaking from experience?

           Byrnes knows he’s rhetorically out-matched, but he’s got the 
           truth on his side.

                                 BYRNES
                        I checked the bank records in that 
                        Ocean Bank Heist in ‘68.  You made 
                        a sizable deposit days before the 
                        robbery. 
                                 GEORGE
                        Got unlucky with that one.

                                 BYRNES
                        Got unlucky with a few others too - 
                        San Francisco, Philadelphia, 
                        Chicago.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I heard the Ocean Bank 
                        investigation was closed.

                                 BYRNES
                        Not for me.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Heard that too.

           Byrnes glares at George.

                                 BYRNES
                        Whatever you think you’re doing, 
                        you’re through.  I’m going to clean 
                        this city up.

                                 GEORGE
                        Only way to clean this city up is 
                        to burn it down first.  

                                 BYRNES
                        My daughters deserve better than 
                        that.

                                 GEORGE
                        You really think you can make a 
                        difference?

                                 BYRNES
                        If not me, who?

           George pours two lowballs of bourbon.

                                 GEORGE
                        From what I hear, cops in this city 
                        are just lookin’ to make a buck 
                        like everyone else.  

                                 BYRNES
                        Some are.  But those days are 
                        numbered.  And so are yours.
                                 GEORGE
                        We both know you have no case.  If 
                        you did, we wouldn’t be having this 
                        little tea party.

           Byrnes withdraws a penny from his pocket.

                                 BYRNES
                        You know how to make a coin stand 
                        on its end?

           George looks at the penny - doesn’t bite.

                                 GEORGE
                        You here to do parlor tricks?

                                 BYRNES
                        I'm telling you that no matter how 
                        impossible a task may seem, I've 
                        found there's always a way.

           George knows Byrnes’ modus operandi all too well.

                                 GEORGE
                        Even if it includes beating a man.

                                 BYRNES
                        Sometimes violence is the only 
                        solution.

                                 GEORGE
                        What do you want from me?

                                 BYRNES
                        I want a confession.  Give me Jack 
                        Howard and I’ll make sure you get a 
                        fair shake.

           George realizes this man can’t help him untie the Gordian 
           Knot of his life.

                                 GEORGE
                        Sorry - I can’t help you.

           Byrnes stands the coin on it’s side and flicks it, leaving it 
           spinning on George’s desk as he rises to leave. 

                                 BYRNES
                        There’s always a way.

           INT. WALLING’S OFFICE, THE TOMBS - DAY

           Byrnes consults with Walling, who sits at his desk, annoyed.
                                 BYRNES
                        I want to reopen the Jack Howard 
                        case.

                                 WALLING
                        Christ, Tom.  Those robberies are 7 
                        years old.  I brought you on 
                        because you are a stubborn son of a 
                        bitch, but this is a waste of time.   

                                 BYRNES
                        Howard’s been robbing banks all 
                        over the country, and I think 
                        George Leslie is working for him.  

                                 WALLING
                        You think a society man is riding 
                        trains around the country robbing 
                        banks?!  Have you lost your mind?!

                                 BYRNES
                        I’ve got evidence.

                                 WALLING
                        Circumstantial!  I read his file.  
                        The man belongs to the best 
                        gentlemen’s clubs in the city.  He 
                        goes to theater openings and art 
                        exhibitions. For Christ’s sake, 
                        Tom, he shops at Brooks Brothers! 

                                 BYRNES
                        He’s involved.  It’s only a matter 
                        of time until they strike again.

                                 WALLING
                        I will not allow you to bring that 
                        kind of heat on this department 
                        over some hare-brained hunch.

                                 BYRNES
                        Just let me bring him in for 
                        questioning.

           Walling knows what ‘questioning’ means...

                                 WALLING
                        Get it through your thick Irish 
                        skull!  You rough him up and we're 
                        gonna have the mayor down here 
                        barking up our ass. 

                                 BYRNES
                        He’s paying off the mayor?!
                                 WALLING
                        No, he built his damn house!  
                             (gathering himself)
                        I can give you rope, Tom, but not 
                        that much.  Stay away from the 
                        architect.  

           EXT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION CONTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           George stands outside the construction site, taking note of 
           the workers pouring concrete.  He examines a stack of 
           imported Italian marble blocks, using a tailor's tape to 
           measure one.  

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           George briefs the crew as they huddle around a table.  He 
           points to an architectural diagram.  

                                 GEORGE

           Mirroring the opening of the film, the camera moves along the 
           atrium of the cathedral of greed...

                        Impossible.  Beneath the stone is 
                        three feet of concrete.

                        What about the vault door.

           Gliding toward the vault - a ponderous labyrinth of bolts and 
           locks set in an impregnable titanic steel door.

                        And the lock?

           George looks up, confident.

                                 GEORGE 
                        A lock’s a lock.

           George sketches at his desk.

                        Life’s been good to you, George.  

           George looks up to see Marm, uncomfortable with the trespass 
           into his legitimate life.

                                 GEORGE
                        The gift is nothing without the 
                        work.

                                 MARM
                        How’s the Vanderbilt job coming?

                                 GEORGE
                        Bank opens in three weeks.

                                 MARM
                        I have another job for you first.  
                        Word is Dexter Savings Bank will be 
                        holding a sizable amount of 
                        government cash.  

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t want government cash.   

                                 MARM
                        But you do want me to finance your 
                        Vanderbilt job, and that costs 
                        money.

                                 GEORGE
                        The crew’s sloppy.  We barely have 
                        time to prepare as it is.
                                 MARM
                        I’m a businesswoman, and I will not 
                        let a score like this slip through 
                        my fingers.

                                 GEORGE
                        When’s the job?

                                 MARM
                        Night after tomorrow.

                                 GEORGE
                        There’s no way I can get the Joker 
                        installed by then.

           Marm picks up a photo of Molly off the desk, running her 
           fingers across it.  

                                 MARM
                        Then improvise.  Do a hard hit if 
                        you have to.

                                 GEORGE
                        A hard hit?!  Are you out of your 
                        mind?  

                                 MARM
                        Watch your tone, kid.  If you want 
                        Vanderbilt, you do this for me 
                        first.

            Marm looks around the office. 

                                 MARM (CONT’D)
                        Maybe someday you can build a house 
                        for me.  Somethin’ classy.

           INT. DEXTER SAVINGS BANK - DAY

           SUPER:  DEXTER SAVINGS BANK - FEBRUARY 23, 1878

           A KNOCK at the front door.  The SECURITY GUARD goes to check 
           it out as the other employees close out the books.  

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        We’re closed.

           Suddenly, the lock is BLASTED out by a shotgun.  Two more 
           quick BLASTS blow out the hinges as the door is kicked in.

           The guard looks up to see the demonic porcelain smile of a 
           Japanese kabuki mask staring back it him - Shang Draper.  
           Shang smashes the man with the barrel of his rifle.  The man 
           stumbles back as the crew storms the bank, weapons up.

           George approaches the bank manager, J.W. BARRON.

                                 GEORGE
                        Mr. Barron, as the one man who 
                        knows the combination to the vault, 
                        I’ll need your assistance getting 
                        everyone out of this alive.

           A FEMALE BANK TELLER tries to flee as Red Leary tracks her 
           with his shotgun, identifiable by his shock of red hair 
           sticking out the top of his mask.  Just as he is about to 
           pull the trigger, George knocks the barrel down.  The gun 
           FIRES, sparking off the floor as the woman escapes.

                                 RED
                        She’ll run straight for the cops.

                                 GEORGE
                        Then we’ll work fast.

           Shang pistol-whips the bank manager George was speaking to, 
           then points the gun at his face. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Shang!

                                 SHANG
                             (ignoring George)
                        Open the god damn vault!

           The bank manager hesitates and Shang swings his weapon around 
           and shoots the guard in the chest, killing him.

           Shang pivots his gun back on the bank manager as George 
           points his gun at Shang.  Shang almost seems amused.

                                 SHANG (CONT’D)
                             (to bank manager)
                        Looks like you better open the 
                        vault or we both die, friend.

           The bank manager steps toward the vault, opening it.  Shang 
           turns to George, gloating.

                                 SHANG (CONT’D)
                        Good work, Georgie.  For a second I 
                        thought you were gonna shoot.

           The men rake mountains of cash off the tables, filling their 
           sacks.
           INT. SQUAD ROOM - SAME TIME

           A Shadow runs in, shouting to Byrnes and his men...

                                 SHADOW
                        Dexter Bank is being robbed!

           EXT. DEXTER SAVINGS BANK - SAME TIME

           George and his masked crew haul out the sacks of cash where 
           Johnny Irving is waiting with a horse-drawn sleigh.  The men 
           heft the sacks into the sleigh.

           BOOM!  A gunshot rings out, tearing one of the sacks.  George 
           looks up to see Byrnes approaching with his pistol raised, 
           flanked by his army of Shadows.

           George’s crew takes cover behind the sleigh as Byrnes and the 
           Shadows advance tactically down Wall Street.  

           George is pinned down behind the stone steps of the bank.  

           Byrnes and his crew leap-frog forward, alternating cover fire 
           like the trained soldiers they are.  Clubber takes cover.

                                 CLUBBER
                        Reloading.

           Another Shadow calls to Byrnes.

                                 SHADOW
                        Moving up.

           Byrnes lays down cover fire.

                                 BYRNES
                        Go!

           Down the street, George’s crew is out-manned and out-gunned, 
           a rag-tag guerilla squad against the most elite police unit 
           in the world.

           Byrnes sees a NEWSKID caught in the cross-fire.  He runs and 
           sweeps the boy up in his arms, delivering him to cover behind 
           a carriage on the opposite side of the street.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        Down that alley - run!

           The kid bolts as Byrnes returns to the war.
           Red Leary nails a long shot, striking one of the Shadows 
           through the neck.  The man clutches his wound, blood gushing 
           through his fingers.

           Byrnes looks over to see the man dead in a pool of blood.

           Overcome with rage, Byrnes advances like a force of nature, 
           shooting and reloading as his bullets rip apart the sled the 
           crooks are using for cover.  

           Nearby, Clubber has Jimmy Hope in his rifle sites.  Clubber 
           hesitates, then FIRES - slamming Jimmy in the gut.  Clubber 
           lowers his rifle in shock as Jimmy buckles, struggling to 
           hold his cash as Abe Coakley drags him to the sled. 

           Shang gives Johnny Irving the signal to move, even though 
           George is still pinned down 20 feet away.

                                 SHANG
                        Let’s go!

                                 JOHNNY
                        What about George?!

                                 SHANG
                        Go!

           The crew piles onto the runners of the sled and on top of the 
           money as they streak away, abandoning George.

           George panics, fleeing down an alley as bullets PING nearby.

           As Clubber watches his bloody victim hauled away, Byrnes runs 
           past, snapping Clubber out of his trance.

                                 BYRNES
                        Come on!

           EXT. ROOTOPS - CONTINUOUS

           George scales a fire escape, running across the rooftops.  

           Byrnes holsters his weapon and scales the building after 
           George, trailed by Clubber and the other Shadows.

           George leaps from rooftop to rooftop, narrowly making the 
           gaps.  He looks back, his terrified eyes visible through the 
           dark holes of the mask...

           ...Byrnes closes in on him, an unstoppable train.

           As George runs past a clothesline, he rips off the rope.
           Byrnes follows George through the tangled walkways of the 
           city built atop the city.  George approaches a water tower on 
           a three-story building, perched precariously on its wooden 
           stilts.  

           He frantically ties the rope to one of the stilts.  He looks 
           up to see...

           ...Byrnes closing in!  Byrnes raises his gun --

           George ties the other end of the rope to his waist and... 
           jumps off the building.

           EXT. BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           The rope pulls taught, swinging George like a pendulum as he 
           tumbles toward the street.  As he swings...

           ...the leg of the water tower snaps...

           ...George crashes to the ground, rolling across the 
           cobblestones in a brutal but survivable landing as his mask 
           flies off in the gutter.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

           Byrnes, meanwhile, sees the leg of the water tower snap and 
           the leviathan tank begins to pitch toward him...

           ...toppling over and flooding Byrnes and his crew back.  
           Clubber nearly washes off the edge of the building when 
           Byrnes grabs him, saving Clubber who dangles 30 feet from 
           death.  Byrnes tugs his brother-in-arms back to safety.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           George enters the warehouse, where Jimmy Hope SCREAMS as the 
           crew restrains him so a doctor can work on his wound.  The 
           doctor is covered in blood as he fishes for the bullet.  

           Jimmy arches his back as if he is being electrocuted.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Hold him down!

           The doctor turns and wipes the sweat from his brow.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        There’s nothing I can do.
           George approaches the table, where Jimmy is hyperventilating.  
           Jimmy looks up at George as he wheezes his last breath.

                                 GEORGE
                             (to Shang)
                        We had rules.  This blood is on 
                        your hands.

                                 SHANG
                        You don’t run this crew.

                                 GEORGE
                        No, if I ran this crew you wouldn’t 
                        kill an innocent bank employee!

                                 SHANG
                        You don’t have the stomach for this 
                        work - never did.

                                 GEORGE
                        This isn’t about stomach!  When we 
                        knock off some rich guy, the public 
                        doesn’t give a shit.  But you kill 
                        an innocent man and now the story 
                        is about a bunch of god-damn 
                        monsters terrorizing the poor.  
                        You’re an amateur - all of you. 
                             (off the crew’s silence)
                        Dump his body in the East River.  
                        Byrnes is going to be turning this 
                        city upside down looking for a gut-
                        shot thief.

           INT. WALLING’S OFFICE, THE TOMBS - DAY

           Byrnes confers with Walling as George’s kabuki mask sits on 
           Walling’s desk.

                                 BYRNES
                        I told you it was only a matter of 
                        time until Howard would be back.

                                 WALLING
                        Do you understand the severity of 
                        the situation?  No sooner are we 
                        both promoted than this circus 
                        happens.  The public sees an 
                        innocent man killed and they are 
                        demanding blood.  If not the Howard 
                        Gang, ours.   
                                 BYRNES
                        I can break this case, but we’ll 
                        need to take the dogs off the 
                        leash.

           Walling weighs the mask in his hand.

                                 WALLING
                        Do it quietly.

           INT. LESLIE MANSION - NIGHT

           George seats himself opposite Molly at an ornate table decked 
           out with all manner of crystal and china.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Sorry I’m late - you didn’t have to 
                        wait.

           Molly is silent, something on her mind.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 MOLLY
                        Some policemen came by earlier.

           Molly tries to gauge George’s reaction.  He plays it cool.

                                 GEORGE
                        What did they want?

                                 MOLLY
                        They were asking a lot of questions 
                        about your business.

           George dives into his meal, deflecting.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s probably nothing.  

           EXT. LESLIE MANSION - SAME TIME

           POV of someone approaching the Leslie home in the dark as 
           George and Molly eat dinner.

           INT. LESLIE MANSION - SAME TIME

           George hears the CRUNCHING of leaves outside.  
                                 MOLLY
                        George - why is your coat torn? 

           George signals for Molly to be quiet.

                                 GEORGE
                        Stay here.

           George moves through the dark house.  He enters an office 
           where he withdraws his gun from the desk.  

           George hears CREAKING on the steps in back of his house, 
           ascending.  He approaches the door, gun trained on it.  He 
           can hear the lock jimmied, then the door begins to sway open.

           George swings the barrel of the gun up and jabs it through 
           the gap, directly into the forehead of...

           ...JOHNNY IRVING.  George pushes him out onto the back porch, 
           checking to make sure Molly isn’t looking as he shuts the 
           door behind him.

           EXT. LESLIE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           George lowers the gun, getting in Johnny’s face.

                                 GEORGE
                        What the hell are you doing here?!

           Johnny is panicked, coming unglued.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I’m being followed.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s the drugs.  They’re messing 
                        with your head.

                                 JOHNNY
                        It’s the cops - I swear!   I didn’t 
                        know who else to turn to.  You 
                        always know what to do, George!  I 
                        need your help.

           George can see the kid is against the ropes, but George’s 
           survival instincts have the best of him.

                                 GEORGE
                        You never come to my home!  This is 
                        my life!  This is my family!  

           The words sting Johnny.
           EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - SAME TIME

           Byrnes lurks outside in the shadows, watching George slam the 
           door as Johnny departs like a whipped puppy.

           INT. LESLIE MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           George takes his seat back at the ornate dinner table and 
           silently resumes eating.  Molly watches him, wanting an 
           explanation.  

                                 MOLLY
                        George...

           George cuts her off.

                                 GEORGE
                        Can we just eat dinner?

           Frustrated, Molly places her napkin on her plate full of food 
           and departs.  George watches her leave, sensing his world 
           collapsing around him. 

           INT. FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL - NIGHT

           George sits alone at the bar of the Fifth Avenue Hotel, 
           sipping a bourbon out of a crystal lowball.  

           He holds a $100 bill in his hand, his eyes lost in it.  
           (Note: In 1878, the $100 bill featured a portrait of Abraham 
           Lincoln on the left and an architect on the right.)  

           George dips the corner of the bill into a votive candle on 
           the bar, watching as the flames consume the note.  Before the 
           flames nip his fingers, George drops the bill into his empty 
           whiskey glass, where it burns itself out.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Why the long face, George?

           George turns to see Josie, dressed to kill in an evening 
           gown.  He returns to his drink.

                                 JOSIE
                        You know why rich people are 
                        depressed?  Because they have 
                        everything there is to have and it 
                        ain’t that great.

           Josie passes her hand over George’s drink, touching his hand 
           seductively. 
                                 JOSIE (CONT’D)
                        We could have been something, 
                        George.  

           George chugs the last of his drink.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah - miserable.  Thought you were 
                        in jail..?

                                 JOSIE
                        I’ve changed, George.  Let me prove 
                        it to you.  

                                 GEORGE
                        Everyone’s working an angle.  You 
                        told me that, remember.

           George fishes some money out of his wallet as he rises.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Drink’s on me.

                                 JOSIE
                        You may not believe it, but I 
                        actually cared about you.

                                 GEORGE
                        You always were a good actor.  

                                 JOSIE
                        You still are.  

           George rubs his eyes, his world going hazy as Josie talks.

                                 JOSIE (CONT'D)
                        A criminal playing an architect... 
                        or is it an architect playing a 
                        criminal?  
                             (laughing to herself)
                        I’ll bet you don’t even know any 
                        more.  

           As George tries to leave, he looks up at Josie, seeing 
           double, realizing she put a knockout drop in his drink.

                                 GEORGE
                        What did you do?

           George collapses and ALL IS BLACK.
           INT. BASEMENT, THE TOMBS - NIGHT

           Over darkness, PANICKED BREATHING and the RATTLING OF CHAINS.  
           A door opens, casting a wedge of light on George, who sits in 
           a chair with his wrists chained behind his back. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Turns out Josie and I had something 
                        in common.  We both think you work 
                        for Jack Howard.

           George looks up with bleary eyes to see Byrnes rolling up his 
           sleeves as Clubber follows with a lantern.  Byrnes pulls the 
           Little Joker from George’s coat.  

                                 BYRNES
                        What’s this?

                                 GEORGE
                        I pickpocketed a China-man.

           Byrnes slugs George in the gut as Clubber watches on.

                                 BYRNES
                        The Dexter bank manager overheard 
                        one of the robbers call another one 
                        ‘George’.  Sound familiar?  

                                 GEORGE
                        I was cursed with a common name.  

                                 BYRNES
                        The games end now.

           George looks up - we’ll see.  Byrnes speaks calmly, settling 
           into the task at hand.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        There are nerves in the human body 
                        where if you strike them the pain 
                        is unbearable.  Up top, we’ve got 
                        the brachial plexus.

           Byrnes punches George in the pocket of the shoulder, sending 
           an electric shock through George’s body.  George tries to 
           swallow his pain.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        Then there’s the radial nerve.

           Byrnes drives his knuckle down into George’s forearm.  George 
           GRUNTS, fingers shooting out like a starfish.  
           Clubber watches uneasily as Byrnes picks up a club propped 
           against the wall, massaging it like a batter on deck.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        Up next is the sciatic nerve.  This 
                        is where the real fun begins.

           Byrnes swings at George, hammering him in the sciatic nerve.  
           George tries to contain his GRUNT.

                                 GEORGE
                        You son of a bitch!

           Byrnes strikes George repeatedly in the sciatic.  George 
           vomits from the pain, snot and sweat running down his face.  

                                 BYRNES
                        Your college degree and fancy 
                        clothes don’t fool me.  You’re a 
                        common criminal - no different from 
                        Shang and the lot of them tearing 
                        this city apart.

           George gasps as he recovers from the beating.

                                 GEORGE
                        You think those thugs are the 
                        problem?  You’re dumber than I 
                        thought, Byrnes. 

                                 BYRNES
                             (mocking)
                        Who’s the bogeyman?  Me?  Let’s 
                        hear it.

                                 GEORGE
                             (exhausted)
                        My family had a farm in Ohio.  The 
                        Western Railroad wanted to put a 
                        rail line through.  

           Clubber recalls hearing about that rail line...

                                 CLUBBER
                        The Western Railroad - I read about 
                        that...

                                 GEORGE
                        My family wouldn’t sell, so instead 
                        they bought the land upstream and 
                        cut off the water.  As soon as my 
                        parents missed one payment, the 
                        bank seized the land.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Cops like you came and burned it to 
                        the ground.

           Byrnes listens, surprised at George’s confession.  George 
           lowers his head, nothing left.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        You want to know who the real 
                        criminals are?  It’s the sons of 
                        bitches you’re protecting.
                             (off Byrnes’ silence)
                        Are we done here?  You can’t hold 
                        me forever.  

           Byrnes considers...

                                 BYRNES
                        Not yet.
                             (to Clubber)
                        Bring in the camera.

           The mention of the camera gets George’s attention.  As two of 
           the Shadows set up the tripod, Byrnes turns to George, 
           knowing he has the upper hand.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        You know what a criminal’s greatest 
                        fear is?  Exposure.  That the whole 
                        world will see them for who they 
                        really are.  

           George tries to mask his fear that Byrnes is about to destroy 
           any hope he had at a normal life with Molly.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna make sure your photo is 
                        hanging in every precinct in the 
                        country.  You’ll bear the mark of 
                        Cain wherever you go.  
                             (to Clubber)
                        Hold his pretty face up.

                                 CLUBBER
                        With pleasure.

           As the final preparations are made, George realizes it’s now 
           or never.  He calls to Clubber...

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re the one they call Clubber, 
                        right?  Heard about that guy you 
                        shot in the back.  
                                 CLUBBER
                        Be quiet.

                                 GEORGE
                        You know he’s dead?  

           The news strikes a chord with Clubber.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                             (reading Clubber)
                        Didn’t know that did you...  

                                 BYRNES
                        Don’t listen to him.

                                 GEORGE
                             (baiting Clubber)
                        They got a name for men who shoot 
                        people in the back.  

                                 CLUBBER
                        I said...

           As Clubber gets in George’s face, George suddenly snaps 
           forward, head-butting Clubber in the face.  

                                 CLUBBER (CONT’D)
                        You son of a bitch!!

           Clubber decks George, sending him tumbling back on his chair.  

           George collapses, still cuffed to the chair, blood pouring 
           from a swollen cut on his face.  He spits blood victoriously.

                                 GEORGE
                             (to Byrnes)
                        How’s my pretty face look now?

           Byrnes turns to Clubber, realizing he blew their shot at 
           photographing George.

                                 BYRNES
                        We’re through here.

           The Shadows depart, leaving George gasping on the floor.   

           EXT. THE TOMBS - DAY

           Molly approaches the Tombs, taking in the granite fortress.
           INT. SQUAD ROOM, THE TOMBS - DAY

           Molly enters the squad room, where the Shadows pour over 
           evidence.  Recognizing her, they all fall silent. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m looking for Mr. Byrnes.

           INT. BYRNES’ OFFICE, THE TOMBS - DAY

           Byrnes pulls out Molly’s seat for her, then sits at his desk.

                                 MOLLY
                        You have my husband.

                                 BYRNES
                        He’s been detained for questioning.

                                 MOLLY
                        I have a lawyer coming this 
                        afternoon.

                                 BYRNES
                        That’s well within your right.

           Molly lingers, eyeing a photo of the gallows on the wall...

                                 MOLLY
                        I need to know the truth.

                                 BYRNES
                        We believe your husband is involved 
                        with the Howard Gang.

                                 MOLLY
                        The bank robbers?  That’s 
                        impossible.

                                 BYRNES
                        The two of you met in Philadelphia - 
                        same week the Kensington Bank was 
                        robbed.

           The doubt begins to creep into Molly’s head.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        Three nights ago, the Howard Gang 
                        knocked off the Dexter Savings 
                        Bank.  They shot two of my deputies 
                        and killed a cashier.  Search your 
                        heart, and tell me you know where 
                        your husband was that night.
           Byrnes can see the truth in her tears.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        Even if he wanted out, George is in 
                        too deep.  You need to leave him.  

           INT. LESLIE MANSION - DAY

           Molly returns home.  She looks at all of their trappings of 
           wealth:  the grandfather clock, the chandelier...  She picks 
           up a sterling silver fork as the tears well in her eyes.

           EXT. THE TOMBS - NIGHT

           George exits the Tombs, his bruised jaw shivering against the 
           cold as he raises the collar on his jacket.  The streets are 
           eerily quiet.

           INT. MARM’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           George enters Marm’s office.  Marm glances up...

                                 MARM
                        You look like hell, George.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m done.

                                 MARM
                        You don’t get to decide when you’re 
                        done.

           George won’t be deterred - still has an ace to play...

                                 GEORGE
                        In exchange for ending our 
                        arrangement.  

           George slaps the Little Joker down in front of here.  Marm 
           eyes the device.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        You can rob as many banks as you 
                        like.  That’s what you wanted, 
                        isn’t it.

                                 MARM
                        I’m not a bank robber, George.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m not either any more.
                                 MARM
                        What about the Vanderbilt job?

                                 GEORGE
                        The crew can take the bank without 
                        me.

                                 MARM
                        You said yourself they weren’t up 
                        for it.

           Marm slides the Little Joker back to George.

                                 MARM (CONT’D)
                        No deal.  Remember - you found me.  
                        You asked for this.  You will rob 
                        that bank.

                                 GEORGE
                        And if I don’t?

                                 MARM
                        We’ll have a problem.

                                 GEORGE
                        What kind of problem?

                                 MARM
                        The kind Red Leary is better 
                        equipped to handle.

           Marm meets eyes with George, threatening.

                                 MARM (CONT’D)
                        And don’t even think about running.  
                        I got crews all over the country.  
                        There’s nowhere I won’t find you or 
                        your pretty little wife. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Leave her out of this.

                                 MARM
                        You made her a part of it.  You 
                        created all this!

           George glares at Marm, death in his eyes.

                                 GEORGE
                        One job - that’s it.  Then you 
                        leave us alone.

           Marm considers, offering the faintest nod of concession.
           INT. MANDELBAUM STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           As George exits Marm’s office, he sees Red standing outside.

                                 RED
                        Babe is back at Shang’s packing 
                        meat.  Guess she didn’t want to be 
                        saved after all.

           EXT. LESLIE MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           George approaches the door to his mansion, finding it cracked 
           open.  He wades into the darkness.

                                 GEORGE
                        Molly...?

           George musters the courage to go deeper.  He approaches the 
           living room, where a fire flickers in the hearth.  He can 
           make out the back of a figure seated in the armchair facing 
           the fire.  Dark hair visible over the high back.  George 
           circles the chair to find Molly, eyes filled with tears.

                                 MOLLY
                        You’re a bank robber...

                                 GEORGE
                        Molly...

                                 MOLLY
                        Don’t lie to me.  When we met, you 
                        were in town to rob a bank, weren’t 
                        you?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Jesus Christ!  I loved you.  I 
                        promised to spend my life with you.    
                        How you could you do this to me?

                                 GEORGE
                        When I brought you to New York, I 
                        was starting to plan my last job.  
                        I thought you’d never need to know.  

                                 MOLLY
                             (overwhelmed)
                        I’ve been living a lie.  Is your 
                        real name even George Leslie?
                                 GEORGE
                        I swear to you everything you know 
                        about me is real.  It’s only the 
                        other side - the one I protected 
                        you from - that’s a lie.  

                                 MOLLY
                        What about our money?

                                 GEORGE
                        Everything we have I bought with 
                        money I earned as an architect.  

                                 MOLLY
                        And the money you stole?

                                 GEORGE
                        I gave it all away - mostly schools 
                        and museums.  It was never about 
                        the money.

                                 MOLLY
                        Then why did you do it?

                                 GEORGE
                        Vanderbilt destroyed my family.  I 
                        wanted revenge, but nothing I do 
                        will get back what I lost.  What’s 
                        past is past.  Now all I want is a 
                        future with you.  Start our own 
                        family. 

                                 MOLLY
                        So you’re done?

                                 GEORGE
                        I have to do one more job.  After 
                        that Jack Howard won’t exist.  I’ll 
                        just be George Leslie the 
                        architect.

                                 MOLLY
                        Why do another job if we don’t need 
                        the money?!

                                 GEORGE
                        I need to finish what I started.

           EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY

           George waits alone on the elevated train platform as 
           Vanderbilt’s red and gold car circles toward the station.  
           INT. LUXURY PASSENGER CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           George steps aboard an opulent luxury car where a lone man 
           eats at a booth - CORNELIUS VANDERBILT, “The Commodore”.  
           George is intercepted by Vanderbilt’s SECURITY.  A pistol is 
           jammed in his gut by one of the PINKERTONS.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m here to see Mr. Vanderbilt.  

           Vanderbilt glances up from his food, taking note of the 
           interloper.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I was a colleague of Jim Fisk.

           Vanderbilt nods, granting George passage as the train leaves 
           the station.  High above the city on an elevated rail, the 
           car seems to be floating in the clouds, as if Vanderbilt 
           operates on an entirely different celestial plane.  George is 
           meeting his maker.

                                 VANDERBILT
                        My condolences about Jubilee Jim, 
                        but Fisk chose to involve himself 
                        with a very low grade of person.  
                        What business do you have with me?

                                 GEORGE
                        George Leslie - I’m an architect.

                                 VANDERBILT
                        Never heard of you.

                                 GEORGE
                        I want to help shape the future of 
                        this city, same as you. 

           Vanderbilt appreciates the praise.

                                 VANDERBILT
                        Commendable ambition.

                                 GEORGE
                        Heard you’re tearing down the farms 
                        in the Bronx to put in a new rail 
                        line.  There’s nothing up there but 
                        peach trees and cows. 

                                 VANDERBILT
                        People used to build rails to 
                        connect the cities.  I build rails 
                        to create the cities.  The future, 
                        Mr. Leslie.
                                 GEORGE
                        At what cost?

                                 VANDERBILT
                        Have you read any Darwin?  He has a 
                        theory that nature works because 
                        the strongest survive.  The poor 
                        are destitute because they are 
                        weak.  If we help them, we do them 
                        a disservice.  Wealth is the 
                        measure of a man’s worth.

           George begins to wind his way to his true purpose for 
           visiting the Commodore.

                                 GEORGE
                        Heard you’ve lost some money in the 
                        bank robberies lately.

                                 VANDERBILT
                        Pocket change.  The banks weren’t 
                        prepared for fortunes like mine.  
                        Besides, I’m building a new bank 
                        housing the rail development money.  

                                 GEORGE
                        The Manhattan Savings Institution.  
                        Took you a year to build...
                             (beat)
                        But somewhere out there is a man 
                        who spent his entire life figuring 
                        out how to get into it.  He 
                        probably knew how to get in before 
                        you laid the first brick.

           Vanderbilt resists the doubt creeping in as the train slows.

                                 VANDERBILT
                        This is your stop.

           George rises to leave.

                                 GEORGE
                        As long as you’re holding cash, it 
                        will never be safe.

           Vanderbilt looks up, curious.

           EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING - DAY

           Abe Coakley stands watch as Charlie Bullard feeds a long wire 
           through a keyhole on a giant loading door.  
                                 ABE
                        You remember the peanuts?

           PAN UP to reveal a sign over the door with circus images on 
           it reading:  “P.T. BARNUM’S AMERICAN MUSEUM”. 

           INT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - DAY

           George enters the cathedral-like atrium of the bank, where 
           workers are making final preparations.  Across the room is a 
           massive new vault door.  He looks up at a cupola where 
           sunlight streams in, memorizing it all.  

           He approaches a familiar man in a suit talking to workers.

                                 ED SCHELL
                        Can I help you?

                                 GEORGE
                        Ed Schell, right?  George Leslie - 
                        we met at the Ocean Bank.

                                 ED SCHELL
                        The architect.  I’m dreadfully 
                        embarrassed about what happened.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s only money.  Nice building - I 
                        was curious to see what you did 
                        with the interior.

                                 ED SCHELL
                        Be my guest.  Won’t have anything 
                        valuable in here until the bank 
                        opens next week.

           George checks his watch as he approaches the vault door.  
           Suddenly, like clockwork...

                                 WORKER (O.S.)
                        Good Lord - there’s a damn elephant 
                        in the street!

           Everyone in the bank runs to the front window, where a large 
           African elephant lumbers past, causing a riot of excitement.

           George doesn’t look back as he withdraws the Little Joker 
           from his pocket...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - DAY

           Flanked by cops, Cornelius Vanderbilt poses for a photo with 
           Ed Schell as he cuts the ribbon, officially opening the bank.

           INT. GEORGE LESLIE’S ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY

           George fills in the gaps of a diagram at his desk as he gives 
           orders to Abe and Charlie.  Johnny sits in the corner of 
           George’s office, scratching his arms.

                                 GEORGE
                        Get me a pulley and rope that can 
                        lift two thousand pounds.  They 
                        sell ‘em at the docks. 

                                 ABE
                        When are we gonna memorize the 
                        vault?

                                 GEORGE
                        We’re using light for this one.

           Abe nods and departs, bumping past a WEALTHY CLIENT in the 
           doorway.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                             (to the client, curt)
                        We’re closed.

           Charlie shuts the door, sealing the man out.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Any word from the guard?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No one’s entered that vault since 
                        the doors were sealed.  Marm’s 
                        getting impatient.

           George rocks back in his chair - desperately trying to think 
           his way out of this one. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        George, the bank was built to house 
                        one man’s fortune.  The only guy in 
                        the world who would open that vault 
                        and register the combination is 
                        Vanderbilt and that ain’t 
                        happening.

           Charlie departs as George runs his options in his head. 
                                 JOHNNY
                        How are we gonna rob the bank?

                                 GEORGE
                        We aren’t going to.

                                 JOHNNY
                        What do you mean?

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re not cut out for this work.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I’m cleaned up.

           George meets eyes with Johnny - a sense of finality.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re through, Johnny.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I thought you were my friend.

           INT. SQUAD ROOM, THE TOMBS - DAY

           Clubber confers with Byrnes as they try to unravel the Howard 
           enigma amidst the mountains of evidence.

                                 CLUBBER
                        I followed up on that story Leslie 
                        told.  Apparently one George 
                        Leonidas Leslie was sentenced to 
                        twenty years in Ohio for assaulting 
                        the cops when his family farm was 
                        seized for the Western Railroad.  
                        Leslie escaped from prison and is 
                        now a wanted fugitive.  Should we 
                        notify the Ohio authorities?  

                                 BYRNES
                        Leslie’s no good to us in Ohio.  
                        Destroy that letter.  

                                 CLUBBER
                        There’s something else you should 
                        know.  The Western Railroad is 
                        owned by Vanderbilt. 

           As Byrnes begins to piece it together, Johnny Irving is led 
           in by two of the Shadows.  

                                 SHADOW
                        He wanted to talk to you.
           Johnny hands Byrnes an architectural tube.  Byrnes takes note 
           of Johnny fidgeting anxiously.

                                 BYRNES
                        What’s this about?

           Johnny points at a WANTED POSTER for Jack Howard with a 
           $10,000 reward.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Reward money.

           Byrnes spreads out the architectural diagram, confused.  

                                 BYRNES
                        What is this..? 

                                 JOHNNY
                        It’s the Manhattan Savings 
                        Institution.

                                 CLUBBER
                        Vanderbilt’s bank...

                                 BYRNES
                        Where’d you get this?!

                                 JOHNNY
                        George Leslie’s office.

           Byrnes snaps to action, calling over to his soldiers.

                                 BYRNES
                        Get your guns.

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           Byrnes and the Shadows move silently up the stairs, guns 
           raised as they check their corners.

           Clubber approaches the door to George Leslie’s architecture 
           office, flanking it with his rifle in the high ready.  Byrnes 
           nods and Clubber mule-kicks the door open.

           Byrnes floods through first, ready to kill, as his crew 
           follows with military precision.  

                                 BYRNES
                        Cup’s warm.

           Clubber flips through the blueprints littering the office.  
                                 CLUBBER
                        Jesus, this guy built a lot of 
                        stuff.

           Byrnes’ stomach sinks as he takes in labels on the diagrams 
           on the wall - “Northampton, Ocean, etc.”

                                 BYRNES
                        He didn’t design these.  He robbed 
                        them.

           Clubber notes the boxes full of architectural tubes storing 
           dozens of schematics George left behind.

                                 CLUBBER
                        There’s gotta be hundreds in here.  
                        He helped Jack Howard knock off all 
                        these banks?

                                 BYRNES
                        Leslie doesn’t work for Howard.  
                        Leslie is Howard.

           INT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - DAY

           Byrnes and the Shadows storm into the bank, flashing their 
           badges at the extensive security detail.  

                                 BYRNES
                        Thomas Byrnes, NYPD Major Case 
                        Squad.  I need to speak to the bank 
                        manager.

                                 ED SCHELL
                        How can I help you?

                                 BYRNES
                        We need to check the contents of 
                        your vault. We have reason to 
                        believe you may have been robbed. 

                                 ED SCHELL
                        I assure you no one has entered 
                        that vault since the building was 
                        constructed.

                                 BYRNES
                        I’m not asking.

           Ed acquiesces, leading Byrnes toward the vault.
                                 ED SCHELL
                        For security reasons, I must ask 
                        you to take a step back.  

           CLOSE ON the bank manager’s fingers twisting the dial.  The 
           CAMERA PUSHES THROUGH inside the dial, where the Little Joker 
           twists, its gears registering the turns of the dial.

           INT. VAULT, MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - MOMENTS LATER

           The Shadows audit enormous blocks of securities stacked 
           inside.  Byrnes confers with Ed.

                                 BYRNES
                        We were never here, understand?  
                        Until this matter is resolved, I’m 
                        going to assign you a security 
                        detail. 

           Clubber approaches Byrnes, pulling him aside.

                                 CLUBBER
                        The money’s all here, but he’d be a 
                        fool to rob it.

                                 BYRNES
                        What do you mean?

           INT. LESLIE MANSION - NIGHT

           George rushes to toss his things in a suitcase as he dictates 
           the plan to Molly.

                                 GEORGE
                        We need to leave tomorrow.  In the 
                        morning, buy two tickets for the 
                        11am train to Chicago.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Why?  What’s going on?

                                 GEORGE
                        The cops know who I am.  We’re 
                        taking the bank tonight and the 
                        cops are gonna know I was involved.  
                        We can’t stay in New York.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Then call off the robbery!  We’ll 
                        leave tonight.   
                                 GEORGE
                        It’s not that easy.

                                 MOLLY
                             (echoing George)
                        Name one thing you can’t walk away 
                        from.

                                 GEORGE
                        Listen to me - I work with some bad 
                        people.  If I don’t do this job, 
                        neither one of us will ever be 
                        safe.  

           George takes Molly’s hand, reassuring her.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Trust me, I have a plan.  After 
                        this we can go wherever you want - 
                        we can go west - San Francisco, you 
                        name it.  We can start over.  

           Molly wants to believe him.  Tries to convince herself.

                                 MOLLY
                        OK...

                                 GEORGE
                        If anything goes wrong, I want you 
                        to have this.

           George hands Molly a ledger.

                                 MOLLY
                        What is it?

                                 GEORGE
                        I deposited my architecture money 
                        in the banks before I’d rob them.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Why?

                                 GEORGE
                        So I could case them.  Cost of 
                        doing business.  I’ve got accounts 
                        open at banks all over the country.  
                        It’s not a fortune, but it’s enough 
                        to start over.  Listen to me - if I 
                        don’t show up for any reason, 
                        promise to get on that train 
                        without me.  
                                 MOLLY
                        George...

                                 GEORGE
                        You said you dreamed of going west.  
                        Nothing’s stopping you.

           George takes Molly’s hands in his.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Please, promise me you will get on 
                        that train and do something good 
                        for yourself with that money.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Only if you promise to be on that 
                        train too.

           George embraces Molly, trying to be strong for her.

           INT. MANDELBAUM STORE - NIGHT

           Marm sits in the dark store.

                                 RED
                        You sent for me.

                                 MARM
                        Is everything on schedule?

                                 RED
                        We’re taking the bank tonight.

                                 MARM
                        I’m afraid George Leslie’s 
                        usefulness has run its course.  

                                 RED
                        Understood.

                                 MARM
                        Wait until he gets you inside the 
                        vault.

                                 RED
                        Yes ma’am. 

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Alone, George wears a blindfold as he walks along the chalk 
           lines on the floor in the bank mock-up.
           INT. SHANG DRAPER’S BROTHEL - NIGHT

           The crew is gathered around the bar as Red Leary opens a bag 
           of weathered pistols.  He hands the guns to the nervous crew 
           as they all prepare to kill Caesar to save Rome.

           Among the prostitutes, Babe watches, fearing the worst.  

           INT. BYRNES APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Byrnes kisses one of his sleeping daughters goodnight, 
           touching her hair tenderly.

           He slides his pistol into his shoulder holster, then dons his 
           jacket to leave.  He looks back at Ophelia, who can sense her 
           husband is going off to war.

           EXT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - NIGHT

           SUPER:  MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - OCTOBER 27, 1878

           The Shadows have the building surrounded.  Without radios, 
           they are positioned within line-of-sight.  

           INSIDE AN EMPTY STORE ACROSS THE STREET: Byrnes and Clubber 
           observe in the pitch black.  Clubber sees one of the Shadows 
           hold up a fist.

                                 CLUBBER
                        Still no sign of Leslie.  It’ll be 
                        sunrise soon.

           EXT. ROOFTOP NEAR THE MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - NIGHT

           Under the cover of night, George swings a grappling hook with 
           its prongs wrapped in cloth to muffle them.  He hurls the 
           hook to the roof of the bank, where it quietly THUMPS.    

           George tugs the rope until the hook catches, then wrenches it 
           taught, tying off the other end around a chimney.  

           Wearing black muslin hoods so they are invisible against the 
           night sky, George and his crew belly slide across the top of 
           the rope, hauling satchels of gear.

           EXT. ROOF OF MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - NIGHT

           The men strip off their hoods as George withdraws a bottle 
           with a skull and crossbones containing muriatic acid.
                                 GEORGE
                        Hold your breath.

           Applying the acid with a glass tube George corrodes the 
           mortar of the giant bricks in the side of the cupola, then 
           slide them out.   

           He then lights a torch, tossing it 40 feet into the abyss, 
           its glow sweeping down the immense cavern...

           George hooks a pulley into place in the cupola, then ties one 
           end of a rope around a stone eagle that soars over the front 
           of the bank to anchor it, running the other through the 
           pulley and down into the atrium.

           George then withdraws a bundle of dynamite from his sack.  
           Abe watches with concern as George affixes it to the base of 
           the eagle statue.

                                 ABE
                        I thought you don’t use dynamite.

                                 GEORGE
                        Rules have changed.

           George lights a long coil of fuse.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        We got five minutes to get out.

           INT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - NIGHT

           Rope unfurls into the illuminated lobby as George and his 
           crew fast-rope down.  At the bottom of the rope is a series 
           of large loops spread on the floor.  

           Shang Draper uses a crowbar to pop the dial off the vault and 
           George Leslie pulls the Little Joker, inspecting it.

                                 GEORGE
                        Right 71, left 16.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           Charlie whizzes through permutations with superhuman speed as 
           George calls them out.

                                 CHARLIE
                        79-8-24.

           George tests the latch - doesn’t budge.
                                 GEORGE
                        Next.

           Abe Coakley checks a pocket-watch, panicked.

                                 ABE
                        We get two minutes.

           George ignores him as Charlie spins...

                                 CHARLIE
                        80-9-25.

           George presses handle - KACHUNK.  

           Deep within the vault door, steel bars releases their grip 
           and the titanic portal yawns open, revealing only darkness.

           George leads the crew into the vault by lantern, where they 
           see paper piled on the tables.  

                                 RED
                        Where’s the money?

                                 GEORGE
                        That is the money.

           The crew falls silent, everyone aware that George’s time is 
           up.  Shang’s pistol comes up to the back of George’s head...  

           As George hears the CLICK of the hammer going back, he blows 
           out the lantern, once again casting his crew into darkness...

           BANG!  The muzzle FLASH lights the room as George dodges.  
           The first shot is followed by the THUNDER of multiple 
           handguns firing at George, the strobing muzzle flashes 
           illuminating George as he uses his photographic memory to 
           strike back at the pack of wolves.  

           Vanderbilt’s fortune explodes into the air, sheets of paper 
           frozen in motion by each flash of gunfire.  

           We catch the flickering image of George punching Red Leary in 
           the teeth...

           ...trading blows with Shang Draper with animalistic fury...

           ...blocking Red Leary’s knife before tossing him into Charlie 
           Bullard...

           ...knocking Abe Coakley’s gun out of his hand as it goes off 
           in the steel wall, sparking as it ricochets...
           ...the thunder and lightning of bones and gunshots 
           CRACKING...

           ...George dives across the room, snatching a gun off the 
           floor -- spinning and swinging it up.  George and Shang face 
           off, both pulling their triggers in a simultaneous flash - 
           George’s face illuminated by the explosion of light from his 
           muzzle.  Then blackness.

           INT. STORE ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT

           Byrnes hears the gunshots and calls out to his men --

                                 BYRNES
                        Move in!  Go!  Go!  Go!

           EXT. ROOF OF MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - CONTINUOUS

           The fuse burns, nearly reaching the dynamite...

           INT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - CONTINUOUS

           George’s crew hooks into the loops of rope.  Dressed in all 
           black in the torchlight, they are difficult to discern.

           EXT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - CONTINUOUS

           The base of the eagle statue blows and the eagle topples 
           toward the street below...

           INT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - CONTINUOUS

           ...acting as a counter-weight for the crew as they are ripped 
           up off the ground and zip toward the sky in a giant bundle...

           The eagle CRASHES outside the front door, narrowly missing 
           Byrnes and his crew as they enter the lobby, which is empty.

           INT. VAULT, MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - NIGHT

           Byrnes leads his crew into the vault, taking in the few 
           scattered notes that remain.  

           In the corner of the room, George sits slumped over, 
           surrounded by bloody bank notes.  Byrnes sees George’s 
           bleeding abdomen - knows it’s bad.  He kneels before him, 
           picking up a stray sheet of paper off the floor.  Byrnes 
           can’t believe George’s error...
                                 BYRNES
                        Registered securities.  Largest 
                        score in history, and it’s 
                        worthless.  All this for nothing.

           George can’t even lift his head to get the words out...

                                 GEORGE
                        Worthless to a criminal.  Not to a 
                        cop.   

                                 BYRNES
                        You knew?

                                 GEORGE
                        You want to target one man or an 
                        entire system?

           George takes Byrnes’ hand, gripping it as he dies.  George’s 
           hand slides away, leaving the Little Joker in Byrnes’ palm.  
           Byrnes isn’t sure what to make of it.

           INT. BYRNES’ OFFICE, THE TOMBS - DAY

           Byrnes studies the Little Joker as Clubber addresses him.

                                 CLUBBER
                        According to Vanderbilt’s man, 
                        George Leslie visited him days 
                        before the robbery and convinced 
                        him to convert his money to 
                        registered securities.  It doesn’t 
                        make any sense - that’s suicide.

                                 BYRNES
                        His target wasn’t Vanderbilt.  It 
                        was Marm.  He knew those registered 
                        securities would spread through the 
                        underworld like a virus.  

           A Shadow enters.

                                 SHADOW
                        Ms. Irving’s here.

           As Babe Irving is escorted in, Byrnes turns to Clubber.

                                 BYRNES
                        I’d like a moment alone.  

           Clubber departs, leaving Byrnes and Babe alone in silence.  
           Babe takes note of the Little Joker on Byrnes’ desk, 
           triggering a distant memory from a warehouse in her youth.  
                                 BABE
                        Been a long time since I saw that.

                                 BYRNES
                        George said you could tell me what 
                        it is.

                                 BABE
                        George..?

           Byrnes withdraws an envelope.

                                 BYRNES
                        I received this letter from him, 
                        post-marked the day before the 
                        robbery.  

           INSERT: handwritten letter from George.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                             (reading letter)
                        Inspector Byrnes, by the time 
                        you’re reading this, Vanderbilt and 
                        his rail money have parted ways and 
                        my career as a thief has reached 
                        its end.

           Byrnes stands before the vault door.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        If you’re still wondering how I 
                        broke into the vault, ask Babe 
                        Irving about the Chinese coin.

           He slowly slides the Little Joker over the shank, then clicks 
           the dial over it, solving the riddle.  He looks around to 
           make sure no one knows the secret but him. 

           INT. LESLIE MANSION - DAY

           Babe enters the palatial estate, taking in all the finery.  

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        In exchange for her cooperation, I 
                        request that she be granted the 
                        deed to my house and all its 
                        contents.  With regard to her 
                        brother, Johnny Irving, make sure 
                        he gets his reward money.  He 
                        earned it.
           Johnny follows Babe into the house, admiring his new home as 
           he sets a large duffel full of cash on the foyer table.

           Marm’s battered crew huddles around the sacks full of 
           securities as Marm divvies up the score.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        I expect by now the securities from 
                        the Manhattan Savings Bank have 
                        spread throughout Marm’s 
                        organization and anyone holding 
                        them is wanted by New York’s 
                        finest.  In the event you need help 
                        locating them, I left you a map.

           INT. BYRNES’ OFFICE, THE TOMBS - DAY

           Byrnes examines the letter confused.  He checks the back 
           side, finding nothing.

                                 BYRNES
                             (to himself)
                        Map?  What map?

           INSERT FLASHBACK: George rolls up his diagram of the bank and 
           hands it to Johnny.  The two men trade a knowing look as they 
           part ways, the betrayal part of the plan.

           Byrnes frantically unrolls the diagram Johnny gave him, 
           noting the title:  ‘MANHATTAN’.  

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                             (confused)
                        It’s not a bank...

           Byrnes notes the labels on the lines: ‘PARK AVE’, ‘BROADWAY’.

                                 BYRNES (CONT’D)
                        It’s the island.

           Byrnes then sees that George has marked the locations of Marm  
           and her crew throughout Lower Manhattan.

           EXT. MANDELBAUM STORE - DAY

           The store is surrounded by UNIFORMED ROUNDSMEN and REPORTERS 
           as the Queen of the Underworld is paraded out in cuffs by 
           Byrnes.  Charlie Bullard is led out behind her.
                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        I apologize for any harm I have 
                        caused you or the city you call 
                        home.  I cannot undo the sins of my 
                        past, but perhaps I can help 
                        architect the future you seek.

           INT. SHANG DRAPER’S BROTHEL - DAY

           Shang sits with his shirt off, face pale and clammy.  He 
           nurses a bottle while a prostitute changes the infected 
           dressings on his chest wound inflicted by George.

           A long shadow casts over Shang, who looks up to see Byrnes.

           EXT. TENEMENT - DAY

           The Shadows rush out the back of a tenement in pursuit of Abe 
           Coakley, who clutches a bunch of securities to his chest.  He 
           disappears into an outhouse, sealing himself in.  The Shadows 
           kick in the door, guns drawn...

           ...finding it empty.  They look down to see Abe chest deep in 
           shit holding the bank notes.

           EXT. DUNES - DAY

           A gray afternoon on the dunes of Coney Island.  Red Leary 
           scrambles to bury his fortune in the sand.  He looks over his 
           shoulder to see the Shadows bearing down on him.  Red 
           snatches the bills and takes off for the sea.

           Clubber tackles Red at the water’s edge.  The Shadows kick 
           the hell out of Red as they cuff him in the water.  Red 
           watches as the waves reclaim Vanderbilt’s worthless paper.

           INT. GRAND CENTRAL DEPOT - MORNING

           Molly stands alone on the platform with her luggage.  She 
           scans the crowd for George, unable to find him as the train 
           begins huffing out steam.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        As for Molly, she deserves better 
                        than this.  In the event of my 
                        demise, my dying wish is that you 
                        make sure she gets on the 11am 
                        train westbound.  
           As Molly looks for George, Byrnes emerges beside her.  She 
           searches Byrnes’ eyes for the truth as Byrnes silently lifts 
           her suitcase and places it on the train. 

           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           Sun washes across Molly’s face as she stares out the window 
           of the passenger car, lost in thought.  She sits up in her 
           seat, eyes falling on the endless rows of Ohio corn as she 
           makes her way West.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        All I ever wanted was justice...

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

           Byrnes leans on the rail of the Brooklyn Bridge, casting his 
           gaze toward the Manhattan skyline stretched out before him.  
           He rolls something in his hand - the Little Joker.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...Hopefully you can be the man I 
                        couldn’t be. 

           Beside Byrnes are his wife and daughters.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Daddy, what’s that?

           Byrnes hands the girl the Little Joker.

                                 BYRNES
                        Make a wish.

           She takes the Chinese coin and tosses it into the East River.  

           The camera PULLS BACK as the Byrnes family makes their way 
           across the bustling bridge, returning home to Manhattan...

           TITLE CARD:  

           “According to the NYPD, George Leslie robbed at least 700 
           banks during his career.  Adjusted for today’s dollars, the 
           Manhattan Savings Institution heist was over $60 million, 
           still the largest bank robbery in U.S. history.”

           “After unraveling the heist, Thomas Byrnes founded the Wall 
           Street Division.  During his career, he logged 10,000 
           conviction years.  When he died, the New York Times 
           proclaimed him, ‘The greatest policeman New York ever had’.”

                                                              FADE OUT.
