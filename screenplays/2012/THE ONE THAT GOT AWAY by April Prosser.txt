           A WOMAN dramatically clears her THROAT. 

                                 KELSEY (V.O.)
                        Shall we begin...?

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO APARTMENT - ROOFTOP - SUNSET

           High above the BUSTLING of Market Street, a “FUNERAL” is 
           underway. The bereaved - AMANDA HUTCHINS, 24 - sexy, zany, 
           but today mostly just heartbroken - holds a PHOTO of her and 
           her former boyfriend, GAVIN MATTHEWS (25, scruffy, 
           effortlessly cool), backpacking in Barcelona.

           KELSEY, 24, short, sporty, super confident, stands over a 
           SHOEBOX, delivering a eulogy FOR A BREAK-UP. 

           What? Girls do this kind of shit. Don’t judge. 

                                 KELSEY
                        Dearly beloved. We are gathered 
                        here to say our final goodbyes to 
                        the relationship of Amanda Hutchins 
                        and Gavin Matthews. Now Amanda - 
                        I’ve been informed you’d like to 
                        share a few parting words?

                                 AMANDA
                           (sincerely, to photo)
                        Dear Gavin... we were supposed to 
                        be peas in a pod forever... But you 
                        took a job in Hong Kong and started 
                        dating asshole supermodels and 
                        putting your pea in their pods. So, 
                        have an awesome time with that. I 
                        hope you get chlamydia. And rue the 
                        day you fucking lost me-

                                 KELSEY
                        --Thank you for that-

           Kelsey REACHES for the PHOTO, Amanda DEATH GRIPS it. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I don’t want to move on! Come back! 

                                 KELSEY
                        Amanda, let it go. Let it go. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Uh-uh! I’m not ready.
                                 KELSEY
                        Put down the photo! Okay -
                           (pulls her into HEADLOCK)
                        I’m hugging you into submission. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Ow, my hair’s caught in there! This 
                        is not a hug. 

                                 KELSEY
                        It’s hard to see right now but one 
                        day you’re gonna be with the man 
                        you’re supposed to wind up with and 
                        you’ll be so happy it never worked 
                        out with this guy. And you’ll say, 
                        “Wow, Kelsey, you were right. I’d 
                        like to thank you with a gift 
                        certificate to Whole Foods because 
                        I never would’ve known love again 
                        if I hadn’t let it go.”

           Amanda reluctantly GIVES UP the PHOTO. Kelsey frees her, 
           putting the FINAL MEMENTO in the BOX and CLOSING IT. 

                                 KELSEY (CONT’D)
                        As we walk through the valley of 
                        the shadow of exes, I now pronounce 
                        you officially set free...

           They release FOUR BLACK BALLOONS INTO THE AIR as Kelsey HUMS 
           a triumphant, shaky rendition of “CAN’T HURRY LOVE,” on her 
           KAZOO. Amanda can’t help but smile as the balloons float off. 
           Symbols of hope, of healing... 

           They SNAG on a ledge. Amanda frowns, Kelsey stops MID-NOTE.

                                 AMANDA
                        That’s not a good sign, huh?

                                 KELSEY
                        I wouldn’t read into it... 

           POP! POP! POP! All but ONE wilt. POP!! Fuck me. 

                                 KELSEY (CONT’D)
                        That’s not as good. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah, I’m never recovering. 

           As we PRELAP the real version of “CAN’T HURRY LOVE,” we...

                                                     SMASH CUT TO:
           TITLE CARD - FOUR YEARS LATER...

           EXT. VICTORIAN HOME - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Twinkling lights in the trees. A banner reads, “Everything 
           Gets Better With Time! Happy 85th Thora!” A little BOY and 
           GIRL mischievously pick at the cake; he PUSHES her, she CRIES 
           and CHASES after him. And thus, young love begins. 

           A mix of FAMILY and spry 80-YEAR-OLDS dance. 

           The music switches to a raunchy RAP SONG. Everyone continues 
           dancing, oblivious - CLAPPING, SNAPPING, TWIRLING.

                                 SONG
                        POP! POP THAT PUSSY! POP POP THAT 
                        PUSSY BABY!

           Relatives stop dancing, look around, confused. 

                                 OLD LADY
                        What are they saying? 

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        Ryan, change it back. 

                                 13-YEAR-OLD SON
                        Fine. 

           The 13-YEAR-OLD DJ begrudgingly changes the SONG. 

           Amanda WAITS in line AT THE GRILL, wistfully watching a HAPPY 
           COUPLE. But before you feel too sorry for her... 

           BRAD HAYES, 30, boy-next-door cute in a cardigan - a John 
           Krasinsky type - walks up with two drinks and WHISPERS:

                                 BRAD 
                        Excuse me, Miss, I received a 
                        report of an overcuteness in the 
                        area. I’m gonna have to take you in 
                        for questioning. 

           She TURNS, lighting up - very much recovered after all. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Uh-oh! Do you need to frisk me?

           She wraps her arms around him in a KISS. Brad’s husky, fun-
           loving COUSIN JIM (think: Chris Pratt) joins their HUG.

                                 COUSIN JIM 
                        Hey, make room for me. 
                                 AMANDA
                        Aw, that’s right, every hug’s an 
                        awkward group hug with Jim. 

                                 COUSIN JIM
                        Keep her around, Brad. She gets me. 

                                 BRAD
                        I dunno, she might ditch me now 
                        that she got a promotion. 

                                 COUSIN JIM
                        Look at big hot stepper!

           He CLINKS her drink as his bad-ass Texan wife, NICKY, joins.

                                 NICKY
                        Psycho Pants promoted you? 
                        Congratulations! Are you officially 
                        a decorator now?!

                                 AMANDA
                        On a trial basis. I have to bring 
                        in clients to make it official. 
                        Psycho Pants could still take it 
                        away. 

                                 NICKY
                        We’ll keep our ears open for you.

                                 AMANDA
                           (smiles at Brad)
                        Actually, we might be my first 
                        unofficial project...

                                 BRAD
                        She’s moving in with me. 

                                 NICKY
                        You’re moving into Brad’s place? Oh 
                        yeah, you have a lot of 
                        redecorating in store. 

                                 BRAD
                        Hey, my apartment is a masterpiece. 
                        It should be in Better Home and 
                        Gardens. No changes necessary. 

                                 NICKY
                        Does he still use suitcases for 
                        drawers?

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m already on it. 
           They SIT DOWN to eat. 

                                 COUSIN JIM
                        Doesn’t “living in sin” make it 
                        sound so illicit? Makes you think 
                        there’s gonna be round the clock 
                        debaucheries and feasts. Like 
                        you’re gonna have a speedboat named 
                        TittyHunter.   

                                 NICKY
                        Nope - no one thinks that.   

                                 COUSIN JIM
                        Sadly it just means less sex and 
                        more walking in on the other one 
                        plucking hairs you never knew 
                        about. Found that out the hard way.

                                 NICKY
                        First of all - shut up. Second of 
                        all - we never “lived in sin.” You 
                        had to put a ring on it first.

                                 COUSIN JIM
                        Is that what we did wrong?

           Nicky HITS him. 

           EXT. VICTORIAN HOME - BACKYARD - MINUTES LATER

           Bee Gees’ “To Love Somebody” starts up. GRANDMA THORA, the 85-
           year-old birthday girl, WAVES her arms excitedly on her way 
           TO THE FLOOR. Not the best dancer but she’s 85 - so be nice. 

                                 COUSIN JIM
                        Well, Amanda, you now know where 
                        the Hayes family gets their moves. 
                           (calls out)
                        Get it, Grandma! 

           Nicky PULLS Jim to DANCE. Amanda LAUGHINGLY TUGS on Brad.

                                 BRAD
                        No chance. Not happening. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Come on! You can’t mess up slow 
                        dancing. It’s the dance made for 
                        white people. 

           Amanda SHIMMIES her shoulders, CIRCLING him.
                                 BRAD
                        Do your shoulders know that?

                                 AMANDA
                        This is a signature move.  

                                 BRAD
                           (smiles, as she tugs him)
                        You’re never going to win this 
                        battle. 

           Amanda FAKE POUTS, dancing in depressed, SLOW-MOTION. UNCLE 
           TED, 65, a Bostonian transplant, HOLDS out his HAND.

                                 UNCLE TED
                        Can I have this dance?

                                 AMANDA
                        Absolutely. 

           She gives Brad a teasingly pointed look as Ted TWIRLS her. 

                                 UNCLE TED
                        Careful Brad, when you got the most 
                        beautiful woman in the room, you 
                        better dance with her... or she 
                        just might get whisked away by a 
                        handsome stranger.

                                 AMANDA
                        Don’t say you weren’t warned!  

                                 BRAD
                        Okay, hands at ten and two, Uncle 
                        Ted. Let’s leave some room for the 
                        Holy Spirit. 

           Amanda and Brad never stop smiling at each other. 

                                 AMANDA AND BRAD
                           (mouthing the chorus)
                        To love somebody... The way I love 
                        you.  

           Uncle Ted DRAMATICALLY DIPS Amanda and she LAUGHS. 

           EXT. EMBARCADERO - NIGHT

           Amanda and Brad WALK home along the boardwalk, HOLDING HANDS. 
                                 BRAD
                        So the weekend I get back from New 
                        York, we’re doing the big annual 
                        camping trip at Angel Island. I was 
                        thinking we could go up a night 
                        early, take the dinner cruise over. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Aw, I’d love to but there’s no way. 
                        We’re moving my stuff all day. It’s 
                        gonna be too hectic. 

                                 BRAD
                        Come on, we could be done by then. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Have you seen how much stuff I 
                        have? 

                                 BRAD
                        Have you seen how many muscles I 
                        have?

                                 AMANDA
                        Shoot, it’s gonna take even longer. 

                                 BRAD
                        I already made the reservation. 

           She stops, playfully turns towards him.    

                                 AMANDA
                        You made a reservation? Since when 
                        do you make reservations?

           He keeps WALKING. She FOLLOWS, incredulous. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        You actually called the dinner 
                        cruise? On the phone? Ahead of 
                        time? 

                                 BRAD
                        Babe, I’m pretty smart. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Did you know you can also change 
                        reservations? 

                                 BRAD
                        Okay, forgive me for trying to have 
                        togetherness time! I’ll just reheat 
                        leftovers in my pajamas.

                        Might as well get used to what it’s 
                        gonna be like. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You’re so dramatic.

                        The sweatpants with the holes?

                                 BRAD
                        Yup. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I like those. I can poke you 
                        through them. 

                                 BRAD
                        Nope. There’ll be no poking. 
                        There’ll be a moratorium on pokes.

                                 AMANDA
                           (pokes him)
                        Poke!

                           (catches her finger)
                        --Nope. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Why is it such a big deal we go 
                        that Friday of all the thousands of 
                        Fridays we’ve never-
                           (looks at her finger,

                        --Actually, I can do Friday.

                        dinner cruise, which is where we

                        starts insisting we go the day I 
                        move in. He’s putting a downpayment

                        was instantly onto him because -

                        a downward spiral, do I need to

                        on taking you on this really out-of-

           INT. UCHI RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           WORKERS scurry around finishing RENOVATIONS. Spiky modernist 
           Morning Star-like SCONCES hang from the ceiling. 

           Interior designer, “Crazy Pants,” GRACE SUNDELL, 40, thin, 
           sharply dressed, can charm you, reduce you to tears and charm 
           you all over again, PACES unhappily with the CONTRACTOR. 

                                 GRACE
                        You fucked the Feng Shui.

                        getting new clients. Is there any 
                        way you can have your new assistant-

                                 GRACE
                        You can find new clients after. A 
                        client we currently have is going 
                        to be here in two hours and think 
                        he walked into Fifty Fucking Shades 
                        of Grey. 

           Amanda PAUSES, then NODS. This is a slippery slope of 
           sacrifice but what can she do?

                                 AMANDA
                        Sure, I’ll start working on it

           EXT. HYDE STREET - DAY

           Amanda pushes a mortifyingly squeaky SHOPPING CART, the

           Amanda HANGS UP, disappointed. The BRAKE goes off on the 
           CART. She has to FORCE the WHEELS to keep MOVING. 

           Push. Thunk. Stop. Push. Thunk. Stop. 

           A HOMELESS MAN in a Raiders jersey SLIDES past with his cart. 

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        You gotta get your carts from Smart 
                        & Final. They don’t have brakes. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Thank-
                           (realizes he has no pants)
                        Oh. Kay. No pants. 

           She KA-THUNKS past a CUTE MAN, 30, as he and a MOVER pull a 
           new plasma screen out of a truck. They share a fleeting 
           glance. He looks like Gavin Matthews (who we saw in the 
           Barcelona photo) with shorter hair... 

           She keeps going as the realization settles in... 

           IT IS GAVIN MATTHEWS.

           Oh fuck, oh fuck. Here? Now? With a shopping cart?

                                 GAVIN
                        Amanda?

           She stops, SLOWLY TURNS around. Plasters on a SMILE. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Gavin?! Hi! 

           He SHAKES his head in disbelief, SETS down the tv. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Hey! 

                                 AMANDA
                        Ohmygod! So do you!
                           (realizes)
                        I mean...
                                 GAVIN
                        That’s okay. How have you been... 
                        since 2008?

                                 AMANDA
                        Nothing -- Sorry. Ahhhh! 
                           (recovering)
                        I’m good. Sorry, I’m just -- what 
                        are you doing in town?

           The Mover STARES at her, bored, unblinking. 

                                 GAVIN
                        We just sold Green Synergy to 
                        Google. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You sold your company to Google?! 
                        Wow, so, you’re doing terrible. 

                                 GAVIN
                           (laughs)
                        Yeah. Life is tough. 
                           (nods towards a townhouse)
                        So, I just bought this place. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You’re moving back? I thought you 
                        loved Hong Kong.

                                 GAVIN
                        I do, I guess there’s certain 
                        things you just start to miss about 
                        home... I was wondering if I might 
                        run into you sometime... Are you 
                        still working for Grace?

                                 AMANDA
                        Me? Oh, no, no. I mean, I am but 
                        I’m a designer now. I was promoted!

                                 GAVIN
                        That’s great. Is business good?

                                 AMANDA
                        It’s great! A dream! I’m still 
                        working on getting clients but I 
                        have some leads. 

                                 GAVIN
                           (less impressed)
                        Ah, well, good for you.  

           ...Was that pity?
                                 AMANDA
                        And I’m engaged! 

           Gavin LOOKS at her ring-less FINGER. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Almost engaged. He’s a billionaire. 

                                 GAVIN
                           (disbelieving)
                        A billionaire, really?

                                 AMANDA
                        Or a zillionaire. I don’t know how 
                        many zeros there are. 

           Amanda DIES inside, did not mean to say that. The Mover 
           SMIRKS, then quickly LOOKS AWAY.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Okay, well, crazy to see you.

           He NODS, as cool as ever. 

                                 GAVIN
                        It was good to see you, Amanda.  

           They HOVER AWKWARDLY a moment, unsure whether to hug. She 
           puts up a HI-FIVE and then HURRIES OFF with her BROKEN CART.

           Push. Thunk. Stop. Push. Thunk. Stop. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (cringes to herself)
                        I don’t know how many zeros there 
                        are??

           Once around the CORNER, she stops, LOOKS down at her HANDS. 
           They’re TREMBLING. Her heart is RACING. 

           INT. VINTAGE FURNITURE STORE - DAY

           Kelsey and Amanda SHOP for a chest of drawers. Amanda CHECKS 
           the price tag on an OAK DRESSER. 

                                 AMANDA
                        What do you think of this one?

                           (then)
                        So, has he aged well?
                                 AMANDA
                        Gavin? It’s only been four years. 
                        He looks... like Gavin... 
                           (begrudging)
                        Great. 

                                 KELSEY
                        Asshole. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I know, the nerve of that guy... I 
                        can’t believe he actually bought a 
                        place... Laying down roots, that’s 
                        huge for him.

                                 KELSEY
                        Yeah, although maybe when you have  
                        a lot of money, it’s not as big a 
                        deal.

           Amanda MOVES to another dresser. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (nonchalant)
                        Don’t you think it’s kind of weird 
                        timing?

                                 KELSEY
                        What do you mean?

                        I dunno, it just took years to get 
                        over him and now when I’m finally 
                        happy and taking the next step with 
                        someone-

                        Please, exes have a radar for that 
                        shit. They never come back when 
                        you’re in the middle of a dry 
                        spell. Otherwise, I’d be swimming 
                        in ex-boyfriends. They wait until 
                        your life’s just starting to go 
                        well and then they swoop back in 
                        and fuck it up. 
                           (nods to eavesdropping OLD 
                           WOMAN)
                        You know about the swooping. 

           The Old Woman looks startled. Amanda MOVES away for PRIVACY. 
                                 AMANDA
                        Well, Gavin’s not gonna swoop. And 
                        even if he did swoop, which he 
                        won’t, he couldn’t fuck anything 
                        up. That ship has sailed. 

           INT. AMANDA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - EVENING

           Amanda RACES in from work. She THROWS down her KEYS, weaves 
           around half-packed BOXES to CHANGE into a dress and earrings. 

           She can’t help herself - she GOES into her closet, SPIDERMANS 
           her way up the WALL to the top shelf to PULL DOWN... the 
           Gavin shoebox. She stares at it, unsure what to do with it. 

           Finally, she DROPS it ceremoniously in the trash. Good 
           riddance. She SLIPS into heels, GOES to leave - oh fuck, one 
           peek can’t hurt. 

           She hardens herself, TAKES the lid off the dusty BOX and 
           STARES inside. Three years of memories stare back.

           Suddenly - she sees a SPIDER has crawled onto her hand. She 
           SCREAMS and DANCES AROUND IN TERROR.  

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh-MyGod! Oh-MyGod!

           The spider SCURRIES under the BED. She BENDS down to GATHER 
           the scattered CONTENTS and picks up a NECKLACE... 

           INT. AMANDA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - FLASHBACK

           Gavin, 25, SITS in bed next to Amanda, 23, FIXING the broken 
           clasp of the same NECKLACE. He brushes her hair to one side, 
           puts the necklace on her. She SMILES at his TOUCH. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You fixed it.

           She turns and KISSES him. Wraps herself around him, wanting 
           him to stay. She’s cute - but there’s a tinge of desperation. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        I miss you. 

                                 GAVIN
                        I’m right here. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I know but you’re leaving. I miss 
                        you in the future. 
                                 GAVIN
                           (laughs at her)
                        I’m gonna be late. 

           He PULLS her off him and GETS out of BED.

           BACK TO PRESENT

           INT. AMANDA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - EVENING

           Amanda SITS down cross-legged, might as well get comfortable.

           She sorts through MEMENTOS - stoic - like an archeologist 
           observing the artifacts of a time gone by: the Barcelona 
           backpacking picture, tailgating at Cal, skiing in Tahoe... 

           She sees a BIRTHDAY CARD, glances at what she’s WRITTEN. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (reads, cringing)
                        “One pod, two peas, three years, 
                        four ever.” 
                           (laughs at herself)
                        So mortifying. 

           She unfolds a NAPKIN - Hog Island Oyster House. She INHALES 
           SHARPLY, her smile vanishing. This one hurts. 

           INT. HOG ISLAND OYSTER HOUSE - SUNSET - FLASHBACK

           A BUSTLING Happy Hour spot on the Marina. A COCKTAIL WAITRESS 
           sets down NAPKINS and BEERS in front of Amanda and Gavin.

                                 AMANDA
                           (mischievous)
                        What do you wanna do for your 
                        birthday?

                                 GAVIN
                        In a month? I don’t know. Don’t 
                        plan anything. It’s too far in 
                        advance. 

                                 AMANDA
                        It’s not that far. 

                                 GAVIN
                        You don’t need to plan anything. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m not doing a surprise party. 
                        It’ll be fun, I promise! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AMANDA (CONT'D)
                           (sees Gavin’s not amused)
                        ...What’s wrong?

           He TWISTS his BEER, debating if this is the right moment. 

                                 GAVIN
                        They asked me to run the Hong Kong 
                        office.

                                 AMANDA
                        Whoa - what’d you tell them?

                                 GAVIN
                        It’s a great opportunity. I mean...
                           (shrugs)
                        When else am I going to have the 
                        freedom to up and live in another 
                        country?

           She NODS, smooths and re-smooths the cocktail NAPKIN, like 
           her life depends on removing that crease.

                                 AMANDA
                           (swallows hard, weakly)
                        Yeah. I mean, we always talk about 
                        how life is meant for traveling and 
                        new experiences... 
                           (trying so much to be 
                           strong)
                        Are we breaking up?

           Pain PINCHES her face, tears SPILL down, veneer CRUMBLING. 

                                 GAVIN
                        No, no. 

           He REACHES for her hand. A RUNNER drops off the Oysters. 

                                 RUNNER
                        There you go. One order of “Get The 
                        Schuck Out.”

           Amanda composes herself, SMILES politely. 

                                 GAVIN
                        We don’t have to have this 
                        conversation right now. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Well, would we do long distance? 

                                 GAVIN
                           (softly)
                        I dunno. It’d be tough. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GAVIN (CONT'D)
                        I understand if you think it’s, ya 
                        know...   

                                 AMANDA
                           (swallows hard)
                        I mean, no, I wanna make it work... 
                        Do you want me to move there?

                                 GAVIN
                        Well, you’ve got your job. I 
                        wouldn’t want to ask you to move to 
                        another country. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (shrugs dismissively)
                        Well, an assistant...

                                 GAVIN
                        Right, I mean, you could come....

           He doesn’t mean it and she suddenly realizes it. 

                                 AMANDA
                        No. I should probably...

           She TURNS her face, can’t stop the TEARS now. Their oyster 
           plate sits there untouched. The Waitress COMES over.

                                 COCKTAIL WAITRESS
                        Is there anything else I can get 
                        you guys? Happy Hour is ending. 

           The Waitress suddenly notices Amanda SOBBING - backs away. 

           BACK TO PRESENT

           INT. AMANDA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - EVENING

           The last memory is enough to SOBER Amanda up for good. 

           A TEXT buzzes on her CELL from Brad: “Hey baby, we just got 
           to Elbo Room. You close?” 

           She suddenly feels SICK with herself for allowing this trip 
           down memory lane. She LUMPS everything back into the BOX, 
           CLOSES the LID and leaves it in the trash. She walks out. 

           EXT. ELBO ROOM - NIGHT

           A bar where hipster meets prepster. With a sprinkle of what-
           the-fuckster’s-up-with-that-guy? 
           INT. ELBO ROOM - NIGHT

           A band PLAYS. Amanda MOVES through the crowd. She PUSHES up 
           to the BAR. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Can I get a pitcher? 
                           (as an afterthought)
                        And four shots of Patron! Leave the 
                        tab open. 

           MOMENTS LATER, Amanda carries the DRINKS to Brad, Cousin Jim 
           and Nicky. Jim is RUBBING his JAW, mid-story. 

                                 COUSIN JIM
                        My jaw was hurting. I think I had 
                        TMZ. 

                                 BRAD
                           (laughs, playing along)
                        Don’t think you mean that. 

                                 COUSIN JIM
                        Yeah, TMZ. I had it for awhile and 
                        then I chilled the fuck out and was 
                        fine. 

           Amanda SETS down the DRINKS and they CHEER. 

                                 NICKY
                        Oh, it’s gonna be that kind of 
                        Monday night, alright. 

           Amanda SLIDES in beside Brad, kisses him, HOLDS up her SHOT. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Here’s to sending you off on your 
                        business trip with a hangover to 
                        remember us by...

           Everyone CLINKS glasses and DOWNS their drinks. 

                                 COUSIN JIM
                           (grunts, flexes his 
                           muscles)
                        Oh, yeah Facebook that, bitches. 
                           (different pose)
                        Instagram this!

           Brad LAUGHS. Amanda laughs - one beat off. She’s still 
           slightly RATTLED but she’s trying hard not to be. 
           MEG, 29, pretty, an old-time friend of Brad’s, comes up, 
           wraps Brad in a HUG. She clearly holds a torch for him but 
           Amanda seems more amused than threatened. 

                                 MEG
                        Brad?! Hiiiiii! 

                                 BRAD
                        Mego my Eggo! Ain’t to proud to 
                        Meg! What are you doing here?

                                 MEG
                        I represent the band!

                                 COUSIN JIM
                        We seeing you camping next weekend?

                                 MEG
                        Of course. Never miss it. 
                           (still hugging Brad, 
                           whispers, annoyed re:)
                        Ohmygosh, Guy-in-Red-Shirt-behind-
                        me won’t leave me alone... 

           Everyone casually GLANCES at the clueless average-looking GUY 
           HOVERING nearby. 

                                 BRAD
                        Here, sit with us. Have my seat. 
                           (stands up)
                        I have to use the bathroom.

                                 COUSIN JIM
                           (also standing)
                        Crap, now I can’t go. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Why not?

                                 COUSIN JIM
                        It’s weird. 

                                 NICKY
                        Just go to the bathroom, you big 
                        dumb animal. 

                                 BRAD
                        Come on, we’ll talk about boys and 
                        whose outfits we hate. 

           The guys LEAVE. Meg SITS with the girls. 
                                 MEG
                           (hand to her heart)
                        I have to say, Brad is such a good 
                        guy! I’ve known him since 
                        elementary school. He’s literally 
                        one of my favorite people on the 
                        planet. 

                                 NICKY
                        I’d drop Jim for him. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Do I need to fight you guys? Is 
                        this happening right now?  

                                 MEG
                        I’m not saying he’s not lucky to 
                        have you because I don’t know you 
                        as well, but you’re lucky to have 
                        him.

                                 NICKY
                        Well, Amanda and Brad are perfect 
                        for each other. I’ve never seen two 
                        people make so many nerdy puns.

                                 AMANDA
                        He does think I have “nice puns.” 

           Nicky LAUGHS. 

                                 NICKY
                        Nice one!

           Meg doesn’t get it. 

                                 MEG
                        He’s just one of those good-to-the-
                        core guys you can’t find, anymore. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (sincerely)
                        Yeah. He’s pretty great.   

           Amanda LOOKS across the bar at him, smiles. 

                                 NICKY
                        And he’s hot. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (points at Nicky)
                        Hey, cool your jets.
           EXT. ELBO ROOM - NIGHT

           It’s RAINING. Nicky, Jim, Amanda and Brad bid hasty GOODBYES. 

           Amanda can’t take her eyes off Brad, pulls him coyly towards 
           a cab. Jealousy is always a nice aphrodisiac.

           INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS

           Amanda and Brad drunkenly SCOOT in. 

                                 BRAD
                        Bush and Van Ness. 

           Spin Doctors’s “Two Princes” is playing. They CHEER.

                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        Can you turn it up please, good 
                        sir?

           Brad starts SINGING along, missing most of the WORDS but 
           having the drunk time of his life. Amanda can’t help but JOIN 
           in to his CONTAGIOUS RENDITION. 

                                 AMANDA AND BRAD
                        ...This one got a princely racquet, 
                        that’s what I said now! Got some 
                        big seal upon his jacket! You marry 
                        him, your father will condone you. 
                        Marry me, your father will disown 
                        you. 

                                 BRAD
                        Marry him or marry me, I’m the one 
                        who loves you baby, can’t you see! 

           The irony of those LYRICS aren’t lost on Amanda. She beams, 
           watching him - this is her guy. Brad gives the fist-
           microphone to the INDIAN CABBIE and to their shock and 
           delight, he SINGS every line spot on. 

                                 INDIAN CABBIE
                        I ain’t got no future or family 
                        tree! I know what a prince and 
                        lover oughtta be. I know what a 
                        prince and lover oughtta be.

           Amanda passionately PUSHES Brad against the SEAT, kissing 
           him. And as we hit the CHORUS, we...

                                                     SMASH CUT TO:
           INT. BRAD’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A typical messy guy apartment. Amanda and Brad BURST in, 
           TEARING clothes off, CRASHING onto the bed. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Boots! Boots!

           She puts her LEGS up as he PULLS off her BOOTS, pushes books, 
           laundry to the floor. Something’s still under her - she rolls 
           over, LAUGHS as he finds a SQUASHED BANANA, throws that, too. 

           And they make glorious PG-13 Rated love. 

           INT. BRAD’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

           SFX: an iPhone Alarm buzzes... Brad and Amanda WAKE.

                                 BRAD
                        I don’t see any reason I should get 
                        out of this bed. Not one reason. 

           He DRAPES his leg on her BACK. She giggles sleepily. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Forget your tech conference. Let’s 
                        go to Paris and eat croissants. 

                                 BRAD
                           (calls out)
                        Pierre, fire up the jets!

           A bit they play. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (calls out)
                        Pierre! The jets!
                           (softly)
                        I hope he heard us. 

                                 BRAD
                        Just as well, you have to work on 
                        finding clients. 

           Amanda GROANS, not excited. Brad DRINKS a glass of water, 
           passes it to Amanda who FINISHES it. She puts it on her side 
           of the NIGHT STAND, looks at a “SEE-NO-EVIL” MONKEY 
           KNICKKNACK, picks it up. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Where’s this guy’s friends? The 
                        hear-no-evil and speak-no-evil 
                        guys?
                                 BRAD
                           (jokes)
                        Never heard of ‘em. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Where’d you get it?

                                 BRAD
                        He just appeared one day. He seemed 
                        like he had an important message so 
                        I kept him.  

                                 AMANDA
                        I hate to break it to you but some 
                        of these prized possessions may 
                        need to go before I move in. It may 
                        be this bad boy’s time. 

                                 BRAD
                        No way! I don’t want to suddenly 
                        start seeing evil. That could be 
                        disaster!

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m sorry but there’s just not room 
                        in this apartment for the both of 
                        us. You have to choose. 

                                 BRAD
                        Don’t put monkey in the middle! 

           She LAUGHS. He holds her closer.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        I’m gonna miss you this week. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (lovingly)
                        It’s nice to have someone miss you. 

                                 BRAD
                        It’s nice to have you!

           She LOOKS at him seriously. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I feel lucky I wound up with you. 
                           (beat, grins impishly)
                        But the monkey’s gone!

           She GRABS the monkey, DASHES out of bed. Brad gives chase. 

                                 BRAD
                        No way!
                                 AMANDA

                           hysterically)
                        No! No! No!

           He tosses her BACK ONTO THE BED.

           INT. SUNDELL DESIGN FIRM - MORNING

           Amanda ARRIVES at her office - a boutique decorating agency - 
           photos of past projects line the wall. She sees Grace YELLING 
           from her office to the Assistant at her desk. 

                                 GRACE (O.S.)
                        Get Tom back on the phone. I lost 
                        him. Now. Now! What is taking so 
                        long?!

           The Assistant accidentally PRESSES Intercom. BEEP. BEEP. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                           (shaky voice)
                        Hi Tom, I have Grace for you again. 

                                 GRACE (O.S.)
                           (into phone)
                        Sorry about that, darling...
                           (calls out to Assistant)
                        Need a coffee. 
                           (into phone)
                        This is Grace Sundell, who’s this? 
                        Oh, what a pleasant surprise, my 
                        assistant dialed the wrong Tom... 

           The Assistant’s eyes grow big, about to have a nervous 
           breakdown, as she starts scouring the computer contacts. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I think you might’ve just called 
                        her ex-husband. 

                                 GRACE (O.S.)
                        No, I promoted Amanda to 
                        designer... Yeah, she was supposed 
                        to train her replacement. 
                           (pause)
                        I wouldn’t want to work for you 
                        either, asshole. 
                                 AMANDA
                        You definitely called her ex-
                        husband. 

           Grace HANGS UP. 

                                 GRACE (O.S.)
                        Amanda?

           Amanda timidly walks INTO GRACE’S OFFICE.

                                 AMANDA
                        Good morning, Grace. 

                                 GRACE
                        Where are you on bringing in 
                        clients?

                                 AMANDA
                           (rubs her neck, preparing 
                           her lie)
                        I have some leads I’ve been 
                        sniffing out-

                                 GRACE
                        Okay, clearly, sniffing around is 
                        not getting you anywhere because 
                        you have no clients. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (treading carefully)
                        Well, I’m trying to, but I’ve just 
                        missed out on a few opportunities-

                                 GRACE
                        So, don’t miss out on them! 

                                 AMANDA
                        Well, no, I don’t want to miss out 
                        on them. It’s just been a little 
                        difficult to juggle still doing 
                        some assistant work. 

                                 GRACE
                        Look, you and I are a team. We’re a 
                        success if you’re a success.
                           (then)
                        But if you’re a failure, that’s 
                        just you and you’ll wind up back on 
                        that desk. So don’t fail. 
                           (to Assistant)
                        Where’s Tom?!!

           Amanda nods, walks out. 
           RECEPTION AREA

           She passes the Assistant, hears her office phone RINGING.

                                 AMANDA
                           (to Assistant)
                        Is that my phone?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Oh sorry, I just transferred it! I 
                        think it’s a client returning your 
                        call?

           Amanda RUNS. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Shit...!

           INT. SUNDELL DESIGN FIRM - AMANDA’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Amanda FLINGS SHUT the door, takes a moment, CLEARS her 
           throat and ANSWERS in her most professional voice. 

                                 AMANDA

                           (pause)
                        This might be weird but I was 
                        thinking... I don’t know any 
                        decorators and you don’t have any 
                        clients. Why don’t you decorate my 
                        place? It could be mutually 
                        beneficial. 

           Amanda COVERS her mouth, stunned - the gull of this guy. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (muffled)
                        Oh, wow. Umm. Ooh. 
           Gavin LAUGHS, always in perfect control. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Sorry, was there an answer in 
                        there?

                                 AMANDA

                                 GAVIN (ON PHONE)
                        Hey, if it’s too weird, I get it. 

           Amanda BLOWS out her lips in a WEIRD GUNSHOT NOISE, still 
           unable to form a sentence. 

                                 GAVIN (CONT’D)
                        I was going to start furnishing 
                        this week and I’d love to get 
                        someone’s help before I start 
                        mixing my neoclassics with my post-

           Amanda looks across the hall at Grace IN HER OFFICE. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (thinking... thinking...)
                        No, I’ll do it. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Great. Wanna come by tomorrow at

                                 AMANDA
                        Ten it is.

           Amanda HANGS UP. She LOOKS at the PICTURE of Brad beside her 
           computer, puts her head in her hands.

                        That’s not true, I just like to buy 
                        domestic. We need to bring jobs 
                        back to America. 
                           (off Kelsey’s look)
                        Okay, I know it’s not an ideal 
                        situation but I don’t have any 
                        other options. And it’s not like 
                        I’d get back with him. I love Brad. 
                        And honestly, I still feel a lot of 
                        anger towards Gavin. Part of me 
                        wouldn’t mind punching him 
                        repeatedly in the face. 

                                 KELSEY
                        I’ll allow this.  
                                 AMANDA
                        But - it’s because I never fully 
                        understood what happened. Maybe at 
                        some point we could finally have an 
                        honest conversation about it, ya 
                        know, find closure. Anyway, I 
                        already accepted the job so...  

                                 KELSEY
                        You could still punch him.  

                                 AMANDA
                        I’ll keep that in mind. 

           Kelsey sips from the measuring cup. It spills down her face.  

                                 KELSEY
                           (nods)
                        That was better in theory.

           EXT. GAVIN’S TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

           Amanda comes up to the brownstone and BUZZES. She straightens 
           her skirt, waits nervously. 

                                 GAVIN (O.C.)
                        Hello?

                                 AMANDA
                        It’s me. 
                           (then)
                        Amanda? 
                           (silence)
                        Hutchins?
                           (silence)
                        We dated for three years??

                                 GAVIN
                           (laughs)
                        The buzzer wasn’t working. 

           The door BUZZES open and she HEADS upstairs, frustrated. 

           INT. GAVIN’S TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

           Gavin OPENS the door for Amanda, BUTTONING his shirt. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Sorry, I just got outta the shower. 
                                 AMANDA
                           (under breath)
                        Of course you did. 
                           (then)
                        That’s a great view. 
                           (off his grin)
                        I meant the window. 

           He has ridiculous abs, in case you couldn’t guess. She 
           purposefully walks past him towards the Bay Window. There’s a 
           BREATH-TAKING VIEW of Pac Heights and The Golden Gate Bridge.

           She SIZES UP the place. It’s UNFURNISHED, spare a few BOXES. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Well, there’s a lot we can do to 
                        maximize the light and spacing and 
                        flow here. Like, I wouldn’t put 
                        anything in this area, just keep it 
                        open, so the first thing people see 
                        when they walk in, isn’t a piece of 
                        furniture, it’s the ocean. That’s 
                        what you paid for. That’s what your 
                        centerpiece should be. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Yeah. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Do you have any particular color 
                        schemes in mind? Or motifs? I could 
                        see modern. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Amanda?

                                 AMANDA
                        Maybe nautical. Yeah?

                                 GAVIN
                        Hi. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Hello. 

                                 GAVIN
                        How are you?

                                 AMANDA
                        Good. You?

                                 GAVIN
                        I can’t believe you’re here right 
                        now. 
           Amanda nods, rigidly, moves on. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I might just take a few 
                        measurements. 

           INT. GAVIN’S TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Amanda REACHES over the INFLATABLE MATTRESS to MEASURE from 
           the wall. Gavin can’t help but notice her bent over. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I can’t believe you bought a flat 
                        screen before you bought a bed.

                                 GAVIN
                        I had the cable and internet set up 
                        before I had flooring. A guy’s 
                        gotta have priorities, right?

                                 AMANDA
                        And you didn’t want to have any of 
                        your things shipped from Hong Kong?

           Gavin is so caught up STARING at AMANDA’S BUTT, he doesn’t 
           notice she’s now SCOWLING AT HIM. No chance, buddy. 

           She STANDS, SNAPS back the measuring tape, WALKS off. 

           EXT. TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

           Gavin walks Amanda down the stairs. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Why don’t I put together a 
                        presentation to give you a sense of 
                        a few different looks?

                                 GAVIN
                        Sounds great.

                                 AMANDA
                        And we should talk about what 
                        you’re looking to spend. 

                                 GAVIN
                        I don’t know. I trust you’ll get me 
                        the best stuff for the best price. 
                        But I don’t need a lot, I’m more, 
                        ya know...
                                 AMANDA
                        Minimalist, I remember. Okay, well, 
                        first order of business is getting 
                        you a mattress that you don’t have 
                        to inflate halfway through the 
                        night. And then we’ll set up a time 
                        for you to come by the office.

           She PUTS on her SUNGLASSES. He LAUGHS a little. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                           (suddenly self-conscious)
                        What?

                                 GAVIN
                        You just seem different, I dunno.

                                 AMANDA
                        More formal?

                                 GAVIN
                        More confident I guess. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Maybe I’m just wiser now.

           She walks away, SUPER CONFIDENT. Trips. She plays it off.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, they should really... that’s a 
                        hazard...

           She KICKS the ROCK out of the way to make her point.

           INT. SUNDELL DESIGN FIRM - DAY

           Amanda enters, passes the Assistant. 

                                 AMANDA
                        How’s it going?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        I think I’m getting fired. 

                                 AMANDA

           Amanda walks INTO GRACE’S OFFICE.

                        Fire her.

                                 AMANDA
                        She’s just starting to settle in. 

                                 GRACE
                        She’s a giant idiot. And she’s so 
                        mousey and boring, she’s not even 
                        fun to yell at.

                                 AMANDA
                        What if we keep her until we get 
                        someone else who might be more fun 
                        to yell at?

                                 GRACE
                        She’s ruining this company. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Ruining the company or annoying 
                        you?
                           (off Grace’s look)
                        ...I’m on it.

                        Replacement Number Three bit the 
                        dust today. How am I supposed to

                        time replacing my replacements?

           Amanda sits at her computer, working on the Gavin 
           presentation on AutoCAD, selecting colors, fabrics, looks.

           Gavin HOLDS the door open for Amanda as they WALK IN -- 

           INT. FURNITURE STORE - DAY

           Amanda LEADS Gavin to the mattress section, PATS ONE --

                        Tempur-Pedic and Pillowtop are both 
                        great, but this is my favorite. 
                                 GAVIN
                        I won’t ask how you’ve done the 
                        research. 

           A MATTRESS SALES WOMAN bounces up. 

                                 SALES WOMAN
                        Oh no, you gotta lay on it! That’s 
                        the only way you’re gonna know! 

           Gavin SCOOTS back to lay down. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Go ahead. I don’t need-

                        It’s the keys to your very own 
                        snoozemobile. Customers come back 
                        all the time and tell me it’s the 
                        stuff dreams are made of. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Customers come all the way back 
                        just to say that?

           Amanda uses this DISTRACTION to STUDY HIM -- his toned arms, 
           his casual but expensive style, his peek-a-boo dimples. 

                                 SALES WOMAN
                        And if you buy today, you get not 
                        one Tempur-Pedic pillow. Not two 
                        Tempur-Pedic pillows. Say it with 
                        me... 

                                 GAVIN
                        Three Tempur-Pedic pillows?

                                 SALES WOMAN
                        Not three Tempur-Pedic pillows! 
                        Four Tempur-Pedic pillows!

           He GLANCES over, Amanda pretends she wasn’t checking him out.

                                 AMANDA
                        Those pillows are kind of magical.
                                 SALES WOMAN
                        See, if she’s happy in bed, you’re 
                        happy in bed, am I right? Now try 
                        not to fall asleep, you two, and 
                        let me know if you have any 
                        questions!

                        -friennnnd... Mattress people are 
                        like the used cars salesmen of

                                 GAVIN
                        She makes me want to shop online.  

           They LAUGH. He looks over at her lying beside him. 

                                 GAVIN (CONT’D)
                        I remember this. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah, except for the entire Mexican 
                        family staring at us right now. 

           He LOOKS over at a SEMICIRCLE OF MEXICANS watching them. 

                                 GAVIN
                           (smiles, then)
                        I gotta say, of the problems we 
                        used to have, the bedroom was never 
                        one of them. 

           She SITS UP, shuts him down cold --  

                                 AMANDA
                        Well, we had plenty other ones to 
                        make up for it. Come on, I’m here 
                        to work. 

           EXT. POLK STREET - DAY

           Amanda walks home, her cell BUZZES. 

           INSERT TEXT - BRAD, “I miss you.”

           She smiles, stops. She writes back, “I miss you too.” 
           He writes, “How is your new client??”

           She hesitates, types back, “You wouldn’t believe it but...” 
           and then DELETES it. She starts again, “I actually ended up 
           knowing him from... “ She DELETES. She stares at her phone. 

           She finally settles on, “So far so good.” She pockets her 
           phone and keeps walking. 

           INT. SUNDELL DESIGN FIRM - THE NEXT DAY

           Kelsey sits at her desk. Gavin enters. Her eyes narrow. 

                                 KELSEY
                        Of all the interior design firms in 
                        all the world, you had to walk into 
                        ours. 

           He smiles wryly, never her biggest fan either. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Kelsey, always a pleasure.

                           (sizes him up)
                        I see you’ve really let yourself 
                        go. 
                           (stands up, overly cheery)
                        This way. 

           She LEADS him INTO AMANDA’S OFFICE. Amanda LOOKS up. 

                                 KELSEY (CONT’D)
                        Your twelve o’clock has arrived. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Is it fair to assume we all know my 
                        name?

                                 KELSEY
                           (ignoring him)
                        Remember, you have a thing in 
                        fifteen minutes.

                                 AMANDA
                        What thing?

                                 KELSEY
                        That important meeting thing 
                        appointment. I could push it to 
                        twenty minutes but that’s it. 
                           (glances at bare wrist)
                        Ope, nineteen. Better hurry. 
           Kelsey TURNS on her heel and LEAVES. Amanda smirks, shrugs, 
           it’s clear Kelsey’s full of shit. 

           INT. SUNDELL DESIGN FIRM - AMANDA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Amanda shows Gavin a DIGITIZED DESIGN of his TOWNHOUSE on her 
           COMPUTER. It shows everything from the WALL COLOR to the 
           FURNITURE and LAYOUT. 

                                 AMANDA
                        For the master, I was thinking we 
                        could do a forest green to tie in 
                        the trees of the park outside and 
                        give it a rich, masculine feel. 

                                 GAVIN
                           (jokingly suave)
                        Sounds fitting. 

           Amanda ignores this, CLICKS -- the walls on the layout turn 
           navy blue. Kelsey SNEAKS PAST for a peek. Amanda 
           conspicuously SHOOS her away. Kelsey gives the MIDDLE FINGER.

                                 AMANDA
                        Navy would also look nice. Or, if 
                        you want borders... 

           She CLICKS and the walls become half tan, half navy. 

                                 GAVIN
                           (impressed)
                        What is this? Standard AutoCAD? 

                                 AMANDA
                           (proud)
                        My boyfriend, Brad, is a software 
                        developer so he customized it for 
                        me. 

           Amanda sees Gavin GLANCE at the picture of her with Brad. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Is that Brad? Bradley?

                                 AMANDA
                        Yep. 

                                 GAVIN
                        He looks like a Brad. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Well, he is a Brad. He’s a great 
                        Brad. 
           She tensely DRAGS a BED GRAPHIC to the other side of the 
           Master - just for something to do. He watches her.

                                 GAVIN
                        I have a proposal for you. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Might be a few years too late on 
                        that one, sorry.

           Gavin LAUGHS at her zing.

                                 GAVIN
                        Hey, I knew you still had that 
                        sense of humor...
                           (beat)
                        Look, things don’t have to be weird 
                        between us. I’m sure I have a lot 
                        of apologizing to do for the way I 
                        was when we were dating. But if 
                        we’re gonna be working together, 
                        why don’t we put it behind us, 
                        declare a truce? 
                           (holds out his hand)
                        Un-awkward friends?

           Four years of anger come down TO THIS MOMENT. She sees Kelsey 
           PEEPING from her desk... 

           Amanda DECIDES -- she nods, shakes his hand. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Un-awkward associates. 

                                 GAVIN
                        I’ll take it. 

           Kelsey is leaning so far back in her chair, SPYING, she 
           tumbles backwards to the floor. 

                                 KELSEY (O.S.)
                        Christ on a bike. 

           Gavin looks but doesn’t see. Amanda smiles at him, covering, 
           like nothing happened. 

           INT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - EVENING

                        I don’t even know what that means 
                        but my stance remains. 

                                 AMANDA
                        He’s my only client. I just think 
                        we can put the past behind us and 
                        be friendly at least.

                                 AMANDA
                        That sounds like a Kelsey-Fact, not 
                        a Real-World-Fact. Tons of people 
                        are friends with exes. 

                                 KELSEY
                        The only kind of ex you can be 
                        friends with is the kind you broke 
                        up with because you both mutually 
                        agreed there’s no chemistry. Zorro, 
                        here, doesn’t qualify. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Well, I think it shows I’m over him 
                        that we can. Plus I’m in a 
                        relationship so the rule shouldn’t 
                        apply. 

                                 KELSEY
                        Nope, it’s a lifelong rule, it 
                        never changes. I’m telling you, if 
                        you want him to be your client and 
                        treat him like an “acquaintance 
                        with history,” fine, but once you 
                        start loosening up and acting like 
                        friends, the more lines get 
                        blurred.

                        dinner and a movie but saying it 
                        doesn’t count as a date because

                                 GAVIN
                        Maybe that’s why I feel so at home. 

           He CARESSES it. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (disgusted)
                        It’s like Furniture Porn. Not 
                        happening.
           She shakes her head, WALKS OFF. He grins.

           ...Amanda POINTS OUT PIECES to Gavin and he NODS - rug, 
           dining room table, chairs.  

           ...Amanda DIRECTS MOVERS carrying FURNITURE into Gavin’s.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Armoire’s to the right. Mattress 
                        and headboard’s second door on the 
                        left. Back it up, back it up, don’t 
                        scrape.

           ...Amanda and Gavin sit in VARIOUS COUCHES. Can’t pick one. 

           ...Amidst the chaos of MOVERS, Amanda ACCESSORIZES 
           knickknacks IN THE LIVING ROOM: She looks up; she’s TRAPPED 
           behind a WALL OF FURNITURE. Gavin acts oblivious. She looks 
           at him - oh, it’s on, buddy.

           ...Gavin carefully PAINTS beneath the crowning of THE 
           BATHROOM. A bit of paint DRIPS down his head. He looks up, 
           startled. Amanda’s HOLDING THE ROLLER over him. She 
           suppresses a wicked smile. 

           ...More shopping, More movers, More chaos. 

           ...Amanda and Gavin stand in a COUCH WAREHOUSE. A mile of 
           couches. They FLOP DOWN exhausted. 

           INT. GAVIN’S TOWNHOUSE - EVENING

           The place is ALMOST FINISHED. Gavin is half-watching the Red 
           Sox on TV while HANGING PICTURES. 

                                 GAVIN
                           (re: game)
                        Oh, come on! He was safe!

           Amanda SITS DOWN in the EMPTY SPACE WHERE A COUCH SHOULD GO, 
           PICKING through a BOX of his PICTURES. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (sarcastic)
                        You know what would go great here?

                                 GAVIN
                        A couch?

                                 AMANDA
                        Just imagine, sitting a few feet 
                        off the ground. Stretching the 
                        legs.
                                 GAVIN
                        It’s a big decision. I don’t want 
                        to rush into anything. 

           She rolls her eyes, PULLS out a PICTURE -- A beautiful woman 
           on a boat in Hong Kong. Amanda GIVES it to him to hang. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Did you take this?

                                 GAVIN
                           (nods)
                        It’s Hong Kong. A group of us were 
                        on a junk boat. Which, by the way, 
                        is the opposite of what you’d think 
                        that means. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (nonchalant)
                        Was that your girlfriend?

                                 GAVIN
                        Just a friend. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (teases)
                        Did she think she was just a 
                        friend?

                                 GAVIN
                        I hope so or her husband would be 
                        pissed. 

           She NODS, secretly pleased. PICKS UP one of a waterfall. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Where’s this one?

                                 GAVIN
                        Victoria Falls. Zambia. Bungee 
                        jumped. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You jumped this? Have you no 
                        survival instincts?!

                                 GAVIN
                        Made sense at the time. Until I had 
                        to walk all the way back up to get 
                        my clothes. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (laughs)
                        You bungee jumped this naked?!
           He grins - HANGS it up. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        You definitely live the life, don’t 
                        you?

                                 GAVIN
                        Isn’t that what it’s all about?

           She SHRUGS - this is a sore subject for her. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Used to think that. I guess I think 
                        there’s something to be said about 
                        making a home somewhere. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Well, looks like you’re helping me 
                        do that now. Just in different 
                        circumstances than we might have 
                        thought four years ago.

                                 AMANDA
                        Life is funny, isn’t it?

           Amanda LOOKS at a picture -- A woman with a pink sarong 
           blowing in the wind - it’s Amanda.  

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Is that me?

                                 GAVIN
                        The bar in the middle of the ocean, 
                        remember?

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah. You’re hanging it?

                                 GAVIN
                        Why not?

                                 AMANDA
                        I dunno, bad feng shui to have a 
                        picture of an ex up?

                                 GAVIN
                        Why, it was a great memory. 

                                 AMANDA
                        It was a pretty good trip. Except 
                        for the part where I bought the 
                        crumbly brownie off that guy on the 
                        beach. 
                                 GAVIN
                        Oh yeah, I still can’t believe you 
                        did that. He, like, pulled it out 
                        of his pocket and had sand in it.  

                                 AMANDA
                        I didn’t know! I thought that’s how 
                        it works. 

           They enjoy a good LAUGH. Gavin GLANCES at the TIME. 

                                 GAVIN
                        It’s almost seven. Do you wanna 
                        grab a bite somewhere?

                                 AMANDA
                        Nah, I better go. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Sure? 

           She SIGHS, stands to leave. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah, I gotta. 

                                 GAVIN
                           (teases)
                        Was it something I said?

           Amanda smiles, GATHERS her things, hands him the PICTURE --

                                 AMANDA
                        Can you believe that was the last 
                        trip I took?

                                 GAVIN
                        Jamaica? That was four and a half 
                        years ago. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Brad and I just haven’t had the 
                        chance. 

                                 GAVIN
                        You always have the chance. You 
                        could book a flight right now. Go 
                        anywhere you want. 

           Amanda nods, noncommittal. 

                                 GAVIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious. The world could end 
                        tomorrow. What are you waiting for?
           INT. AMANDA’S APARTMENT - AMANDA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Amanda eats TAKE-OUT and drinks WINE from a measuring cup as 
           she LOOKS ONLINE at trips to Paris. CLICKS through glamorous 
           pictures of the streets, the shops, the sights. 

           Amanda’s Google “Hang Out” session rings. She ANSWERS, Brad’s 
           face appears. He’s in bed at his hotel. 

                                 BRAD
                        Greetings earthling. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Hey! How’s the tech conference?

                                 BRAD 
                        Oh man, nerds everywhere. 

                                 AMANDA
                        So, you fit right in. 

           He CLICKS an icon so that huge glasses appear on his face. 

                                 BRAD
                        Not as well as you would. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (laughs)
                        How’d you do that?!

           She CLICKS an icon so that CLOWN HAIR appears on her head. 
           They start playing around: Indian headpiece, goatee...

           Brad makes a HALO appear. He MOVES HIS HEAD SIDE TO SIDE and 
           the halo comically chases him. 

                                 BRAD
                        Get offa me!

           She CLICKS on a BERET. 

                                 AMANDA
                        So... you know how we always talk 
                        about going to ze’ Paris?

                                 BRAD
                        Yes?  

                                 AMANDA
                        I was just browsing the interweb. 

                                 BRAD
                        Heard of it. 
                                 AMANDA
                        And I found a great deal that 
                        includes direct air, a romantic 
                        cruise on the Seine, and a boutique 
                        hotel in the seventh arrondissment.

                                 BRAD
                        You had me at... 
                           (butchers the French)
                        ...a-round-di-smah. 

                                 AMANDA
                        We should go for it. 

                                 BRAD 
                        I’d love to...
                           (sighs)
                        But I don’t know what days I can 
                        get off right now. I’m so 
                        exhausted, I can’t even think about 
                        traveling. And you just got a 
                        promotion. Could you even go?

                                 AMANDA
                        We always talk about going but when 
                        are we actually gonna go? 
                           (quietly)
                        The world could end tomorrow. 

                                 BRAD
                        Aw, we’ll go before the world ends, 
                        I promise.

                                 AMANDA
                        We don’t know that. The world 
                        doesn’t announce that kind of 
                        thing... We’ve never gone anywhere. 

                                 BRAD
                        Aww, babe. It’s just the 
                        circumstances. 
                           (yawns)
                        I have to go to sleep. I get up in 
                        six hours. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (sad)
                        Okay. 

           Amanda CLICKS off her BERET.

                                 BRAD
                        Hey. 
                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah?

                                 BRAD
                        See you at the Seine?

           Amanda smiles, SIGNS OFF. She looks down at the SHOEBOX in 
           the TRASH CAN. With her TOE, she LIFTS the LID off it. Sees 
           the Barcelona backpacking picture with Gavin. 

           She GUILTILY puts the lid back on. FINISHES her wine.

           INT. SUNDELL DESIGN FIRM - AMANDA’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Amanda sits at her desk. She BROWSES couches online, bored. 
           She sees a ridiculous pink one. She brightens. 

           She attaches the photo and emails Gavin, “Found your couch. 
           We should probably move quick on it.”

           She continues searching.

           A new email pops up on her computer. It’s from Gavin. 
           “Already found one on Fillmore. Good price, too.”

           She opens it and there’s a PHOTO of a hideous, taped, stained 
           60’s yellow, green couch with a DRUNK asleep on it. 

           She writes back, “Pretty sure you had that couch in college.”

           INTERCUT WITH... 

           Kelsey WATCHES from her desk, sees Amanda SMILING to herself. 

           AMANDA’S DESK

           Another Gavin email pops up. “Couldn’t be - we tore up that 
           one pretty good.”

           Amanda freezes, BITES back a smile and before she can think 
           better of it, she responds, “Is that what that stain is???” 
           She cringes at herself.

                        Or pink is another way to go. 

           Grandma nods, HAPPY. 

           EXT. GRANDMA THORA’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - EVENING

           Grandma CARRIES out TEA to Amanda. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Thank you. 

                                 GRANDMA THORA
                        Did you know Dean and I came out 
                        here every night at six thirty for 
                        fifty two years?

                                 AMANDA
                        No, wow... 

                                 GRANDMA THORA
                        He’d have his after work whiskey 
                        and I wasn’t much of a drinker so 
                        I’d just sit with him. After he 
                        died, I kept doing it because if I 
                        didn’t do this at six thirty, what 
                        else would I do? 
                           (shrugs, sadly)
                        He passed away eight years ago and 
                        he’s still the framework to my 
                        life.  

           Amanda smiles, touched. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Did you always know he was The One?

                                 GRANDMA THORA
                        There wasn’t such a hullabaloo 
                        about that stuff back then.

                        Neither of us were looking for “The 
                        One.” We just liked sitting next to 
                        each other.  

           Amanda nods, contemplating this. 

           INT. AMANDA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Amanda sits ON THE FLOOR, surrounded by BOXES, talks to Brad 
           on her LAPTOP WEBCAM. 

                                 BRAD
                        Hi Pony Tail. You packing?

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah. Thank you for the lead with 
                        your Grandma. I needed it. 

                                 BRAD
                        Course. Anything for you. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Come home! I want to sit next to 
                        you... 

                                 BRAD
                           (smiles)
                        Tomorrow. 

           Amanda sighs, she can hold out one more day. 

           LATER, Amanda knocks on KELSEY’S DOOR. She sees Kelsey has 
           SAKS FIFTH AVENUE and BARNEYS’ shopping bags. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Did you go on a shopping spree?

                                 KELSEY
                        I’m going to Good Will. I like to 
                        get their hopes up when they see 
                        the bags and then they see it’s my 
                        old printer and spandex inside. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I just wanted to apologize, thank 
                        you, etcetera for earlier. I hit 
                        rock-crazy but I’m better now. 

                                 KELSEY
                        Etcetera accepted. 
                                 AMANDA
                        I think part of me just wanted 
                        Gavin to want me back so I could 
                        feel like I won in the end.  

                                 KELSEY
                        Well, you did win in the end. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah, I moved on and met a great 
                        guy. 

                                 KELSEY
                        No, I just meant Liz is a wack job. 
                        I would totally date you over her. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Right?! Thank you!
                           (then)
                        Well, this all served as a great 
                        reminder that he’ll always be the 
                        guy that pulls you in and then 
                        pushes you away. Any soft spot for 
                        a first love that I might have had 
                        is gone now. 

                                 KELSEY
                        Good. Then I guess you got what you 
                        came for.

                                 AMANDA
                        Definitely. 
                           (to herself)
                        Definitely. 

           So, why doesn’t she seem entirely resolved?

           INT. AMANDA’S APARTMENT - AMANDA’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Amanda STARES at the ceiling, trying to sleep. Her cell 
           RINGS: It’s Gavin. She debates, answers. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (tense)
                        Hello? 

                                 GAVIN (ON PHONE)
                           (cool, intimate)
                        Hey. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Hi...?
                                 GAVIN
                        Are you by yourself?

                                 AMANDA
                           (shakes head, exasperated, 
                           what does he want??)
                        ...Yeah. What’s up?

                                 GAVIN
                        You disappeared earlier. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I had to meet with another client. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Ah, so you’re too big for me now. I 
                        thought we were friends. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Un-awkward Associates. 
                           (light)
                        Liz is so talented at finding the 
                        piece de resistance, you hardly 
                        need any more help. 

           Gavin LAUGHS softly. 

                                 GAVIN (ON PHONE)
                        I’m sorry, she kind of took over.  

                                 AMANDA
                           (dismissive)
                        It’s your house, you can take 
                        whoever’s opinion you want. 

                                 GAVIN
                           (smiling)
                        I know she can seem flighty but 
                        she’s pretty smart. 

           She ROLLS OVER, tugging at a string on her comforter.

                                 AMANDA
                        I didn’t say she wasn’t. 
                           (can’t resist)
                        I just didn’t realize she was your 
                        type.

                                 GAVIN (ON PHONE)
                           (flirts)
                        Maybe she’s not. But they can’t all 
                        be Amanda Hutchins. 
                                 AMANDA
                           (scoffs)
                        Whatever. 

           What the fuck does that mean?

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        We’re pretty much done. All you 
                        need is a couch. It’d be more 
                        efficient if I just email you 
                        photos. It’s not worth you paying 
                        extra to have me be there in 
                        person. 

                                 GAVIN (ON PHONE)
                        It’s worth it to me. 

           She accidentally PULLS THE STRING so much a button falls off. 
           She realizes - stops. 

                                 GAVIN (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        So, I’ll see you tomorrow, right?

           Amanda hesitates, reluctant. But - what choice does she have? 

           INT. COUCH STORE - DAY

           Liz BOUNCES from couch to couch as Gavin and Amanda BROWSE.  

                                 LIZ
                        How do you choose?

                                 AMANDA
                           (ultra-professional mode)
                        The biggest rule in decorating is: 
                        You can drive yourself crazy with 
                        all the options. When you find one 
                        you love, you just have to go for 
                        it and trust you made the right 
                        choice. 

           Amanda SITS on a sleek, simple white sofa, PATS it. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        I think this is a great one. It’s 
                        beautiful, comfortable, classy... 

           He SITS beside her. 

                                 GAVIN
                        I do keep coming back to this one. 
                           (sotto)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GAVIN (CONT'D)
                        Although, it’s a toss-up between 
                        this and that couch I had from 
                        college - for sentimental reasons. 

           Gavin SMILES at Amanda. She GLANCES at him, SHAKES HER HEAD 
           bashfully. A small moment but Liz catches it. 

           Liz SQUISHES in close beside Gavin. A SALES WOMAN approaches. 

                                 SALES WOMAN
                        You guys are like three peas in a 
                        pod!

                                 AMANDA
                           (wants this over with)
                        So, do you wanna get this? Are we 
                        done?

                                 GAVIN
                        Yeah, think so. 

                                 LIZ
                        We’re done?! We’re done!

           Liz KISSES Gavin, excitedly. The weight SLIDES Amanda towards 
           them. Amanda STANDS, awkwardly. 

           Her cell RINGS. She ANSWERS, grateful for the distraction. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Excuse me a moment. 
                           (boasts)
                        It’s my boyfriend. He just got back 
                        in town. 

                                 LIZ
                           (relieved but playing it 
                           cool)
                        You have a boyfriend?

           Amanda WALKS AWAY for a sliver of privacy. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Welcome home!

           INTERCUT WITH...

           INT. SFO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - SAME

           Brad PULLS his LUGGAGE off the carousel. 
                                 BRAD
                        Babydoll! Why have I been gone so 
                        long?

                                 AMANDA
                        I don’t know!

           Liz FOLLOWS her, excitedly. 

                                 LIZ
                        I wanna talk to your guy! I wanna 
                        talk to him!

                                 BRAD
                        Can I take you out somewhere 
                        tonight?

                                 AMANDA
                        I would love that. Uchi’s opening 
                        tonight, the Japanese restaurant we 
                        just finished. 

                                 BRAD
                        Perfect. 

           Liz SNATCHES the phone. Amanda tries to GRAB it back. 

                                 LIZ
                        Hi Amanda’s boyfriend!! This is 
                        Liz, Gavin’s girlfriend!

                                 BRAD
                        Brad. 

                                 LIZ
                        Brad, your girlfriend has done an 
                        amazing job decorating. I think all 
                        four of us should go to Uchi 
                        tonight to celebrate.  

                                 AMANDA
                        No, no, I don’t think that’s - he’s 
                        tired -

                                 BRAD
                        Sure. 
                                 LIZ
                        See you at eight! 

           Liz HANGS UP, heads over to Gavin, JUMPS on him like a koala.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Baby, we’re going on a double date!

           He GLANCES at Amanda who is frozen in shock. 

           INT. SUNDELL DESIGN FIRM - EVENING

           Amanda PREPARES to leave. She sees Brad WALK IN. She STOPS - 
           BEAMS - he is a sight for sore eyes. 

           She RUNS OVER and KISSES him.  

                                 AMANDA
                        Hi! 

                                 GAVIN
                        I feel like I haven’t seen you in 
                        forever. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m so glad you’re back. 

           They head for the door, see Kelsey and Grace LAUGHING IN 
           GRACE’S OFFICE. 

                                 KELSEY
                        The blue is bullshit. 

                                 GRACE
                        I agree! Total bullshit. 

           Amanda’s never seen this before. She WAVES at them. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Bye guys. 

                                 KELSEY AND GRACE
                        Bye!

                                 GRACE
                           (to Kelsey)
                        But seriously, look at this one. 

                                 KELSEY
                        Not on my death bed!

                                 GRACE
                        Exactly! They’re fucking nuts!
           They LAUGH at their own little joke. Hell has clearly frozen 
           over. Amanda and Brad share a wry grin, WALK OUT. 

           INT. CAB - NIGHT

           Amanda and Brad SIT in the back, HOLDING HANDS. Despite all 
           that’s transpired, this is comfortable, nice. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (laughs)
                        I never saw that one coming. 

                                 BRAD
                        Has she been doing a good job?

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah, Kelsey’s a pain in my ass but 
                        she keeps me in line. 

                                 BRAD
                        Well, you know she always has your 
                        best interest in mind. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah... That she does. 

           EXT. UCHI - NIGHT

           A red carpet event for its grand opening. Bulbs FLASHING. 
           Brad holds the door open for Amanda, Liz and Gavin. 

                                 LIZ
                        This is so fun!

                                 BRAD
                           (to Gavin)
                        Yeah, I’m happy I get to finally 
                        meet Amanda’s client. 

           Amanda shares a quick “how awkward is this?” glance with 
           Gavin. Gavin waves Brad in, can hold his own door. 

           INT. UCHI - MOMENTS LATER

           A HOST guides them to a table, Liz looks around in awe. 

                                 LIZ
                        Oh my god, this place looks 
                        amazing. 
           Amanda smiles, flattered. Brad checks out the morning-star 
           sconces - there’s far fewer now. 

                                 BRAD
                           (whispers jovially)
                        Those the sconces?

           Amanda nods. Gavin NOTICES Brad double-squeeze Amanda’s hand.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                           (jokes)
                        You gonna offload the extras onto 
                        Grandma’s living room?

                                 AMANDA
                           (laughs, then)
                        She’s the best! Now that I’m 
                        finished with this other project, 
                        I’m excited I can really focus on 
                        her.  

           Gavin is LISTENING SO INTENTLY, he almost mows down Liz. He 
           puts his hands on Liz’s shoulders, steadying her. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Sorry!

           INT. UCHI - MINUTES LATER

           The WAITER pours sake as they LOOK over their menus. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Do you guys wanna try the umame?

                                 BRAD
                           (no way)
                        Is that the eel?

                                 GAVIN
                        It’s great. Have you ever had it?

                                 BRAD
                        Not really my thing. But go for it. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Nah, we can try to find something 
                        everyone likes. The octopus roll 
                        with smelt eggs sounds great. 

                                 BRAD
                           (laughs)
                        I’d rather open my mouth in the 
                        ocean and see what happens. 
                                 GAVIN
                        Not really the adventurous type, 
                        okay. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (intervenes)
                        He’s just not a big seafood guy. 

                                 LIZ
                        That’s okay, neither am I. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (changes subject, to Brad 
                           and Liz)
                        Did I mention you both work in 
                        software development?

                                 LIZ
                           (to Brad)
                        More or less. I do interface design 
                        and authoring for Zynga. 

                                 BRAD
                           (isn’t she cute)
                        Amanda thinks they’re the same 
                        thing. 

           Amanda gives an “excuse me, nerds” face, puts her hands up. 
           Gavin LAUGHS, sharing a SMILE with her. Brad and Liz’s 
           CONVERSATION takes off like a rocket. 

                                 LIZ
                        Where are you?

                                 BRAD
                        I’m at Apple.  

                                 LIZ
                        Oh that’s amazing! What division?

           INT. UCHI - BATHROOM / HALLWAY - LATER

           Amanda WASHES her hands, CHECKS HERSELF in the reflection. 
           She exits and BUMPS into Gavin IN THE HALLWAY. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Oops, sorry. 

                                 GAVIN
                           (quietly, moving slowly 
                           around her)
                        I like that dress on you. 
                                 AMANDA
                           (stares down)
                        Thank you. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Do you think these two have any 
                        idea how bizarre this is?

                                 AMANDA
                        Bizarre? I think it’s totally 
                        normal to go on a double date with 
                        the guy who dumped me and his new 
                        girlfriend.

                                 GAVIN
                        What do you mean?

                                 AMANDA
                        What do you mean what do I mean? 

                                 GAVIN
                        I didn’t dump you, Amanda. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Okay, I was there. I’m pretty sure 
                        you did. 

                                 GAVIN
                        I was there, too, and I’m telling 
                        you I didn’t. 

           Amanda’s world is CAVING IN. A BUSBOY passes by and she makes 
           room, trying to register this SHITSTORM of new information. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I don’t know if you’re trying to be 
                        nice or you’re fucking with me... 
                        but please stop this.  

           He closes in on her, putting his HAND against the WALL, 
           BLOCKING HER IN. Her breath catches. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Amanda, I-

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        Is this the line for the bathroom?

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh, no, I was just heading back to 
                        the table.

           Amanda turns, BUMPS into a WAITER, WALKS back to her seat, 
           still REELING. She sees Brad was left by himself.  
                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Aww, you got left by yourself. 

                                 BRAD
                           (slumps his shoulders, 
                           playing it up)
                        That’s okay. 

           She instinctively KISSES Brad’s cheek for being so cute but 
           it’s awkward with Gavin watching. 

           THE COCKTAIL AREA has converted from DINNER to NIGHTCLUB 
           CROWD. DANCE MUSIC comes up. Liz SITS down, LOOKS over. 

                                 LIZ
                        I love this song! Do you guys wanna 
                        dance?

                                 AMANDA
                           (glances at Brad)
                        Oh, Brad doesn’t...

                                 LIZ
                        Don’t worry, I need a lot of drinks 
                        to get out there. 
                           (calls out)
                        Bartender!

                                 BRAD
                        Unfortunately, there’s no amount of 
                        alcohol that can get me out there. 

                                 GAVIN
                        That’s too bad. Amanda loves 
                        dancing. 

           Amanda SHOOTS Gavin A LOOK. Brad LOOKS over at Amanda, 
           wondering how Gavin knows this. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Gavin and I knew each other back in 
                        college. That’s how I ended up 
                        working with him. 

                                 BRAD
                        Oh, I didn’t realize. 

                                 LIZ
                        Me either. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah, we ran into each other 
                        randomly a couple weeks ago. 
           The Waiter WALKS up. 

                                 WAITER
                        Can I interest you all in dessert?

                                 LIZ
                        Yes. 

           The Waiter CHUCKLES, lists off the choices as Amanda TUNES 
           OUT, glad to be out of the limelight. She WATCHES COUPLES 
           DANCING. TWIRLING, LAUGHING, GRINDING. 

           She gets LOST in the LYRICS, clutching her drink. She can 
           feel Gavin watching her. 

           As the music SWELLS, her eyes finally LOCK with his. He gives 
           her the smallest smile - a secret between them. 

           But she SHAKES her head - an almost imperceptible “no.” She 
           can’t. He hears her loud and clear, pulls back, looks away.

           INT. CAB - NIGHT

           Amanda and Brad RIDE HOME. Marvin Gaye’s “LET’S GET IT ON” is 
           on the RADIO. Awkwards-ville.

           INT. BRAD’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Brad UNDRESSES for bed. Amanda FLOPS on the bed, looks at the 
           SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY. Turns it to face the other way. 

                                 BRAD
                        That dinner was interesting. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah, Liz is a little weird but at 
                        least you had some stuff in common. 

                                 BRAD
                        Too bad for her, I guess. You’re 
                        the one I’m in love with. 

           Amanda SOFTENS, whatever resistance she was feeling melts. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You are?

                                 BRAD
                        Course.

                                 BRAD (CONT'D)
                        So, how did Gavin know you like to 
                        dance? Did you guys go dancing in 
                        college or something?

                                 AMANDA
                           (stalling)
                        I don’t ... know how he would have 
                        known that. We had astronomy 
                        together. We were lab partners.

                                 BRAD
                        Did you two ever date?

                                 AMANDA
                        Um. I mean, I think we might have 
                        gone out for a minute actually but 
                        I don’t think we ever went dancing. 

                                 BRAD
                        So, you dated.

           Amanda REELS the truth back in - he can’t handle it. 

                                 AMANDA
                        No, it was like - not even 
                        anything. 

                                 BRAD
                        And you didn’t tell me this? That 
                        you’re working with your ex-
                        boyfriend?

                                 AMANDA
                        He’s not - no, we maybe went on a 
                        couple dates. I barely even 
                        remember, it was so long ago. Brad - 

                                 BRAD
                        I’m at a loss for words... I don’t 
                        know what to say... I literally am 
                        speechless. 
                           (sees she’s suppressing a 
                           smile)
                        ...What?

                                 AMANDA
                           (cute)
                        Nothing. You just keep saying, “how 
                        you have nothing to say.” 

           He starts to WALK OFF. She unsuccessfully tries to WRESTLE 
           him to BED. 
                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        No! I’m sorry! I was just kidding! 
                        Come back!

           She SITS on the BED as he stands defiantly to the side. 

                                 BRAD
                        The way you described your client, 
                        I thought he was a random stranger. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Because he is to me now. Seriously.

                                 BRAD
                        Did you two ever have sex?

                                 AMANDA
                        No. Can we please drop it? We’re 
                        done working together.

                                 BRAD
                        I just wish you had told me. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I didn’t want to worry you for no 
                        reason. I’m sorry... You’re the one 
                        I love.

           He RELAXES, gets in bed beside her. 

                                 BRAD
                        We still on for our dinner cruise 
                        tomorrow?

                                 AMANDA
                        ...I wouldn’t miss it.  

           He KISSES her. She turns over to sleep, in TURMOIL.

           Amanda WRAPS UP the last box. She PULLS out a notebook, the 
           backpacking Barcelona PICTURE OF GAVIN is tucked inside. It 
           survived the shoebox tossing. 

           She puts it SIDE BY SIDE with BRAD’S PICTURE, studies them. 
           Her cell RINGS - Gavin.

                        from last night. 

           She SHAKES her head, knows she should say no - how is it he

                        No. Far from it. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Wow. 
                                 AMANDA
                        What would you have said?

                                 GAVIN
                        That I missed you. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Did you want to get back together? 
                        Did you want me to move there?

                                 GAVIN
                        I think I was starting to realize 
                        I’d made a mistake letting you go. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Then why didn’t you call again? Why 
                        didn’t you try harder?

                                 GAVIN
                        Would you have called again if 
                        someone told you something like 
                        that? ...I should have known that 
                        Kelsey was lying. She was always 
                        meddling in our business. She’s a 
                        fucking perpetually single girl who 
                        doesn’t want anyone else to be 
                        happy.  

           She WINCES - this is still her best friend. 

                                 AMANDA
                        No -- I mean, I’m mad at her but I 
                        do think she wants me to be happy. 
                        She was just looking out for me. 

                                 GAVIN
                        I think you’re capable of looking 
                        out for yourself. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’ve never been good at telling you 
                        “no.” You know that. She helped me. 

                                 GAVIN
                        I never thought she was good for 
                        you.  

                                 AMANDA
                           (smiles, gently)
                        She thinks the same about you. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Well, I’m not the guy I used to be. 
                                 AMANDA
                        ...If I had answered, if we had 
                        gotten back together and I moved 
                        there, do you think we would have 
                        made it? I mean, I wasn’t the 
                        greatest girlfriend back then. 

                                 GAVIN
                        You were perfect. 

                                 AMANDA
                        No, I was clingy. My whole world 
                        revolved around you. I’m sure I 
                        would’ve driven you crazy if I 
                        moved there. Don’t you think we 
                        probably would have broken up, 
                        anyway? So it all worked out the 
                        same?

                                 GAVIN
                        Or maybe you’d be my wife. 

           This is the last thing Amanda needs to hear. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (stares off, sad)
                        I guess it doesn’t really matter. 
                        It all worked out for the best. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Did it?

                                 AMANDA
                        Yes. I love Brad. 
                           (quietly)
                        I didn’t come here to get you back, 
                        Gavin. I just needed to understand.  

           He looks away, NODS towards a beautiful Pac Heights mansion 
           for sale.

                                 GAVIN
                        Have you done any B&E’s lately?

                                 AMANDA
                        Breaking and Enterings? No. My 
                        crime spree days ended when you and 
                        I did.

                                 GAVIN
                        You don’t travel, don’t dance, 
                        don’t trespass. What happened?
           Amanda gives a polite, thoughtful LAUGH. Her cell RINGS. 
           Brad. She FORWARDS it. 

           Gavin is already WALKING up the driveway. 

                                 AMANDA
                        What are you doing?

                                 GAVIN
                        When you were mine, you would’ve 
                        been the first one over the fence. 

           He DOESN’T TURN BACK, beckoning her to follow.

           EXT. MANSION - MINUTES LATER

           Amanda FOLLOWS Gavin to the WROUGHT IRON GATE.  She LOOKS 
           around nervously. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Really, I don’t do this kind of 
                        stuff anymore. I’m very boring.

                                 GAVIN
                        You’re going to be fine. 

                                 AMANDA
                        No, I don’t feel comfortable. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Trust me. 

           Amanda’s cell BUZZES. She looks, this time it’s Kelsey. 
           “Where are you?” She SCOWLS, defiantly puts her phone away.   

           Her anger at Kelsey is enough to send her over the edge. 

           Gavin BOOSTS her OVER THE GATE. He easily CLIMBS over. They 
           go AROUND THE BACK. Gavin goes to A WINDOW, it DOESN’T OPEN. 
           Amanda LOOKS around. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I don’t have a good feeling about 
                        this. I really should get back...  

           He TRIES the door. It opens. He smiles.  

           INT. MANSION - DAY

           Amanda and Gavin CLIMB inside. She LOOKS around, slowly 
           starts to relax. 
                                 GAVIN
                        See?

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah... Until the cops show up. 

                                 GAVIN
                        We’re fine. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Do you do this with all the ladies?

                                 GAVIN
                        Course not. It’s our thing. 

           They WANDER around in awe. She enters THE LIVING ROOM, 
           enormous, elegant, does a 360. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Wow, look at this. This is crazy. 
                        I’m already imagining how I’d 
                        decorate it. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Maybe you should and we could live 
                        here. We’d have big boisterous 
                        dinner parties. 

           Amanda LAUGHS a little sadly, nostalgic, but plays along.

                                 AMANDA
                        And the band would set up right 
                        there. 

           They go quiet, imagining what will never be. Gavin plays 
           “MIDNIGHT TRAIN TO GEORGIA” on his iPhone. She stares 
           straight forward, can’t turn to look at him. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                           (laughs to cut the 
                           tension)
                        You know what’s better than a 
                        midnight train to Georgia? A plane. 
                        Speedier. 

                                 GAVIN
                        You’ve gotten dorkier with age. 

                                 AMANDA
                        It’s kind of my defining 
                        characteristic. I’ve embraced it. 
                                 GAVIN
                        I broke up with Liz. I realized you 
                        were right. She’s not my type. 

           He takes her hand. Her breath catches. 

           He doesn’t ask permission, he just SPINS her around and 
           starts twirling her around the floor. 

                                 GAVIN (CONT’D)
                        You deserve to dance, Amanda. 

           Their bodies finding each other’s rhythm. There’s something 
           comfortable here, romantic. He pulls her close against him. 
           She LAUGHS softly. 

                                 GAVIN (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 AMANDA
                        You still wear the same cologne. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Guess some things never change. 

           He LOOKS at her, wants to kiss her, and she pulls away. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (cringes, instinctively)
                        Brad.  

                                 GAVIN
                        Gavin. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (shakes her head, 
                           flustered)
                        I’m sorry, I just can’t do this. I 
                        just... I can’t do this. Brad is 
                        waiting for me. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Look, he’s a good guy and I know 
                        you’re loyal to the end but I think 
                        you’re picking the wrong couch. 

                                 AMANDA
                        What?

                                 GAVIN
                        Yesterday you said, “you just have 
                        to choose one and trust you made 
                        the right choice.” What if you’re 
                        not? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GAVIN (CONT'D)
                        You don’t want to spend the rest of 
                        your life with regrets. There is 
                        always going to be something 
                        between us, admit it; you wouldn’t 
                        be here if you didn’t agree.  

                                 AMANDA
                        No, you’re right - I came here 
                        because I felt like I owed it to 
                        myself to see if there was... but 
                        all I feel now is guilt. 

           He bridges the distance, brings her towards him. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                           (weak, losing her will 
                           power, pleading)
                        I need to go, Gavin. 

                                 GAVIN
                        Come on, remember when we broke 
                        into that house in the Marina in 
                        the pouring rain and went upstairs 
                        and had sex on the bare floor. And 
                        the Realtor walked in downstairs. 

           Amanda gives him a small smile. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Wow... 

                                 GAVIN
                        Yeah...?

                                 AMANDA
                        No, it’s a great story. Wrong girl. 

           She PULLS him off her and WALKS AWAY. His face falls. FUCK.

                                 GAVIN
                        Come on! 

           She puts her HAND up dismissively. 

                                 GAVIN (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 AMANDA
                        I know what the dot dot dot is. 
           EXT. MANSION - MINUTES LATER

           Gavin FOLLOWS after. Amanda STRADDLES the gate. Her shorts 
           catch mid-jump.  

           A POLICE SIREN chirps. She looks up, dangles precariously 
           from the Gate, her shorts RIP all the way up the leg. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh, fuck me. 

           And she lands with a THUD. 

           INT. SQUAD CAR - MINUTES LATER

           Amanda and Gavin sit in the back, on the way to the station. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (stares out window, 
                           freaking out, whispers)
                        No, no. This can not happen. I’m 
                        gonna miss the dinner cruise!

                           (glances at cops)
                        Shh... Calm down...

                                 AMANDA
                        No! I told you this was a bad idea 
                        and you didn’t listen! 

                                 GAVIN
                        If this is about the comment in 
                        there - I’m sorry - that didn’t 
                        happen when I was with you. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Ugh, it’s not about that you 
                        trespassed with other girls and had 
                        sex. 

                                 GAVIN
                           (glances again at cops)
                        Maybe we should talk about this 
                        later. 

                                 AMANDA
                        No, please, whenever you say, “we 
                        should talk about this later,” the 
                        conversation never happens. I want 
                        to say this. It’s that I actually 
                        hate this adventure shit, I always 
                        have.

                        And if I didn’t act like that when 
                        I was dating you, it was because I 
                        was doing everything I could to be 
                        exactly what you wanted. And it’s 
                        that when I make a dorky pun, you 
                        don’t make one back. 

                                 GAVIN
                        A what?

                                 AMANDA
                        And mostly, it’s because I don’t 
                        trust you. Not just with what you 
                        say. I don’t trust you with my 
                        heart.

                                 GAVIN
                        Because of one comment?

                                 AMANDA
                        No, because if you loved me, really 
                        loved me, you would have fought for 
                        me. But you didn’t, and that was my 
                        answer. 

                                 GAVIN
                        I called-

                                 AMANDA
                        Don’t blame this on Kelsey. You’ve 
                        always hated her because she could 
                        see through you when I couldn’t. 
                        You called one time after six 
                        months? You didn’t love me. After a 
                        three year relationship, you didn’t 
                        even have the decency to properly 
                        break up with me. 

                                 GAVIN
                        You’re right. I didn’t handle it 
                        well. The last thing I wanted to do 
                        was hurt you. I didn’t know what I 
                        was doing, I thought if I let you 
                        down gently.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh, bullshit. You didn’t let me 
                        down gently. You didn’t let me down 
                        at all. You just left hanging. I 
                        had to draw my own conclusions. And 
                        believe me, when you’re in love, 
                        you can rationalize for a long time 
                        that there’s a chance. It took a 
                        long time for me to give up.

                        But I did give up. I moved on. And 
                        I met a great guy. You would leave 
                        me hanging forever if I let you.

           The squad car STOPS. The Officer PULLS OUT Amanda. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        And I just realized you probably 
                        did the same thing with Liz.

           As a COP pulls Gavin out, she LOOKS at his STRICKEN FACE and 
           realizes she’s right. She LAUGHS sadly. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Wow, I’m right. You didn’t break up 
                        with her, did you?
                           (then, sincere, slow)
                        You’re that guy you date when 
                        you’re twenty four and don’t know 
                        any better. But there’s a reason 
                        you go through that - so that you 
                        learn from your mistakes. And it 
                        might have taken me a long time to 
                        realize it -- but I finally know 
                        100% positively, Gavin -- you’re 
                        not my fucking couch. 

           And just like that, Amanda is hauled away. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Amanda gets FINGER PRINTED.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. POLICE STATION - HOURS LATER

           An OFFICER releases Amanda from HER HOLDING CELL. She WALKS 
           down the hall, sees Kelsey waiting for her. They hug. 

                                 KELSEY
                        I’m so sorry. You were right, I 
                        shouldn’t have done that. 

                                 AMANDA
                        No, you were looking out for me. 
                        Thank you.  

                                 KELSEY
                        We should probably hurry or you’re 
                        gonna miss the boat. Which sounds 
                        like a metaphor but it’s not. 
           They pull apart and hurry out.  

           EXT. EMBARCADERO - SUNSET

           Kelsey drops Amanda off, she takes off RUNNING. Seagulls FLY 
           OFF in all directions. We hear the BLASTING HORN of the 
           HORNBLOWER DINNER CRUISE. 

                                 STRANGER
                        Run, girl, run!

                                 AMANDA
                        Thank you, very helpful. 

           Amanda BREAKS through a WEDDING PARTY posing for a photo on 
           bicycles. The bikes CRASH to the floor.  

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                           (turns, apologetically)
                        As you were. 

           She TURNS OFF and heads DOWN THE DOCK, arms pumping. Just as 
           the SHIP parts from the dock. DOCK HANDS remove the ropes. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Wait! Wait! Wait!

           But the BOAT continues. She RUNS all the way TO THE EDGE, 
           looks like she’s about to leap the few feet but it’s just a 
           little too far. The ROAR of the engines drown out her YELLS. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Stop that dinner cruise!

           She RUNS to a DOCKHAND. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        I’m late! Can you get it to turn 
                        back?

                                 DOCK HAND
                        No. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Please! It’s right there! 

                                 DOCK HAND
                        Sorry. There’s nothing I can do. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’ll pay you everything I have. 
                           (pulls out three dollars)
                        Can’t you radio them or something?!
                                 DOCK HAND
                        I’m sorry. 

           Amanda BURSTS INTO TEARS. 

                                 DOCK HAND (CONT’D)
                        There’ll be another dinner cruise 
                        in twenty minutes... 
                           (then)
                        This is an awkward moment so I’m 
                        just gonna...

           The Dock Hand WALKS OFF. Amanda stands there, DIALS Brad.

                                 BRAD (ON PHONE)
                        Hey. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Brad! I’m so sorry! I’m so sorry 
                        I’m late! 

                                 BRAD (ON PHONE)
                        Where were you? 

                                 AMANDA
                        I was wrongfully imprisoned. Kinda 
                        wrongfully. 

                                 BRAD (ON PHONE)
                        Is that why you look like a bad mug 
                        shot right now?

           Amanda RUNS her hands through her WIND BLOWN HAIR. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Huh?

           She LOOKS at the boat that is too far away now. She SPINS 
           around, searching the crowd.

           There on a bench, waiting for her is BRAD. Sweet, wonderful 
           Brad. She RUNS over, relieved, all apologies. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Brad! You didn’t get on the boat. 

                                 BRAD
                        Of course not. I wouldn’t get on 
                        without you. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I love you so much. I’m so sorry. 

           She tries to KISS him but he RECOILS. 
                                 BRAD
                        Where were you? Where were you 
                        really?

           Time to lie or tell the truth. 

                                 AMANDA
                        With Gavin. 

                                 BRAD
                           (smiles coldly)
                        The guy you only went on a couple 
                        dates with, right?

           Amanda FREEZES. 

                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        I came over to your place to help 
                        move your things. I wanted to 
                        surprise you. This fell out of your 
                        stuff. 

           Brad HANDS her the BARCELONA PHOTO of Amanda kissing Gavin.

                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        Was Barcelona your first date or 
                        second?

           Fuck.

                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        I came here, anyway, tonight 
                        because I hoped there was some 
                        explanation, that you haven’t just 
                        been lying to me this whole time. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Nothing bad happened between him 
                        and I, I promise. Nothing ever 
                        will. I’m so sorry I lied. I 
                        should’ve told you. I just didn’t 
                        want you to feel jealous I was 
                        working with an ex. 

                                 BRAD
                        It’s one thing to lie because you 
                        didn’t want me to feel jealous. 
                        It’s another thing to lie because 
                        it allows you to hang out with him. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You’re right, I’m so sorry. 
                                 BRAD
                        What were you doing? Why were you 
                        arrested?

                                 AMANDA
                        He dropped off the check and we 
                        went for a walk and we were having 
                        this closure conversation that we 
                        never had before and we decided to 
                        go inside this house that was for 
                        sale and I guess it was private 
                        property. 

                                 BRAD
                        You guess? You were in some empty 
                        house with him? Having a closure 
                        conversation? I can’t listen to 
                        this. You’re making me sick. 

           Brad GETS UP and starts WALKING AWAY. Amanda RUNS after.

                        I can see how - it’s making me sick 
                        saying it over right now. 

           He stops, WHIPS towards her. 

                                 BRAD
                        What was wrong with us?

                                 AMANDA
                        Nothing!

                        You wouldn’t have let him back into 
                        your life unless something was 
                        missing with us. 

           He starts WAVING down a cab. 

                                 AMANDA
                        No. If anything, something was 
                        missing with me before I met you. 
                        It had nothing to do with you. I 
                        just had this question I needed to 
                        answer. 

                                 BRAD
                        That sucks because I didn’t have 
                        any questions. But now I do. 

           A cab STOPS, he GETS in. 
                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t bother finishing my 
                        grandmother’s living room. Now you 
                        can just focus completely on Gavin.

                        now. Don’t call me. 

           He shuts the door. The cab TAKES OFF, leaving Amanda there 
           holding the Polaroid of Gavin.

                        going to need to take that back. 

           EXT. ANGEL ISLAND - CAMPSITE - NIGHT

           The Hot Air Balloon LANDS. Amanda and Kelsey GET OUT, take 
           off RUNNING. 

                                 KELSEY
                        What campsite is it?

                                 AMANDA
                        I have no idea. 

                                 KELSEY
                        Great. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Brad?!

                                 KELSEY
                        Brad?!

           They run through CAMPSITES, calling out for BRAD. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Brad?!

                                 RANDOM CUTE GUY
                        Yes? 

                                 AMANDA
                        Wrong Brad. 

                                 KELSEY
                        But I might come back for you 
                        later. 

           They keep RUNNING. 

                                 KELSEY (CONT’D)
                        Hayes family at large?!

                                 AMANDA
                        I think that’s it...
           They come up on the HAYES’ CAMPSITE. Amanda sees Brad, Meg, 
           Grandma Thora, Cousin Jim, Uncle Ted, Nicky - thirty friends 
           and family members around a campfire, talking. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Brad?!

                                 BRAD
                        Amanda??

           Amanda ZEROS in on Meg sitting beside Brad. Amanda looks 
           around at the large clan, DELIVERS her grand gesture speech. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have hung 
                        out with my ex and I know I screwed 
                        up but I’m here to fight for you.  

           Everyone is STUNNED SILENT. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                           (whispers)
                        I don’t think he told anyone. 

                                 KELSEY
                           (whispers)
                        I’m getting that impression. 

           Brad STANDS. 

                                 BRAD
                        Amanda, let’s talk in private. 

           His normal warmth is gone. She FOLLOWS. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m so sorry- 

                                 BRAD
                           (still walking)
                        --Not yet. 

                                 AMANDA
                        --Okay. 
                           (whispers)
                        You’re not dating Meg are you?

                                 BRAD
                        What? No. It’s been one day. 

           They reach the steps of AN OUTDOOR AMPHITHEATER built off the 
           hill - it’s empty other than a couple KIDS and GUY playing 
           his GUITAR. Brad stops WALKING, turns to her. 
                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        I appreciate you coming here - but 
                        don’t think that changes 
                        everything. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I know. I’m so sorry. You’re the 
                        one thing I’m sure about in this 
                        whole world and I screwed it up. 

                                 BRAD
                        You lied to me. How am I supposed 
                        to trust you? 

                                 AMANDA
                        You know me. I’ve always been 
                        Honest Abe. 

                                 BRAD
                        Not this time. Not when it counted. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I know. 
                           (timidly -- this isn’t 
                           going well)
                        Which is why I brought these... 

           She pulls out the missing companions to his monkey knickknack 
           - The Hear and Speak-No-Evil guys. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        So that they can keep me from ever 
                        falling off track again. I know 
                        that they’re not that impressive 
                        but I am so in love with you. 
                        You’re the coolest guy I’ve ever 
                        met. 

                                 BRAD
                        No, come on. 

                                 AMANDA
                        No, Brad, you’re so cool. Whenever 
                        we’re together, things get great. 
                        And yeah, we don’t have everything 
                        in common and neither of us is 
                        perfect but love isn’t about 
                        finding the perfect person --

           Amanda DROPS DOWN TO ONE KNEE. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Love is about seeing an imperfect 
                        person perfectly. 
                                 BRAD
                        No, get up, what are you doing? 

           He BRINGS her OFF HER KNEE. 

                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        Amanda, you don’t get to propose to 
                        me. 

           She CAN’T LOOK AT HIM, nods, realizing she really has fucked 
           this up for good. Tears STREAM down her face. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (nods)
                        Sorry. I understand. 

           Even though she doesn’t really understand. Even though her 
           heart is BREAKING. She always tries so hard to be polite. 

           She doesn’t see... that he’s gotten down on his own knee. 

                                 BRAD
                        ...Because I’m proposing to you. 

           He holds the RING in his hand. Amanda GASPS, tries to catch 
           up to her own emotions. 

                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        So quit hijacking my proposal. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Ohmygosh... Yes!

                                 BRAD
                        I haven’t asked yet. I hoped you 
                        would come here tonight... 

                                 AMANDA
                        Yes!
                           (off his look)
                        Sorry, got too excited.

                                 BRAD
                        I was sitting here getting jealous 
                        of a guy trying to steal my 
                        girlfriend but I realized, I'm the 
                        one he should be jealous of. Gavin 
                        was right to fight for you - you 
                        are worth fighting for, Amanda. But 
                        I don't care that he missed out, 
                        tough shit, I'm your man now. 
                                 AMANDA
                           (laughs between tears)
                        Hell yes you are. 

                                 BRAD
                        And I know I can be set in my ways 
                        sometimes about certain things but 
                        I’m still growing and if you’re 
                        willing, I’d like to spend the rest 
                        of my life, doing it with you. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Yes! Oh god, yes please. I do. 

           She JUMPS on him, WRAPPING her legs around him. SPARKLERS set 
           off around them. 

                                 BRAD
                        Maybe we could honeymoon in Paris. 
                        I heard about this great deal in 
                        the seventh arrondissment. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (laughs)
                        Pierre!

                                 BRAD
                        But the monkey knickknacks, I hope 
                        you know, are staying.  

                                 AMANDA
                        We could have a million monkey 
                        knickknacks, I don’t care! ...Maybe 
                        not a million. 

           He SETS her down. She looks around in awe at the lights. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        How did you do this?

                                 BRAD
                        I had a little help. 

           He LOOKS OVER and we see KELSEY standing to the side. Her 
           best friend who really does have her best interest at heart. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You surprised me. 

                                 BRAD
                        That’s the point, isn’t it?
                           (holds out his hand)
                        Would you like to dance?
           She LOOKS around at the few people milling around. 

                                 AMANDA
                        No one’s dancing. 

                                 BRAD
                        We are. 

           She WRAPS her arms around him, they never take their eyes off 
           each other, moving to the guy’s simple song on a guitar... 

                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        Well, at least trying to. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I think we’re just hugging in 
                        rhythm. 

                                 BRAD
                        I wouldn’t call this rhythm. 

           They GIGGLE, lost in each other’s embrace. Suddenly, POP 
           MUSIC blasts from a stereo. She LAUGHS, moment over... But 
           then Brad backs up and STARTS DANCING SOLO MOVES. 

                                 AMANDA
                           (laughs)
                        What are you doing?

                                 BRAD
                        You asked for this.

                                 AMANDA
                           (teases)
                        Did I?

           From OUT OF NOWHERE, their friends and family appear. Cousin 
           Jim, Nicky, Kelsey, Uncle Ted, Grandma Thora. A FLASH MOB. 

           They start doing an ELABORATE CHOREOGRAPHED DANCE with Brad 
           at the helm. Amanda LAUGHS, CLAPS, loving it. 

           He brings her in, twirling her, as the MUSIC hits its PEAK. A 
           BREAKDANCER slides across the ground, busts a finale move. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Who is that?

                                 BRAD
                        I have no idea. 

           They LAUGH, as they watch, holding each other close. 
                                 BRAD (CONT’D)
                        Now your next client’s not gonna be 
                        your long lost secret admirer from 
                        third grade or something, right?

                                 AMANDA
                           (giggles)
                        No, promise. 

                                 BRAD
                        What about Pepe from that steamy 
                        summer you spent abroad. He might 
                        want a new master suite. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Not him either. And I never studied 
                        abroad... But I did study a ‘bro. 

                                 BRAD
                        Too soon. Nice pun, though. 

           She kisses him a million times and says:

                                 AMANDA
                        I missed you missed you missed you. 

                                 BRAD
                        It’s nice to be missed.

           And they lived... Nerdily...Ever...After. 

                                                         FADE OUT:

           OVER CREDITS WE WATCH:

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Kelsey dressed up as a banana, dancing.
