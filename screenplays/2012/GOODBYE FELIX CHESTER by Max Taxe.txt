                                Goodbye, Felix Chester

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           The frenzy of recess. A horde of THIRD GRADERS rush outside. 
           The allure of swings and monkey-bars.

           But FELIX CHESTER, 9, a wide-eyed stubby-fingered Romeo in 
           corduroy shorts, remains inside at a table.  Alone.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                             (older, 17 years old)
                        It all started in third grade.

           A GIRL bursts back inside. The Girl. Pigtails, overalls, the 
           works. Her eyes dash around and meet Felix’s gaze. Pure 
           accident.

           A smile.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        They say it feels like a freight 
                        train running over your chest the 
                        first time.

           Her FRIENDS yell for her from outside. She considers, but 
           maneuvers over to Felix and sits down. He shrinks.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        They say your hands get sweaty and 
                        a tingling feeling rushes to your 
                        fingers and toes.

           She motions for the OREOS in front of Felix.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        They say it can happen at any time, 
                        in the blink of an eye, without any 
                        warning whatsoever.
                             (then)
                        For me, it happened as I perfectly 
                        split open an Oreo.

           He breaks it open. Cream beautifully parted to one side. 
           Holds it out toward The Girl--

           The cookie FALLS.

           Felix CLUTCHES at his chest. Shaking. Mouth open. GASPING for 
           breath that won’t come.
                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        Apparently I was the first third 
                        grader in the history of Lincoln 
                        Elementary to suffer a mild heart 
                        attack in the middle of recess.

           She yanks her hand back. Terror erupts on her adorable face.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        It was a Wednesday. For years, the 
                        muscle that kept my heart beating 
                        had been deteriorating, unnoticed.

           The TEACHER catches a glimpse of the commotion from outside 
           and rushes in. Third Graders gravitate in toward the clamor.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        I’ve been dying ever since.

           Felix’s head falls to the table with a THUD. Lifeless.

           INT. FELIX’S HOUSE - MORNING

           FELIX, 17, scrawny, awkward, a face unlikely to ever produce 
           legitimate facial hair, stares vacantly at the television. At 
           his feet lays an aged golden retriever, Lucky.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        Everyone responds to death and 
                        dying differently. Some people 
                        mourn prematurely. Some over-
                        compensate their affection. Others 
                        ignore it.

           Planet Earth plays with it’s unbridled whimsy. Ducklings jump 
           off a tree, one by one, free-falling to their death. But 
           instead, at the last moment, they BOUNCE on the leafy ground.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        Take, for example, my mom. Classic 
                        over-compensation.

           CONNIE CHESTER, late fifties, reading The Power of Positive 
           Thinking, walks past Felix into the kitchen and prepares 
           breakfast.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        Ever since I started going 
                        downhill, she’s upped her 
                        motherliness to unknown levels. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FELIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I think she’s trying to cram a 
                        normal life span’s worth of caring 
                        into the handful of years I have 
                        remaining.

           Felix stands up. Wills himself to the kitchen.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        On the other hand, take my dad.

           DAVID CHESTER, knocking on sixty, cuts out coupons from the 
           newspaper at the table with a practiced, steady hand.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        After coming home from the hospital 
                        that first time, my dad’s first 
                        reaction was to re-arrange my 
                        weekly chores to accommodate for 
                        lost time. I washed dishes for nine 
                        straight days until my natural odor 
                        was a cross between Lysol and 
                        lasagna. I never expected him to go 
                        all Lorenzo’s Oil on me, but...I 
                        wouldn’t have minded a week off.

           Connie dashes over to the stairs.

                                 CONNIE
                             (yelling)
                        Pete! Pete, are you up there?

           Felix plops down across from David.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        My brother, Pete, has been gone for 
                        two weeks, but his report card came 
                        back with mostly A’s, so no one 
                        seems to mind.

                                 CONNIE
                        Any idea where he is now?

           Felix shrugs. He opens up two PILL BOTTLES on the table. 
           Expertly pops a pill from each with a swig of water.

                                 CONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, okay. Breakfast is served.

           Connie places two plates in front of Felix. French toast, 
           bacon, thinly sliced strawberries.

                                 FELIX
                        I told you, I’m really not hungry 
                        in the morning.
           David shoots a look over his newspaper.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, mom.

                                 CONNIE
                        And there’s more where that came 
                        from.

                                 DAVID
                        Anything for me?

                                 CONNIE
                        You have legs. You can make your 
                        own breakfast.

           Felix checks his watch. Scarfs down food while he stands up. 
           Swings on his backpack.

                                 CONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Already?

                                 FELIX
                             (in a hurry)
                        I’ll take a piece to go.

           He grabs a piece of french toast and dashes for the door.

                                 DAVID
                        Felix, don’t forget to take out the 
                        trash before you leave.

           Stopped dead in his tracks. Felix sighs.

           EXT. FELIX’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Felix drags trash bins out onto the street, holding the piece 
           of french toast between his teeth. He stumbles--

           One trash can CRASHES to the ground. As does his french 
           toast. Right on the pavement.

           Across the street, a WOMAN smiles at Felix’s misfortune. A 
           neighborly wave. A TODDLER waddling beside her copies it.

           Felix smiles and waves back, righting the trash can and 
           tossing in the toast.

           Her business-suit-and-briefcase HUSBAND walks out. She runs 
           to give him a goodbye kiss. The Perfect Family. White picket 
           fence and all.

           Felix realizes he’s staring. His smile fades. And he leaves.
           INT. CENTERVIEW HIGH - MORNING

           Preppy. Lockers in the hallway. Art and theatre teachers go 
           by their first names. A banner reads “Centerview High: Home 
           of the Fighting Canadians.”

           Felix stands in front of a black stand-up sign with tacked on 
           white letters:

           “Felix Chester, 1994-TBD. Vigil in courtyard. 3 PM Thursday. 
           Sponsored by the Christian Society.”

           Felix sighs. Walks past it.

           LOCKERS

           Felix opens his locker. Next to him, ANDIE WEBBER, a plaid 
           button down girl, rests her head on her locker, waiting for 
           Felix.

                                 ANDIE
                        You know that whole mustache 
                        connection thing?

           A FLYER falls out of Felix’s locker. He picks it up - an 
           image of Felix looking into the distance with the slogan 
           “Felix is America” underneath. Sponsored by the Young 
           Democrats.

                                 FELIX
                        Not really.

           He crumples up the poster.

                                 ANDIE
                        Like two guys have mustaches, so 
                        they have this communal stachey 
                        brotherhood going on? I think it 
                        works with muffins also. A muffin 
                        connection.

           Felix’s eyes suddenly hone in on someone down the hall.

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        I was waiting at a crosswalk, 
                        eating a blueberry muffin, and this 
                        random guy in a suit stands next to 
                        me, also eating a blueberry muffin. 
                        We both kinda looked at each other, 
                        raised our muffins as if to say “I 
                        got your back, you got mine. We’re 
                        eating muffins. Let’s do this.” I 
                        think I’m onto something big here.
           Andie realizes Felix’s mind is elsewhere. She throws her 
           hands up in disbelief.

                                 FELIX
                             (totally not there)
                        That’s ground-breaking.

           Stealing Felix’s attention, VICKY PATAKI, a perfect mix of 
           cute, hot, and blonde, talks with her friends further down 
           the hall.

                                 ANDIE
                        Please don’t tell me you’re into 
                        Vicky Pataki this week.

           Andie lets her head fall into her locker.

                                 FELIX
                        It’s not like I’m “in to her,” I’m 
                        just...in waiting...for her.
                             (defending himself)
                        Come on, look at her. If you were a 
                        guy, tell me you wouldn’t fantasize 
                        about cooking her a fine meal.

                                 ANDIE
                             (overlapping)
                        I would not.

                                 FELIX
                        She’s smart in that unassuming way 
                        that you think she might be stupid. 
                        She’s the statistically exact 
                        height so I could rest my head 
                        casually on top of hers, and you 
                        know that would be adorable. And I 
                        could definitely picture us wasting 
                        a Sunday playing Scrabble and 
                        arguing over what two letter words 
                        are allowed. You know what I mean?

           Vicky heads in Felix’s direction. Felix awkwardly tries to 
           act casual. Andie isn’t helping.

                                 ANDIE
                        It’s not like you ever talk to 
                        these bi-weekly crushes anyway.

                                 FELIX
                        I do. Just not verbally.

           Right as Vicky is about to pass--
                                 ANDIE
                        Hey Vicky.

           She turns. Looks at Andie, confused.

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        What? That was blatantly a man’s 
                        voice that said your name. Wasn’t 
                        it, Felix?

                                 FELIX
                        Hi.

           Vicky looks at Felix, goes puppy-eyed.

                                 VICKY
                        Hey Felix! I haven’t seen you in 
                        like forever. Where have you been 
                        all this time?

                                 FELIX
                             (meek)
                        Right down the hall. And behind you 
                        in English Lit.

                                 VICKY
                        Hang in there, okay? We’re all 
                        rooting for you. You know, my mom 
                        said we could name our next dog 
                        after you in your honor.

           The “dream girl” status of Vicky Pataki shatters.

                                 FELIX
                        It’s more of a cat’s name, but 
                        thanks.

           Vicky shrugs, waves, and walks off, friends in tow.

           A long pause.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        Why? Why? What possessed you to do 
                        that?

           The bell RINGS.

                                 ANDIE
                        I feel like that went well, 
                        actually.
                             (heading to class)
                        We still on for tonight?
                                 FELIX
                        As always.

                                 ANDIE
                             (backpedalling)
                        Wanna chill at my mom’s house after 
                        school? They’ve decided to be 
                        separated this week, so I’ll 
                        probably have the house to myself.

                                 FELIX
                        I can’t. Doctor’s appointment. 
                        Again.

                                 ANDIE
                        Alright.
                             (their goodbye)
                        Don’t die on me.

           And she’s gone.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           MRS. DRUMMOND, a frail woman with the voice of Julia Child, 
           sashays down the rows of desk, passing back tests.

                                 MRS. DRUMMOND
                        I say this not only to Mr. Kremer 
                        here, but to the class as a whole: 
                        at least you tried.

           She reaches Felix, hiding near the back of the class. Passes 
           him his test with a wink.

           FELIX’S POV

           A red circled “A” in the upper right hand corner. Below, 
           Felix’s valid attempts at answers, riddled with errors, 
           crossed out in the teacher’s red pen.

           Next to each incorrect answer, in that red scrawl: “Close 
           enough.”

           BACK TO SCENE

           A SURLY STUDENT groans behind Felix after receiving his test.

                                 SURLY STUDENT
                        I cheated off the wrong guy...
           INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

           A flock of crimson gym shorts flees the gymnasium. Felix and 
           ANKUSH, a lanky Indian teenager who walks with a limp, remain 
           behind. The GYM TEACHER yells from the doorway.

                                 GYM TEACHER
                             (leaving)
                        Come on, gimps. Get cleanin’.

           They mosey over to the badminton nets, unhooking them.

                                 FELIX
                        How’s the heel feeling?

                                 ANKUSH
                        It’s okay. I’ll be back to full 
                        form in a couple of weeks.

           They carry the net to the storage closet, picking up rackets 
           and birdies along the way.

                                 ANKUSH (CONT’D)
                        How’s the heart thing going?

                                 FELIX
                        It’s going. You know how it is.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Not really. But that’s okay.

           They throw everything into the closet.

                                 ANKUSH (CONT’D)
                        Um. Now that you mention it, I 
                        actually have a favor to ask of 
                        you. If that’s cool.
                             (before Felix can answer)
                        Okay, so. I’m a recent inductee 
                        into the planning committee for the 
                        Young Democrats. I know. Thank you.

           A SQUEAKING NOISE. Over and over in the background. Felix 
           hears it and searches around.

                                 ANKUSH (CONT’D)
                             (following Felix around)
                        Well, you’re kind of a big deal for 
                        us, and I was wondering if you’d 
                        make an appearance. Maybe a speech. 
                        Something simple and profound. It 
                        would kill on my college apps.
                                 FELIX
                        Do you hear that?

                                 ANKUSH
                        Yeah, but...

                                 FELIX
                        Shh...

                                 ANKUSH
                        Is that a “no” on the speech?

           LOUDER. THUMP-THUMP-THUMP. Felix turns around the high-rise 
           bleachers--

                                 FELIX
                        Oh dear lord.

           Ankush stops behind him. His eyes widen.

           ANGLE ON Felix and Ankush from behind, staring underneath the 
           bleachers. A COUPLE has sex a distance in front of them, but 
           only the occasional wild-flying leg can be seen. The enthused 
           GRUNTS and MOANS make it unmistakable as to what’s going on.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Oh. Wow.

                                 FELIX
                        They’re just...right there.

           Felix and Ankush don’t move. Can’t move. Hypnotized.

                                 ANKUSH
                        They don’t even notice us.

                                 FELIX
                        Not whatsoever.

                                 ANKUSH
                        They’re in the zone.

           Felix leans forward. Makes a BIRD CALL noise.

                                 FELIX
                        Nothing. I’m impressed.

                                 ANKUSH
                        I miss sex.

                                 FELIX
                        What? Since when?

           Despite talking, they’re transfixed by the Couple.
                                 ANKUSH
                        Last year I went to prom with Mindy 
                        Mungerson. She looks like a pear, 
                        but, you know. She was my lab 
                        partner in chem and would always 
                        try to seduce me with the way she 
                        handled her beakers. She was really 
                        nice. And gentle.

           Felix, though entertained and in awe, can’t find it in 
           himself to smile.

           A climactic WAIL. Felix and Ankush spazz out and pretend to 
           be wandering around, pre-occupied.

                                 FELIX
                        Oh, hey Ankush. What’s....what’s 
                        up...

                                 ANKUSH
                        Just cleaning up...shuttlecocks.

           From beneath the bleachers, a BEEFY JOCK and a FRAIL GIRL 
           emerge and quickly scatter, darting in opposite directions.

           Felix shakes his head, watching them go.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Felix sits on the examination table in an open-backed 
           hospital gown, his legs dangling over like a kid. A NURSE 
           checks his blood pressure.

           In the corner, Connie reads Six Attitudes for Winners.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        Ever since my diagnosis in third 
                        grade, my mom has been working her 
                        way through “The Top 100 
                        Motivational Books in a Time of 
                        Crisis” that her friend Rhonda gave 
                        her.
                             (then)
                        Rhonda’s now in a mental 
                        institution after breaking down in 
                        a ball pit at a Chuck E. Cheese.

           INSERT: Rhonda sobbing in a colored ball pit, being consoled 
           by a four year old in mouse ears.

           The Nurse checks off some boxes on a clipboard and heads out 
           the door.
                                 CONNIE
                             (stopping the Nurse)
                        Could you make sure we get those 
                        forms I gave the doctor? Thanks.

           Felix hops off the table.

                                 FELIX
                        I wonder if doctors actually think 
                        they’re good people, or if they 
                        know they’re genuinely evil.

           Connie glances up from her book.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        At what point did each of them say 
                        to themselves “well, I’ve been 
                        plagued with this intelligence, and 
                        I do enjoy inflicting pain, 
                        so...doctor it is.”

           Felix examines the jars of cotton swabs and other doctorly 
           condiments.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        Where are these people? It’s been 
                        like four minutes.

                                 CONNIE
                        It’s this or the school won’t let 
                        you skip P.E. anymore. They know 
                        us, they know you, it won’t be much 
                        longer.

           Felix grabs a few cotton balls and stuffs them in his mouth, 
           chipmunk-style.

           A warning KNOCK on the door. It cracks open. DOCTOR NAGELMAN, 
           a youthful man with the wear and tear of his profession 
           seeping through, peeks in.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN
                             (quickly to Felix)
                        Hey. I just need to...grab your mom 
                        for a moment, then I’ll be right 
                        with you.

           Connie closes her book. Felix hops back on the table as 
           Connie leaves the room behind Dr. Nagelman.

           Through a square of glass in the door, Felix watches from his 
           perch on the table. His cheeks bulging with cotton balls.
           Like a silent movie, Dr. Nagelman opens his folder, reading a 
           few lines to Connie. His head bobs constantly to keep eye 
           contact.

           Connie’s eyes glaze over. She’s not crying, but the struggle 
           against it shows in her clenched jaw and trembling throat.

           Felix, entranced, lets a few cotton balls fall from his 
           mouth.

           Connie gulps a few deep breaths. Dr. Nagelman offers her his 
           hand for support, but she bats it away. She runs her hand 
           along the wall to keep steady. They head back into the room.

           The door opens. Dr. Nagelman immediately makes eye contact 
           with Felix, realizes he’s been watching. Wastes no time.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN (CONT’D)
                        Felix...
                             (unprepared)
                        We looked over your blood work and 
                        the scans, like every other month, 
                        but this time we saw some pretty 
                        bad news. Your heart is getting 
                        weaker and weaker at an 
                        accelerating pace. And it’s reached 
                        a breaking point. I’m not going to 
                        sugar coat this at all...

           Connie stares, not at Felix, not at the Doctor, but away, in 
           her own world. Felix watches her through all of this.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN (CONT’D)
                        We’re looking at no more than a 
                        month.

           Felix pulls the remaining cotton balls from his mouth, 
           placing them next to him on the table.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN (CONT’D)
                        I know you don’t want to think 
                        about, you know, the next step 
                        right now. But I encourage you - 
                        both of you - to see me as a 
                        counselor, if you need it.

           A silence.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 FELIX
                             (quiet)
                        Yeah. Why wouldn’t I be?
           Dr. Nagelman cringes a quarter smile.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN
                        I don’t want to get anyone’s hopes 
                        up, but there is always a slim 
                        chance for a transplant. You’re on 
                        the list, it’s just a matter 
                        of...luck.

           He stands upright. Backing toward the door.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN (CONT’D)
                        Pray for car crashes.

           INT. CONNIE’S VOLVO - NIGHT

           Connie drives, eyes forward, gripping the steering wheel. 
           Almost catatonic. Bobbing with every bump in the road.

           Felix rests his head on the passenger side window. Stares at 
           the trees, benches, buildings, and straggling people that 
           morph into a colorless blur.

           Complete silence, except for the meager whir of wheels on 
           concrete.

           PRE-LAP:

                                 CONNIE (V.O.)
                        There has to be a way...

           INT. DINING ROOM - FELIX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Connie drops plates of food in front of David and Felix 
           before sitting down with them.

                                 CONNIE
                        It’s not like this is some one in a 
                        million disease.

                                 DAVID
                             (overlapping)
                        We’ll look into all the options.

                                 CONNIE
                        There’s bound to be some new 
                        treatment in Sweden or Finland or 
                        somewhere we can try. Or some Zulu 
                        witch doctor for all I care.
                                 DAVID
                             (eating)
                        You need to relax.

                                 CONNIE
                        How can you eat right now?

                                 DAVID
                        You put the food in front of me. Am 
                        I not supposed to eat it?

           Felix stares at his food, searching for a profound message in 
           between the mashed potatoes and the peas.

                                 CONNIE
                        Do you even care? It’s only our 
                        son, right?

                                 DAVID
                        Of course I do. But right now, 
                        we’re clearly a little frazzled, 
                        and I don’t want us to overreact.

                                 CONNIE
                        What would it take for you to 
                        overreact?

                                 FELIX
                             (finally)
                        We knew it was gonna happen 
                        sometime...
                             (looking down)
                        At least I won’t have to do college 
                        applications.

           Only the sound of Felix’s fork scratching his plate.

                                 DAVID
                        Tonight, let’s eat, relax. Clear 
                        our heads. We’ll start fresh 
                        tomorrow.

                                 CONNIE
                             (mostly to herself)
                        I should call everyone. They should 
                        know. I’ll have to make 
                        arrangements, start planning. 
                        There’s a lot to do.

                                 DAVID
                        Have much homework tonight, Felix?

           The SCREEN DOOR CREEKS OPEN. Everyone quiets...
           The DOOR opens. In walks PETE CHESTER, a pint sized twelve 
           year old in army shorts, riddled with stripes of war paint 
           and mysterious scratches and scars. He ambles over to the 
           table, picks at Connie’s food.

                                 CONNIE
                        Thank God you’re home.

                                 DAVID
                        Where the hell have you been?

                                 PETE
                        I plead the fifth.

                                 DAVID
                        Are you on drugs?

                                 PETE
                        I’m twelve years old.

                                 DAVID
                        That does not answer my question.

                                 PETE
                        I’ve dabbled, okay?

           David looks to Connie and Felix to make sure he isn’t 
           serious.

           Everyone falls silent. Pete gnaws at a roll.

                                 PETE (CONT’D)
                        So...how’s everyone’s day been?

                                 FELIX
                        I’m dying.

                                 PETE
                        What else is new?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s for real this time, kiddo.

                                 PETE
                        Oh. Well, that blows.

           Pete snags a spoonful of Felix’s mashed potatoes.

                                 FELIX
                        May I be excused?

           He doesn’t wait for an answer. Stands up. Brings his plate to 
           the sink. And walks upstairs.
           OFF CONNIE AND DAVID -- as they share a look, not entirely 
           sure what to do now.

           INT. HALLWAY - FELIX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Felix stops in front of a HORSE OF THE MONTH CALENDAR. March. 
           A herd of horses huddle around a watering hole.

           One month. Right there in front of him.

           He flips to see April--

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        I won’t even make it to the 
                        thoroughbreds.

           Lets it fall back down.

           INT. FELIX’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Movie posters like The Truman Show. Television rests on a 
           mini-fridge. Messy in an everything-is-organized-by-piles 
           way.

           Felix walks in, Lucky sneaking in at the last possible 
           moment. Closes the door behind him.

           Paces aimlessly around before sitting on the corner of his 
           bed, still with childlike-multi-color bedspread.

           He looks around. What now? His eyes land on Lucky, gazing at 
           him, breathing heavily.

           The door opens:

           ANDIE.

                                 FELIX
                        Oh, hey. Sorry. I almost forgot. 
                        Wonder Years Wednesdays.

                                 ANDIE
                        What’s going on downstairs? Your 
                        mom hugged me. It was weird.

           She sits at his desk. Felix stares down.

                                 FELIX
                        We found out...I have a month left.

                                 ANDIE
                        Only a month? That sucks.
                                 FELIX
                        I expected something 
                        more...dramatic. Tears would’ve 
                        been nice. A sullen gaze maybe?

                                 ANDIE
                        I don’t know. Sorry. You’ve been 
                        dying since I met you in seventh 
                        grade.
                             (then)
                        I guess I’ll believe it when I see 
                        it.

           Andie plays with a Slinky on Felix’s desk.

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        So what are you gonna do with your 
                        last month?

                                 FELIX
                        You know what’s the worst thing?

                                 ANDIE
                        You’re gonna miss Shark Week.

           He flops back onto his bed.

                                 FELIX
                        I’m gonna die a virgin. Not like 
                        the glasses, bacne, rollie backpack 
                        overdramatic statement “I’m gonna 
                        die a virgin” virgin, but I’m 
                        actually going to die a virgin.
                             (then)
                        I mean, Ankush isn’t even a virgin. 
                        How has the virginity chain already 
                        reached an Ankush? It’s like I 
                        missed this wave of promiscuity 
                        that everyone went through since 
                        last year.

                                 ANDIE
                        It’s sex, Felix. It’s not even good 
                        most of the time.

                                 FELIX
                        How would you know?
                             (realizing)
                        No. No, no, no. What?

                                 ANDIE
                             (denial)
                        What?
           She focuses far too intently on her hands.

                                 FELIX
                        With who?

                                 ANDIE
                        With whom.
                             (off his look)
                        Does it even matter?

           Felix sits up. She won’t make eye contact.

                                 FELIX
                        Of course it matters. Why? How did 
                        you manage not to tell me this?

                                 ANDIE
                        You know everything that’s remotely 
                        important about me. I didn’t think 
                        this fell into that category.

                                 FELIX
                        Where did this happen? Was it in a 
                        car? Someone’s van? One of those 
                        white vans with curtains and a bean 
                        bag?

                                 ANDIE
                        Shouldn’t we be focusing on the 
                        fact that you’re dying in a month?

                                 FELIX
                        Just a little context. Please. Are 
                        you really going to deny a dying 
                        kid his last request?

           Andie rubs her face.

                                 ANDIE
                             (hurrying)
                        It was with Patrick Nubkin last 
                        year - don’t say a word - and he 
                        really liked me, and, you know, 
                        things happened. And we did it in 
                        the back of his mom’s volvo.

                                 FELIX
                        Ah! My mom has a Volvo.

                                 ANDIE
                        Every mom has a Volvo. It’s the 
                        law.

           Felix thinks for a moment.
                                 FELIX
                        Well congrats I guess.

                                 ANDIE
                        Shut up. End of topic.

                                 FELIX
                        No, I’m serious. I want that. I 
                        want the ridiculous story that ends 
                        with me figuring out how to utilize 
                        the seat belts for some new 
                        position.

                                 ANDIE
                        There’s so much else to do in a 
                        month though. You’ve never...been 
                        drunk?

           She searches through Felix’s drawers. Finds a yellow legal 
           pad.

                                 FELIX
                        I’ve also never had sex.

           She scribbles these goals down. The List.

                                 ANDIE
                        You’ve never driven a car. You’ve 
                        never been to Europe. You’ve never 
                        even beaten Zelda.

                                 FELIX
                        I’ve never bowled a perfect game?
                             (suddenly)
                        Oh, you know what else should go on 
                        that list? Losing my virginity. Or, 
                        if you prefer, vagina spelunking.

           Andie shakes her head.

                                 ANDIE
                        Fine. If you’re looking for sex, 
                        then find it. But it won’t mean 
                        anything.

                                 FELIX
                        Everyone’s had this one momentary 
                        connection with someone that lasts 
                        for five seconds-

                                 ANDIE
                        Let’s hope it lasts for more than 
                        five seconds.
                                 FELIX
                        -and that’s all I want. That one 
                        moment with someone. That’s it.

           Andie leans back in her chair.

                                 ANDIE
                        So who’s this fair maiden you plan 
                        on laying with?
                             (wait)
                        Please, please tell me you’re not 
                        gonna try to get with Vicky Pataki.

                                 FELIX
                        Oh. No. I’m over her. It needs to 
                        be...someone perfect.

                                 ANDIE
                        Then lets find her.

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Half-asleep, Felix finishes brushing his teeth. Spits.

           He puts away his toothbrush. On the counter top, PILL BOTTLES 
           stand in rows, each with prescription labels bearing Felix’s 
           name.

           His hand lingers for a second. Glances at himself in the 
           mirror out of the corner of his eye. Swoops up the bottles.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Connie stands at the refrigerator. Her list (The Top 100 
           Motivational Books in a Time of Crisis) pinned to the door. 
           She crosses off Six Attitudes for Winners as Felix bursts in.

           Felix pours bottle after bottle of pills into the sink. 
           Connie watches from afar.

           Felix snags the last two bottles on the breakfast table. 
           Dumps them all out.

           Felix flicks on the garbage disposal. CRUNCH. Connie WINCES.

           INT. ART CLASSROOM - DAY

           Easels and drawing cubicles. The aroma of cheap paint. Felix 
           and Andie stand near the window, pretending to be absorbed in 
           their own paintings.
                                 ANDIE
                        Dina Demarcus?

           Andie nods to a Frumpy Girl drawing a Felix-on-the-cross 
           picture.

                                 FELIX
                        Her voice shrieks too much.

                                 ANDIE
                        Tracy Amblin?

                                 FELIX
                        Her face is too angular.

                                 ANDIE
                        What are you even looking for?

                                 FELIX
                        You know. Cute has priority over 
                        hot, intelligent but willing to act 
                        ridiculous, able to hold a 
                        conversation or be okay with 
                        silence. But I’m not picky.

                                 ANDIE
                        No, that’s not picky at all.

                                 FELIX
                        I’ll know when I see her, trust me.

                                 ANDIE
                        How about Amber Wimply? Pretty, 
                        debatably retarded, talks to 
                        herself. Fits the bill.

                                 FELIX
                        She’s planning my wake.

           Andie adds a random dash of color to her painting.

                                 ANDIE
                        That could be perfect. She couldn’t 
                        say no to you.

                                 FELIX
                        Absolutely not. This can’t be some 
                        charity event. No pity. Rule number 
                        one through fifteen. Whoever this 
                        is can’t know I’m dying.

                                 ANDIE
                        Because that makes things easier.
                             (nodding across the room)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDIE (CONT'D)
                        Look at that Mona Lisa copy that 
                        guy is drawing? Oh, wait. That’s 
                        you as the Mona Lisa.
                             (point)
                        Everyone knows you’re dying.

           RAMONA, just Ramona, the art teacher, walks behind Andie. 
           Examines her painting.

                                 RAMONA
                        Hm. Very interesting. But what does 
                        it mean?

                                 ANDIE
                             (rapid-fire)
                        It represents the viewing structure 
                        of the 21st century museum 
                        aficionado, challenging them to 
                        question the value of art itself.

                                 RAMONA
                        Interesting, indeed.

           Ramona quickly glances at Felix’s stick figure masterpiece.

                                 FELIX
                        It’s a bear.

                                 RAMONA
                        Absolutely stunning.

           She walks off.

                                 FELIX
                             (off Andie’s look)
                        What?

           INT. CENTERVIEW HIGH HALLWAY - DAY

           Felix and Andie walk down the hall to their lockers.

                                 FELIX
                        I never said this was gonna be 
                        easy.
                             (bright side)
                        So she doesn’t go here. We’ll 
                        search elsewhere.

                                 ANDIE
                        That’s what the internet is for.

           They turn the corner--
           A MASSIVE poster of Felix standing, staring into the 
           distance, holding a SCEPTER. PROM. Your King has Arrived.

           Felix stops. Stares.

                                 FELIX
                        Why am I always alone in every one 
                        of these pictures? Why couldn’t I 
                        die before prom? I feel like that’s 
                        just a slap in the face.

                                 ANDIE
                        Maybe you will.

                                 FELIX
                        Not with my luck.

                                 ANDIE
                        Or you can bring your new dream 
                        girl and make her swoon there?

           Felix walks up to the poster. Checks out the extreme detail.

                                 FELIX
                        Who are you going with?

                                 ANDIE
                        I don’t know. Jeff Greenbaum 
                        probably. He’s been into me since 
                        kindergarten.

                                 FELIX
                        Jeff? Why Jeff? He’s so...Jeff.

           Felix shudders.

                                 ANDIE
                        I don’t know. I’d rather go with 
                        the bland, turtle-neck wearing sure 
                        thing than build up this ridiculous 
                        fantasy only to end up getting 
                        disappointed.

                                 FELIX
                        Oh, real subtle.

           INT. COMPUTER LAB - DAY

           Students type papers in computer cubicles. A select few check 
           blogs and news sites. And Andie and Felix stare at the 
           Match.com Welcome screen.
                                 ANDIE
                             (typing)
                        Okay. Profile for Felix-Chester-
                        Arthur. What sports and exercise do 
                        you enjoy?

                                 FELIX
                        None. Wait, click bowling and yoga.

                                 ANDIE
                        You like yoga?

                                 FELIX
                        Not personally.

                                 ANDIE
                        What’s the last thing you read? 
                        List something edgy.

           A Student passes behind them, staring.

                                 FELIX
                        Watership Down. That was heavy 
                        stuff.

                                 ANDIE
                             (filling out the rest)
                        You don’t exercise. You make no 
                        money. Don’t even have a high 
                        school degree.

                                 FELIX
                        I sound really fantastic.

                                 ANDIE
                        Whoa, whoa! You got a message.
                             (reading)
                        Are you the same Felix Chester 
                        that’s dying?

           Felix slumps in his chair.

                                 FELIX
                        Oh, great. The internet knows.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           Felix sits in the stands next to Andie. A basketball game 
           between the Fighting Canadians and the visiting Mayfield 
           Messiahs rages on, as only basketball games can, below.
                                 ANDIE
                        Maybe it’s time to think up a Plan 
                        B?

           Felix shoots the it’s-no-time-for-puns look at her.

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.
                             (then)
                        Worst case scenario, I’ll have to 
                        do it. I have this awesome red shag 
                        rug in my attic. Stain resistant. 
                        We could pound a few out before 
                        dinner, get on to some other goals.

           The WAVE goes around. Andie stands, but Felix stays seated.

                                 FELIX
                        I’m gonna have to pass, as romantic 
                        as you made that sound.

           She sits back down.

                                 ANDIE
                             (knowing)
                        I thought this was just about sex.

                                 FELIX
                        It is.
                             (beat)
                        I thought this was actually gonna 
                        happen.

           Felix looks down. Another WAVE goes around, but he doesn’t 
           even flinch.

           A MEEK GIRL squeezes over to Felix. Stands, wide-eyed.

                                 MEEK GIRL
                        I saw your ad on Match.com. Are you 
                        still looking? I have very few 
                        inhibitions.

           Felix stands.

                                 FELIX
                             (to Andie)
                        Okay. I’m going to the bathroom.

           He steps around the Meek Girl, trips over some feet, and 
           escapes.
           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Felix pees at a stall next to a Student, decked out in 
           Fighting Canadians gear. The Student realizes he’s peeing 
           next to Felix Chester and can’t take his eyes off him.

                                 STAR-STRUCK STUDENT
                        F-Felix Chester...

           Felix forces a smile and zips up in a hurry.

           He washes his hands at the sink. Looks at himself in the 
           mirror. A FLUSH. The stall opens behind him and a GIRL walks 
           out and heads for the sink:

           CAMILLE JENSEN, 17, essentially everything Felix dreamed of 
           and more, button-nose included. The girl. 

                                 CAMILLE
                             (noticing Felix’s stare)
                        The women’s bathroom had a line. 
                        It’s called being practical.

           She dries her hands. And exits.

           Felix turns to watch her leave, hands dripping all over his 
           pants.

                                 FELIX
                        And that’s how I met the girl of my 
                        dreams.

                                 STAR-STRUCK STUDENT
                        Narrating to yourself?

                                 FELIX
                        Absolutely.

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

           Felix bounds ahead of Andie, grasping the straps of his 
           backpack. He backpedals to keep Andie in sight.

                                 FELIX
                        She was like...she emerged from the 
                        stall. Like an etherial spirit. She 
                        was beautiful, her teeth were so 
                        straight. And that line about being 
                        practical? No effort whatsoever. 
                        Flowed off her tongue.
                                 ANDIE
                        It really wasn’t that impressive of 
                        a line.

                                 FELIX
                        Her voice was like a Siren’s 
                        melody.

                                 ANDIE
                        You know siren’s are evil, right?

                                 FELIX
                        She’s the exception to the rule. 
                        And most importantly, when she saw 
                        me, she had absolutely no idea who 
                        I was.

                                 ANDIE
                        So what’s her name, Romeo?

                                 FELIX
                        I have no idea!
                             (then)
                        But she’s real! I’m almost certain 
                        of that.

                                 ANDIE
                        Well, finding her seems somewhat 
                        important. Maybe I’m putting too 
                        much weight on you two ever having 
                        a conversation.

           Felix slows down.

                                 FELIX
                        You’re right. Maybe we can find 
                        some security footage from the gym 
                        and see who she was with and go 
                        from there?

                                 ANDIE
                        Or...we can assume she doesn’t go 
                        to Centerview, otherwise we would 
                        know who she is. So she must go to 
                        Mayfield. Why else would she have 
                        gone to the game?

                                 FELIX
                        That works too.

           Felix stops.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        Who knows people from Mayfield?
           Andie cringes.

           OFF FELIX -- as he figures out what this means...

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           Ankush moseys between shelves of books. He examines a book on 
           the shelf before pulling it out, only to reveal FELIX’S FACE 
           behind it--

           Ankush jumps back. Winces.

                                 ANKUSH
                             (re: his heel)
                        Oh, sweet mother! That sent me back 
                        a week.
                             (to Felix)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 FELIX
                             (through the books)
                        How well do you remember Mayfield?

           Ankush decidedly turns and hobbles down the aisle. Felix 
           follows suit on the other side of the shelf.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Mayfield is a distant memory.

                                 FELIX
                        You transferred here last year.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Painful memories.

                                 FELIX
                        I need you to help me find a girl.

           Felix turns the corner and cuts Ankush off.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        She’s about yay high. Really cute. 
                        Straight...teeth. Oh, she had 
                        freckles. Looked a bit like Winnie 
                        Cooper from Wonder Years.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Did she have a mole near her 
                        collarbone?

                                 FELIX
                        I don’t know.
                                 ANKUSH
                        I think I know who it is.

                                 FELIX
                        Perfect! Who is she?

                                 ANKUSH
                        Do the Young Democrats speech.

                                 FELIX
                        Come on. It’s a name, some 
                        information, that’s it.

           Ankush shrugs and walks the opposite way.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        Don’t hobble away from me.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Two speeches then.

                                 FELIX
                        That’s not an actual bargaining 
                        tool. I have stage fright. I don’t 
                        know what I’d say.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Well, then that’s that.

                                 FELIX
                        Fine. Fine. I’ll do the damn 
                        speech.

           Ankush smiles. Extremely pleased.

           INT. ANKUSH’S SEXMOBILE - DAY

           Felix, looking extra dapper, sits uncomfortably in the faux-
           leopard-skin seats. Ankush fits in far too well, driving with 
           one hand.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Her name’s Camille Jensen. This is 
                        her, right?

           He pulls out a BINDER with Camille’s picture on the front. 
           Felix takes it.

                                 FELIX
                        That’s her.
                                 ANKUSH
                        Okay. I was short on time. Please 
                        do not rush ahead. Open the binder.

           He does. First page: ACTIVITIES/INTERESTS.

                                 ANKUSH (CONT’D)
                        Consider this an old school 
                        PowerPoint.
                             (prepared)
                        She’s into theatre, hiking, 
                        painting, bowling-

                                 FELIX
                        I do enjoy bowling.

                                 ANKUSH
                        -old Nintendo, milkshakes, and 
                        flossing. Turn the page.

           MUSIC/TELEVISION/MOVIES.

                                 ANKUSH (CONT’D)
                        She listens to the Weepies, the 
                        Strokes, the That Thing You Do 
                        soundtrack, Stevie Wonder. Only 
                        watches the Twilight Zone-

                                 FELIX
                        Wait, you just copied her Facebook 
                        page, didn’t you?

                                 ANKUSH
                        I have very few sources.

                                 FELIX
                        How is this supposed to help me?
                             (reading)
                        Ah, she likes Dumbo? God damnit 
                        she’s perfect.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Okay, fine. Turn the page. I 
                        printed out pictures of her and 
                        almost every guy she’s been with. 
                        So you know your competition.

           Felix turns the page: Camille smiling with a Jock. Turns the 
           page: Camille with a Suave Hipster. Camille with a Musician. 
           Page after page after page--

                                 FELIX
                        Almost every guy?
                                 ANKUSH
                        Yeah, she’s been around.

                                 FELIX
                             (still flipping pages)
                        They’re all so good looking.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Yes. And they had charisma.

           OFF FELIX -- panic creeping onto his face.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Felix leans against the car door as Ankush checks his hair in 
           the mirror.

                                 FELIX
                        One thing.
                             (serious)
                        Under any circumstance, no matter 
                        what happens, you cannot tell 
                        anyone about my condition. Not a 
                        word. Okay?

                                 ANKUSH
                        Roger that.

           EXT. MAYFIELD CAMPUS - QUAD - DAY

           The whitest school ever. So many sweater vests. Ankush leads 
           Felix into the fray, heading for a central building in the 
           distance.

                                 FELIX
                             (sarcastic)
                        This place is so urban. Look, those 
                        people couldn’t even afford full 
                        jeans.

           Ankush charges ahead, past a group of Varsity Jacket Guys.

                                 VARSITY GUY
                        Whoa, the Brown Recluse has 
                        returned.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Hello Gerald.
                             (to Felix)
                        Their pet name for me. I love this 
                        school. Keep walking.
                                 VARSITY GUY
                             (from afar)
                        Here to take another victim?

                                 VARSITY GROUP
                        Everyone beware! The Brown Recluse 
                        is back.

           Ankush makes it a distance away. Stops at a Girl Reading The 
           Stranger.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Do you know where Camille Jensen 
                        is?

                                 THE STRANGER 
                        You’ll get nothing from me, Brown 
                        Recluse!

           She BOLTS.

           Ankush keeps walking.

                                 FELIX
                        So...why do they call you the Brown 
                        Recluse?

                                 ANKUSH
                        It’s a long and sordid tale.
                             (then)
                        I ratted on someone for cheating. 
                        They got expelled. Three strikes.

                                 FELIX
                        Then why don’t they call you the 
                        Rat?

                                 ANKUSH
                        Someone else already has that name.

           He points at a Kid with a lengthy rat tail.

                                 FELIX
                        That makes sense.
                             (then)
                        Maybe I should try. They may trust 
                        me more.

           A Student BUMPS into Felix--Ankush SQUEELS.

                                 PASSING STUDENT
                        Sorry.
                                 FELIX
                        I’m fine.
                             (to Ankush)
                        Seriously. That cannot kill me.

                                 ANKUSH
                             (catching his breath)
                        I’m okay. I’m okay.

           Felix hails down the Student that bumped him.

                                 FELIX
                        Would you happen to know where 
                        Camille Jensen is?

                                 PASSING STUDENT
                             (looking at Ankush)
                        Is he with you?

                                 FELIX
                        What? No. This guy? I don’t 
                        even...no.

                                 PASSING STUDENT
                        I think she’s in the 
                        Environmentalist Club right now. 
                        Check room 118.

                                 FELIX
                        Thanks.

           INT. MAYFIELD CAMPUS - HALLWAY - DAY

           Felix and Ankush stand outside of Room 118. Felix is 
           paralyzed.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Environmentalist Club? You really 
                        still want her?

                                 FELIX
                        Yes, though a tiny bit less now.
                             (then)
                        My mouth is too dry. I can’t do 
                        this. Listen, I can’t even 
                        pronounce anything. Oh, God. Why am 
                        I doing this?

           The door SWINGS open as a student leaves. For a brief moment, 
           Felix can see Camille inside, sitting in the corner.

           He walks to a water fountain. Takes a sip. Jumps around, 
           pumping himself up.
                                 ANKUSH
                        Do you even have a plan?

                                 FELIX
                        I’m just gonna walk in there, be 
                        relaxed, be cool, say hello. I have 
                        a few lines and talking points 
                        ready in my arsenal.

           A deep breath.

                                 ANKUSH
                        Good luck.

           And Felix goes in.

           INT. ENVIRONMENTALIST CLUB MEETING - DAY

           Felix shuffles in. He weaves through the rows of seats, 
           lingering, delaying his decision on where to sit, blocking 
           people’s view, stepping on toes...

           He sits a seat away from Camille. A buffer.

           Overly aware of Camille, who doesn’t even notice him there, 
           he tries to act casual. Unsure of where to put his hands. On 
           the desk. Off. In his pockets. Behind his head.

                                 CAMILLE
                        You okay, man?

           Felix scoffs. Multiple times.

                                 FELIX
                        Way okay. Totally. Don’t worry 
                        about it.

           She opts to turn her head to the front. A Group Leader pulls 
           down the projection screen.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                             (quietly, to Camille)
                        Hey. ‘Sup.

           She withholds an amused smile, shakes her head.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Hi...

           A painfully long pause. The Group Leader dims the lights.
                                 FELIX
                             (singing, softly to 
                              himself)
                        You, doing that thing you 
                        do...breaking my heart into a 
                        million pieces...like you always 
                        do...and you...

           Felix nods to himself. Stands up. Moves several seats away. 
           Ashamed.

                                 GROUP LEADER
                             (spotting Felix)
                        Is that a new member I see? What 
                        horrific act by mankind has 
                        compelled you to join our righteous 
                        club?

           Half-sitting-half-standing:

                                 FELIX
                        I’m, uh, a big fan of Planet Earth? 
                        Especially that scene where the 
                        ducklings jump off the ledge and 
                        bounce on the ground. Yeah. That’s 
                        really it.

           He sits down. The Group Leader stares at him before starting 
           his slide show.

                                 GROUP LEADER
                        Okay then. Well. Back to 
                        yesterday’s topic of mulch...

           Felix bangs his head on his desk. Slowly.

           Camille watches out of the corner of her eye. A slight smile.

           Felix’s stands decidedly. The Group Leader stops talking.

                                 FELIX
                        Yeah, I’m just gonna...

           He motions to leave. Reaches the door. Looks back and 
           considers. But turns back and exits.

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

           Andie walks on the sidewalk while Felix drags his feet in the 
           middle of the road.
                                 FELIX
                        Suicide is definitely an option. 
                        Why wait a month? We could make it 
                        an event. Sell tickets. I’ll be 
                        drawn and quartered. Raffle off 
                        each piece of me.

                                 ANDIE
                        Come on. It wasn’t that bad.

           A car HONKS behind Felix. He nonchalantly waves for it to go 
           around him.

                                 FELIX
                        I sang, Andie. I just...sang, along 
                        to myself. She didn’t even say a 
                        word.

                                 ANDIE
                        Maybe she was in awe of your 
                        falsetto?

                                 FELIX
                        Not helping.

           Andie steps into the street beside Felix.

                                 ANDIE
                        You can’t win ‘em all.

                                 FELIX
                        All I had to do was talk to her, 
                        like a normal human being. And I 
                        sang her a song just because Ankush 
                        mentioned that she liked it.

           Andie just watches Felix berate himself, inching closer to 
           comfort him in a way.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        You get so excited for something 
                        and it just...I had every line, the 
                        entire conversation planned out in 
                        the shower this morning. And 
                        yesterday. And for the past two 
                        years, this perfect back-and-
                        forward...

           He’s out of words. Watches his feet instead.

                                 ANDIE
                        Maybe we should focus on another 
                        goal instead, ya know?
           She pulls out the folded up yellow list from her pocket.

                                 FELIX
                        You keep that in your pocket?

           She hands it to Felix. He unfolds it.

                                 ANDIE
                        Tonight may not be the worst night 
                        to get drunk for the first time.

                                 FELIX
                        At least I can drown my sorrows. It 
                        still does that, right?

                                 ANDIE
                        Still an adequate function of 
                        alcohol, so I’ve heard.

           INT. ANDIE’S DAD’S HOUSE - DAY

           The living room. Off-colored brown couches. A mermaid lamp. 
           Felix and Andie stand half a room away, staring at ANDIE’S 
           DAD, a balding nebbish man, slumped over in a Lay-Z-Boy, 
           wearing a suit, complete with tie, shoes with dress socks, 
           but absolutely no pants. Just boxers.

                                 ANDIE
                        He was stood up by this bimbo 
                        secretary who he asked out to get 
                        back at my Mom who’s been dating a 
                        middle school geography teacher. He 
                        was gonna call it a night until he 
                        found out that the secretary stood 
                        him up to have a threesome date 
                        with my mom. He hasn’t moved for 
                        four hours.

           Felix slowly turns his head, but he can’t keep his eyes away.

                                 FELIX
                        How’d he get his pants off with his 
                        shoes still on?

                                 ANDIE
                        There are things in life we may not 
                        be meant to know.

           Andie walks to the stairs. Felix stares for a moment longer 
           before scurrying after her.
           INT. ANDIE’S DAD’S ROOM - DAY

           Andie leads Felix into the walk-in closet.

                                 ANDIE
                        This is my Dad’s secret alcohol 
                        stash. He used to hide it from my 
                        Mom because she would steal it 
                        while he was at work. Now it’s more 
                        of a vanity thing.

           She parts the hanging trousers.

           A WOODEN CABINET

           Andie opens it. Inside are two labeled sections: “Happy” and 
           “Lonely.”

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        Pick one.

                                 FELIX
                        Definitely “Lonely.”

           Andie snags a bottle of WINE from the “Lonely” section.

           She stands on her tip-toes, reaches above, out of sight, and 
           pulls down two wine GLASSES. Hands one to Felix.

           EXT. UPSTAIRS BALCONY - DUSK

           Felix leans back in a chair, sipping tentatively on his wine. 
           Andie takes larger swigs but each time seems shocked by it.

                                 FELIX
                        I can taste the loneliness.

                                 ANDIE
                        Bitter, with a touch of harrowing 
                        depression.

           Andie extends her glass.

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        To our collective loneliness.

                                 FELIX
                        Whatever that means.

           They clank glasses. Drink more. A quiet nothingness.

                                 ANDIE
                        And there she is...
           DOWN ON THE STREET

           ANDIE’S MOM emerges from the house on the opposite side, 
           glitzy and trying too hard. A bookish MAN and a stuffy WOMAN 
           follow her, like a coyote and her feasting partners.

           FELIX AND ANDIE

           Lean back, spectating.

                                 FELIX
                        She gets two dates. I get...red 
                        wine.

                                 ANDIE
                             (re: her parents)
                        I wish they’d get a divorce 
                        already.

           The Man opens his car door for Andie’s Mom and she 
           flirtatiously touches his face.

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        Stop fooling themselves. They hate 
                        each other.

           The car ZOOMS off.

                                 FELIX
                        Maybe they will.

                                 ANDIE
                        They won’t. They’ll stick it out 
                        until the end. They’re assholes.

           She takes a long, deep drink.

                                 FELIX
                        Well, when I’m gone, you can have 
                        mine.

                                 ANDIE
                        I’ll consider it.

                                 FELIX
                        My mom always wanted a daughter. 
                        You’d be my parting gift to her.

           A meager smirk. They both sip their wine, feel the air 
           chilling, and relax. At ease.
                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        You know why today sucked? Because 
                        I was actually convinced everything 
                        was going to work. That I’d show 
                        up, Knox Overstreet the hell out of 
                        her, and bam I emerge victorious.

                                 ANDIE
                        You don’t even know her. For all 
                        you know she’s one of those girls 
                        who owns a choke collar.

           Felix rocks forward.

                                 FELIX
                        But I do know her. You know when 
                        you meet someone and you just get 
                        it? That’s what it’s like for me. I 
                        know.

                                 ANDIE
                        But what if she’s average? What if 
                        she’s...like the rest of us?

           Andie refills her glass. Offers it to Felix who sees no 
           reason to decline.

           They drink. Verging on tipsy.

           Andie stares at Felix, who’s lost in thought.

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        Still thinking about it?

           He nods.

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        You have to give it up. You don’t 
                        have the kind of time to dwell on 
                        that too much.

                                 FELIX
                        Yeah, but it was like...agh, right 
                        there.

                                 ANDIE
                        Call her. If you remotely told her 
                        half of what you’ve told me about 
                        her, she’d at least consider. You 
                        met in a bathroom. Everything’s an 
                        upgrade after that.

           Felix shakes his head.
                                 FELIX
                        No, no. I can’t do that.

                                 ANDIE
                        Why?

                                 FELIX
                        I’m drunk.

                                 ANDIE
                        You’re not drunk. You’re just 
                        giggly.

                                 FELIX
                        But they’re painful giggles. I 
                        can’t...

                                 ANDIE
                        Are you gonna stop talking about 
                        Camille then?

           Felix stops. Smiles.

                                 FELIX
                        No. Okay, okay, I’ll do it.

           Felix brings out his cell phone.

                                 ANDIE
                        You have her number?

                                 FELIX
                        It was on Facebook. I know, it’s 
                        kinda creepy, but she put it up 
                        there. Okay, okay. What do I say?

                                 ANDIE
                        Just talk, don’t worry. The worst 
                        thing she can do is ignore the 
                        call.
                             (then)
                        Practice on me, if you’re so 
                        concerned.

           Felix stares at Andie. Concentrating.

                                 FELIX
                        Camille...
                             (beat)
                        Camille...
                             (beat)
                        Camille...
                                 ANDIE
                        Okay, let’s get past the name.

                                 FELIX
                        You look amazing.

                                 ANDIE
                        She will be on the phone, so don’t 
                        go with that.

                                 FELIX
                             (trying not to laugh)
                        I would like to schedule a time to 
                        fornicate in the near future.

                                 ANDIE
                        How about this...shut up and call 
                        her.

           He dials.

                                 FELIX
                        Okay, fine.
                             (beat)
                        It’s her answering machine.

                                 ANDIE
                        Focus.

           Felix takes a breath.

                                 FELIX
                        Hey, Camille. It’s Felix Chester. 
                        I’m not sure if I heard the beep or 
                        not, so I’ll stall for a couple 
                        seconds to make sure. I don’t know 
                        if you know me, or know of me, so 
                        this is all going to sound a little 
                        weird, but I have to try. You might 
                        remember me as the guy that sang to 
                        himself at environmental club 
                        today. I only came to not-so-subtly 
                        run into you. That sounds terrible, 
                        but if you think of it in a 50’s 
                        romance way, all it means is 
                        that...
                             (beat)
                        Have you ever been in line 
                        somewhere, or just...walking, and 
                        you catch someone’s eye and you 
                        feel like for every second you 
                        decide not to talk to them, you’re 
                        missing out on something...amazing?
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 FELIX (CONT'D)
                        I don’t know. I sound ridiculous. 
                        Maybe you and I could meet 
                        sometime, that’s all I’m trying to 
                        say. So if you’re interested, you 
                        know where to find me. Thanks. 
                        Hope...hope to see you soon. Bye.

           He closes his phone slowly.

                                 ANDIE
                             (absorbed in that call)
                        That was good.

           Felix gulps down his wine, wide-eyed.

           INT. TEACHER’S LOUNGE - MORNING

           Andie and Felix sit around a circular table with TWO HUNGOVER 
           TEACHERS. All four of them wear SUNGLASSES and have the ashen-
           pale complexion only possible from a long night of drinking.

           Hungover Teacher #1 pulls out a pack of Alka-Seltzers. Pops 
           one out. Drops it into his glass of water. Passes it along.

           It reaches Felix. He downs his bubbly drink desperately.

           He rubs his forehead, throbbing.

                                 FELIX
                        Ugh. I...just...ugh.

                                 ANDIE
                        My tongue feels so foreign.

           Felix whimpers. Just a little.

                                 FELIX
                        My life...

           A KNOCK on the SIDE PANEL WINDOW next to the door.

           A second KNOCK finally stirs Hungover Teacher #2 to look. He 
           takes a half-drunken second, points to Felix.

           Felix lifts his head. Looks at the window. Eyes WIDE:

           CAMILLE.

           She waves. Points to Felix. Felix points at himself, 
           questionably. Camille nods. Felix points at Andie. Camille 
           shakes her head, points at Felix. Felix points at himself one 
           more time.
           Hungover Teacher #1 stands up to shoo Camille away.

           Felix shrugs at Andie. Stands up. Passes Hungover Teacher #1. 
           Opens the door slightly.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I got your message.

                                 FELIX
                        Oh. I’m...sorry.

                                 CAMILLE
                        No, no. I thought it was...well, I 
                        don’t know. I’m here to do a column 
                        on your school’s new fountain. I 
                        took the assignment...on a whim. 
                        Wanna join me?

           Felix lifts up his sunglasses.

                                 FELIX
                        Now?

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Camille walks with a sense of direction, despite not knowing 
           where to go. Felix tries to keep pace.

                                 CAMILLE
                        So I have to ask. Why me?

                                 FELIX
                        What do you mean?

           A Curious Student passes, eyeing Felix with suspicious.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Well there has to be a reason, 
                        unless you go around leaving 
                        messages on every girl’s answering 
                        machine.

           Felix turns to block the Curious Student’s gaze from Camille.

                                 FELIX
                        Was it that awkward?

           She smiles.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        Can I say you’re really cute and 
                        let that be reason enough?
                                 CAMILLE
                        Probably not.

                                 FELIX
                        I’ll think of something.

           They pass by VENDING MACHINES. She stops.

                                 CAMILLE
                        So you know now, I’m addicted to 
                        the really cheap versions of Root 
                        Beer.

           As she talks, Felix’s focus turns to the FLYER behind her--a 
           drawing of Felix in the Shawkshank Redemption rain scene.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        The kinds that you find in like 
                        vending machines outside of 
                        donation centers. They’re 
                        delicious.

                                 FELIX
                             (reaching for his wallet)
                        I-I’ve got it. I love-I love crappy 
                        soda. Get me one too. Here.

           He hands her a few bucks.

                                 CAMILLE
                        What a gentleman.

           While she bends over to use the machine, Felix COUGHS and 
           TEARS down the flyer. CRUMPLES it.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                             (handing him a soda)
                        Enjoy.

                                 FELIX
                        Thanks. The fountain’s...this way.

           They turn down the hallway and Felix drops the balled up 
           flyer behind him.

           EXT. CENTERVIEW HIGH COURTYARD - DAY

           Camille and Felix walk out of the main building, sipping 
           their cheap Root Beers. Every time Felix drinks, he struggles 
           to keep a straight face.
                                 CAMILLE
                        Give it to me straight. Felix 
                        Chester in a nutshell.

                                 FELIX
                        Let’s see.

           They approach an unfinished FOUNTAIN.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        I’ve had a pretty busy week, 
                        actually. I started playing 
                        baseball with this group of kids 
                        down at an old abandoned lot, and, 
                        you know, I’m pretty awful, but 
                        they needed a new ball. So I 
                        thought: my dad has tons in those 
                        little plastic containers, I’ll 
                        take one and that’s that. Well, I 
                        hit my first home run and lost the 
                        ball only to find out it was signed 
                        by that, uh, Babe Ruth guy. And 
                        just...mayhem ensued.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I think I know one of those guys. 
                        Benny the Jet Rodriguez, right?

                                 FELIX
                        It’s a lot more fun when people 
                        don’t know The Sandlot. How about 
                        you, the environmentalist from 
                        Mayfield?

                                 CAMILLE
                             (thinking)
                        I recently got separated from my 
                        family while in San--

                                 FELIX
                        Homeward Bound 2: Lost in San 
                        Francisco. Don’t even try it.

                                 CAMILLE
                        That’s not even possible!

                                 FELIX
                        And I now have the confidence to 
                        say that this soda tastes awful.

           She laughs. Stops.

                                 CAMILLE
                        What’s going on over there?
           A small crowd starts to form around a GUY ON A SOAP BOX...

           They surround what appears to be an ALTAR.

                                 SOAP BOX MAN
                        This is not a child, this is a man 
                        who embarked on a journey to our 
                        humble town to remind us not of the 
                        perils of death...

           Camille walks toward it. Felix steps ahead of her.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Do you guys have like radical 
                        Christian groups or something?

                                 SOAP BOX MAN
                        ...but instead of the grandeur of 
                        life itself. He will not be 
                        forgotten!

           Felix glances through the bodies. A picturesque altar, 
           brimming with candles, with a framed yearbook photo of FELIX 
           in the center -- THE VIGIL.

                                 FELIX
                             (cutting Camille off)
                        I wouldn’t get near them. They’re 
                        zealots, they’re crazy. They’ll 
                        proselytize your socks off.

           She keeps moving closer.

                                 CAMILLE
                        They just gather on the lawn? I 
                        mean freedom of speech and all, but 
                        it seems weird.

                                 FELIX
                             (frantic)
                        I have a meeting I have to go to. 
                        So we should go. Don’t want you to 
                        get lost around here. Some shady 
                        folks.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I’m okay.

                                 FELIX
                        No, I-I-I want to walk you to your 
                        car. I feel like that’s a good cap 
                        on things.

           She stops.
                                 CAMILLE
                        How ‘bout this: I’ll pick you up 
                        later. Let’s do this again, but for 
                        real.

                                 FELIX
                        Okay. Yeah. Yes.

                                 CAMILLE
                             (turning to leave)
                        Thanks for the drink.

           She throws her pad and pencil in the trash.

                                 FELIX
                        What about the article?

                                 CAMILLE
                             (halfway gone)
                        What article?

           OFF FELIX -- absolute joy.

           INT. ANDIE’S ROOM - MOM’S HOUSE - DAY

           ON FELIX -- absolute panic.

           He paces the room. Andie stands, watching.

                                 ANDIE
                        Take a deep breath.

                                 FELIX
                        I think I should wear my sweatshirt 
                        around my waist.

                                 ANDIE
                        No, you shouldn’t.

                                 FELIX
                        What if I start singing again? 
                        Maybe that’s my nervous tic. In 
                        times of peril, I harmonize.

                                 ANDIE
                        Relax. Lose your virginity, then 
                        have a heart attack. You need to 
                        breathe.

           She puts her hands on his shoulders.
                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        Remember the plan, okay? Go in for 
                        the kiss. Baby steps. Always be 
                        closing.

                                 FELIX
                        Okay. I got this. On the cheek, on 
                        the lips?

                                 ANDIE
                        No, on the collar bone. Be natural.

                                 FELIX
                        Natural. Au naturale.

                                 ANDIE
                        Do you whatever you did when you 
                        hooked up with Lori Werner.

                                 FELIX
                        I might’ve made that up. Never 
                        happened. I was in 8th grade, I 
                        didn’t think my next opportunity 
                        would come right before I die.

                                 ANDIE
                        Well, then you’re gonna have to 
                        learn on the fly...

           Felix nods.

           INT. CAMILLE’S CAR - DAY

           Camille swerves and speeds and jams on the breaks. An all 
           around awful driver. Felix taps his leg, nervous for entirely 
           different reasons.

                                 CAMILLE
                        How do you not have a license?

                                 FELIX
                        I didn’t feel like it was all that 
                        necessary. Someone’s always willing 
                        to drive.

                                 CAMILLE
                        It’s freedom. Don’t you ever get 
                        the urge to just...leave?

                                 FELIX
                             (evading)
                        Isn’t that what we’re doing now?
                                 CAMILLE
                        Do me a favor. Grab a CD from my 
                        glove compartment labelled 
                        “Scantron.”

           He opens the glove compartment.

                                 FELIX
                        Sounds like really lame techno.

           Sorts through receipts, movie stubs, pens. JUNK.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I don’t like throwing things away.

                                 FELIX
                        I would never have known.

           Finds the CD. She puts it in--

           MMMBOP. HANSON. Seriously.

                                 CAMILLE
                        You can change it if you want.

           Felix clicks the Next button--

           MMMBOP. HANSON.

           Next--

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        They’re all the same song.

           She rolls down the windows as she starts to SING. Volume UP.

                                 FELIX
                        Why? Why would you make a CD-

                                 CAMILLE
                        Sing! It’s a rule in my car. You 
                        sing, or you go home. It’s my test 
                        to see if you’re worth my time.

                                 FELIX
                             (mumbling)
                        They’re gone so fast. Oh, yeah.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Come on, you can do better than 
                        that.

           She starts really putting some lungs behind her rendition.
           Felix bobs his head. Getting louder. Clearer.

                                 FELIX
                             (getting down)
                        Ba dubi bop, ba do bop-

                                 CAMILLE
                        Why do you know more words than I 
                        do?

           Camille smiles. Felix loose.

           The car ZIPS by the CITY LIMITS.

           EXT. CITY OVERLOOK - NIGHT

           The lit up buildings and streets look like miniatures. Felix 
           leans over the guardrail, soaking it in. Camille stands 
           several feet away, doing the same.

                                 FELIX
                        How’d you find this place?

                                 CAMILLE
                        Most of my first dates have been in 
                        movie theatres, or hanging out at 
                        some guy’s house when their parents 
                        happen to be out for the night. I 
                        thought this would be more up your 
                        alley.

                                 FELIX
                        Yeah, no, I totally get what you 
                        mean. I’m sick of dates like that.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Girls cornering you in movie 
                        theatres?

                                 FELIX
                        All the time.

                                 CAMILLE
                             (re: the gap between them)
                        You’re allowed to come closer.

                                 FELIX
                             (nervous)
                        As long as you allow it.

           Felix inches closer. He quickly notices how close his hand is 
           to hers.
                                 CAMILLE
                        I actually used to come out here to 
                        rehearse for auditions when I 
                        thought I wanted to act. No one 
                        comes out here, so you can talk to 
                        yourself and no one notices.

           He puts his hand on hers. Sweaty. Heart pounding.

           She takes his hand and wipes it off on his shirt, then holds 
           it. Laces fingers.

                                 FELIX
                        Sorry.

                                 CAMILLE
                        You don’t have to be nervous.

                                 FELIX
                        Easier said than done.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Come here.

           She pulls him close. And kisses him. His first kiss. Off 
           guard and unsure what to do with his hands.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        No pressure.

                                 FELIX
                        Okay.

           She leans on the guard rail again, back to normal.

           INT. FELIX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Felix closes the front door behind him. He turns around and 
           sees:

           CONNIE anxiously waiting at the base of the stairs. She 
           stands up.

                                 CONNIE
                        Where have you been?

           DAVID rushes in, steps feet away from Felix, looming over 
           him.

                                 DAVID
                        You can’t disappear without a phone 
                        call or a note. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Your mom called every person at 
                        your school wondering where in the 
                        world you went.

           In the background, Pete passes, simply shaking his head at 
           the hypocrisy.

                                 FELIX
                        I’m sorry...

                                 CONNIE
                        We worry about you.
                             (beat)
                        There’s too much that can go wrong.

           David holds his stare.

                                 DAVID
                        So where were you?

                                 FELIX
                        I stayed out with Andie, I didn’t 
                        think it was a big deal.

                                 DAVID
                             (before Connie can answer)
                        We know for a fact you weren’t with 
                        Andie. Why are you lying to us?

           The door CREEKS open--Camille SLIPS inside. Dead silence.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Sorry. Felix, you forgot your 
                        jacket in the car. I just realized.

           After a moment, Felix forces a smile and takes the jacket. 
           David stares, Connie shifts her feet.

           Camille smiles, despite the tense silence.

                                 FELIX
                        Mom, dad. Camille. Camille, the 
                        parents.

                                 CONNIE
                        It’s nice to meet you.

           David nods his hello.

                                 CONNIE (CONT’D)
                        How...how long have you two known 
                        each other? Do you go to 
                        Centerview?
                                 CAMILLE
                        Oh, no. I go to Mayfield. We met 
                        the other day, pretty random 
                        encounter.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh.

           A silence.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I really should head out. It was 
                        nice to meet you all.

           She ducks out. The door closes behind her, but the silence 
           remains.

                                 DAVID
                        That isn’t fair. That’s not fair to 
                        her. Not with you like you are.

           Felix puts his head down and charges upstairs. David keeps 
           his stare where it was. Connie watches David.

           INT. FELIX’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Felix sits at his desk, mindlessly watching Japanese game 
           shows on his computer. He barely moves when the door opens 
           and Connie walks in, holding a mug of tea on top of The Tough-
           Minded Optimist, her current read.

           She places the tea in front of Felix, understanding that he 
           isn’t going to talk.

           She turns to leave and stops at the doorway.

                                 CONNIE
                             (unsure)
                        If you need me to drive you to 
                        any...dates, or need money so you 
                        guys can go some place nice, 
                        just...tell me, okay?

           Felix continues to gaze at his computer, but he hears every 
           word.

                                 CONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you two could go out for 
                        milkshakes. That always worked on 
                        me.
                             (then)
                        I was a cheap date.
           She smiles. Turns, book in hand, and leaves.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Felix sits on the sidelines while Andie half-heartedly takes 
           part in a way intense game of dodgeball. Ankush plays for the 
           other team, limping around.

                                 ANDIE
                        Three bases to go, unless we’re on 
                        the metric system.

                                 FELIX
                        It was terrifying. I have to figure 
                        out the whole breathing thing. I 
                        have a deviated septum, maybe that 
                        means I can’t make out-

                                 ANDIE
                        You’ll figure it out.

                                 FELIX
                        Yeah, by tonight. She’s hanging out 
                        at my house. I feel like that’s a 
                        big step. My house. My domain.

                                 ANDIE
                        I take it that means no Wonder 
                        Years Wednesday?

                                 FELIX
                        Oh, sorry. Yeah, is that okay?

                                 ANDIE
                        Yeah, no worries. Probably a good 
                        night to lay low anyway. I’m 
                        supposed to work on a chem project 
                        with Jeff.

                                 FELIX
                        How’re things with the Greenbaum?

                                 ANDIE
                        He’ll ask me in time. He just needs 
                        to work up the courage first.

           On the opposite team: JEFF GREENBAUM, nerdy chic, decent 
           looking, but balls of Play-do, holds a ball, refusing to 
           throw it at Andie.

                                 FELIX
                        He won’t even throw the ball at 
                        you.
                                 RANDOM JOCK
                        Hit her, Jeff! Damnit!

                                 JEFF
                        Give me space, okay?

                                 ANDIE
                             (to Felix)
                        Like I said. In time.

           In the background, a ball SLAMS into Ankush’s legs. He falls 
           over with a THUD.

           INT. FELIX’S ROOM - DAY

           Felix and Camille lay on his bed, on top of the covers. His 
           arms stick to his sides, unsure of how to go about something 
           as simple as putting his arm around her.

                                 CAMILLE
                        You’re sure your parents don’t hate 
                        me?

                                 FELIX
                        They adore you. Right after you 
                        left, my dad came up to me, gave me 
                        a pat on the back, and said “you 
                        get ‘em, tiger.” And my mom openly 
                        wept. It was a great moment.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I’ve never made good first 
                        impressions. I’ve never had any 
                        parents like me. I corrupt their 
                        precious children.

                                 FELIX
                        No...worry about...corruption with 
                        me. I’m pretty screwed up as is. 
                        Pretty dark...

           Felix slides his arm behind Camille, about to wrap it under 
           her head--

                                 CONNIE
                        Just wanted to check in! Brought 
                        some snacks.

           Connie steps into the room.
                                 CONNIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s pretty muggy in here. Should 
                        open some windows, keep the door 
                        open, get some cross-ventilation in 
                        here.

           She places a tray of snacks on the desk. Mission 
           accomplished.

                                 CONNIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, then.

           She leaves.

                                 FELIX
                        Alright, maybe my mom didn’t openly 
                        weep. But she was...affected.

           Felix holds his breath. Puts his arm around Camille. She 
           wiggles in closer when she feels it.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I like that she checks in on you. I 
                        wish my mom could do that.

                                 FELIX
                        It’s a pain, really.

           They both adjust themselves, not quite fitting together.

                                 CAMILLE
                        My mom died when I was in 7th 
                        grade. I didn’t start dating until 
                        8th, so my door always remained 
                        closed at all times.

           Felix stares out, past Camille. A topic he knows too well.

                                 FELIX
                             (supposed to say it)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 CAMILLE
                        It happens. She had cancer, it’s 
                        not like it came as a surprise to 
                        anyone. I had years of preparation 
                        until it really got bad.

           Felix tries to steady his breath, all too aware of it.
                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                             (off of Felix’s silence)
                        I was, uh, I had an audition for 
                        the first middle school play of my 
                        career the day she was rushed to 
                        the hospital, and apparently she 
                        demanded that no one call me until 
                        after my audition was over. I 
                        remember my teacher saying “good 
                        job, we’ll post the parts on 
                        Thursday, your aunt is outside 
                        waiting for you,” all in one 
                        breath. And by the time I got to 
                        the hospital, my mom couldn’t talk.
                             (then)
                        I got the part. I was gonna be Kim 
                        MacAfee in Bye Bye Birdie. Dropped 
                        out.

           Felix pulls his focus back in. His mouth slightly open as if 
           he wants to say something. But nothing comes out.

           He unconsciously pulls her in a little closer.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        Is your hand on my leg?

                                 FELIX
                        What? I didn’t mean-

                                 CAMILLE
                             (much more upbeat)
                        A strange time to get handsy.

           She flips around.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        Ugh. Move your leg and scoot up a 
                        bit.

           He does. They still don’t fit comfortably.

                                 FELIX
                        I think you’re too short. You need 
                        to put your arm under my body. And 
                        I’ll...slide my leg under yours.

                                 CAMILLE
                        You’re too tall. My arm has no 
                        blood in it anymore.
                                 FELIX
                             (struggling)
                        Cuddling’s an art. It’s Jenga with 
                        bodies.

           Still doesn’t fit. Camille laughs.

           She pulls on his shoulders and brings him to eye level. And 
           kisses him. Close, tight.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Are you holding your breath?

                                 FELIX
                        Not intentionally.

           She smiles.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

           A mandatory art show for all the art-based classes. Each 
           student, dressed formally, stands in front of their painting, 
           sculpture, modernist take on paper mache as parents amble 
           around through the maze of artistry.

           Not surprisingly, most parents find themselves in front of a 
           minimalist masterpiece by a wildly smiling Felix. Andie 
           stands deserted one display over.

           A Bushy Browed Parent shakes Felix’s hand.

                                 OL’ BUSHY BROW
                        I’m sorry for your...impending 
                        loss.

                                 FELIX
                        I like to think the soul lives on.

           Bush-a-Plenty shakes his head in unfortunate disagreement. 
           Walks away.

                                 ANDIE
                        She seems a little easy.

                                 FELIX
                        No, we just understand each other. 
                        We’re comfortable. We get it.

           His phone RINGS. It’s Camille.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        See what I mean?
           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Camille stands against the wall, dressed up and, frankly, 
           looking ridiculous good.

                                 CAMILLE
                             (on phone)
                        Hey. I just wanted to call to tell 
                        you that I won’t be free tonight...

           She walks down the hall a few paces.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, it’s...homework and I have 
                        that geology project.

           She turns into a set of double-doors--

           INT. GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS

           --emerging into THE ART SHOW. Smiling. Her surprise ready.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I’ll call you later. Okay. Miss you 
                        too.

           She hangs up. She weaves through the various art displays, 
           searching for Felix. She glances at some of the paintings 
           ever-so-briefly.

           A Toucan with a moustache. A picture of Felix looking to the 
           Heavens. A sculpute of Felix in the nude. A painting of a 
           clown. Another Felix depiction...

           She slows down as her unfocused browsing picks up more and 
           more Felix-themed pieces.

           She stops at a classic Felix on the cross. Approaches the 
           Turtle-Shelled Glasses Wearing Student who painted it.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        What’s this...all about?

           AT FELIX’S STATION

                                 FELIX
                             (to Andie)
                        So she’s busy tonight. Probably 
                        doesn’t want to get too close, you 
                        know how it is.

           Shakes the hand of another Parent. 
                                 PARENT
                        Is your piece for sale?

                                 FELIX
                        Uh. Sure?

                                 PARENT
                        Fantastic. How about fifty?

                                 FELIX
                        Fifty dollars?

                                 ANDIE
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think we’re all 
                        aware that artist’s values triple, 
                        no, quadruple post death. I’ll give 
                        it to you for a hundred.

                                 PARENT
                        Sold.

           The Parent forks over a crisp hundred.

                                 ANDIE
                             (to Felix)
                        I want my ten percent.

           The Parent leaves, and the next person in line steps up--

           CAMILLE. At a loss for words. Mouth open. Blinking back tears 
           and rage and sadness and every damn emotion that’s storming 
           her mind at this moment.

                                 FELIX
                             (shit)
                        Wha-why-what are you doing here? I 
                        thought you were busy?

           She shakes her head. Stunned.

                                 CAMILLE
                             (finally)
                        How do you keep that from someone?

                                 FELIX
                             (panic)
                        Things are going so well, I don’t 
                        know, what was I supposed to do?

           Camille paces a few steps.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        It’s not as terrible as it seems.
           She gives him one hard look, erasing everything she could’ve 
           possibly felt for him in one glare. Turns. And walks away. 
           Out the door.

           Gone.

           Andie watches Felix as he stands motionless.

           His phone RINGS in his pocket. He picks it up without 
           breaking his stare as Camille exits the building.

                                 CONNIE (V.O.)
                        Felix? Come home immediately. Dr. 
                        Nagelman just called. There’s a 
                        chance for a transplant.

           INT. KITCHEN - FELIX’S HOUSE - DAY

           Felix sits at the breakfast table. Still. Connie paces 
           around, touching every pot and pan, every counter top. Silent 
           save the squish of Connie’s ever-moving rubbery soles.

           Waiting.

           RING--

           Connie SNATCHES the phone off the wall.

                                 CONNIE
                        Hello?
                             (flat)
                        No. He’s not in. He’ll-he’ll be 
                        home later. Can you-
                             (annoyed)
                        Can you call back later? I cannot 
                        take a message right now. He is not 
                        in! Thank you.

           She hangs up. Takes a steadying breath. Returns to pacing.

                                 CONNIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s been half an hour. They must 
                        know by now if the other person was 
                        a match. They would’ve called. They 
                        would’ve called by now.

           RING...

           Connie stares. Almost afraid to pick it up.

           RING...
           Felix stands and reaches for the phone, feeling Connie’s 
           breathless gaze.

                                 FELIX
                        Hello? Mhmm. Yeah...we assumed so. 
                        No, that’s...wonderful. Tell him 
                        congratulations. Yeah, I’ll tell 
                        her.

           David walks into the front door. He silently peers into the 
           kitchen as he pulls off his tie.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. I appreciate it. I know.

           He hangs up.

           Shakes his head as a simple “no.”

           Connie’s entire body shudders. David stands in the doorway, 
           needing no further explanation.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - FELIX’S HOUSE - DAY

           White iPod earbuds in his ears, listening to a Celine Dion 
           playlist, headlined by It’s All Coming Back to Me Now.

           Felix stares out the window at The Perfect Family across the 
           street, piling into their Range Rover, probably going to get 
           a bite to eat their favorite weekly restaurant.

           Connie tears through the pages of Tough Times Never Last, but 
           Tough People Do!, taking out her frustration with every turn, 
           not even reading.

                                 DAVID
                             (walking into room)
                        We need to set the table. Con, if 
                        you wanna start the green beans, 
                        I’ll get the potatoes in the oven.

           He looks at his family, silent and scattered across the room.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Come on, people will be here soon.

           Connie slams her book shut. Gets up. Storms off.

                                 CONNIE
                        You’re not the one handling death 
                        and menopause at the same time!
           David refocuses on Felix. He leans over him, pulls out an 
           earbud.

                                 DAVID
                        You need to set the table.

                                 FELIX
                        Right now?

                                 DAVID
                        Yes, right now. Apparently I have 
                        to get all of the food ready 
                        myself, so the least you could do 
                        is set the table.

                                 FELIX
                        I feel like I’ve earned a day off. 
                        It’s enough that I have to sit 
                        through a Chester family reunion 
                        tonight.

                                 DAVID
                        This isn’t for you, Felix. It’s for 
                        them. Can you do that for me?
                             (off his look)
                        Fine. I’ll set it myself.

           As Felix puts the earbud back in, the doorbell RINGS.

           INT. DINING ROOM - FELIX’S HOUSE - DAY

           Felix stares at his plate, disgusted by the thought of 
           eating.

                                 UNCLE KEITH (O.S.)
                        So any ladies in your life, Felix?

           PULL BACK to REVEAL Felix sitting at the kid’s table with 
           Pete and two YOUNG COUSINS pre-occupied with what food can 
           fit in their noses.

           Several feet away, at the full-sized adult table, a stone-
           faced AUNT PAIGE stares down a jovial UNCLE KEITH. Connie and 
           David sit at the ends of the table, surrounded by Other 
           Family Members (UNCLE MIKE, COUSIN TREVOR, etc).

                                 UNCLE KEITH (CONT’D)
                        What? If I were in his situation, 
                        I’d be thinking of nothing but 
                        plowin’ trou.

                                 AUNT PAM
                        I know you would.
                                 FELIX
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        I’m currently single.

           News to Connie, though she remains silent.

                                 DAVID
                        How’s the Big 5 treating you, 
                        Keith?

                                 TREVOR
                        You still have to go to school, 
                        Felix? I mean, why would you?

                                 DAVID
                             (interrupting)
                        Let’s keep the doomsday talk to a 
                        minimum.

           Pete sneaks out the back door, unnoticed by everyone but 
           Felix.

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        Have you considered embracing your 
                        religious roots-

                                 DAVID
                        Come on, there has to be something 
                        we can all talk about that 
                        isn’t...this.

           Silence.

           Felix slips out of seat and walks out the back door fast 
           enough that no one can stop him.

                                 UNCLE KEITH
                        I did recently find a buyer for my 
                        truck on Craigslist.

                                 DAVID
                             (disappointed)
                        Is that so?

           EXT. PORCH - DUSK

           Pete sits on the top step, relaxing in silence. The screen 
           door creaks open. Felix steps out, sits down next to Pete.

                                 FELIX
                        What’s up?

           Pete just kind of shrugs. They’re both fine with the silence.
                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        You know women pretty well, right?

                                 PETE
                        I do know my bitches.

                                 FELIX
                        Okay then. So you know how I’ve 
                        been dating this girl, right?

                                 PETE
                        No...you? Bold play.

                                 FELIX
                        Yeah, well. It’s over.

                                 PETE
                        That sucks.

                                 FELIX
                        Right as it started getting...good.

                                 PETE
                        Your fault or hers?

                                 FELIX
                        Mine. Me, as a whole.

                                 PETE
                        Ah. I’m picking up what you’re 
                        putting down. We all make our 
                        mistakes. I’ve been through it 
                        every year since the ‘garten. 
                        Doesn’t mean it’s over.

                                 FELIX
                        I’m pretty sure in this case, it’s 
                        over.

                                 PETE
                        Never say die. Look...there are two 
                        ways to win a woman back. I 
                        wouldn’t tell anyone this, but, I’m 
                        cuttin’ you some slack.
                             (holding up a finger)
                        One: find some memento of your 
                        relationship. Something small like 
                        a flower you saw in window thirty 
                        minutes after you met her for the 
                        first time. Something ridiculous, 
                        she’ll eat it up.  Girls love that. 
                        They put it in their memory boxes 
                        and keep it until they’re eighty.
                                 FELIX
                        That actually sounds reasonable.

                                 PETE
                        Two: when you do apologize to her, 
                        make sure she feels you. Like 
                        really feels you. Touch her hand. 
                        Caress the face. Brush up against 
                        her leg, you know? Let her know 
                        you’re a sensual guy. They want 
                        that. She won’t care what you’re 
                        actually saying, she’ll only think: 
                        “wow, this guy’s got the touch.”
                             (then)
                        Works every time.

                                 FELIX
                        Creepy yet intensely informative.

           A pause as Felix ingests what his twelve-year old brother 
           just said.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                             (genuine)
                        Thanks.

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                             (inside, yelling)
                        Felix! Where’d you go? Come back 
                        inside!

           Felix looks at Pete, doesn’t get up yet. Pete trains his eyes 
           on the distance, away from Felix.

                                 PETE
                        It’s going to suck when you’re 
                        gone. All the attention is suddenly 
                        going to be all on me. I hate that.

           Pete shoots Felix a fleeting glance before averting his eyes 
           back to the horizon.

           Felix stands up. Ruffles Pete’s hair. Walks inside.

           INT. FELIX’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Felix hunches over an open drawer, only the desk light on in 
           his room.

           Between letters, tokens, and ticket-stubs:

           A KEY. Jagged, scratched, worn.
           Felix flips it in his hand. Gazing into it, like he can see 
           the reflections of a memory between the grooves.

           He crawls into bed, still holding the key, still examining 
           it. Lies down. Lets his eyelids fall.

           IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           OUT OF BREATH. Felix COUGHS himself awake. Startled. He sits 
           up, huffing, the wind seemingly knocked out of him.

           He looks around, his breath steadying, searching his body 
           with his hand to make sure he’s still alive.

           INT. HALLWAY - FELIX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Felix explores the hallway. Unable to sleep.

           He stops outside of his PARENTS’ ROOM. Door open.

           Connie, in her sleep mask, and David, sprawled over the 
           entirety of the mattress, sleep soundly in their king-sized 
           bed.

           Felix stares, too old to wake them up when he can’t sleep.

           He turns back toward his room. A faint BUZZ grows as he nears 
           his door.

           INT. FELIX’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Felix’s phone RATTLES around on his night stand. A square of 
           light disrupting the darkness.

           As Felix enters, it stops. He reaches for it - ONE MISSED 
           CALL. Before he can press a button, it BUZZES in his hand.

                                 FELIX
                             (picking up)
                        Hello?

                                 ANDIE (V.O.)
                        Hey. Did I wake you up?

                                 FELIX
                        No. Just doing my cardio.

                                 ANDIE (V.O.)
                             (not all right)
                        Can you come over? Please.
                                 FELIX
                        Everything okay?

           Felix clicks on the overhead light.

                                 ANDIE (V.O.)
                        Yeah. Yeah. Can you just head over?

                                 FELIX
                        Sure. Give me a few.

                                 ANDIE (V.O.)
                        Head around back. Don’t go in the 
                        front door. I’ll leave my window 
                        open.

                                 FELIX
                             (unsure)
                        Okay.

           She hangs up. Felix pauses. Gets moving.

           EXT. ANDIE’S MOM’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Felix, in makeshift attire - jeans, sleep shirt, slippers - 
           trudges around the side of the house to the back.

           He, familiarly, props a chair up against the house. Uses it 
           to climb onto the next level of roof. Sneaks past a window. 
           Hops into an open one.

           INT. ANDIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Andie sits, hunched over, on her bed. Felix pops in. Walks 
           next to her and sits.

                                 FELIX
                        Hey.

                                 ANDIE
                        Hey.

           Felix overhears faint sounds from downstairs: YELLING. An 
           argument between Andie’s parents. Andie simply listens from 
           her own room.

           She looks at Felix. An uncomfortable smile. He copies her, 
           understanding.

           He lays back, propping his head up on a couple of pillows. 
           Andie follows moments after, curling up next to Felix.
           She lays her head on his chest, listening to his heart beat.

           She closes her eyes, but he keeps his open.

           The argument rages on downstairs.

           INT. ANDIE’S ROOM - MORNING

           Andie listens to Felix’s heartbeat as he sleeps.

                                 ANDIE
                             (counting the beats)
                        Dum dum. Dum dum. Dum dum.

           She pretends it stops. Holds her breath. Then:

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        Dum dum. Dum dum.

           Felix spies this, awake, his eyelids barely lifted.

           INT. FELIX’S ROOM - DAY

           Felix swings his backpack over his shoulder. A new day.

           He pockets the KEY before rushing out the room.

           INT. FELIX’S HOUSE - DAY

           Felix dashes down the stairs. Connie spots him from the 
           kitchen.

                                 CONNIE
                        What about breakfast?

                                 FELIX
                        Not hungry. Gotta get to school 
                        early.

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        Don’t forget to take out the trash.

                                 FELIX
                        Got it.

           And he’s out the door.

           EXT. FELIX’S HOUSE - DAY

           Felix drags the trash bins onto the street.
           He checks behind him, at his house, to make sure no one’s 
           watching. Once he’s sure, he takes off in the opposite 
           direction.

           EXT. CAMILLE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Camille comes out of her house, ready for school, 
           unsuspecting.

           Across the street, Felix sits on the curb, waiting. He holds 
           fifteen-or-so Hallmark cards.

           Camille spots him. Considers passing by. But they’ve already 
           made eye contact. She approaches, hands in her pocket, the 
           kind of look that says “you have thirty seconds.”

                                 FELIX
                        There wasn’t an “I apologize for 
                        hiding my terminal condition” card, 
                        so...I bought everything else.

           He hands over the stack. “Get Well” to “I’m Sorry for Your 
           Loss,” to “It was the alcohol's fault, let’s be a family 
           again.” Each signed “Love, Felix.”

                                 CAMILLE
                        Is everything a joke with you?

                                 FELIX
                        I thought it’d lighten the mood...

                                 CAMILLE
                        It’s not exactly a light topic.

                                 FELIX
                        Try living with that every day. You 
                        find a way. Here...

           He hands her the KEY from his drawer.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s stupid, but I found 
                        this on the ground before we left 
                        the city overlook. I kept it. I’m 
                        sure someone’s lamenting their lack 
                        of key, but...take it.

           He hands her the key. She holds it. Closes it in her palm.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I can’t just forget this tiny 
                        little detail, Felix. It’s not that 
                        easy.
                                 FELIX
                        I know, but...

           He grabs her hand, but she tears it away. So much for Pete’s 
           advice.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        What would you have done if I met 
                        you and said “hey, I’m Felix 
                        Chester, I like you, let’s go out 
                        some time, and small caveat, I’m 
                        dying.”

                                 CAMILLE
                        But that didn’t happen.

                                 FELIX
                        Everywhere I go someone hands me a 
                        free coffee or they let me cut in 
                        line or they do all my work for me. 
                        For once, everything worked out for 
                        the right reasons, not because I 
                        was...me.

           She looks down the street. Aching to escape.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I don’t think you get it.

                                 FELIX
                        Then tell me! I don’t know what to 
                        do, okay?

                                 CAMILLE
                        Go home. ‘Cause there are so many 
                        more important things to do than to 
                        be with someone you’ve known for 
                        three weeks.

                                 FELIX
                             (overlapping)
                        I wanna be here.

                                 CAMILLE
                        You don’t know what you want. If 
                        you really have a month left, then 
                        go home. Tell them you want to be 
                        there. Don’t let them wonder why 
                        you’re out here instead of with 
                        them.

           She walks to head car. Opens the door.
                                 FELIX
                        You’re really going to break up 
                        with a dying kid?

                                 CAMILLE
                        That’s dirty.

                                 FELIX
                        I’m aware. And I can’t pretend to 
                        know how this all feels from your 
                        end, but whether this is for a 
                        month, a year, ten years, I don’t 
                        plan on leaving this porch without 
                        good news.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I’m sorry.

           She gets inside the car. Closes the door.

           Felix stands, watching, hoping, waiting, urging the door to 
           re-open as Camille sits inside. But it doesn’t. The engine 
           ROARS to life.

           INT. CAMILLE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           She backs out of her driveway, eyes trained ahead. Felix 
           grows smaller and smaller in her rearview mirror.

           Far enough away, she finally exhales. Takes a moment simply 
           to breath. Trying to justify what she just did.

           PRE-LAP:

                                 ANDIE
                        Felix. Felix!

           INT. CENTERVIEW HIGH HALLWAY - DAY

           Andie stands beside a heavily decorated table selling prom 
           tickets.

           Felix snaps out of a zombie-like daze a few feet away.

                                 FELIX
                        What?

           Vicky Pataki, Felix’s former crush, and a LACKEY, obligatory 
           unattractive best friend, sit behind the table.

                                 ANDIE
                        What should I do?
                                 FELIX
                        With what?
                             (to Vicky, no longer 
                              caring)
                        Hey Vicky.

                                 ANDIE
                        The guy’s supposed to buy the 
                        tickets, right? Or should I buy 
                        one? Or buy both, just to be nice?

                                 FELIX
                        Jeff asked you?

                                 ANDIE
                        Not yet. We talked today though. He 
                        asked me how my day was and if I 
                        enjoyed carnival rides. In Spanish.

                                 FELIX
                        Just ask him out. Get it over with. 
                        It’s pathetic.

                                 ANDIE
                        Forget it. Let’s go.

           She walks down the hall, not waiting on Felix.

                                 VICKY
                             (to Felix)
                        Are you buying a ticket?

                                 FELIX
                        I’m...I’m not going.

           Felix follows after Andie.

                                 VICKY
                             (calling after him)
                        But you have to go! You’re the main 
                        attraction!

                                 FELIX
                             (to Andie)
                        Slow down.

                                 ANDIE
                        We’re gonna be late for class.

                                 FELIX
                        Come on. I’m tired, I can’t walk 
                        that fast.

           He slows down, but she keeps going.
                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        Stop. Andie.

           He sits against a wall, catching his breath.

           Andie stops. Looks back at Felix, taking a much needed rest.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                             (feeling it)
                        I’m tired.

           She pulls off her backpack. Sits along the wall, a distance 
           away.

                                 ANDIE
                        Then we’ll sit.

                                 FELIX
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ANDIE
                        It’s okay.

                                 FELIX
                        Why won’t you do it?

                                 ANDIE
                        Some things are worth waiting for.

                                 FELIX
                        I’d kill to have what you have. No 
                        matter what you do, he’ll say yes. 
                        He’s a sure thing.
                             (then)
                        I can’t even...I need more time.

           The bell RINGS.

                                 ANDIE
                        Let’s go.

           Andie stands up and offers a hand. After a moment, Felix 
           takes it. Pulls him up.

           INT. FELIX’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Felix holds his phone.

                                 CONNIE (O.S.)
                        Felix, dinner!

                                 FELIX
                        Okay, I’ll be down in a second.
           He dials Camille, not the first time tonight, and not the 
           last.

           Waits. Hopes.

           Answering machine. He hangs up...

           INT. KITCHEN - CAMILLE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           ...Camille watches her phone on the table until the screen 
           darkens. She exhales, as if she were holding her breath until 
           it ended.

           CAMILLE’S FATHER, 50s, once had a spark to him that’s since 
           been robbed or simply burned out, places papers on the table, 
           airline tickets peeking out from underneath.

                                 CAMILLE’S FATHER
                        Well, I got the tickets.

           He checks all the documents, not even checking for Camille’s 
           attention.

                                 CAMILLE’S FATHER (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take a cab in the morning. You 
                        have the number for the hotel. I’ll 
                        be back on Monday.

           Grabs his things. He considers saying something else, but 
           leaves instead.

           Camille sits in the kitchen. Alone. Scans the room.

           INT. CAMILLE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Camille sits on her bed. A jewelry box on her lap. She opens 
           it.

           Amongst pictures of her mother, letters, mementos, sits 
           Felix’s KEY.

           She picks it up. Spins it between her finger tips. Thinking. 
           Takes a deep breath. And pulls out her phone. Dials.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Hey Felix.
                             (beat)
                        My dad’s...going away for the week 
                        on a business trip. I was 
                        wondering...keep me company, okay?
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAMILLE (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, I’m sure. Wednesday. I’ll see 
                        you then.

           She flips it closed. A sigh of relief.

           INT. CVS PHARMACY - DAY

           Andie examines a box of CONDOMS. Felix feigns incredible 
           interest in a bag of Werther’s candy on the opposite side of 
           the aisle.

                                 ANDIE
                        Do you want one with ribs?

                                 FELIX
                        I want a normal, penis shaped one.

                                 ANDIE
                             (realizing)
                        Why am I the one doing this?

                                 FELIX
                        Because you’re a veteran.

                                 ANDIE
                        It was one guy.
                             (showing the boxes)
                        And do you consider yourself a 
                        magnum or a regular?

           Felix pushes them away.

                                 FELIX
                        Don’t show them to me. You’re 
                        supposed to be conveniently on the 
                        other side of the aisle.

           Felix grabs a box of each. And one extra. For insurance.

                                 ANDIE
                        You really think she’s going to put 
                        out?

           They walk toward the register. Felix snatches random 
           assortments of merchandise off shelves to cover the condoms 
           in his basket.

                                 FELIX
                        Better to have them now instead of 
                        her screaming “surprise sex!” and 
                        I’m totally unprepared.
                                 ANDIE
                        Women are known to yell such 
                        things. But three boxes worth?

                                 FELIX
                        I’m making up for lost time.

           They pass a MEN’S HEALTH AISLE.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        Should I get some Viagra or 
                        something? Cialis? Oh God. What if 
                        I...you know.

                                 ANDIE
                        I’m pretty sure Viagra would kill 
                        you.
                             (then)
                        Actually, sex will probably kill 
                        you too.

           They reach the register and Felix starts unpacking his 
           basket. Candy. Nasal spray. Lufas. Oh, and condoms.

           The Cash Register Guy eyes Felix.

                                 FELIX
                             (embarassed)
                        It’s for charity. Food drive.

           He swipes a pack of gum. Places it on top.

           INT. WAITING ROOM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Felix walks past magazine-reading patients to the 
           Receptionist. Stands silently.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        May I help you?

                                 FELIX
                        I’m, uh, I’m here to see Dr. 
                        Nagelman.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Do you have an appointment?

                                 FELIX
                        No. He told me to come in if I 
                        needed to talk to him.
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m sorry. We’re backed up today. 
                        Call and make an appointment.

                                 FELIX
                        Can you just tell him Felix Chester 
                        is here? It’ll only take a minute. 
                        Please.

           The Receptionist stares down Felix, but he won’t budge. She 
           rolls her eyes and slithers out of her chair and into the 
           back area.

           Felix watches the waiting patients. An elderly man. A snooty 
           woman. And a mother consoling her panicked child--

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (annoyed)
                        Go on in. He’s waiting.

           Felix snaps out of his gaze.

           INT. NAGELMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Graduate degrees. Awards. Shelves of hefty books. Dr. 
           Nagelman sits behind his grand desk and stands at the sound 
           of his door opening.

           Felix walks in. Shakes Dr. Nagelman’s extended hand. Sits.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN
                        I’m glad you’re coming to see me. 
                        How’s your family doing?

                                 FELIX
                        They’re good.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN
                        How about you? How’ve you been 
                        holding up?

                                 FELIX
                        Hanging in there.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN
                        Any signs of...fatigue, 
                        breathlessness, chest pains?

                                 FELIX
                             (lying)
                        Nope.
           A silence. Dr. Nagelman searches Felix’s face, but Felix 
           focuses on the ground.

           Dr. Nagelman pinches the bridge of his nose.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN
                        I know none of this is easy for 
                        you. There must be so many 
                        questions, most of which, as a 
                        doctor, I can’t answer for sure.

           Felix taps his fingers on his knee nervously.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN (CONT’D)
                        But if there’s anything you’re 
                        worried about, or you’re unsure 
                        about, I really want to try and 
                        help.

           Felix looks everywhere but at him.

           An awkward silence.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. How about this--

                                 FELIX
                        I was-I was wondering whether...my 
                        heart could handle...sexual 
                        activity.
                             (clarifying)
                        Like sex.

           Dr. Nagelman shifts back in his chair.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN
                        Oh.
                             (disappointed)
                        Well, I don’t see why not, 
                        technically.

           Felix stares at his hands. Nods.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN (CONT’D)
                             (trying)
                        Is there anything else I can help 
                        you with? Anything at all?

                                 FELIX
                             (quiet)
                        No.

           Felix stands up.
                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

           He opens the door to leave.

                                 DR. NAGELMAN
                        Felix...my door’s always open.

           Felix flashes a brief, toothless smile.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Felix taps his foot. Waiting for the clock to hit 3:00.

           Mrs. Drummond writes on the white board, but Felix focuses 
           purely on the second hand wheeling around. 2:59...

           The bell RINGS. Felix snaps up, backpack in hand, and he’s 
           gone.

           INT. CENTERVIEW HIGH HALLWAY - DAY

           Felix crams his books into his locker. Excited. Nervous. He 
           turns to leave and sees Andie down the hall.

           He makes his way toward her. Notices she’s talking to 
           someone. Jeff Greenbaum. Felix stops.

           Andie and Jeff seem to be getting along. Lots of smiling, 
           averting of eyes, and jittery hand gestures. 

           Felix considers going over to Andie, but turns and exits.

           INT. FELIX’S ROOM - DAY

           Felix tosses a duffel bag onto his bed and OPENS it.

           He FILLS it with an absurd amount of clothes.

           He WASHES the dishes, finishing the last of his chores.

           He HIDES the condoms snuggly between socks.

           He SHAVES his already hairless face.

           He SMACKS on far too much cologne.

           He HOPS around, trying to rid of excess energy.

           One deep breath. ZIPS the bag up. Slings it over his 
           shoulder.
           INT. FELIX’S HOUSE - DAY

           Felix comes down the stairs, ready to leave. Connie hovers at 
           the base.

                                 CONNIE
                        You’ve got your toothbrush?

                                 FELIX
                        Yes, mom.

                                 CONNIE
                        Extra socks? You have your phone, 
                        your wallet, your keys.

                                 FELIX
                        I have everything. It’s a movie 
                        marathon, I don’t need much.

                                 CONNIE
                        Why am I letting you out on a 
                        school night? I’m a terrible 
                        mother.

                                 FELIX
                        ‘Cause I’m growing up way too fast.

           Connie hugs him. Doesn’t let go easily.

                                 CONNIE
                        Be safe, okay?

                                 FELIX
                        Trust me. I will.

           Felix heads out the door. Connie lingers behind the closed 
           door. David passes her, walking up the stairs.

                                 DAVID
                        He’s blatantly not having a movie 
                        marathon.

                                 CONNIE
                        I know.

           EXT. CAMILLE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Felix KNOCKS on the door. Camille opens it.

                                 FELIX
                        I’m here for the sleepover.
           INT. CAMILLE’S HOUSE - DAY

                                 CAMILLE
                        May I take your bags, sir?

                                 FELIX
                        Yes, you may.

           She walks away. And flings the bag into the corner. Problem 
           solved.

           Felix remains near the door.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Come on.

           He hesitates and follows.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        What are you so nervous about?

                                 FELIX
                        Nothing. Sorry.
                             (then)
                        So what are we...doing tonight?

                                 CAMILLE
                        I don’t know. But I have a surprise 
                        for you.

           She escapes down the hall. Felix follows far behind, looking 
           at each framed picture hanging on the wall.

           Family photos of Camille and her parents. Pictures of 
           Camille’s Mom, the type you’d only hang once they’re gone.

                                 CAMILLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hurry up!

           Felix lingers for a moment before turning back down the hall.

           LIVING ROOM

           Felix watches from a distance as Camille rushes to a shelf 
           and grabs a RECORD. She tries to shield it from Felix’s view 
           with her arms.

           She places the LP on a scrappy record player. Puts the needle 
           down.

           Felix waits, confused. She approaches him with a finger on 
           her lips. Just wait...

           That Thing You Do! plays.
           Felix smiles. Camille mouths the words to him.

                                 FELIX
                        I’m surprised you remember.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I was afraid you wouldn’t.

                                 FELIX
                        That’s not the kind of absolute 
                        failure you forget easily.

           Camille wiggles around. Her version of dancing.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I found this last week at a garage 
                        sale. I was gonna give it you as a 
                        gift, but...

                                 FELIX
                        You found out I was dying.

           She looks down.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        It happens.

                                 CAMILLE
                             (trying to bring the mood 
                              back up)
                        Dance. At least swing your arms.

           She puts more energy into her dancing. Felix doesn’t move.

                                 FELIX
                        Uh, I shouldn’t...

                                 CAMILLE
                        Come on.

           She grabs his shoulders and starts swinging them for him.

                                 FELIX
                        ...because of the whole 
                        heart...thing.

                                 CAMILLE
                             (stopping)
                        Oh my God! I’m so sorry.

                                 FELIX
                        I’m joking.

           Felix smiles.
                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        Relax. You can’t kill me. No matter 
                        how hard you try. I’m like 
                        everybody else. Sort of. Not at 
                        all. But you get the point.

           She hits him on the shoulder--he GRABS at his chest.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Ah! No, are you okay?

                                 FELIX
                        Seriously?

           Camille exhales. Her whole body at ease, needing to relax.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Don’t do that.

           She comes close to him. Close dancing, simple swaying. Felix 
           falls into rhythm and she leans her head against his chest.

           The music trickles out. Song over. The needle gently scraping 
           the LP, but no sound coming out. But they keep swaying.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        What’s it like?

           Felix takes a moment.

                                 FELIX
                        It’s kinda like...those nightmares 
                        where you know you’re in a 
                        nightmare, so the entire time 
                        you’re waiting to wake up.

           Swaying. Rotating. A comfortable silence.

                                 CAMILLE
                        What are you thinking?

                                 FELIX
                             (eyes closed)
                        Nothing.

                                 CAMILLE
                        That can’t be true.

                                 FELIX
                        You’d be surprised.

           A beat. Camille kisses him.
                                 CAMILLE
                        What do you want to do?

                                 FELIX
                        Anything’s fine.

           MONTAGE OF THEIR DATE -- JULIA NUNES “FIRST IMPRESSIONS”

           --They search through cupboards, finding a chess board and 
           decide to play. Camille makes her move, and Felix ponders...

           --They cook, chopping up food, tossing everything in the 
           spice rack into a pan. And kiss.

           --They eat, filling wine glasses with discount root beer. 
           Under the table, Camille runs his foot up Felix’s leg.

           --Felix still thinks about his chess move. One day...

           --They continue to cook, but they would rather make out. The 
           flames on the stove engulf the pan. But they keep making out.

           --Camille dives on top of Felix, still on that one chess 
           move. They make out even more, hardcore, while Felix keeps 
           his eye on the board. While she drags him down, he makes his 
           move.

           --They flop backwards onto her bed, kissing much more gently. 
           Their eyes taking more notice of each other than before. 
           Felix kisses her neck. She starts to pull up his shirt...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM - FELIX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The family table. Connie, David, Pete, and an empty chair. 
           They eat in silence.

           Connie’s eye catches the empty chair. Temporary for now, but 
           soon to be a fixture.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ANDIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Andie sits on her bed watching The Wonder Years. Alone. She 
           stares at the screen, but barely pays attention.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CAMILLE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Lights off. Felix, shirtless, breathes over Camille. She 
           kisses him, rubbing his back, calming him.

           He reaches forthe night stand. Fumbles. Grabs a condom. Pops 
           it open. Reaches beneath the covers.

           A pause.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Your disease isn’t 
                        like...contagious, right?

                                 FELIX
                        Cardiomyopathy is the new herpes.

           The hint of sarcasm drops as he looks Camille in the eyes. 
           Lowers his head for a kiss, right on her forehead, between 
           the eyes.

           He stops. His mouth slightly open, wanting to say something. 
           But he drops back down for another kiss.

           She grabs onto his back, digging in her fingernails suddenly. 
           Their breathing picks up...

           INT. CAMILLE’S ROOM - LATER

           Camille lays on her side, asleep, facing away from Felix. He 
           sits up, his bare chest above the sheets. He looks at her 
           sleeping. His breathing remains jagged. Long, deep breaths.

           Strips of light through the blinds cut Felix into pieces.

           He stares out. Eyes glazed over. Focused. His chest expanding 
           with every breath. He’s alone.

           Now what?

           INT. KITCHEN - CAMILLE’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Eggs sizzling. Pancakes solidifying. Bacon baconifying. Felix 
           mans the stove in an apron and boxers.

           Camille walks in, dressed and ready to go.

                                 CAMILLE
                        What’s this?
                                 FELIX
                        I didn’t know what to do while you 
                        were in the shower, so...

                                 CAMILLE
                        You made bacon.

                                 FELIX
                        Exactly. Sit.

           He brings over plates of food.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        I was wondering...

           He brandishes TWO TICKETS.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to be my prom date 
                        for this Saturday?

                                 CAMILLE
                             (re: Felix’s lack of 
                              pants)
                        Where did those tickets come from?

                                 FELIX
                        My apron pocket.
                             (pressing)
                        I know most people would do this 
                        before...doing...the sex-

                                 CAMILLE
                        Is that what we’re calling it? 
                        Doing the sex?

           Felix sits down, waiting.

                                 FELIX
                        So how about it?

           Camille takes a large bite. Trying not to have to answer.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I can’t. I’m sorry.

                                 FELIX
                        You don’t need to buy a dress or do 
                        anything like that. We can go in 
                        normal clothes, I just thought it’d 
                        be fun.

                                 CAMILLE
                        It’s not like that.
                                 FELIX
                             (re: his performance)
                        Was it something I did...or didn’t 
                        do?

                                 CAMILLE
                        No...

                                 FELIX
                        Then come on, it’ll be fun. It’ll 
                        be the one normal thing about me.

           She looks at the sink, away from Felix.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I have to be here. Every year I do 
                        something small for my mom.

                                 FELIX
                        Oh.

                                 CAMILLE
                        My dad’s in Hawaii. That’s where he 
                        and my mom went on their honeymoon, 
                        so every year he goes and stays in 
                        the same room, eats at the same 
                        restaurants, sees the same shows.
                             (then)
                        And I stay here, and visit her.

           Felix scratches at his plate, suddenly uninterested in food.

                                 FELIX
                        I didn’t know.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I didn’t tell you.

           He pulls the two tickets from the table as discretely as 
           possible, letting them fall onto his lap.

           Camille sees it. And the unsure look on his face.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        You should come with me.

                                 FELIX
                        It’s your day, I couldn’t-

                                 CAMILLE
                        I want you to come.

           She looks at Felix.
                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        And then we’ll go to your prom. 
                        We’ll pretend to be normal for one 
                        night.

           Felix eyes Camille and smiles.

           INT. CENTERVIEW HIGH HALLWAY - DAY

           Ankush pins Felix against a wall. He holds a checklist of 
           talking points.

                                 ANKUSH
                        I’ve reserved a nice space in the 
                        library. I’ll basically go in, warm 
                        up the crowd a bit. Then you’ll 
                        come up and, you know, blow our 
                        minds.

                                 FELIX
                        I have no idea what I’m going to 
                        say-

                                 ANKUSH
                        Do you need any water bottles, or a 
                        podium? I’m gonna get you a podium.

           Felix spots Andie coming out of a classroom.

                                 FELIX
                             (going after her)
                        Okay. Sounds great.

                                 ANKUSH
                        I’ll see you. Friend.

           Felix catches up to Andie.

                                 FELIX
                        Hey.

                                 ANDIE
                        Hey, how’d it go?

                                 FELIX
                             (not all that enthused)
                        I’m a man.

                                 ANDIE
                        Finally!

           Felix WINCES. Rubs his chest. Pain.
                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 FELIX
                             (playing it off)
                        Yeah, yeah. It’s nothing new. Don’t 
                        worry about it.

           Andie watches him, aware of what this means.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                             (changing subjects)
                        Camille’s coming to prom.

                                 ANDIE
                        You guys should totally come in our 
                        limo. There’s a mini-bar, and a sun-
                        roof, and...it’s really like every 
                        other limo, but it’s still a limo.

                                 FELIX
                        I don’t know if we’ll make it in 
                        time, but-

                                 ANDIE
                             (remembering)
                        Oh, damnit. I forgot, I’m supposed 
                        to meet up with Jeff. We’re gonna 
                        match his tie with my dress. 
                        Exciting.

           She backpedals.

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll see you there, okay?

           She waves and bounds off. Felix watches her leave.

           EXT. FELIX’S HOUSE - DAY

           Back from school, Felix makes his way over his lawn to his 
           doorway. Grabs for his keys and notices something across the 
           street at The Perfect Family’s house--

           In the picturesque bay window, The Perfect Wife storms 
           across, The Perfect Husband trailing her, yelling.

           Felix can’t look away.

           The Husband and Wife meet back on the periphery of the 
           window. Arguing. Beyond arguing. Rage. She storms off into 
           the house. He stays for a moment before walking away.
           Felix stands. Waiting for them to return to view. But they 
           don’t. He looks down, trying to comprehend.

           INT. FELIX’S HOUSE - DAY

           A hanging suit in dry-cleaner wrapping.

           Slick black loafers.

           And disposable cameras lined up in a row.

           Connie lays out the merchandise on the couch, readying 
           herself for the impending prom night.

                                 CONNIE
                        Everything is ready for when you 
                        get back.

           Felix stands opposite David, who ties Felix’s tie on himself - 
           the last piece of the suit.

                                 FELIX
                        You guys don’t have to wait for me. 
                        I don’t know how long this 
                        whole...thing will take.

           David pulls off the tie and puts it with the rest of the 
           suit.

                                 CONNIE
                        Don’t kid yourself. We cleared our 
                        schedules for this.

           A car HONKS outside. Felix makes for the door.

                                 FELIX
                             (leaving)
                        Do you think I should get a 
                        corsage?

                                 CONNIE
                        We forgot the corsage!

           David shakes his head at Felix - why make her panic?

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Windy. Quiet. Sparse pockets of visitors kneel before 
           gravestones. Vibrant flowers amongst drab, cold stones.
           Camille navigates through the graves, holding a bouquet of 
           flowers. Felix follows, watching people mourn privately, 
           aware of each and every engraved name he passes.

           She stops at a grave.

           OLIVIA JENSEN; 1956 - 2005; Loving wife and mother.

           Camille picks up an old bouquet left from her last visit. In 
           routine, she drops it in the trash.

           Felix watches from a distance.

                                 CAMILLE
                        You know, you can talk.

           She fills the grounded metal vase with fresh water. Places 
           the new flowers in.

                                 FELIX
                             (self-conscious)
                        It just feels...weird.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Cemeteries aren’t sad places. I’d 
                        rather be here than struck at home, 
                        alone, thinking about it.

           She steps back. Looks at the grave. Her eyes shift down.

           Silence.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        She was a pretty cool woman.
                             (beat)
                        She had tons of energy. She always 
                        had to be doing something, talking 
                        on the phone, planning some event. 
                        If she didn’t have anything else to 
                        do, she’d just walk and hum. It 
                        drove me crazy.

           Camille leans over and wipes a leaf off the gravestone.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        But there was this calm about her. 
                        Like everything was under control, 
                        you know? She could tell you 
                        anything - you won the lottery, you 
                        look great - and you’d believe it. 
                        She made you feel special. 
                        Important. You don’t find someone 
                        like that easily.
           Felix inches over to her, brushing his hand up against hers.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        She just made things work. Without 
                        her, my dad’s lost. He goes through 
                        every day the exact same as before.

           Camille feels Felix’s hand. And holds it. Leans into him.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        I did everything right. I said 
                        everything I was supposed to say. 
                        The “I love yous” and the “I’ll 
                        miss yous,” all of it, even when 
                        she couldn’t say anything back.

           She pauses. Letting the thought air out.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        I still never said “goodbye.” Isn’t 
                        that stupid? I remembered to say 
                        all the things that mattered. It 
                        would’ve sounded ridiculous to say 
                        “goodbye” out of nowhere.
                             (then)
                        But it’s the one thing I forgot.

           Felix turns his head to look at her. Unsure of what to say.

                                 CAMILLE (CONT’D)
                        You would’ve liked her.

                                 FELIX
                        I can tell.

           INT. CAMILLE’S CAR - DUSK

           Camille pulls up in front of Felix’s house. Felix sits, 
           staring into his hands.

                                 CAMILLE
                        I guess I’ll head home and change?

           Felix looks up.

           Across the street, The Perfect Family’s house appears empty. 
           The lights shut off. The cars gone.

           He turns to Camille.

                                 FELIX
                        I was thinking...
           EXT. CAMILLE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Felix continues talking inside the car. He finishes and waits 
           for a response.

           Camille nods. Hugs Felix despite the restraints of seat 
           belts. And they kiss.

           He steps out of the car, heads for his house. She drives off.

           INT. FELIX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Felix sheepishly walks in the door.

           He looks around - Connie buzzes around in the kitchen, David 
           does work in the dining room, Pete does push-ups in the 
           living room.

           Everyone’s distant.

                                 FELIX
                             (finally)
                        Mom?

           Connie emerges from the kitchen.

                                 CONNIE
                        Hey, honey.

           She beelines for Felix’s waiting suit on the couch. He 
           lingers near the door.

                                 FELIX
                        What’s, uh, what are you all up to 
                        tonight?

                                 CONNIE
                        Probably stay in. I think there’s 
                        something new on Lifetime. Why?

                                 FELIX
                        I was thinking...making we could 
                        all go out, you know. Do like a 
                        Leave It to Beaver kind of night.

           Caught off guard.

                                 CONNIE
                        What about prom?

           He looks at the suit. Shrugs.

           A beat. Connie processes this. Smiles.
                                 CONNIE (CONT’D)
                        What did you have in mind?

           INT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

           Musky. Coffins for sale evenly spaced apart throughout a 
           large gallery room. Felix waltzes in with David and Connie in 
           tow. Pete lingers behind, curiously touching and examining 
           each casket.

                                 DAVID
                        This doesn’t scream family bonding 
                        to me.

                                 FELIX
                        It was this or Color Me Mine. This 
                        kills two birds with one stone at 
                        least.

           David leans over a box, his face contorted like there’s an 
           awful smell in the room. Uncomfortable.

                                 DAVID
                        Don’t they sell coffins at CostCo 
                        now?

                                 FELIX
                        Yeah, but you have to buy a four-
                        pack.
                             (then)
                        Look at this one.

           Felix approaches a Dracula-esque coffin.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m sorry, this is...
                             (the entire place)
                        ...it’s too strange.

                                 CONNIE
                        Felix is right, this is an 
                        important moment. It’s a symbolic 
                        gesture.
                             (more for herself)
                        It’s coming to terms with it.

           A MORTICIAN, a car salesman of the afterlife, slides up 
           behind them.

                                 MORTICIAN
                        How may I help you?
                                 FELIX
                        We’re looking to buy a coffin.

                                 MORTICIAN
                             (taken aback)
                        This is the right place to do such 
                        a thing. I know this is a sensitive 
                        topic, but what price range are you 
                        looking in?

                                 CONNIE
                        Anything.

           David shoots her a quick look.

                                 MORTICIAN
                        Do you have any preferences? I know 
                        many are partial to oak and prefer 
                        our lacquer finish, though it is a 
                        bit traditional.

           Connie and David look to Felix.

                                 FELIX
                        I don’t know. I’m not gonna care, 
                        right? This should be your 
                        decision.
                             (off their look)
                        Okay, let’s check out the oak.

           They follow the Mortician over to a simple coffin. David 
           hangs back, distracting himself.

                                 MORTICIAN
                        It’s a very simple look. Very 
                        graceful, if I may say so. 
                        Unadorned but beautiful.

                                 CONNIE
                        I don’t know.

                                 MORTICIAN
                        We have many other selections.

           The Mortician saunters over to another coffin. Connie and 
           David follow, but Felix remains at the simple coffin.

           He leans over and examines the white interior. Runs his hand 
           along the edge. The smooth, black wood.

           It’s so real.

                                 CONNIE (O.S.)
                        Felix, come see this one.
           Felix snaps from his trance.

                                 FELIX
                        Now you’re getting into the spirit.

           He walks over behind Connie. A beautiful coffin in front of 
           her.

                                 CONNIE
                        What do you think?

                                 FELIX
                        I like it. I think it’s nice.

           Connie spins, looks around.

                                 CONNIE
                        Felix, where’s Pete?

           Way in the background, a coffin SWINGS open. Pete POPS up 
           from inside.

                                 PETE
                        Oh my God, Felix. You have to get 
                        this one. It’s so comfortable.

           INT. CONNIE’S VOLVO - NIGHT

           Parents up front. Kids in back.

                        Where to now?

                                 FELIX
                        What’s the most shamelessly 
                        “family” thing we could do?

           David digs in his pockets.

                                 DAVID
                        I have coupons for...Tony Roma’s. A 
                        foot massage - oh, thats’ on 
                        weekends. Bowling-

                                 FELIX
                        Bowling. Definitely bowling.

                                 DAVID
                        This coupon’s only for two games, 
                        so...you guys know the limit.

           Connie rolls her eyes.
           INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

           Felix holds his twelve-pounder high, staring down the ten 
           pins at the end of the lane.

           He takes three steps. Swings. Releases...

           The ball rolls down and crashes into the corner of the 
           triangle. Three pins after a lucky fall.

                                 FELIX
                        Setting the bar.

           Connie claps as Felix takes his seat.

           Pete steps up from his seat. Grabs a ball. He wears a wrist 
           guard and dons the face of a true bowling champion.

           With a lick of the lips, he releases the ball for a cool 
           strike.

                                 PETE
                        Child’s play.

           David ruffles Pete’s hair until he lets go of the scowl and 
           smiles.

           MONTAGE OF BOWLING

           --David tries absurdly hard, yet only hits a few pins. He 
           tries to play it off like it’s no big deal.

           --Connie knocks down a pin for a spare. She’s beating 
           everyone with ease.

           --Pete falls to his knees as he barely misses a split.

           --Felix sucks. He’s absolutely awful.

           --Everyone loosens up. They’re having fun, not thinking about 
           anything else for once.

           END MONTAGE

           David sits behind the console behind the ball return. Felix, 
           Pete, and Connie stand behind him.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not doing it. It’s immoral.

                                 FELIX
                        Fine, let me do it.
           Felix nudges David out of the seat and takes over. He presses 
           a few buttons--

           The score on the overhead screen starts to change. With every 
           click, one of Felix’s frames changes to a strike. Slowly but 
           surely, he reaches the tenth frame.

           The score changes to 300. A perfect game.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - FELIX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Felix and Connie sit on opposite sides of the couch, each 
           reading a book. Peaceful.

           Connie finishes the final page. Closes the book and looks at 
           the cover. The Language of Letting Go.

           She starts to tear up.

           Which builds into a cry.

           And then full on sobbing.

                                 FELIX
                        ...Mom?

                                 CONNIE
                             (through tears)
                        I finished it.

           Felix starts to tear up just seeing Connie cry.

                                 FELIX
                        Stop it.

                                 CONNIE
                        I finished every single book.

                                 FELIX
                             (unable to hold it back)
                        That’s not fair. It’s like yawning.

           They both cry. Connie lets it fly, Felix tries to restrain 
           himself.

           Connie throws her arms around Felix, hugging him close. He 
           keeps his arms at his sides, like all sons do.

           Felix quells his tears, resorting to quivering breaths.

           And he puts his arms around Connie. Hugs her. A real hug.
           She starts to quiet and lets go of Felix. They both sit there 
           for a moment before shifting back to the opposite ends of the 
           couch.

           INT. FELIX’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Felix clicks on the overhead light and plops down at his 
           desk.

           He brings out the bowling score card. A memento.

           After a beat, he pats down his pockets. Searching. Shelves. 
           Drawers. Under a stack of books on his desk, he finds it--

           The List. The wrinkled, yellow lined piece of paper. At the 
           top: Sex. Down the line: Get drunk. Bowl a perfect game. 
           Amongst many others, not achieved.

           “Notarized by Andie Webber.” Signed and underlined.

           Felix looks it over like an old photograph--

           An idea. He grabs a pen. And scribbles on the list, adding a 
           new line, a new goal.

           He looks it over. An updated list. Folds it back up.

           PRE-LAP:

                                 FELIX
                        I need your help.

           INT. CAMILLE’S ROOM - MORNING

           Camille wipes sleep from her eyes. On the phone.

                                 CAMILLE
                        With what?

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        A surprise.

           MONTAGE OF FELIX AND CAMILLE PREPARING...

           --Felix and Camille toss groceries into a bag at the market. 
           Felix examines blueberries with a keen eye, squishing one 
           individually to be absolutely sure.

           --Camille turns on the oven in her kitchen as Felix unloads 
           the bags.
           --They each go through their phones, calling people, like a 
           political campaign’s calling center.

           --Felix covers a basket with a cloth.

           END MONTAGE AS...

           INT. CENTERVIEW HIGH HALLWAY - DAY

           Felix closes ANDIE’S LOCKER. Camille stands next to him.

           They smile. A deed accomplished.

                                 FELIX
                        Sure you don’t wanna stay?

                                 CAMILLE
                        I should get going. I’m already 
                        going to miss first period.

                                 FELIX
                        Okay.
                             (then)
                        Thanks again.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Any time.

           Felix starts to backpedal away.

                                 FELIX
                        I’ll see you later, then?

           She nods. Stops him. And kisses him.

                                 CAMILLE
                        Goodbye, Felix.

           He scurries off to class.

           She stays behind for a moment until he disappears around a 
           corner.

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           Packed. Rows of seats filled, people stand in the back. Right 
           between the non-fiction and the science fiction. Pre-show 
           chatter. Standing behind a podium, Ankush addresses the 
           crowd.

           Felix stands off to the right. Takes a moment to himself.
                                 ANKUSH
                        Without further ado, I’d like to 
                        introduce the man who needs no 
                        introduction: our guest of honor, 
                        Felix Chester.

           A golf-style APPLAUSE. Felix makes the short walk to the 
           podium. Stands behind it.

           Felix notices a life-sized cardboard cut out of himself a few 
           feet to his right. Tries to look away. Fidgeting. Turns to 
           the crowd.

                                 FELIX
                        Didn’t expect this many people.

           He scans the group. No recognizable faces. Just eager fans.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        I don’t really have anything 
                        planned. When I agreed to this a 
                        few weeks ago, I thought I’d just 
                        come up here and deliver my own 
                        eulogy for half an hour, but...

           He continues as...

           EXT. ANDIE’S MOM’S HOUSE - DAY

           Andie walks out of her house, backpack on, eating her 
           breakfast as she goes. A blueberry muffin.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        I know why you’re all here, or I 
                        think I know. You think because I’m 
                        dying, I know something.

           A MAN passes on the sidewalk. Also eating a muffin. He nods 
           in Andie’s direction - a muffin connection. She smiles.

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           Felix gazes into the podium.

                                 FELIX
                        Like I’ve had some epiphany or my 
                        life flashed before my eyes and I 
                        figured out some secret.
                             (looking up)
                        I don’t know anything.
           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY

           Andie crosses at a stop walk. A JOGGER runs in place next to 
           her, chomping away at a muffin as well.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        I’m with you guys. I’m confused, I 
                        don’t know why life’s unfair, or 
                        what we’re supposed to do before we 
                        die.

           She smiles warily. What’s going on?

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        I still don’t understand fax 
                        machines. It took me until a few 
                        weeks ago to go on a real date for 
                        the first time.

           She crosses the street to see PETE. Eating a muffin. He winks 
           at her.

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           The crowd shifts around, glance at each other.

                                 FELIX
                        I’m not the guy with the answers. 
                        I’m the one with all the questions. 
                        I’m still figuring things out, 
                        probably at a third grade level. 
                        Ask your friends, or your parents, 
                        or anyone - the people that’ve 
                        always been there for you.

           INT. CENTERVIEW HIGH HALLWAY - DAY

           Andie opens her locker. 

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        They’re going through it too. They 
                        may not know any better, but 
                        they’re there. And you can’t 
                        understand how much that matters. 
                        Just being there.

           She pulls out a BASKET. Brimming with muffins. She laughs out 
           loud and consciously checks around her.
           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           Felix pauses.

                                 FELIX
                        I don’t know if there are any 
                        secrets. And if anyone figures them 
                        out, please tell me. But...that’s 
                        it. That’s all I’ve got.

           A silence.

           He looks around. Blank stares.

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        I know there’s supposed to be some 
                        kind of Q&A after this, but...I 
                        think this covers it.

           A handful of students politely clap as Felix ducks out, off 
           the make-shift stage.

           Ankush verges on silent tears.

           INT. CENTERVIEW HIGH HALLWAY - DAY

           Andie closes her locker. Felix comes RUNNING up behind the 
           closing door.

                                 FELIX
                        Damnit, I was gonna try to hide 
                        behind it, so you’d close it and 
                        then what? There I am.

                                 ANDIE
                             (re: the muffins)
                        I thought you didn’t believe in the 
                        muffin connection.

                                 FELIX
                        I’m willing to admit I was wrong.

                                 ANDIE
                        How’d you get Pete to help?

                                 FELIX
                        I told him you’d consider sleeping 
                        with him if he did it.

                                 ANDIE
                        Noted.
                             (then)
                        What was the occasion?
                                 FELIX
                        I don’t know. I thought it was your 
                        turn to feel special for a change.
                             (then)
                        Just returning the favor.

           She gets it.

           Can’t contain herself and kisses Felix on the cheek.

                                 ANDIE
                        Thanks.

           He smiles.

           He pulls out a small, folded up piece of paper from his 
           pocket. THE LIST. Hands it over.

                                 ANDIE (CONT’D)
                        You keep that in your pocket?

                                 FELIX
                        I added one more goal.

           She unfolds it. Scans down the list...

           A smile.

                                 ANDIE
                             (re: what he wrote)
                        You too.

                                 FELIX
                        You wanna come to dinner tonight?

           She nods.

           They head down the hall.

                                 FELIX (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I’ve heard it described a lot of 
                        different ways...

                                 ANDIE
                        You won Prom King, by the way.

                                 FELIX
                        Who won Prom Queen?

                                 ANDIE
                        You did also. It was really 
                        confusing.
                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        Some liken it to a gentle spring, 
                        or smoke raised with the fume of 
                        sighs.

           INT. FELIX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Andie joins Connie, David, Pete and Felix for dinner around 
           the table. They talk and enjoy themselves.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        Others compare it to a pain, a jab 
                        to the chest, a deep cut. Most 
                        people just say it feels good. Or 
                        it feels right.

           A series of flashbacks in quick succession while Felix 
           continues to talk:

           Connie making Felix an elaborate breakfast in the morning.

           Connie crying on the couch next to Felix, draping her arms 
           over him for a hug.

           Pete sitting outside on the porch giving advice to Felix.

           David repressing his reaction at dinner after first hearing 
           the news of Felix’s health.

           David tying Felix’s tie to get ready for prom.

           And Andie...

           In Felix’s room, writing the first edition of the list.

           Buying condoms with Felix.

           Sleeping on Felix’s chest while her parents argue downstairs.

           The flashbacks end. Felix’s family continues to eat as Pete 
           hits on Andie.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        And yes, they also say it feels 
                        like a freight train running over 
                        your chest. And they say your hands 
                        get sweaty and a tingling feeling 
                        rushes to your fingers and toes. 
                        And they say it can happen at any 
                        time, in the blink of an eye, 
                        without any warning whatsoever.
           Felix simply looks happy, for lack of a better word, in the 
           company of the people that were there from the start.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        They were wrong.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
