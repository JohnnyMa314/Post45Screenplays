           EXT. WINTER FIELD - DAWN 

           A blinding snow falls across an endless frozen horizon. White 
           as far as the eye can see. There is a hard wind, and against 
           it, a strange sound of rustling metal.

           Through the snowstorm emerges the outline of a wooden pole. A 
           fence post. Hanging off it are thick lengths of barbed wire, 
           dancing in the wind.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN (V.O.)
                        (Russian accent)
                        Lieutenant. Wake up.

           INT. LUBYANKA HEADQUARTERS - STEPAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           A man opens his bloodshot eyes, waking out of sleep. He is 
           laying face-down on a desk in a small office.

           This is STEPAN - middle aged, disheveled, and exhausted. He 
           wears a wrinkled and stained shirt. Staring down at him from 
           above is a thin CAPTAIN in a blue and green police uniform.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        What, you been sleeping down here?

           Stepan sits up and rubs his face, struggling to focus. 

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN (CONT’D)
                        You missed the staff meeting. 
                        That’s a report.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...I...what time is it?

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Ten past midnight. The trucks are 
                        waiting. Time to work.

           Stepan says nothing. He closes his eyes, takes a breath, then 
           rises. A leather jacket hangs off his chair. He slips it on.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN (CONT’D)
                        I have to report you, for the 
                        meeting.

                                 STEPAN
                        Comrade Captain. 

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Hey, I don’t make the rules. Go on, 
                        they’re waiting. Also, look.
           The Captain opens a bag by his feet and hands Stepan a 
           shoebox. Stepan takes the box with a confused look. He opens 
           it up and stares at what is inside. 

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN (CONT’D)
                        I, uh, my daughter’s. She dropped 
                        and broke it.

                                 STEPAN
                        What? Are you serious?

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        I heard you grew up fixing these 
                        things, so-

                                 STEPAN
                        When am I supposed to do this?

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        When you get home.

                                 STEPAN
                        (Angry, motioning to his desk)
                        Like I sleep enough as it is?

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        C’mon, do it for me, Comrade. Maybe 
                        I don’t file your absence sheet. 
                        Both know you could use that.

           Stepan stares at the box, thinking, then takes it with a 
           sigh. Without a word he heads for the door.

           INT. LUBYANKA HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Stepan moves down a florescent lit hallway, the box under one 
           arm. Uniformed OFFICERS are everywhere despite the late hour.

           Text appears on screen:

              Moscow, September 1937.

           Stepan flashes a laminated identification card to a GUARD. A 
           POLICE COURIER catches up to him, waving a letter and a 
           clipboard.

                                 NKVD COURIER
                        Comrade Lieutenant! Comrade, 
                        dispatch from Administration 
                        Directorate. 

           Stepan signs the clipboard and takes the letter. He opens and 
           reads it as he steps through a door into a stairwell. 
           INT. LUBYANKA - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           A cement stairwell. The walls are rigged with anti-suicide 
           nets. Stepan descends the stairs, reading intently. 

           Two prison WARDERS pass him, struggling to carry a body bag 
           up the stairs. Someone is moving inside it. Stepan doesn’t 
           bother to look.

           When Stepan reaches the bottom floor he suddenly crushes the 
           letter angrily. He stuffs it in his pocket, quickly glancing 
           left and right to make sure he’s alone. 

           He takes out a flask and drinks.

           Stepan pockets the flask, rubs his eyes, then pushes open a 
           door to reveal a blaring packed garage. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - MOTOR POOL - CONTINUOUS

           The massive bright garage is filled with OFFICERS and roaring 
           trucks. The trucks have all been disguised with delicious 
           pictures of bread and vegetables on their sides. Two STAFF 
           SERGEANTS are washing blood out of one with a hose. 

           Stepan moves through the garage to the far end of the line of 
           trucks. Waiting for him there are his small team - two young 
           STAFF SERGEANTS in uniform and a near-teenaged DRIVER. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Who’s got Our Brand?

           A sergeant hands him a cigarette. Stepan lights it, the shoe 
           box still tucked under an arm. He smokes in silence for a 
           moment, then draws a crumpled map from his coat pocket. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...we, uh, we have fourteen 
                        suspects to arrest tonight across 
                        Tverskoy District, most near Garden 
                        Ring.

                                 STAFF SERGEANT BALDY
                        Tverskoy? Why isn’t Butyrka-

                                 STEPAN
                        Because their cells are full, even 
                        more than ours. Now there’s been 
                        another operations change from the 
                        Commissariat. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEPAN (CONT'D)
                        From now on we do not conduct 
                        procedural searches for evidence 
                        and we don’t file arrest reports 
                        unless there is an incident, which 
                        we don’t have time for tonight, so 
                        no book burners, no suicide 
                        attempts, no runners. Understood?

                                 STAFF SERGEANT BALDY
                        You ever seen anyone actually run?

                                 STEPAN
                        No. Now-

                                 MAJOR MISHIN (O.S.)
                        Lieutenant! Cabbage Boy! 

           Stepan turns to see a huge, hairy old officer lumbering 
           towards him. This is MAJOR MISHIN, nicknamed “Old Bear.” He 
           walks with a heavy limp.

           Stepan’s team snaps to attention, but not Stepan. He 
           approaches Mishin with a grin and hugs him.

                                 STEPAN
                        Old Bear, who opened your cage? 

                                 MAJOR MISHIN
                        Your mother. Hey, I got you a gift. 
                        Junior Lieutenant!

           A young man approaches. He is handsome, clean shaven, and in 
           a perfectly fitting uniform. This is ILYCH.

                                 MAJOR MISHIN (CONT’D)
                        Lieutenant Lebedev, meet Comrade 
                        Junior Lieutenant Ilych 
                        Aleksandrovich Sidorov. Straight 
                        from Dzerzhinsky Academy, top 
                        marks. He’s your new protégé. 
                        You’re going to train him.

                                 ILYCH
                        (Saluting, grinning)
                        From Burevestnik to Dynamo, eh?

           Stepan takes a step back. He looks at Mishin, bewildered.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...train? No, Mishin I-

                                 MAJOR MISHIN
                        Stepan.
                                 STEPAN
                        I can’t train someone. Not now. 
                        Don’t do this to me, please.

           Ilych shifts uncomfortably. Mishin forces a smile.

                                 MAJOR MISHIN
                        Lieutenant. Can we talk? Alone? 

           Stepan nods. He hands the map to Ilych.    

                                 STEPAN
                        Prep the team. Baldy, Pepper, in 
                        the Raven. Us in the Pobeda alone.

                                 STAFF SERGEANT BALDY
                        Lieutenant, I’m in the truck?

                                 STEPAN
                        No arguing. This in the backseat.

           Stepan hands the shoebox to Ilych. Ilych salutes Mishin and 
           leads the sergeants off to the truck. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Is this about that staff meeting? 
                        The Captain already gave me shit.

                                 MAJOR MISHIN
                        No. Listen. You need to stop 
                        writing letters. 

           Stepan shifts, surprised. Mishin looks around, ensuring they 
           are alone.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...how did you-

                                 MAJOR MISHIN
                        Nothing comes through here without 
                        me knowing. Cabbage, what were you 
                        thinking? You know how this looks?

                                 STEPAN
                        I’m not allowed to write? 

                                 MAJOR MISHIN
                        No one is getting a transfer, not 
                        now. Stop asking Directorate, you 
                        hear me?

           Stepan says nothing. Mishin steps closer and whispers.
                                 MAJOR MISHIN (CONT’D)
                        Chekists spend their whole career 
                        trying to get assigned to Moscow, 
                        and you want out? What, you don’t 
                        like serving the people? 

                                 STEPAN
                        Of course I do.

                                 MAJOR MISHIN
                        Then do it. No more letters.

           Mishin turns to go. Stepan grabs his arm, whispering.

                                 STEPAN
                        Mishin. Wait.

                                 MAJOR MISHIN
                        I don’t want to hear this.

                                 STEPAN
                        Look, I’m tired, alright? The 
                        quotas, and now this kid? Don’t-

           Mishin glances around to make sure no one is around, then 
           suddenly grabs Stepan and slams him against a truck, 
           whispering hard and angrily.

                                 MAJOR MISHIN
                        I said I don’t want to hear this. I 
                        get twenty-five years ‘cause you 
                        want to be a shirker? Stop it. You 
                        have a duty, damn it, and don’t 
                        think I don’t smell that on you! 

           Mishin shoves him. Stepan stares down at the ground. Mishin
           takes a breath and calms down. A beat. His voice softens.

                                 MAJOR MISHIN (CONT’D)
                        ...Cabbage...it won’t go on 
                        forever. Not like this. 

           In the distance the huge garage door begins to open, 
           revealing a stormy night. Engines start revving.

           Stepan grinds his cigarette against a truck and fits the snub 
           in his pant’s pocket. His voice becomes a calm whisper.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...you shouldn’t have given me that 
                        fucking kid.

           With that he leaves. Mishin watches as Stepan heads down the 
           length of the garage and climbs into a sedan with Ilych.
           A staff sergeant at the entrance gives a signal. The trucks 
           and sedans begin to drive like a fleet into the storm.

           EXT. STREETS OF MOSCOW - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A hard raining night. Soaked wood and steel. Drenched posters 
           of glorious Stalin. It feels like a city drowning.

           The headlights of Stepan’s sedan cut through the night. The 
           truck follows closely behind.

           INT. STEPAN’S SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

           Stepan drives, Ilych riding beside him. Rain falls hard on 
           the window shield. Awkward silence. Finally Ilych speaks.

                                 ILYCH
                        ...Comrade Lieutenant, I-

                                 STEPAN
                        Tomorrow night’s shift, don’t show 
                        up wearing that. What we have to do 
                        goes quicker if we’re not in 
                        uniform. And call me Comrade 
                        Stepan, or Stepan Sergeivich, not 
                        Comrade Lieutenant, especially not 
                        around the suspects. Understood?

           Ilych nods. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        They get you an apartment yet?

                                 ILYCH
                        My wife found us one. 

                                 STEPAN
                        You don’t have a ring.

                                 ILYCH
                        We’re not bourgeois.

           Stepan stops talking. A beat. He pulls the car over to a curb 
           and turns off the engine. Ilych stares out the glass at a 
           tall, worn apartment complex.

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        This is it?

           Stepan nods. The truck pulls up to the curb in front of them.
                                 STEPAN
                        Take off your uniform.

           Ilych blinks, confused. Stepan gives him a hard stare. 

                                 ILYCH
                        All I got is the undershirt.

           Stepan sighs and slips off his leather jacket. He hands it to 
           Ilych to wear. Squirming in the seat, Ilych takes off his 
           uniform and puts on the jacket. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Wish you weren’t wearing the boots. 
                        Just stand behind me and-

           Stepan freezes. Through the windshield he can see his two 
           sergeants as they slide open the back of the truck. Both men 
           have PPD-40 submachine guns strapped across their backs.

           Stepan curses under his breath and gets out of the car.

           EXT. MOSCOW STREET CORNER- CONTINUOUS

           Stepan hurries through the rain. He quickly climbs up into 
           the back of the truck and angrily points at the submachine 
           guns. Ilych scrambles up after him.

                                 STEPAN
                        Hey! What the hell are those?

                                 STAFF SERGEANT BALDY
                        Junior Lieutenant’s orders.

                                 STEPAN
                        What? 

                                 ILYCH
                        You said prep the team.

                                 STEPAN
                        You think we’re playing Reds and 
                        Whites? This some game?

                                 ILYCH
                        Comrade, field operations-

                                 STEPAN
                        I don’t care what you think they 
                        taught you in that three year 
                        school, this isn’t the Young 
                        Pioneers, damn it!
                                 ILYCH
                        (Offended)
                        No, it’s State Security, and armed 
                        deterrence is required procedure 
                        for Article 58 offenders! It’s the-

                                 STEPAN
                        (To the staff sergeants)
                        Stay dry in the truck, door closed. 
                        Junior Lieutenant, your sidearm.

           Stepan holds out a hand. Ilych glares. Stepan doesn’t budge. 
           A beat. Ilych sighs and draws a TK automatic pistol.

                                 ILYCH
                        You want my underwear next?

           Stepan takes the pistol and with one smooth motion 
           disassembles it into two pieces. He pockets the grip and 
           hands the barrel back to Ilych. The young man is bewildered. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...you’ll get it back after recess.  

           The sergeants laugh. Stepan hops out of the truck and heads 
           for the apartment. Ilych curses under his breath and follows.

                                                        CUT TO: MONTAGE

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           FAMILIES across the building lay in their beds, fast asleep. 
           These are poor people. Husbands, wives, and children share 
           the same room, many in the same bed. Some sleep on the floor.

           The rusting sound of an old elevator groans to life. People 
           everywhere awaken immediately. They listen to the rising 
           machine, their eyes wide open.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan and Ilych ride the grinding elevator. Stepan leans 
           against a wall, eyes closed, smoking a cigarette snub.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Stepan opens the elevator door and the two men step into a 
           dark, deserted hallway. Silence. Complete silence. Stepan 
           lets it sink in, then starts down the hall. His steps echo. 
           INT. DMITRY’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A young husband and wife lay in bed, listening as the sound 
           of Stepan and Ilych’s footsteps echo down a hall outside. 

           The husband is Dmitry- he’s rail thin with a short beard. His 
           plain wife YULIYA holds onto him, terrified. A golden locket 
           hangs off her neck. 

           The steps come closer and closer. Then they stop. There is a 
           knock on the front door. Yuliya begins to cry softly. 

           INT. COMMUNAL APARTMENT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The knocking continues. Dmitry steps into a small kitchen. 
           This is a communal apartment. HUSBANDS and WIVES from other 
           bedrooms enter the kitchen. They look at each other, scared.

           A trembling husband in his pajamas opens the door a crack. 
           Stepan is waiting in the hallway, Ilych standing behind him.

                                 STEPAN
                        (Polite, controlled)
                        Good evening. I’m Comrade Stepan 
                        Sergeievich of the Peoples 
                        Commissariat for Internal Affairs. 
                        I’m sorry to wake you at this hour-

           The husband holds up a hand and shakes his head.

                                 HUSBAND
                        No, I no speak. 

           He starts to quickly talk in Ukrainian to the others. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Ukrainians. I don’t have time to- 

           Ilych suddenly starts speaking Ukrainian, translating what 
           Stepan said. Stepan stares, surprised. He takes out a list.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Tell them we need...Citizen Dmitry 
                        Nikolayevich Ivanov. Ivanov. 

           Dmitry closes his eyes, shuddering. Yuliya covers her face. 
           The husband opens the door and points out Dmitry. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Dmitry? Dmitry Nikolayevich?
                                 DMITRY
                        (Trying to be brave)
                        Yes, I, I’m Dmitry. I, I’m Russian, 
                        I speak Russian.

                                 STEPAN
                        Good. I was hoping you’d come with 
                        me to the precinct, there’s a case 
                        we are working on I think you could 
                        help us with. Won’t take long. 

           Dmitry takes a step back. He struggles to focus. The other 
           families watch silently.

                                 DMITRY
                        ...uh...Yuliya, Yuliya could you 
                        get my...my rain coat please?

           She retreats into the bedroom and returns with an old ragged 
           raincoat and boots. Crying, she dresses Dmitry. Ilych shifts 
           uncomfortably. Stepan looks down at his nails, unconcerned. 

           Yuliya suddenly rushes back into the bedroom and returns with 
           a sleepy little girl, SASHA, guiding her by the hand. Dmitry 
           leans down beside the girl and touches her face. His 
           fingertips are stained a dark color. Stepan notices. 

                                 DMITRY (CONT’D)
                        (Swallowing hard)
                        ...your father loves you. He loves 
                        you very much.

           Stepan walks over to Dmitry’s room and stares inside. The 
           dark floor is covered in books, newspapers, and dolls. The 
           newspaper has a picture of a football coach on the cover. 

           Stepan coughs, indicating it’s time to go. Dmitry gets up and 
           squeezes his wife’s hand. She slips the locket off her neck 
           and hands it to him.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan, Ilych, and Dmitry ride the descending elevator. For a 
           long moment no one speaks. Dmitry slips the locket on. 

                                 STEPAN
                        (To Ilych)
                        They didn’t tell me you’re 
                        Ukrainian.

                                 ILYCH
                        I’m not. I learned some, Polish, a 
                        little Turkish, at the academy. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ILYCH (CONT'D)
                        You know, that three year school 
                        you didn’t go to. 

           Ilych grins. The elevator touches the ground with a lurch. 

           EXT. MOSCOW STREET CORNER - MOMENTS LATER

           The three step into the rain. As they approach the truck, its 
           back slides open, revealing the sergeants and their machine 
           guns.

           Dmitry freezes. His eyes go wide at the sight of weapons. 

           Suddenly he starts to run. Ilych chases after him. The 
           sergeants scramble to cock their weapons. Stepan blocks their 
           fire.

                                 STEPAN
                        NO! Block the alley! Go!

           EXT. MOSCOW ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Dmitry races through the rain, sobbing. Ilych is close on his 
           heels, but he suddenly slips and crashes into a garbage can.

           Stepan bolts into the alley. He runs like a man possessed, 
           snarling as he chases his prey. He runs down Dmitry, tackling 
           him beneath a soaked poster of a smiling steel worker. 

           Stepan starts to beat the crying man senseless. He roars and 
           grips Dmitry by the hair, striking his face again and again. 
           Something has snapped in Stepan. It’s brutal.

           Finally he lets go. Dmitry curls up, bleeding. Stepan paces. 
           Ilych stumbles over. He stares at them, unsure what to do. 
           Stepan keeps pacing. Suddenly he turns on Ilych and screams.

                                 STEPAN
                        (Raging)
                        THAT’S WHY I DON’T BRING FUCKING
                        GUNS! THEY GET SCARED! 

           The truck pulls up. Stepan charges at Ilych. He grabs him by 
           the shoulder and rips his flask out of the leather jacket. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Resisting arrest reports. Incident 
                        reports. Cross files. Never finish 
                        tonight now. 

           Dmitry crawls up to his knees, his face covered in blood. 
                                 DMITRY
                        (Sobbing, appealing to everyone)
                        ...please, I didn’t-

           Stepan kicks Dmitry in the face, sending him crashing over. 
           He pulls the rain coat off Dmitry as the sergeants approach.

                                 STEPAN
                        Give me that. Give it! You’re under 
                        arrest for treason, you’re gonna
                        freeze in the camps, you fuck!

           Stepan snaps the locket off Dmitry’s throat. Dmitry lets out 
           a cry. He clutches Stepan’s leg desperately. 

                                 DMITRY
                        No! Please! Give! Please!

           Stepan lifts a fist to strike him. Dmitry flinches, crying.

           Stepan freezes. His hand shakes as he stares down at the 
           sobbing, bleeding man. Suddenly he drops the locket. 

           Stepan steps away, shaking. He reaches for his cigarette 
           stub, but his hands drop it in a puddle. He closes his eyes. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...get him in the raven. We got 
                        thirteen more. 

           The two staff sergeants grab Dmitry. He barely snatches up 
           the locket as they drag him into the back of the truck.

           Stepan picks up Dmitry’s coat, unscrews his flask, and storms 
           off into the alley. The truck rumbles to life and drives off. 
           Ilych is left standing alone and stunned in the rain.

                                                        CUT TO: MONTAGE

           INT. MOSCOW APARTMENTS - LATER THAT NIGHT

           We see Stepan and Ilych making more arrests. Riding more 
           elevators. Knocking on more doors. Each time Stepan looks 
           worse. The alcohol and sleep exhaustion are taking a toll.

           EXT. MOSCOW - DAWN

           Dawn rises over Moscow. The storm has turned into a soft 
           drizzle. A happy morning radio announcer can be heard.
                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        ...to Great Stalin! Beautiful 
                        Stalin! Genius Architect of the 
                        Revolution, Great Genius of History-

           INT. STEPAN’S SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

           The sedan is parked on Dzerzhinsky Square. The broadcast is 
           coming from the car’s radio. Rain falls softly on the glass.

           Stepan is asleep in the driver’s seat, back in his leather 
           coat. Ilych, in uniform, reads a report he’s been writing. 

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO)
                        -we praise him with all our love! 
                        For all the love he has given us! 
                        Thank you Comrade Stalin! We love-

           Stepan suddenly pulls the keys out, silencing the radio. A 
           long pause. He doesn’t look at Ilych.

                                 STEPAN
                        I’m sorry. Last night. That wasn’t 
                        me.

                                 ILYCH
                        ...we didn’t finish our arrest 
                        list. Is that bad?

                                 STEPAN
                        I’ll talk to Old Bear tonight. 
                        He’ll smooth it out. 

           Silence. Ilych looks him over.

                                 ILYCH
                        You two are close, right? You and 
                        the Major?

           Stepan says nothing. Ilych studies him, thinking. 

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        Let me guess. The Civil War. You 
                        two served together. Is that where 
                        he got that limp?

                                 STEPAN
                        That was a long time ago. 

           Ilych looks out the glass. A beat. 
                                 ILYCH
                        ...my father, he lost a leg at 
                        Simbrisk, well, Ulyanovsky. The 
                        Czechs with that armored train. I 
                        was three. When I got older, I used 
                        to have to carry him. Hated that. 
                        No elevator, all those stairs. You 
                        know how the blocks were then.

                                 STEPAN
                        No, wasn’t raised in an apartment.

                                 ILYCH
                        Where’d you grow up?

                                 STEPAN
                        A farm.

           Ilych stares at the city. He laughs. Stepan shifts, annoyed.

                                 ILYCH
                        Nothing, Comrade. It’s just, things 
                        have changed. We’ve changed. Look 
                        at all we’ve become.

           Stepan quietly studies the young man’s face. He reaches into 
           his coat and hands Ilych the pistol barrel.  

                                 STEPAN
                        ...get some rest. We’re back in 
                        eight hours. 

           Stepan reaches into the back seat and grabs Dmitry’s coat and 
           the shoebox. He then climbs out, slamming the door.

           INT. MOSCOW SUBWAY TRAIN - LATER THAT MORNING

           Standing, Stepan rides a clean, crowded train filled with 
           COMMUTERS. He holds Dmitry’s coat and the shoebox. No one 
           talks on the train. No one makes eye contact. 

           EXT. MOSCOW STREET - LATER THAT MORNING

           Stepan walks down a cobble street, approaching a worn down 
           apartment building. This is an old neighborhood. A horse 
           drawn buggy passes by. 
           INT. STEPAN’S APARTMENT - LATER

           A small, cluttered apartment. Lonely and silent. The window 
           has a view of Moscow River, industrial barges sailing down 
           it. Stepan enters, puts down the shoebox, and heads for a 
           cabinet. He pours himself a stiff drink.

           Stepan stares at the shoebox, thinking. Little holes are 
           pricked across the top of the box. Air holes. He opens it up.

           Inside the box is a baby rabbit. One of its forelegs is 
           matted with blood. The baby animal is clearly in pain. 

           Stepan stares down at the creature. Something shifts in his 
           face. He steps over to the kitchen and grabs a thick knife.

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           Stepan sits in a chair, running the knife over a small block 
           of wood. He’s shaving off sticks.

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           Stepan sits at the table, the rabbit laying atop Dmitry’s 
           coat. Stepan has sticks in one hand and wire in the other.

           He is fitting the sticks against the rabbit’s leg, making a 
           tiny splint. The animal squeaks in pain.

                                 STEPAN
                        (Soothing)
                        Sshh. Sshh.

           Stepan takes a wet cloth and dabs at the bloody wound.

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           It’s afternoon. Stepan sits in the chair, the rabbit wrapped 
           in a bundle of Dmitry’s coat. He’s using an eye dropper to 
           feed it milk. Silence. Suddenly, slowly, he begins to speak.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        (Like talking to a child)
                        ...you know I, I grew up in a 
                        village, a village by the river, 
                        with friends like you. My family 
                        grew cabbage. Raised rabbits. Lots 
                        of your friends. A good home.

           He feeds the animal another drop of milk.
                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...and then the Czar’s men came. 
                        They wanted our food to feed the 
                        army. My father resisted. They 
                        burned the farm. Everything, burned 
                        everything...that was the day I ran 
                        away from home. To join the 
                        Revolution. I was seventeen. Never 
                        been home since.

           Stepan stares out at the river. His eyes are sagging, 
           exhausted. Warm rain falls on the glass. Finally he whispers. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...can I tell you a secret, little 
                        one? We’re not home. None of us are 
                        home.

           INT. LUBYANKA - MOTOR POOL - AFTERNOON

           The motor pool is empty and quiet. Most of the lights are 
           off. “Old Bear” Major Mishin enters from a stairwell, reading 
           a sheet. He doesn’t see the others until it is too late.

           A TEAM of sergeants slip out of the darkness. One of them 
           strikes Mishin from behind with a truncheon. The others 
           quickly gag him, blindfold him, and drag him to a body bag. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - EXECUTION CELLAR - LATER

           The blindfold is ripped off Mishin. He’s now naked and scared 
           in a cellar room, a plastic tarp stretched across the floor. 
           The sergeants descend on him with truncheons.

           They beat him mercilessly, breaking bones and bashing in his 
           face. Blood spills across the plastic tarp. He’s still 
           gagged.

           Leaning against a wall, smoking and watching, are two young 
           officers - VOLKOV and NAZYUTA. Volkov is blond with a slick, 
           sharp smile. Nazyuta is a woman with piercing eyes. 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        ...too late to sell him to the 
                        circus? As a dancing bear?

           Nazyuta laughs and calls out to the sergeants.

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA
                        Alright, that’s enough! Volkov, 
                        give him his nine grams already.
           Volkov hands her his cigarette and steps towards Mishin’s
           body, drawing a TT30 automatic pistol from his holster.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Hold him up.

           The sergeants pull Mishin up to his knees. Volkov puts the 
           barrel to his bleeding head.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV (CONT’D)
                        Look at me. Look at me.

           Mishin stares, battered and bloody. Volkov grins. He fires. 

           INT. MOSCOW SUBWAY - EVENING

           Stepan rides the packed subway, rubbing his tired eyes.

           INT. LUBYANKA - STAFF OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Stepan enters a CROWDED office, flashing his identification. 
           Telegraphs and typewriters chatter away. The walls are lined 
           with portraits of smiling Stalin. Stepan grabs a clerk.

                                 STEPAN
                        I need Old Bear. You seen him?

                                 NKVD CLERK
                        I look like a footslogger?

           The clerk leaves. Stepan heads over to a coffee pot and pours 
           himself a cup. 

           A newspaper sits on the coffee table, with a football coach 
           on the cover. The same newspaper from Dmitry’s apartment. 
           Stepan stares at it. Captain Tyruin catches up with him.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Comrade. On time for once.

                                 STEPAN
                        Captain. Where’s the Major?

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Dunno. Maybe sick?

           Stepan glances around. Dozens of officers are crowded about, 
           waiting on something. Volkov and Nazyuta are among them.

                                 STEPAN
                        What’s with all the case officers?
                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Someone called a full department 
                        meet. No idea who. So, where is it?

           Stepan blinks, not understanding for a moment.

                                 STEPAN
                        Oh, well I don’t think the leg is 
                        broken but I got her in a splint. 
                        I’ll hold onto her until I’m sure.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Watch out, the thing loves to chew. 
                        It’ll eat your whole damn place if-

           Stepan spots Ilych across the office, in a cheap suit. Volkov 
           and Nazyuta are approaching the young man. Stepan immediately 
           tightens. He leaves Tyruin, hurrying over to Ilych.

                                 STEPAN
                        Ilych. Ilych. Come with me, we have-

           He puts a hand on Ilych’s shoulder, but Volkov calls out from 
           behind. He’s grinning wolfishly.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Comrade! Lieutenant Lebedev!

           Stepan freezes. Slowly he turns around and salutes.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...Senior Lieutenant. I’m looking 
                        for Old Bear. You seen him?

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Me? No, but my investigation docket 
                        is a little thin today. Someone 
                        didn’t finish his list last night. 

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA
                        We heard about your runner. How 
                        quaint. No one runs anymore.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Well this one thought he could. You 
                        like hurting my quotas, Lieutenant? 

                                 STEPAN
                        If I wanted to hurt you, it 
                        wouldn’t be your quotas.

           The two men stare each other down. Volkov gives a cold smile.
                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Careful. This the new kid? I’m 
                        Senior Lieutenant Volkov, case 
                        officer. I interrogate the accused 
                        Stepan brings in, when he does.

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA
                        Senior Lieutenant Nazyuta, 
                        Religious Affairs.  

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        She hunts unlicensed priests, nuns. 
                        I’m wondering, kid, did you know 
                        Comrade Bottle here actually use to 
                        be a case officer? One of us? 

           Ilych looks at Stepan, surprised. Stepan takes a deep breath.

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA
                        That’s right. He was good. Then he 
                        changed. Stopped bringing in 
                        confessions, started picking up 
                        Moscow Specials. Soviet Champagne. 
                        Cognac with Kvas.

                                 STEPAN
                        Can I go now?

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Hell, if you’re done slowing me 
                        down you could go back to the army. 
                        We’re shooting so many officers now 
                        you’d make General in a week.

           Stepan bites his lip, trying to stay calm. The coffee cup is 
           shaking in his hand, his grip tightening. Volkov notices.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV (CONT’D)
                        (Leaning in closer)
                        ...would you like that, Chapayev? 
                        Play soldier again? Put back on 
                        your medal? What’d you get that for 
                        in the first place, distilling? 

           The coffee cup handle shatters. Suddenly Stepan has Volkov by 
           the collar, slamming him into the wall. 

           Before anything else can happen the office door bursts open. 
           In charges a troop of BODYGUARDS and PARTY OFFICIALS.

                                 COMMUNIST PARTY HERALD
                        Attention! Attention! It is now my 
                        honor to present General Commissar 
                        of State Security...Nikolai Yezhov!
           The name rings out like a bell. Every person in the office 
           immediately snaps to fierce attention. Footsteps echo down 
           the hallway as Stalin’s right-hand man enters.

           YEZHOV is not what you would expect. He is a sniveling worm 
           of a man, nearly a dwarf in size and dressed like a general. 
           He stares out at the officers with wild, gleeful eyes. When 
           he opens his mouth a crazed squeaky voice emerges.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        Comrades. Stalin brings his 
                        greetings.

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           The officers stand in ordered rows, at attention. Yezhov 
           paces back and forth before them, giving a speech. His voice 
           starts calm but gradually grows into a crazed, raving scream.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        ...I stand before a hall of heroes. 
                        You are the defenders of Communism. 
                        You are needed now more than ever. 

           Stepan opens and closes his eyes, struggling to stay alert.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        Yes, Comrades, these are grave 
                        times. On all sides our nation is 
                        surrounded by enemies, and at home 
                        traitors plot to destroy this- the 
                        only free nation on Earth! 
                        Traitors. How I hate their names. 
                        Saboteurs. Wreckers. Trotskyites. 
                        Bukharinites. Bundist Jews. 
                        Bourgeois sympathizers. Tsarist
                        Revivalists. Counter-Revolutionary 
                        Zinovievits.  Old Believers. 
                        Imperialists. Ex-Mensheviks. 
                        Deviationists. Kulaks! 
                        Schutzbundlers! Shirkers! German

                        A vile horde only we can stop! It 
                        is our duty to find the traitor, to 
                        destroy the traitor, to shoot him 
                        like a dog - LIKE A MAD DOG EVEN 
                        WHEN HE LURKS AMONG OUR RANKS!

           Yezhov pauses to calm down, wiping spittle from his lips.
                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        ...some of you may be wondering 
                        where your commanding officer Major 
                        Mishin is. He is dead. 

           Stepan suddenly perks up, his back stiffening.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        Mishin was a traitor. For years he 
                        has been in secret communication 
                        with the Great Betrayer Trostky, 
                        planning nothing less than to 
                        poison the lips of our very own 
                        magnificent Comrade Stalin. 
                        Unthinkable! A monstrous crime, a 
                        crime against humanity, and for it 
                        he was given just punishment. He 
                        died screaming on the cellar floor! 

           Stepan is breathing hard, struggling to stay calm. He glances 
           about and spots Volkov and Nazyuta smiling among the crowd. 

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        Let this be a lesson! There is 
                        nowhere traitors do not hide! 
                        Nowhere! We must hunt the wicked! 
                        But also, we must reward the good. 
                        You beautiful young Chekist case 
                        officers are our future, and as of 
                        now, there is an opening in your 
                        command which needs replacing.

           Yezhov gives a big, crazed smile.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        To prove who deserves it I have 
                        devised a competition of sorts. A 
                        game. Whichever case officer can 
                        get one hundred criminal 
                        confessions and arrests first will 
                        be promoted to the rank of Major 
                        and given their choice of 
                        assignment anywhere in Russia, with 
                        Stalin’s gratitude. 

           The case officers look at each other, excited.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        The opportunity of a lifetime, and 
                        only the most zealous among you 
                        will earn it. Prove your worth. 
                        Take no pause from your duty. Hunt 
                        the traitor! Defend the Party! You 
                        are State Security!

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)

                        unsheathe yourself and get to work.

           Satisfied, Yezhov nods to one of his assistants.

                                 COMMUNIST PARTY HERALD
                        Comrade Commissar Yezhov would now 
                        like to end this meeting with 
                        “Defenders of the People, Unite!” 
                        One! Two! Three! Four!

           The office immediately begins to roar out a marching song. 
           Everyone knows the lyrics. As they belt out the song Yezhov 
           paces among their ranks, smiling like a child.

                                 THE WHOLE OFFICE
                        THE PEOPLE CRY FOR HELP OUT LOUD, 
                        TO HER ENEMIES WE'LL BRING THE 
                        FIGHT!

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        Yes! Sing! Sing!

                                 THE WHOLE OFFICE
                        THE NKVD'S STRONG AND PROUD! 
                        DEFENDERS OF THE PEOPLE, UNITE!

           Among the crowd Stepan roars the lyrics. His voice is strong 
           and proud, but there is no joy in his eyes. 

                                                        CUT TO: MONTAGE

           EXT. MOSCOW APARTMENTS - LATER THAT NIGHT

           As the song continues we see Stepan and Ilych on another 
           whirlwind night of arrests. They drag a sobbing mother away 
           from her daughter. They pull an old man into the truck. They 
           kick down an apartment door. 

                                 THE WHOLE OFFICE (V.O.)
                        THE ENEMY CRAWLS EVERYWHERE, BUT WE 
                        CHARGE WITH OUR SWORDS IN HAND!
                        WE ARE FIERCE, WE ARE PREPARED
                        TO HUNT THE MONSTERS FROM OUR LAND! 
                        DEFENDERS OF THE PEOPLE, UNITE!

           EXT. MOSCOW - DAWN

           Another dawn rises over Moscow. The night’s work is done.
           INT. STEPAN’S SEDAN - DAWN

           Stepan and Ilych sit in the sedan, parked outside the garage. 
           Stepan has his eyes closed. Ilych stares out the window.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...he’s lucky.

           Ilych looks at him, confused. Stepan doesn’t open his eyes. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Whoever wins this competition. The 
                        case officer. Get promoted. Pick a 
                        post anywhere. Very lucky.

                                 ILYCH
                        ...what...what was it like? Being a 
                        case officer?

           Stepan doesn’t answer. He appears asleep. Finally he speaks.

                                 STEPAN
                        That what you want? The uniform, 
                        the raise?

                                 ILYCH
                        I want to serve the people. I want 
                        to catch traitors, like the Old 
                        Bear. Did you have any idea he- 

                                 STEPAN
                        Of course not. 

           Ilych stares at Stepan, thinking. 

                                 ILYCH
                        You’re own friend. You never knew.

           Stepan doesn’t reply. He opens the door and steps out. He 
           stops. A beat. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Your father. What happened to him?

                                 ILYCH
                        He got weak.

           Stepan studies him for a silent moment, then leaves. 

           INT. MOSCOW SUBWAY - LATER THAT MORNING

           Stepan rides the crowded subway, barely awake.
           EXT. MOSCOW STREET - LATER THAT MORNING

           Stepan walks down a cobble street, his eyes to the ground. A 
           troop of CHILDREN marches beside him, wearing red armbands 
           and waving a Soviet flag as they head to school.

           INT. STEPAN’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT MORNING

           Exhausted, Stepan staggers into his apartment. The baby 
           rabbit is on his table, resting in a bed made out of Dmitry’s 
           coat and a milk box. 

           Stepan pets the rabbit, stares at the river, then stumbles to 
           his bed. He crashes down, his eyes shutting. 

           Silence. Stillness. Stepan starts to drift into sleep. As he 
           does, a sound fills his ears. The sound of wind and snow.

           EXT. WINTER FIELD - DREAM

           Stepan’s bed is suddenly in a field of wind and snow. White 
           as far as the eye can see. He sits up and sees a barbed wire 
           fence, dancing in the wind. 

           Shivering SOLDIERS step around the bed, approaching the 
           fence. Stepan’s attention turns to a young handsome MAN among 
           them. The young man is scared and freezing. He clutches his 
           rifle nervously as something approaches. 

           Through the storm a great brown shape appears, coming closer. 

           INT. STEPAN’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT MORNING

           The dream is suddenly gone. Stepan is sitting up in bed, 
           sweating and alone. 

           He leans back down and shuts his eyes. Then a sound comes to 
           his ears. A nibbling sound. The sound of little teeth chewing 
           paper. Stepan’s eyes open again. Something isn’t right.

           He sits up. Slowly, Stepan gets out of bed and approaches the 
           table. The rabbit has been chewing on a sleeve of Dmitry’s 
           coat. Stepan gingerly lifts her out of the box and feels 
           along the seams of the clothing. Something is in there.

           Stepan rushes over to the kitchen and grabs a knife. He takes 
           the blade and starts to cut open the jacket, carefully 
           peeling apart the fabric. As he opens a seam he finds a sheet 
           of paper, sewn within the very fabric of the coat.
           Stepan pulls out the paper and starts cutting faster. He 
           tears opens sleeves and pockets, peeling apart the stitches. 
           More pages begin to fall out. The coat is filled with paper.

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           Stepan sits on the floor, the pages laid out in front of him. 
           The writing is in a foreign language. Not Russian. We can’t 
           understand what it means, but it is clear the pages are 
           covered in rows of lists and numbers. Stepan’s eyes widen.

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           It is evening now, the sun dipping away in the distance. 
           Stepan is standing at his window, the paper in hand. He’s 
           staring at the river down bellow. His hand shakes.

           He suddenly grabs his leather jacket off a chair, stuffs a 
           page inside it, and rushes for the door.

           INT. LUBYANKA - STAFF ENTRANCE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Stepan heads through a guarded staff entrance, flashing his 
           identification. Ilych is waiting for him up ahead.  

                                 ILYCH
                        ...evening, Comrade. I have 
                        tonight’s list, and-

           Stepan pulls him aside, into a corridor. Stepan glances 
           around, draws a page of the list, and shows it to him. 

                                 STEPAN
                        What language is this? This is 
                        Polish, right? What does it say?

           Ilych scans the list, confused.

                                 ILYCH
                        What? I, uh, it’s a list of 
                        something. Boxes of soap. Units, 
                        deliveries. What is this? 

           Stepan thinks. Suddenly he grabs the list back, stuffs it in 
           his jacket, and rushes away. Bewildered, Ilych follows. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - COMMISSAR’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Stepan and Ilych enter a massive, luxurious private office. 
           It’s filled with OFFICIALS and CASE OFFICERS. Drinks and food 
           are out. Music plays from a gramophone. It’s a party.
           Stepan tries to work his way in, but a guard stops him. 
           Stepan scans the swarm. He spots who he is looking for. 

           Standing at the center of the crowd, smiling wildly, is 
           Commissar Yezhov. Captain Tyruin and Lieutenant Volkov are 
           treating him like a prince. The Captain rattles his glass 
           with a spoon.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        ...that the Commissar has a plane 
                        to catch, but first I want to say 
                        it’s been an honor to stand in his 
                        presence. To Comrade Yezhov! 
                        Defender of the Proletariate! 

           The place erupts in applause. Yezhov heads for the door, 
           smiling and nodding. Stepan tries to push closer. Guards hold 
           him back as the crowd roars and cheers.

                                 STEPAN
                        Commissar! Commissar, a word! 

           Yezhov can’t hear him. Stepan sweats. Yezhov’s almost gone.

           Suddenly Stepan shoves past the guards, fighting through the 
           crowd. He grabs Yezhov by the elbow and yanks him backwards. 
           People gasp. Yezhov squeals with fear as he topples over.

           Bodyguards draw guns. Someone pistol-whips Stepan. As he 
           falls guards leap on him, stripping off his leather jacket as 
           they search him. They start dragging Stepan towards the exit. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Comrade Commissar! Wait! Please!

           The guards almost have Stepan out the door when Yezhov 
           screams. The whole place goes silent and still.  

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        HALT! Who touched me?! Show me!

           The guards let go of Stepan. Every eye is now on him. The 
           crowd slowly parts, allowing Stepan to approach Yezhov. 
           Stepan stumbles forward, holding his head. Yezhov gets up.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        This is my assaulter? Who sent you?

           Stepan gets down on a knee, talking quickly.

                                 STEPAN
                        Comrade, I am Lieutenant Stepan 
                        Sergeievich Lebedev. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEPAN (CONT'D)
                        I’ve come to personally request you 
                        let me join the case officer’s 
                        competition.

           A mummer goes through the crowd. Yezhov tilts his head.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        Attacking me would get you that? 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Don’t listen to this drunk. He was 
                        best friends with that dead bear.

                                 STEPAN
                        (Quickly)
                        Commissar, it’s true I knew the 
                        traitor Mishin, but I engaged in no  
                        treason nor knew of his crimes. I 
                        denounce him with all my heart. 

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        Ignorance is no shield, Lieutenant. 
                        I send worms to the cellars every 
                        day for your crime of omission, and 
                        they aren’t the ones who attack me. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Then allow me to regain my honor by 
                        entering this competition.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        And why should I do that?

                                 STEPAN
                        Because I’ll win.

           Yezhov snorts a laugh. He grins to the crowd.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        A real Stakhanovite, eh? Should I 
                        put him on the Canal?

           People laugh. Stepan stays calm.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...Comrade Commissar, if you give 
                        me this chance not only will I win, 
                        but I will double the results. I 
                        will get you two hundred arrests 
                        and confessions.

           The grin leaves Yezhov’s face. He stares at Stepan, stunned.
                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        ...do not toy with me, Lieutenant. 
                        I have no stomach for liars.

                                 STEPAN
                        I will win. All I ask in return is 
                        you allow me access to a group of 
                        suspects I arrested two days ago. 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Bullshit. Those accused are mine.

                                 STEPAN
                        Commissar, there is a threat and I 
                        can stop it. I will get you two 
                        hundred traitors, with evidence.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        How?

                                 STEPAN
                        I can’t say. 

           Volkov laughs. Yezhov doesn’t look happy. 

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        You won’t tell me?

                                 STEPAN
                        Comrade, you said yourself there is 
                        nowhere traitors do not hide. What 
                        I know could save lives and I can’t 
                        risk saying it where-

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        Sergeants.

           The guards approach. Stepan gets down on both knees, talking 
           fast and desperate.

                                 STEPAN
                        Comrade Commissar, look at me! 
                        Think this through. I came into 
                        this room willing to put my life in 
                        danger just to meet you. I’m ready 
                        to lay down and die for the 
                        Revolution! There are enemies! I-

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        Stand up, Lieutenant!

           The guards pull him to his feet. Yezhov stares, thinking. 
                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        ...Comrade Stalin believes in only 
                        one thing. The power of human 
                        will...I look at, and I am curious 
                        to learn how far that power goes. 
                        Sergeants, give him back his coat. 
                        You are promoted to the rank of 
                        Senior Lieutenant case officer. 
                        Welcome to the competition.

           Dead silence. Then Captain Tyruin nervously lets out a cheer. 
           The crowd erupts in awkward applause. Smiling, Yezhov nods 
           and beckons Stepan closer. He whispers in his ear. 

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        ...make me regret this and you 
                        won’t enjoy the next time I have 
                        you on your knees.

           With that Yezhov leaves, flanked by his bodyguards and staff. 
           The room keeps cheering. Stepan takes a quick breath. A 
           champagne flute sits on a stand nearby. He snatches it up, 
           drinks, then leaves. Ilych, stunned beyond words, follows. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan leans against a wall, rubbing the back of his bruised 
           head. OFFICERS watch him. Ilych slides up close and whispers.

                                 ILYCH
                        Care to explain what just happened?

           Stepan looks at the others, then motions for Ilych to follow.

           EXT. LUBYANKA - ROOFTOP - SUNSET

           A deep sunset hangs over Moscow from Lubyanka’s large 
           rooftop. SNIPERS patrol the edges, but beyond them the city 
           stretches out endlessly, almost peacefully.

           Stepan and Ilych climb onto the roof from a stairwell. They 
           walk to the center, far from the earshot of the patrols. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...the suspect who resisted arrest, 
                        I found this in his coat.

           Stepan glances over his shoulder, then hands Ilych the page.  
           He reads it, not understanding.  
                                 ILYCH
                        “250 boxes of soap for K.V.
                        191 boxes of soap for S.A. 805 
                        boxes of soap for L.S.” 

                                 STEPAN
                        Dozens of pages. Just like that, 
                        sewn into the fabric. Each with 
                        numbers, initials, in Polish.

                                 ILYCH
                        In his coat? He had a foreign list 
                        sewn in his coat? 

                                 STEPAN
                        Ilych, think. When we arrested the 
                        suspect he told his wife to get him 
                        his rain coat. His rain coat. 
                        Everyone who gets picked up knows 
                        they are going to some frozen labor 
                        camp, so if you were being arrested 
                        why would you pick your rain coat? 
                        Why not your winter coat? 

           Ilych stares at him, unsure. Stepan points to the page.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Because he didn’t want this in his 
                        apartment if we searched for 
                        evidence. No one cares what a 
                        suspect wears. The clothes are 
                        stolen or lost - he wanted that. He 
                        was using us to get rid of this.

           Ilych takes a step back, his eyes widening.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        He had pages of these soap lists in 
                        his coat. Hundreds of initials. 
                        Whose names? And boxes of soap? 

                                 ILYCH
                        Has to be a code word. Maybe the 
                        soap is a delivery of something. 
                        Explosives or, or radio codes.  

                                 STEPAN
                        Could be anything, but he was under 
                        arrest for suspicion of treason and 
                        he didn’t want us to have it. This 
                        is big, Ilych. Very big. Two 
                        hundred and six initials. If I can 
                        crack this, I’ll beat everyone. 
                        I’ll win.
           Ilych swallows and nods. He thinks, studying Stepan.

                                 ILYCH
                        ...and you’re showing me this. Why?

           Stepan doesn’t answer. Ilych studies him. A beat.

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        When did you find this list? Last 
                        night? This morning? You could have 
                        called the department’s 
                        translators. But you didn’t. You 
                        waited for me.

           Stepan says nothing. Ilych thinks it through.  

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t tell the Commissar about 
                        this list. That means you’re 
                        keeping it a secret. Why?

                                 STEPAN
                        Those case officers you met 
                        yesterday, they rule this place. 
                        What do you think happens if they 
                        find out I have a lead like this?

                                 ILYCH
                        So you want someone to translate 
                        this list you can trust. Someone 
                        who will keep your secret, and-

           Stepan laughs. He takes the list back from Ilych.

                                 STEPAN
                        Trust? Ilych, stop. I know what you 
                        are. Why you’re here. 

           Ilych blinks. Stepan leans in, suddenly aggressive.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        You think I didn’t know? I’m an 
                        idiot? They send a top mark 
                        Komonsol boy to learn from some old 
                        drunk like me? You think I believe 
                        that for a second? 

                                 ILYCH
                        C-Comrade, I don’t-

                                 STEPAN
                        You’re not here for training. 
                        You’re already trained. You’re my 
                        replacement. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEPAN (CONT'D)
                        Any day now you were suppose to 
                        push me out, and then what? I’m 
                        sent to work the cellars? You were 
                        going to throw me over, so don’t 
                        ever talk about trust! I know what 
                        you are!

           Stepan paces away, breathing hard and rubbing his bruised 
           head. Ilych swallows. A beat.

                                 ILYCH
                        ...fine. It’s true. But you didn’t 
                        bring me up here for nothing. The 
                        Old Bear is dead. I’m all you have 
                        left. You know what I want. 

           Silence. Finally Stepan steps close, holding the page.

                                 STEPAN
                        You translate this, you help me 
                        with the case, you tell no one 
                        about the list, and when I win, I 
                        will leave and you can take my spot 
                        here as a case officer. Deal?

           Ilych nods. Both men take a deep breath.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Smart little prick, give you that. 

                                 ILYCH
                        So, Comrade, where do we begin?  

                                 STEPAN
                        The suspect. We start with him. Get 
                        his files, translate this, then go 
                        to the mess hall and get a lemon 
                        and cheese grater.

                                 ILYCH
                        Excuse me?

                                 STEPAN
                        I got a headache.

                                 ILYCH
                        You got pistol-whipped. Lemons? 
                        What kind of backwards place is 
                        that a folk cure for headaches?

                                 STEPAN
                        The kind of place where we string 
                        up smart ass children. Get to work. 
           Stepan heads for the exit. A beat. Ilych calls after him.

                                 ILYCH
                        You meant what you said to Yezhov? 
                        Being ready to lay down and die?

                                 STEPAN
                        I’m not dead yet. 

           Stepan leaves. Ilych laughs softly. He stares out at the city 
           and its setting sun.

           INT. LUBYANKA - PRISON CELL - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Dmitry slowly opens his swollen eyes. He’s been sleeping 
           standing up, trapped among a suffocating swarm of PRISONERS.

                                 ILYCH (V.O.)
                        Dmitry Nikolayevich Ivanov. Age 25, 
                        I think.

                                 STEPAN (V.O.)
                        You think?

           INT. LUBYANKA - MOTOR POOL - ONE DAY EARLIER

           The trucks are lined up in the motor pool, WARDERS and GUARD 
           DOGS waiting. SERGEANTS slide open the truck back doors, 
           their insides are filled to the brim with terrified PEOPLE.

                                 ILYCH (V.O.)
                        He’s got almost no papers. His 
                        parents are listed as migrant 
                        workers, so that’s a wash. I got no 
                        files on him ‘til he applies for 
                        communal housing at 22.

           Warders start shouting. Dogs bark. Prisoners spill from 
           trucks. Dmitry’s among them, covered in bruises from Stepan’s 
           beating. He clutches his broken locket, the chain gone.

           INT. LUBYANKA - PRISONER PROCESSING CENTER - LATER

           Prisoners are being photographed. Strip searched. 
           Fingerprinted. Dmitry is among the line, the locket in his 
           dark, stained fingers.

                                 STEPAN (V.O.)
                        So he’s a ghost?
                                 ILYCH (V.O.)
                        A ghost with no birth certificate. 
                        No Party card, nothing. Like he 
                        shows up out of nowhere.

           A warder passes by. Thinking fast, Dmitry pops the locket in 
           his mouth. He swallows it with a painful shudder.

           INT. LUBYANKA - PRISON CELL - LATER

           A warder opens a prison cell door, guiding Dmitry in. 
           Dmitry’s bruised eyes go wide when he sees the cell.

           The cell is a small converted storage closet. Twenty male 
           prisoners are crammed inside. No room to sit. The warder 
           shoves Dmitry in and closes the door.

           The squirming mass of prisoners push and force Dmitry towards  
           a corner with a slop bucket. Dmitry immediately starts to 
           vomit into the bucket. Prisoners laugh. Lights blare above.

           Dmitry coughs, closes his eyes, and reaches into the bucket. 
           He pulls out his locket, wiping vomit and feces off it.

           INT. LUBYANKA - HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Stepan and Ilych move down a hallway, Ilych reading a file. 
           Stepan is rubbing bits of lemon on his temples. 

                                 STEPAN
                        So this ghost, why was he arrested?

                                 ILYCH
                        Uh, someone reported him as an 
                        enemy of the people. That’s it. 

                                 STEPAN
                        That can’t be it. 

                                 ILYCH
                        It was an anonymous report, like 
                        the witness was scared.

           An OFFICER catches up to them.

                                 NKVD OFFICER
                        Senior Lieutenant Volkov’s looking 
                        for you. Never seen him so angry.

                                 STEPAN
                        Don’t tell him where I am, and book 
                        me a room please, one hour. Thanks.
           Stepan hands him the lemons. The officer leaves, confused. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        So we got a mysterious suspect with 
                        no papers, a coat full of Polish 
                        secrets, and a hidden witness.

                                 ILYCH
                        Yeah. And he’s a runner. You think 
                        he’s a spy? For the Polish? 

                                 STEPAN
                        You know a lot of spies with 
                        families? It’s possible, but most 
                        of the Polish nationals have been 
                        rounded up already. He’s not one, 
                        you can tell by his accent. 

                                 ILYCH
                        So he’s Russian. Then what?

                                 STEPAN
                        I don’t know. We need answers. Book 
                        us a cell, under your name.

                                 ILYCH
                        What? You just booked one.

                                 STEPAN
                        And when that officer rats me out 
                        to Volkov he’s gonna be there, 
                        looking at an empty room. Dmitry is 
                        our suspect. Lets keep it that way. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - PRISON CELL - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The cell door opens with a lurch. A warder leans in.

                                 NKVD WARDER
                        D.I. Accused D.I.

                                 DMITRY
                        I, I’m Dmitry Ivanov. Is-

           The prisoners start shifting and moving. Dmitry squirms 
           towards the entrance. As he does an old man suddenly grabs 
           Dmitry’s wrist and whispers in his ear.

                                 OLD PRISONER
                        They want you to confess a crime, 
                        and name accomplices. They won’t 
                        stop until you do. God bless you.
           Other prisoners murmer in agreement.

           INT. LUBYANKA - STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

           The warder leads Dmitry up a stairwell, jangling his keys. 
           They arrive at a thick door, guarded by TWO SERGEANTS.

                                 NKVD WARDER
                        Accused D.I. for interrogation.

           The sergeants open the door, revealing the long dark hall of 
           the interrogation wing. Muffled sounds seep out. Screams.

           Dmitry steps back. The warder gently pushes him forward.

           INT. LUBYANKA - INTEROGATION WING - MOMENTS LATER

           The warder leads Dmitry down the hall, passing the doors of 
           interrogation cells. Screams can be heard through the thick 
           doors. Dmitry begins to shake. 

                                 2ND NKVD WARDER (O.S.)
                        Incoming accused!

           The warder makes Dmitry face a wall, blocking his view. A 
           team of WARDERS emerge from a cell, carrying a sobbing, 
           bleeding WOMAN down the hall. Once she’s gone Nazyuta emerges 
           from the cell, calmly wiping her bloody hands with a rag.

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA
                        ...room’s all yours.

           The warder guides Dmitry towards the cell.

           INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Dmitry sits alone at a table in a small windowless room. 
           Screaming can still be heard faintly through the walls. His 
           hands are trembling.

           A little bell sits in front of Dmitry. An empty chair is 
           across the table. Dmitry glances at the wall beside him. A 
           smear of dried blood runs down it. He stares at it.

           INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION STAFF ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan and Ilych stand in a hall before a thick door. Stepan 
           is unlocking it with a key. He’s got a file in his hands. 
                                 STEPAN
                        This is the interrogation wing back 
                        entrance. No one will see us here.

                                 ILYCH
                        You used to work in here, right? 

           Stepan doesn’t reply. The door opens. Screams fill the hall. 

           Stepan closes his eyes, listening to the sounds. He takes a 
           breath, then starts walking down the hall. He gets about five 
           steps in before he notices Ilych isn’t following him.

           Stepan turns around. Ilych is still in the entrance. He’s 
           frozen, not moving, listening as a woman cries behind a door. 

           Ilych’s eyes flicker towards him. He doesn’t move. A beat.

                                 STEPAN
                        Junior Lieutenant. You wanted into 
                        the forest. Sooner or later you 
                        meet the wolves.

           A beat. Ilych follows him. They start towards a cell door.

                                 ILYCH
                        What are, what are you going to do?

           Stepan looks at him, but doesn’t answer. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Dmitry is still staring at the bloodstain on the wall. The 
           door opens behind him. He flinches. 

           In enters Stepan and Ilych. Stepan is focused on the folder 
           in his hands. Dmitry tries to stand up but Stepan lifts a 
           hand casually.

                                 STEPAN
                        No. 

           Dmitry sits back down. Stepan takes a seat across the table. 
           Ilych leans against the wall, his arms crossed. 

           Stepan reads. Finally looks up at Dmitry’s bruises.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...are you okay?

           Dmitry twitches, surprised. He says nothing. Stepan looks 
           about the room. He stares at the bloodstain on the wall.
                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...I’m sorry, by the way. About the 
                        alley. That’s wasn’t me.

                                 DMITRY
                        Why am I here?

                                 STEPAN
                        This is procedure.

                                 DMITRY
                        Why am I in prison? Why was I 
                        arrested?

                                 STEPAN
                        Why do you think you were arrested?

           Dmitry says nothing. Stepan shrugs and draws his flask, 
           offering it to Dmitry.

                                 DMITRY
                        No, thank you. Have I been charged 
                        with a crime?

                                 STEPAN
                        Not any 58s, but you tried running, 
                        which doesn’t work in your favor. 
                        You a Party member, Dmitry?

                                 DMITRY
                        No. But, but I love Stalin. And I 
                        only ran because I was scared. I 
                        didn’t, I shouldn’t have-

                                 STEPAN 
                        Where are you from?

                                 DMITRY
                        I’m not going to give you names.

           Stepan pauses, surprised.

                                 DMITRY (CONT’D)
                        I, I haven’t done anything. I’m not 
                        saying I have, but I won’t give you-

                                 STEPAN
                        Did I ask for names? Do I care?

           Dmitry blinks. Stepan closes the folder.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Look. I’ll be honest with you. I 
                        don’t know what you’re here for. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m a doorman, bring them in, bring 
                        them out. Far as I can tell, they 
                        don’t have anything on you. So 
                        they’re gonna put you back out.  

                                 DMITRY
                        ...out? Like back home?

                                 STEPAN
                        Where are you from, Dmitry 
                        Nikolayevich?

                                 DMITRY
                        I was born near Bodaybo, Irkutsk.

                                 STEPAN
                        That far east?

                                 DMITRY
                        Spent the first ten years of my 
                        life in the back of a wagon. You 
                        mean I’ll be released, free to go?

                                 STEPAN
                        Could be. Why a wagon?

                                 DMITRY
                        (Not enjoying this)
                        My family, we moved wherever the 
                        work was. Harvest, farms. Before 
                        the collectives. I was a kid.

                                 STEPAN
                        I’ve never been on a farm. What’s 
                        it like? Bodaybo, you were growing 
                        grain, wheat, that stuff?

                                 DMITRY
                        Yeah, wheat. Can we talk about why 
                        I’m here?

                                 STEPAN
                        I told you I don’t know why you’re 
                        here. Mistakes happen. They don’t 
                        find anything they’ll release you. 
                        Just paperwork for me either way. 

                                 DMITRY
                        My...forgive me, with all due 
                        respect officer, the night you came  
                        for me, you beat me. Told me to 
                        freeze to death in the camps, now 
                        you’re, you’re saying- 
                                 STEPAN
                        (Angry)
                        You ran, and I told you that wasn’t 
                        me. Dmitry, I know you’re scared 
                        but use your head. Look at me. Look 
                        around you. If they really 
                        suspected you of something then you 
                        wouldn’t be sitting here with the 
                        doorman, would you? You hear that?

           Stepan motions to the walls and their screams. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Are they doing that to you? No. 
                        Because you have nothing to give 
                        them. You’re innocent, right? You 
                        did something stupid in an alley, 
                        that’s it. So relax. Answer 
                        questions, then you’ll go home.

           A beat. Dmitry nods. Stepan opens his folder again.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        You live with foreigners. Why?

                                 DMITRY
                        Why? It’s, uh, it’s where the 
                        housing committee put me. I didn’t 
                        have a choice. 

                                 STEPAN
                        You know a lot of foreigners? 
                        Ukrainians, Poles, Georgians?

                                 DMITRY
                        I don’t know, I just speak Russian. 
                        They’re all the same to me.

                                 STEPAN
                        In your apartment I saw a lot of 
                        books. Your wife’s?

                                 DMITRY
                        Mine.

                                 STEPAN
                        You read all that? Why?

                                 DMITRY
                        Why? I’m a poet. 

           Stepan blinks. He laughs, suprised, and looks at Ilych.
                                 STEPAN
                        ...you hear that? Farm boy Gorky? 
                        Who even taught you to read?

                                 DMITRY
                        I did. I, uh, I started to pick it 
                        up. Left the farm. Met my wife.

                                 STEPAN
                        And you get paid to write?

                                 DMITRY
                        Not much. I mail them from home. I 
                        make do but it’s tough. Wish I had 
                        a real job, to be honest.

           Stepan freezes, his smile tightening. He looks Dmitry over, 
           then down at the file.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...alright, Dmitry Nikolayevich, I 
                        think we’ve taken up enough of your 
                        time. We’re done here.

           Stepan gets up. Dmitry is astonished. Ilych shifts, confused.

                                 ILYCH
                        Uh, Senior Lieutenant? 

                                 STEPAN
                        C’mon Junior. Let’s go.

           Dmitry starts to stand up.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        No, you wait here. They’ll bring 
                        someone. C’mon, Ilych.

                                 DMITRY
                        Am I, I’m going home?

           Stepan smiles and heads to the door. He knocks twice. It 
           opens. Ilych stands frozen in the corner, bewildered. 

           Ilych suddenly says a sentence to Dmitry in Polish. Dmitry 
           flinches. Ilych leaves. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION WING - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan and Ilych step out into the hallway. Stepan looks 
           around at the cells, listening to the screams.
                                 STEPAN
                        ...wheat in Bodaybo.

                                 ILYCH
                        Stepan, what the hell?

           A warder heads for Dmitry’s door. Stepan stops him.

                                 STEPAN
                        What are you doing? Captain Tyruin 
                        has the cell on reserve. Evidence 
                        sweep. No one goes in, understood?

                                 NKVD WARDER
                        Evidence sweep? What’s that?

                                 STEPAN
                        I’m sorry, you a case officer? Do I 
                        have to explain my job to you, or 
                        can you do as your told? No one in. 

           The Warder nods, embarrassed. Stepan leaves, Ilych following.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Wheat in Bodaybo.

                                 ILYCH
                        Stepan, look at me. Why didn’t you 
                        ask him about the list? Or the 
                        coat? Why aren’t we-

                                 STEPAN
                        He made a mistake. I let him feel 
                        safe and he walked right into it.

                                 ILYCH
                        What?

           Captain Tyruin pops out of a hallway.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Comrade, there you are! Do you have-

                                 STEPAN
                        Sorry Captain, that rabbit’s my 
                        good luck charm. You’re never 
                        getting her back now.

           Before the Captain can protest, Stepan heads down a 
           stairwell. 
           INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Dmitry sits at the empty table, the screams still around him. 
           He glances at the closed door, and carefully reaches into his 
           sock. He pulls out the golden locket.

           He rubs his dark fingers over the locket, again and again.

           INT. LUBYANKA - STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan and Ilych stand on an empty stairwell. Stepan takes 
           out the soap list. He glances around to make sure they’re 
           alone.

                                 STEPAN
                        The suspect, he said he works at 
                        home. Doesn’t have a real job. 

           Ilych nods. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        When we were at his apartment, he 
                        had a Friday edition of Truth in 
                        his bedroom. I saw it. Mikhail
                        Tovarosky was on the cover.  

                                 ILYCH
                        Truth, the newspaper Truth?

                                 STEPAN
                        Yes. Ilych, it was Thursday night. 
                        That paper hadn’t come out yet. I 
                        saw it next day in the office, and 
                        you know we get everything first. 

                                 ILYCH
                        Wait...he had a copy of a newspaper 
                        the night before it came out, how?

                                 STEPAN
                        How do you think?

           Ilych thinks. Immediately he gets it.

                                 ILYCH
                        He works there. He’s got ink stains 
                        on his hands, he probably works the 
                        presses. He takes next day’s paper 
                        home with him after work. 

           Stepan nods. He holds up the list. 
                                 STEPAN
                        Feel this. Touch it. It’s wax 
                        paper. Carbon copies are restricted 
                        from the public, only a few places 
                        you can find them. Here. Accounting 
                        departments. Newspaper offices. 

                                 ILYCH
                        You think he got this from Truth. 
                        That’s why he lied about his job. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Requisition a search team, quietly.

                                 ILYCH
                        Where are we going?

                                 STEPAN
                        Where do you think? He’s hiding 
                        something at that newspaper office. 
                        We need to find it.  

                                 ILYCH
                        So let’s just get him to confess 
                        it.

                                 STEPAN
                        Not yet. Get the team.

                                 ILYCH
                        No, we have him! Why not make him-

                                 STEPAN
                        Do what I say. Get the team.

           Stepan starts down the stairs. Ilych sighs. A beat. 

                                 ILYCH
                        ...Stepan, wait. Dmitry speaks 
                        Polish. He lied about that, too.

           Stepan stares, waiting for an explanation. 

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        I, uh, I told him I fucked his 
                        mother in the ass. In Polish. He 
                        blinked.

           A beat. Stepan laughs. He leaves. On a balcony above them, 
           Lieutenant Nazyuta watches, silent and unseen. 
           INT. LUBYANKA - EMPTY INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

           Lieutenant Volkov stands in an empty interrogation room. His 
           uniform is stained in dried blood. He’s not happy. 

           Lieutenant Nazyuta enters and leans against a wall. Volkov 
           says nothing. He’s twitching with anger. She grins.

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA
                        ...smarter than you thought, isn’t 
                        he? Want to know where he is?

           INT. LUBYANKA - MOTOR POOL - LATER

           The massive garage doors open. A truck and a sedan are 
           preparing to leave.

           Volkov enters the motor pool, moving with fast, hard steps. 
           He moves to the garage entrance, blocking their path. The 
           truck tries swerving to the right. Volkov moves right, 
           blocking it still. The engine roars.

           The DRIVER honks. Volkov doesn’t budge. He’s seething. 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        STEPAN! STEPAN SERGEIVICH!

           The truck keeps rumbling. A beat. Finally Stepan and Ilych 
           emerge from the sedan behind the truck. They head for Volkov. 
           He shouts over the truck’s engine.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV (CONT’D)
                        You hiding from me, huh? 

                                 STEPAN
                        You need to step aside, Comrade.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        I want them back. All of them.

                                 STEPAN
                        Volkov, I don’t have time to-

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Those suspects are mine, damn it! 

           Stepan gives a signal to the truck. Its engine stops. 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV (CONT’D)
                        You think you can just steal from 
                        me? Those suspects you got from the 
                        Commissar, they’re mine. I want 
                        them back, all of them.
                                 STEPAN
                        You want to get out of my way.

           Volkov thinks. He turns to Ilych. 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        What’s Stepan hiding? What is it? 
                        You think I won’t find out? 

                                 STEPAN
                        Volkov-

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Shut up! You’ve been slowing me 
                        down for years, now you want to 
                        compete? With me? I will fucking
                        bury you, you hear me peasant?

                                 STEPAN
                        Volkov, either you step aside, or 
                        I’m going to get in that truck and 
                        run you over. Last chance.

           They stare each other down. A beat. Volkov grins. 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        ...you know, I’ve changed my mind. 
                        Keep the suspects. I forgot you 
                        need new friends. 

           Stepan stares him down, cold and hard. A beat. Still smiling, 
           Volkov moves aside. Stepan and Ilych head for their car.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV (CONT’D)
                        I got fifty three, by the way. 
                        Already.

           They freeze. Volkov casually picks blood on his nails. 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV (CONT’D)
                        A brigadier at Trekhgorka, he 
                        denounced his entire pressing crew 
                        as Trotskyites. So I got a two 
                        night head start, fifty three 
                        arrests already, and I’m not a 
                        farmhand drunk. Still think you can 
                        win?

           Stepan says nothing. He climbs into the sedan with Ilych, 
           slamming the door. The truck engines start again. Volkov 
           watches as the truck rumbles past him into the night.
           INT. STEPAN’S SEDAN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Stepan drives, the truck following. He’s clearly restless. He 
           draws his flask and takes a sip. Ilych shifts in his seat.

                                 ILYCH
                        ...fifty three, how is that even-

                                 STEPAN
                        How do you think? 

                                 ILYCH
                        Well, why aren’t we doing that? 

           Stepan stares, lighting himself a cigarette. 

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious. Dmitry is a traitor, 
                        we know that. So why are we out 
                        here when we could be...getting the 
                        truth from him? Faster. 

                                 STEPAN
                        You think that’s truth? Think its 
                        fast? What do you even know about-

                                 ILYCH
                        I know Volkov’s got fifty three-

                                 STEPAN
                        I don’t give a shit what Volkov 
                        has. We’re going to beat him, and 
                        we’re going to do it by getting the 
                        whole story. Evidence, names, when 
                        we bring down Dmitry, we are going 
                        to have it all. That’s how we win. 

           Ilych stares out the window again. A beat. He laughs.

                                 ILYCH
                        You’re different, aren’t you? 
                        Different than all of us. When they 
                        assigned me to replace you, I 
                        thought you were soft. Weak, like 
                        my father. But you’re not. So what 
                        happened to you? How did you go 
                        from a case office to a-

                                 STEPAN
                        Ilych, what makes you think I want 
                        to have this conversation? What 
                        makes you think I even like talking 
                        to you at all? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEPAN (CONT'D)
                        Let’s be clear, you’re only here 
                        because I need something from you, 
                        that’s it, and the next time you 
                        compare me to your father I’ll put 
                        your head through that window. 
                        Understood? 

           Ilych goes silent. Stepan pulls up to a curb outside a large 
           warehouse. The truck pulls up beside him. 

           Stepan shuts off the engine. He leans forward and closes his 
           eyes. A beat. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...you don’t want to make friends. 
                        Trust me. 

           Stepan climbs out. Ilych follows, angrily.  

           EXT. MOSCOW STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Four STAFF SERGEANTS climb out of the truck, following Stepan 
           and Ilych up the steps towards the warehouse door. 

                                 STEPAN
                        No guns, watch the doors.

           Stepan pushes open the doors, flooding the night with light.

           INT. TRUTH PRINTING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           The newspaper warehouse is bright, loud, and teeming with 
           WORKERS despite the late hour. Massive industrial printing 
           presses are spewing out endless pages of newspaper with 
           Stalin’s face on the cover. 

           Stepan and his team move through the press floor, passing the 
           terrified workers. Stepan motions for the sergeants to wait 
           here, then steps into a back office with Ilych. 

           INT. TRUTH STAFF OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The exhausted OFFICE STAFF are gathered around tables, in the 
           midst of their work. They freeze as Stepan and Ilych enter. 

                                 PAPER EDITOR
                        Excuse me? Hey! Who are-

           Stepan flashes his identification card.
                                 STEPAN
                        Senior Lieutenant Lebedev, NKVD. 
                        Everyone, come here.

                                 PAPER EDITOR
                        (Growing scared)
                        State Security? I, uh, what are you 
                        doing here, Comrade?

                                 ILYCH
                        What do you think?

                                 PAPER EDITOR
                        No, there, uh, with respect, there 
                        aren’t anymore traitors here. Your 
                        people already came through and 
                        rounded up all of Bukharin’s-

           Stepan isn’t listening. He takes a police mugshot of Dmitry 
           out of his pocket and flashes it to the workers.

                                 STEPAN
                        Dmitry Nikolayevich Ivanov. I need 
                        access to whatever machinery he’s 
                        touched plus his possessions.

                                 WRITER
                        Dmitry Nikolayevich? The young man? 
                        Comrade he’s a copy-editor, I throw 
                        him some roubles for poems! 

                                 ILYCH
                        But he works here, right?

                                 WRITER
                        Yeah, he’s got a desk in the back 
                        but he doesn’t touch the presses. 
                        We’d never let him on the printing 
                        floor, I swear it!

                                 ILYCH
                        Not what his fingers say.

           Stepan spots a coffee pot brewing. He picks up a coffee mug.

                                 STEPAN
                        His desk. Show me.

           INT. TRUTH STAFF OFFICE - BACK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan and Ilych enter an empty back room full of desks and 
           typewriters. The nervous staff follows them in. Stepan’s 
           drinking coffee. A writer points out a desk. 
                                 WRITER
                        There, that one’s his.

           Stepan tries to open the desk drawer. It’s locked. Ilych 
           pushes him aside and with a quick flick draws a switch blade. 
           He starts to pry open the drawer lock with the blade.

                                 STEPAN
                        (The blade)
                        Where’d that come from?

                                 ILYCH
                        What do you care?

           Ilych pops open the lock and rummages through the drawer. 
           Pencils. Scraps of paper. A photograph of Dmitry’s wife and 
           daughter. A small sealed bottle of wine.

                                 STEPAN
                        The paper.

                                 ILYCH
                        Blank.

                                 STAFF EDITOR
                        See? Nothing here. Now if you 
                        Comrades would please excuse-

                                 STEPAN
                        (To Ilych)
                        Shut the presses down.

                                 PAPER EDITOR
                        Wait, wait, what?

           Ilych leaves. Stepan lifts his photo of Dmitry to the crowd.

                                 STEPAN
                        This man has had access to the 
                        printing floor, I know it! If none 
                        of you want to cooperate-

                                 PAPER EDITOR
                        You can’t stop the presses, we have 
                        morning edition in four hours! Ma 
                        Hushan’s on the run towards India! 
                        Republicans are holding Asturias 
                        seven to one! Comrade!

           In the back of the crowd Stepan spots a JANITOR shifting 
           nervously, gripping his broom. Stepan closes in on him.

                                 STEPAN
                        Look at me. What do you know?
                                 WRITER
                        He’s an immigrant. He’s just scared 
                        you’re going to check his papers!

           Stepan gives the writer a look that quiets him. He turns back 
           to the janitor, he’s a short swarthy man, missing a hand.

                                 STEPAN
                        You the janitor? What’s your name?

           The janitor starts to nervously speak in a foreign language. 
           Stepan grits his teeth. He turns to the editor. He shrugs.

                                 PAPER EDITOR
                        He’s, uh, from Azerbaijan, I think.

           Ilych returns with the sergeants. Stepan turns to him.

                                 STEPAN
                        Azeri, you speak it? 

                                 ILYCH
                        What? No, I speak some Turkish, 
                        it’s similar. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Will he understand? Show him the 
                        photo. Ask him what he knows.

           Ilych takes the photograph, approaches the janitor, and 
           starts to speak carefully in Turkish. The janitor replies, 
           shifting nervously from foot to foot as he babbles.  

                                 ILYCH
                        He, uh, I think he says he, he 
                        knows Dmitry, and he’s sorry.

                                 STEPAN
                        For what?

           Ilych asks. The janitor answers. Ilych struggles to keep up. 

                                 ILYCH
                        He, he use to...let Dmitry on the 
                        floor, I think, the printing floor. 
                        With keys. After everyone leaves.

                                 PAPER EDITOR
                        What? Comrades, I denounce this 
                        foreigner as a saboteur! Shoot him!

                                 STEPAN
                        All of you, shut up! Ilych find us 
                        someplace private. No one leaves.
           INT. TRUTH OFFICE - BACK HALLWAY - LATER

           Stepan and Ilych pace before the janitor. He is sitting on 
           the floor, crying and babbling to himself in Azeri. The walls 
           are lined with posters of triumphant soldiers and workers. 

                                 ILYCH
                        He, uh, slow down, he says he, I 
                        think he’s trying to say he didn’t 
                        know Dmitry was...bad. Bad man. He, 
                        uh, he says Dmitry paid him. Paid 
                        him to let him in after hours. And 
                        he says he’s sorry and he says he 
                        has two boys, little boys, and he-

                                 STEPAN
                        What’s his name?

                                 ILYCH
                        Habil.

           Stepan speaks to Habil, Ilych translating. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Habil, I need you to think very 
                        carefully. Tell me everything about 
                        Dmitry, understand? Everything. Do 
                        you want to go to the truck? Truck?

                                 HABIL
                        No! No truck!

                                 STEPAN
                        Tell me what you know. 

           Habil starts quickly speaking again. Ilych translate.

                                 ILYCH
                        He says he, uh, hold on, slow down. 
                        He’s saying, he’s saying Dmitry 
                        would come, in his raincoat, Dmitry 
                        would pay him, then shut the doors, 
                        and, uh, he wouldn’t see. This guy 
                        wouldn’t see.

                                 STEPAN
                        Great. He mention soap? Soap boxes, 
                        what do you know about soap?

           Habil stares, not understanding. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Soap! Soap boxes! Tell me!
                                 HABIL
                        (Confused, scared)
                        I no have soap! Please! No soap!

           Habil starts crying and talking quickly in Azeri.

                                 ILYCH
                        He’s going on about his kids. I 
                        don’t think he knows anything.

           Stepan steps away, rubbing the bruise on his head.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...what the hell was Dmitry doing 
                        here? What was he hiding?

                                 ILYCH
                        The staff, maybe one of them caught 
                        on? Maybe that’s the witness who 
                        reported him?

                                 STEPAN
                        None of them knew. You saw their 
                        faces.

           The staff sergeants enter the hall.

                                 NKVD STAFF SERGEANT
                        Comrade Lieutenant, we’ve been 
                        through the whole floor. Nothing. 
                        Place is clean.

           Stepan sighs. The sergeant points at Habil. 

                                 NKVD STAFF SERGEANT (CONT’D)
                        He’s a criminal, right? What are we 
                        going to do to him? 

           Stepan stares at Habil. The crying man looks up at him. He 
           says something.

                                 ILYCH
                        He says he didn’t know. He didn’t 
                        know.

           Stepan keeps staring. His expression hardens. 

           INT. TRUTH PRINTING FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           The building’s STAFF watch silently as Stepan drags Habil 
           towards the exit. He’s babbling and crying in Azeri. He has a 
           handcuff locked around his amputated wrist. 
           Ilych and the sergeants follow.

           EXT. MOSCOW STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           The sergeants throw Habil in the back of the truck and lock 
           it. Stepan lights a cigarette and turns to the sergeants.

                                 STEPAN
                        Give me the keys. I’m driving, 
                        you’re taking the sedan back.

                                 NKVD STAFF SERGEANT 
                        Comrade, we have to take the 
                        accused to processing and-

                                 STEPAN
                        I’m taking him in. This is my 
                        catch, you’re not selling it to the 
                        highest bidder. 

           The sergeants say nothing. Habil can still be heard crying.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Keys, now. There a sidearm in the 
                        glove?

           A sergeant nods. He switches keys with Stepan. The sergeants 
           get in the sedan and drive off. Stepan and Ilych climb in the 
           truck. 

           INT. RAVEN TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan drives. Classical music is playing on the radio. He 
           shuts it off. A beat. They can hear Habil crying from behind.

           Stepan says nothing. A long pause. Suddenly he pulls the 
           truck into a deserted street and turns off the engine. He 
           stares down at his hands. A beat. 

                                 STEPAN
                        You remember what I said yesterday, 
                        about how I can’t trust you? 

           Ilych nods.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        I need you to forget that now.

           Stepan reaches into the glove compartment and draws a TT-30
           automatic pistol. He climbs out. Ilych follows.
           EXT. MOSCOW STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan pulls Habil out of the truck, throwing him on his 
           knees onto the curb. Habil is crying, terrified.  

           Stepan puts the pistol to Habil’s head. He cocks it. 

                                 ILYCH
                        Whoa, wait-

                                 STEPAN
                        I want you to tell this man that he 
                        broke Article 58 of Soviet Criminal 
                        Code. Tell him that if he ever 
                        shows up to work again, he will be 
                        reported, and I will have to shoot 
                        him. Tell him to nod if he 
                        understands.

           Ilych stares at Stepan, surprised. Stepan doesn’t budge. A 
           beat. Ilych translates. Habil nods, nervously. 

           Stepan switches the safety back on the pistol and puts it 
           away. He takes out a set of keys, unlocks the handcuffs, and 
           pulls Habil back up to his feet. They stare at each other.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...ask him how he lost his hand. 

           Ilych translates. Habil doesn’t talk. Stepan draws his flask.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Was it the war? You fight for us? 
                        Get a medal? 

                                 HABIL
                        I, no, no more medal. Lost it.

           Stepan studies him. A beat. He offers him the flask. Habil 
           grins and draws his own flask, shaking it. 

           Stepan shakes his head, laughing softly. He motions for Habil 
           to go, then heads back to front of the truck. Ilych follows. 

                                 ILYCH
                        ...if anyone ever finds out about-

                                 STEPAN
                        About what? 

           Ilych gets the hint. Stepan looks at Habil and shrugs.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...he didn’t know.
           Stepan opens the truck door. Habil talks, grinning and waving 
           his flask. Stepan looks to Ilych for an explanation.

                                 ILYCH
                        Uh, I don’t know. He’s...I think 
                        he’s saying you’re a man. Like him. 
                        Not like Dmitry. “Dmitry would 
                        never drink with me. What kind of 
                        man doesn’t drink?” 

           Stepan freezes. He stares at Habil, thinking hard.

           INT. TRUTH STAFF OFFICE - BACK ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Stepan and Ilych slip into the back office. Stepan glances 
           around to make sure no one is coming, then grabs Dmitry’s 
           small bottle out of the desk. He lifts it up, inspecting it. 

           The glass is thick and dark. He shakes it. No sound.

                                 ILYCH
                        Stepan, what are you-

           Stepan suddenly smashes the bottle against the desk. Ilych 
           flinches as glass shatters everywhere, but no liquid. Out of 
           the bottle falls a small bundle wrapped in cloth. 

           The two men stare at the bundle, amazed.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...we don’t search bottles. Never 
                        sealed bottles. He’s smart. 

           Stepan draws a handkerchief from a back pocket. Covering his 
           fingers, he reaches down and opens the bundle of cloth. 
           Inside is a worn Soviet passport.

           Stepan opens it. There’s no photograph within. It’s been cut.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Damian Zajac. Polish, Soviet 
                        citizen. Age fifty six.

                                 ILYCH
                        No face. He cut the photo out?

           Stepan flips through the passport. The pages have been 
           stamped hundreds of times, a wild mess of stamps.
                                 STEPAN
                        ...regional stamps. Someone’s used 
                        this passport to travel all across 
                        the Soviet Union. Hundreds of 
                        places. Cities, towns. 

                                 ILYCH
                        No face. Stepan, no face. Printing 
                        presses. Dmitry, he could have been 
                        printing forged copies of the 
                        passport. He gives them to the 
                        cell, they put their own faces in. 
                        That’s why he’s here?

           The two men stare at each other. 

           INT. TRUTH PRINTING FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Ilych is talking into a rotary phone attached to the wall, 
           reading off the passport. Stepan paces, thinking. 

                                 ILYCH
                        ...immediate seizure for anyone 
                        traveling under that name. GUPVO, 
                        yes, all stations. No. Polish.

                                 STEPAN
                        And get us a full file search on 
                        Zajac. Who he is, where, check the 
                        apartment on the passport.

           Stepan spots a stack of next morning’s newspapers on the 
           floor. He takes one and flips through before turning to a 
           STAFF WRITER who is smoking and leaning nearby. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...half this newspaper is 
                        obituaries, you realize that? 

                                 STAFF WRITER
                        Glavlit censored our cover story. 
                        Have to fill the pages with 
                        something, Comrade. 

           Ilych lowers the receiver, talking to Stepan.

                                 ILYCH
                        They got news on Volkov. You’re not 
                        going to believe this.

           Stepan stares. Ilych doesn’t speak. Stepan moves closer.
                                 STEPAN
                        What, he find Dmitry? What?

                                 ILYCH
                        Dispatch is saying he just cracked 
                        some clerk from Gastronom 1. Gave 
                        up nineteen speculators. Puts him 
                        up to 72 confessions. He’s gonna
                        win tomorrow if he keeps this up.

           Stepan’s hands tighten around the newspaper. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION CELL - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Dmitry is laying face down on the table in the interrogation 
           room, sleeping. There are still screams. Beneath the table 
           his fingers hold the locket tightly.

           The door begins to open with a loud screech. He immediately 
           bolt awakes, slipping the locket in his sock. 

           Stepan and Ilych enter. Stepan heads for the empty chair. 

                                 DMITRY
                        ...I, they never came for me, I...

           Stepan sits down. He stares at Dmitry for a long moment. 

                                 DMITRY (CONT’D)
                        ...is there any news on my release? 

                                 STEPAN
                        (Not friendly)
                        They don’t grow wheat in Bodaybo. 
                        No black soil. Lift up your palms, 
                        show them to me. 

           Dmitry blinks, groggy.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Lift up your palms.

           Dmitry slowly lifts up his hands. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        No calluses. You don’t have any 
                        calluses and you don’t know 
                        anything about field work. You’ve 
                        been lying to me, Dmitry 
                        Nikolayevich.

                                 DMITRY
                        It, I was ten, it was-
                                 STEPAN
                        Keep your hands up.

           Dmitry keeps his hands up. A beat. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re like everyone else here. You 
                        think I’m weak. I’m not weak, but 
                        I’m running out of time. So here’s 
                        where we are:

           Stepan reaches into his coat and drawers a folded newspaper 
           from Truth. He slides it across the table to Dmitry.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Mostly obituaries. Open it and see. 

           Dmitry folds it open. The passport is sitting inside. Dmitry 
           takes a quick, frightened breath.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...this is what’s going to happen 
                        now. You are going to give me 
                        everything. You’re going to give me 
                        the names off the list, you’re 
                        going to tell me what boxes of soap 
                        really are, and you’re going to 
                        explain why you were printing 
                        passports for the people on the 
                        list. This is not an option.

           Dmitry’s face shifts and twitches. A long silence. Finally he 
           reaches for the passport. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Keep your hands up.

           Dmitry puts his hands back up.

                                 DMITRY
                        The list?

                                 STEPAN
                        I have the soap list. Give me the 
                        names.

                                 DMITRY
                        What, what names? What list?

           Stepan doesn’t answer. A beat.

                                 DMITRY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t, I don’t know what you’re 
                        talking about. Soap? Is-
                                 STEPAN
                        This is how you want to try me?

                                 DMITRY
                        I’m not trying anything, I just, 
                        why would I have a list of soap? I 
                        don’t understand.

                                 STEPAN
                        Are you working for the Polish? Is 
                        that why you speak their language?

                                 DMITRY
                        What? No, I, I don’t speak-

                                 ILYCH (POLISH, SUBTITLED)
                        You smuggling agents? Planning an 
                        attack? Who’s paying you?

                                 DMITRY
                        I don’t, I don’t understand what 
                        he’s saying.

           Stepan and Ilych simply stare at him.

                                 DMITRY (CONT’D)
                        Please! I, I’m telling the truth!

                                 STEPAN
                        (Annoyed)
                        Besides about where you work. Or 
                        who you are. Or where you’re from.

                                 DMITRY
                        I’m from Bodaybo!

                                 STEPAN
                        Dmitry, I spent seventeen years on 
                        a farm, never once saw a field hand 
                        turn himself into Pushkin. You 
                        taught yourself to read? I didn’t 
                        learn to read ‘til I was twenty-one 
                        and out of the army. You came to 
                        Moscow? Bullshit. Listen to your 
                        accent. You grew up here.

                                 DMITRY
                        No, please-
                                 STEPAN
                        Everything you have told me about 
                        yourself is a lie, your whole 
                        identity is a lie, you hid the 
                        list, you hid your job, you hid the 
                        passports, you-

                                 DMITRY
                        I don’t, the passport, I found it!

           Dmitry reaches for the passport. Stepan screams.

                                 STEPAN
                        KEEP YOUR HANDS UP!

           Dmitry’s hands bolt back up. Stepan breathes, calming down.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...I’m out of time, Dmitry. Who are 
                        you working for? What’s the soap? 
                        Who is your contact? Where is 
                        Damian Zajac?

                                 DMITRY
                        He, he, I, I don’t know who he is. 
                        Please, I, I know it looks bad but 
                        the passport’s not mine. I found 
                        it! I found it at Three Train 
                        Station, I was going to report it, 
                        but then I got scared so I, I hid 
                        it. That’s why I didn’t tell you 
                        about my job at Truth. I’m sorry, I 
                        know I should have, but I thought 
                        if you saw the passport, it would 
                        look bad, so I, I hid it.

                                 STEPAN
                        In a locked drawer in the building 
                        you bribe an immigrant to unlock 
                        for you in secret.

           Dmitry freezes. Stepan draws the soap list from pocket. 

                                 DMITRY
                        Habil, you...

                                 STEPAN
                        Habil is dead. They want to give 
                        you nine grams of lead next but I 
                        told them you’d cooperate.

           Dmitry’s face goes cold and still. 
                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        What do boxes of soap mean? Whose 
                        names are initialed on the list? 
                        How are you connected to the Poles?

           Stepan slides it across the table. Dmitry stares at the list. 
           He doesn’t speak. A long beat.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Dmitry, look at me. If you 
                        cooperate, I’ll do what I can for 
                        you. You have my word. You want to 
                        see your family again?

           Dmitry swallows hard. He closes his eyes.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...Dmitry.

                                 DMITRY
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. I can’t help you. I’m sorry.

           The two men stare at each other. There’s a long pause. 

                                 STEPAN
                        (Calm, quiet)
                        ...Ilych, leave the room.

           Ilych heads to the door and knocks twice. Once he’s gone 
           Stepan reaches for his flask.

           Stepan drinks, listening to the screaming through the walls. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...you tired? I’m tired.

           They hear a high pitched cry. Stepan tilts his head.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        I know that one. That scream. It’s 
                        the crown.

           Dmitry doesn’t speak, hands still raised. Stepan drinks.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        (Very calm)
                        In the room to your right, there is 
                        a case officer, Senior Lieutenant 
                        Nazyuta. She’s trying to get a 
                        priest to confess to derailing a 
                        train or something. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        What she does is, she uses this 
                        crown, this metal crown with screws 
                        attached to the inside. She fits it 
                        over your head and then she 
                        tightens the screws until they 
                        drill into your skull. When that 
                        doesn’t work, she likes to take 
                        this hot branding iron and drive it 
                        up your anal cavity. Your colon, it 
                        actually starts to melt. She’s 
                        creative like that. 

           A beat. He drinks, staring at the wall and listening to 
           screams. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        I...hate torture. I hate that 
                        torture has become the tool we use. 
                        Getting a suspect to confess with 
                        it is like cheating, and I know 
                        that every suspect I tortured into 
                        a confession probably was innocent. 
                        But now, for the first time, I know 
                        I have a guilty man sitting before 
                        me. A conspirator. A liar. And his 
                        confession is the only way I will 
                        ever get out of here. 

           A beat. He looks Dmitry in the eye.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        So what am I going to do, Dmitry? 
                        Am I going to go down that path 
                        again? I’m not an animal, but this 
                        place, it wants to make me into 
                        one. I’m struggling. I’m struggling 
                        to stay a man.

           Dmitry doesn’t answer. The door opens, Ilych leans in.

                                 ILYCH
                        Senior Lieutenant, you need to come 
                        with me. Now.

           Stepan stares at Ilych curiously, then gets up, staggering a 
           bit. Stepan slides the soap list across the table to Dmitry.

                                 STEPAN
                        The names. Give them to me. 

                                 ILYCH
                        Now, Stepan.
           He picks up the passport and newspaper and heads for the 
           door. Suddenly Dmitry speaks, staring down. 

                                 DMITRY
                        (Ashamed)
                        I, uh...I have diarrhea. When I 
                        can’t sleep well. They don’t give 
                        me anything to clean myself with. 
                        If there is anything you can get 
                        me, a rag or...I just don’t want to 
                        be like that when you return.

           Stepan stops. A beat. He laughs and tosses the newspaper at 
           Dmitry’s head.

                                 STEPAN
                        Wipe your ass with Truth.

           With that Stepan and Ilych leave, the door slamming. Once 
           they are gone Dmitry slowly lowers his hands.

           INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION WING - MOMENTS LATER

           Ilych frantically pulls Stepan into the hall.

                                 ILYCH
                        Stepan, look. Look. 

           Stepan looks. STAFF SERGEANTS are blocking the hallway’s 
           exits. Every door and stairwell has a pair of sergeants.

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        Something’s not right. What are 
                        they all doing here?

                                 STEPAN
                        ...he knows.

           Stepan thinks. A beat. Suddenly he rushes over to a supply 
           closet. Stepan pulls out a body bag, hands it to Ilych, and 
           races back into the interrogation cell. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Dmitry turns around just in time to see Stepan descend on 
           him. Without a word Stepan grabs Dmitry by the collar and 
           starts viscously beat his face with his fist. 

           Ilych watches, horrified. Stepan hits Dmitry about six times 
           and lets go. Dmitry crashes to the floor, unconscious and 
           bleeding. Stepan grips his own fist in pain, then turns to 
           Ilych and points at the bag.
                                 STEPAN
                        Help me. Now.

           Stepan and Ilych pull open the body bag and fit Dmitry in. 
           Stepan smears the blood around Dmitry’s face and zips it up.

           INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION WING - MOMENTS LATER

           Volkov marches down the hall. A sergeant points to a cell. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Volkov enters the interrogation cell. Stepan and Ilych are 
           waiting for him, silent. Stepan rubs his bruised hand.

           Volkov looks at the blood on Stepan’s hands, then heads over 
           to the body bag. He zips it open and stares at Dmitry’s 
           motionless, bloody face. 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        ...who’s he?

                                 STEPAN
                        You want to ask him?

           Volkov zips the bag up. He studies Stepan coldly. A beat.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...you got something you want to-

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        I know what you found at that 
                        newspaper office.

           Stepan twitches. Volkov grins.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV (CONT’D)
                        Thought you could hide it? Everyone 
                        knows you have some secret you’ve-

                                 STEPAN
                        I don’t-

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Don’t even try. Four sergeants saw 
                        it. Saw you arrest a one handed 
                        man. Except, records don’t have you 
                        bringing anyone in. Suspicious, 
                        isn’t it? You slip him in under a 
                        different name? Put him in the mass 
                        cells? That amputee, he’s your 
                        secret suspect, isn’t he?
                                 STEPAN
                        Volkov, you don’t know what you’re-

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Here’s what I know. An hour ago I 
                        put a call in to Blokhin’s boys. 
                        Pulled some strings. They did some 
                        cell cleaning with OSO. Every one 
                        handed man we have in custody was 
                        just shot. There were twelve. 

           Stepan says nothing. Volkov smiles and turns to go. At the 
           doorway he stops and addresses Ilych.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV (CONT’D)
                        Hey kid, one more thing. Do you 
                        know why the farmhand here is going 
                        to lose? 

           Stepan and Ilych say nothing. Volkov smiles.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV (CONT’D)
                        Stepan, he’s good at what he does. 
                        Taught me to follow clues. Chase 
                        leads. Then one day I figured 
                        something out he never did. We’re 
                        not detectives. Not anymore. We’re 
                        assembly line operators. This 
                        place, it’s just a factory. If you 
                        ever want to learn how it works, 
                        you come find me, okay? 

           Volkov leaves. Silence. Both men let out a sigh. Stepan leans 
           against the table, draws his flask, and looks at his hand.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...I think I broke my fist.

           INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION WING HALLWAY - LATER

           Ilych peers out into the hall. It is deserted. He and Stepan 
           drag the body bag out. Ilych whispers. 

                                 ILYCH
                        ...where can we hide him? 

                                 STEPAN
                        Old Bear’s room. It’s empty now. We 
                        can bolt it from the outside.

                                 ILYCH
                        You want to put him in a traitor’s 
                        office? 
                                 STEPAN
                        You think anyone will look? We can 
                        slip him in after the night shift, 
                        maybe around five in the-

                                 ILYCH
                        Stepan, it’s seven in the morning.

           Stepan stops. He looks at the windowless walls around him.

           INT. LUBYANKA - MAJOR’S OFFICE - LATER THAT MORNING

           Dmitry opens his eyes with a moan. Morning sunlight is 
           splashed across his face. 

           He sits up, confused, and finds himself in a large, entirely 
           empty office overlooking Moscow. His face and nose are 
           covered in dried blood. He’s handcuffed.

           Dmitry stumbles to his feet. He touches the windows. They’re 
           bolted with anti-suicide braces. He stumbles over to the 
           door. It’s locked.

           INT. LUBYANKA - STAFF OFFICE - LATER THAT MORNING 

           Stepan and Ilych lean against a desk, staring at the sun 
           through a window. Both are drinking coffee. Stepan smokes a 
           cigarette. His bruised wrist is wrapped in gauss. 

                                 ILYCH
                        ...I missed breakfast. My wife is 
                        probably wondering where I am. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Only three kinds of people work 
                        till morning - us, thieves and 
                        prostitutes. They get better pay.

                                 ILYCH
                        Until we catch them.

           Stepan shakes his head. A beat. He motions around the office.

                                 STEPAN
                        You know what this place was, 
                        before the Revolution?

                                 ILYCH
                        Insurance agency...I’m not sure 
                        which frightens people more.

           Stepan grins. The smile slowly fades as he smokes and thinks.
                                 STEPAN
                        ...why won’t he just confess? 

           Ilych has no answer. A young OFFICER hurries towards them, 
           carrying a folder. 

                                 NKVD OFFICER
                        Senior Lieutenant, good morning. 
                        Two things. First, I’ve finished 
                        the file search you asked on that 
                        passport, Damian Zajac. Polish, but 
                        a Party Member. 

           Stepan glances around, ensuring they’re out of anyone else’s 
           earshot.

                                 ILYCH
                        How many Poles are Party Members?

                                 STEPAN
                        Too many. What else?

                                 NKVD OFFICER
                        Well, he’s dead. Suicide in ‘34. 
                        Drank himself to death, in Omsk.

           Stepan and Ilych look at each other. Stepan takes the file. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...if he died in Siberia how did 
                        his passport get back here?

                                 NKVD OFFICER
                        Don’t know. Did a full listing off 
                        the places it was used to travel 
                        to, though, it’s big. 

           The officer hands Stepan a long list. Stepan scans it.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...Savala. Savala fields village? 
                        The village, this passport was used 
                        to go to the village there? 

                                 NKVD OFFICER
                        I guess. In Tambov, right? Never 
                        heard of the place. You know it?

                                 STEPAN
                        What’s the score now?

                                 NKVD OFFICER
                        Uh, Volkov’s in the lead with 82. 
                        Nazyuta’s second with 73. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NKVD OFFICER (CONT'D)
                        Both are resting. But, another 
                        thing, a woman’s here for you. 

           Stepan blinks.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...a what? 

                                 NKVD OFFICER
                        A woman. Across Dzerzhinsky at the 
                        Information Center. Showed up 
                        asking for you. Says it’s 
                        important.

                                 STEPAN
                        A woman?

                                 ILYCH
                        (To the officer, joking)
                        You will excuse the Senior 
                        Lieutenant, Comrade, it’s been a 
                        long time since he was laid. 

           Stepan ignores this and heads for the exit. He bumps into 
           Captain Tyruin. 

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Senior Lieutenant! There you are! 

                                 STEPAN
                        Not now, Comrade Captain. 

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        No, stop! I denounce you as a 
                        thief, damn it, that rabbit’s my 
                        Masha’s! You can’t just steal the 
                        rabbits from vanguards of the 
                        proletarian-  

           Stepan grabs the Captain by the collar. The office freezes.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...I met your daughter. She’s a 
                        little terror. She didn’t drop that 
                        rabbit on accident, now did she?

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        You’re drunk.

           Stepan draws his wallet and pulls out a bill.

                                 STEPAN
                        Here. Go buy her a nice pet rock.
           Stepan drops the money to the floor and walks away. A group 
           of CLERKS across the office laugh. Ilych whispers, trailing.

                                 ILYCH
                        So you’re going crazy now, too.

           Stepan doesn’t answer. 

           INT. INFORMATION CENTER - LOBBY - LATER THAT MORNING 

           Stepan and Ilych enter the large, loud information center. 
           Bright sunlight pours through big windows around them. 

           The building is set up like a bank lobby, long snaking lines 
           of WOMEN and CHILDREN wait for their chance to argue with 
           CLERKS behind barred stations. Armed GUARDS patrol the sides.

           Stepan and Ilych push towards the front of the line.  A 
           frantic woman is arguing with the clerk.

                                 WOMAN
                        You don’t know? You do know! It’s 
                        been three weeks, where did you 
                        take him? Where’s my husband? 

           Stepan gently pushes the woman aside. The clerk scowls. 

                                 INFORMATION CENTER CLERK
                        Hey, no! There’s a line, there’s 
                        request files, you can’t just- 

           Stepan flashes his identification. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Show me the woman.

           INT. INFORMATION CENTER - BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           A thick middle aged woman, IRINA, sits in a chair, fidgeting 
           nervously. A SERGEANT ushers Stepan and Ilych into the room, 
           then leaves. She stands up, clearly nervous. 

                                 IRINA
                        Comrades. Good morning. I, my names 
                        Irina Andreevna Popov and, uh...

           Stepan holds up a hand, stopping her. He studies the woman.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...I know you. You were at Dmitry 
                        Nikolayevich’s apartment. The night 
                        we arrested him.  
                                 IRINA
                        Yes, I live there. With my husband. 
                        And my son, we’re Dmitry’s 
                        neighbors, Russian, and I know I 
                        shouldn’t be here, but I need help.

           Stepan stares, waiting.

                                 IRINA (CONT’D)
                        ...it wasn’t, wasn’t supposed to 
                        happen like that. They said it 
                        wouldn’t happen in front of the 
                        children and, and the number they 
                        gave me, I call it but no one 
                        answers, and, the compensation, I, 
                        please, I did my duty, I need your-

           Something clicks in Stepans’ mind. He leans close to her. 

                                 STEPAN
                        What are you saying? Are you saying 
                        what I think?

           Irina fidgets nervously.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...you’re the informer, aren’t you? 
                        You reported Dmitry.

                                 IRINA
                        I, my husband doesn’t know, please-

                                 STEPAN
                        What do you know, what did you see?

                                 IRINA
                        He, uh, he, he-

           Irina starts to have a panic attack. Stepan touches her. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Breathe. You’re safe, okay? Just 
                        tell me what you know. Why did you 
                        report Dmitry? 

                                 IRINA
                        He...he, Dmitry Nikolayevich always 
                        acted suspiciously. He would come 
                        home late. Him and his wife were 
                        always reading books. He even had 
                        foreign books.

           Stepan blinks. A beat. 
                                 STEPAN
                        ...you reported him for books?

           Irina doesn’t answer. She fidgets with her hair nervously.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Irina, answer me! Why did you 
                        report him?

                                 IRINA
                        (Terrified)
                        He, I, he, he, we, my husband’s 
                        cold, it’s getting colder in the 
                        apartment and his lungs are so bad. 
                        We can’t afford gas for the furnace 
                        and they, they said they were 
                        compensating people who, who 
                        reported traitors, they were 
                        handing out money, so I, so I, I 
                        mean, all those books, so young 
                        with those books, it had to mean 
                        something but, but I haven’t gotten 
                        the money yet. For doing my duty. 
                        Can you get me the money? Please?

           Stepan takes a step back. A beat. Irina takes a breath.

                                 IRINA (CONT’D)
                        You...you’re not married, are you? 
                        I’m sorry. You wouldn’t understand.

           Stepan says nothing. A beat. He turns around and storms off.

           INT. INFORMATION CENTER - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan pushes through the noisy lobby, Ilych trailing. He 
           passes a table where a clerk is working at a typewriter. 

           Stepan suddenly lashes out, grabbing the typewriter and 
           slamming it into a wall. Everyone in the center immediately 
           goes silent. They watch as Stepan barges towards the exit.

           EXT. DZERZHINSKY SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan emerges onto a bright street, stumbling. A passing car 
           nearly runs him over, its horn blaring. Stepan flinches.

                                 STEPAN
                        Fucking shit.  

           Ilych catches up to him and takes him aside.
                                 ILYCH
                        Hey, hey enough. 

                                 STEPAN
                        We’re going back to Dmitry.

                                 ILYCH
                        You sure that’s a good idea?

                                 STEPAN
                        It doesn’t mean anything. What she 
                        said. He’s still a traitor. C’mon.

           Stepan reaches for his flask, Ilych takes the flask.

                                 ILYCH
                        You need to calm down. Rest.

                                 STEPAN
                        I’m fine.

                                 ILYCH
                        Fine? You grabbed the Captain, you 
                        just threw a typewriter, you’re 
                        stumbling, that’s fine? 

                                 STEPAN
                        I can’t lose this, okay? You know 
                        what happens if I lose? To both of 
                        us? He has to give us the names. 
                        We’re going back. He has to.

           Stepan paces. A beat. 

                                 ILYCH
                        ...and if he doesn’t? What happens 
                        if he goes silent again? 

           For a moment Stepan doesn’t answer. Finally he stops pacing. 
           He rubs his eyes and comes to a decision. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...I don’t know, I...you’re right. 
                        We need a break. I have to rest. 
                        Clear my head.

                                 ILYCH
                        I’ll get someone to drive you home.

                                 STEPAN
                        No, no, we don’t have time for 
                        that...my office, you come wake me 
                        there in two hours. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEPAN (CONT'D)
                        Talk to your wife on the phone or 
                        something, I just, two hours...

           Stepan rub his eyes again, slipping. He starts to leave.

                                 ILYCH
                        Stepan, wait. You asked before, 
                        about a village. Savala. Is that-

                                 STEPAN
                        No. Two hours.

           Stepan leaves. Ilych watches him go.

           INT. LUBYANKA - STEPAN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan’s head comes down on the desk in his small, dark 
           office. His eyes close, drifting quickly to sleep.

           Dark silence. Peace. Suddenly, a strange sound begins to fill 
           the room. The sound of hard wind, and with it rustling metal.

           Snow begins to fall from the ceiling. Suddenly we are no 
           longer in Stepan’s office. We are in a dream.

           EXT. WINTER FIELD - DREAM

           A blinding snow falls across an endless horizon. White as far 
           as the eye can see. A barbed wire fence twists in the wind.

           Shivering soldiers approach the fence. A young handsome man 
           is among them. He is scared and freezing. He clutches his 
           rifle nervously as something approaches through the storm. 

           A great brown shape begins to emerge from the snow. It is a 
           herd. A herd of PEASANTS. Women, children, and old men 
           huddled together, singing hymns. Sheep DOGS and SOLDIERS herd 
           them towards the fence. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - STEPAN’S OFFICE - LATER

           Stepan’s bloodshot eyes open. His desk covered in snow.

           He sits up, frightened. A second later the snow disappears, 
           leaving him shivering and alone in the dark.

           Stepan stares down at the empty desk. He rubs his face. He 
           breathes slowly, his eyes closing. A long, deep silence.

                                 STEPAN 
                        ...no more.
           INT. LUBYANKA - LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           A deserted, large locker room. Stepan opens his locker. 
           Inside are a few half full bottles. A vintage Nagant M185
           revolver. Hanging from a hook is a dusty uniform. 

           Stepan turns to a mirror and stares at himself. A beat. He 
           strips off his leather jacket. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - STAFF OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

           OFFICERS move and work through the busy staff office. Ilych 
           sits on the corner of desk, talking into a phone. 

                                 ILYCH
                        No I’m fine, just my eyes...me too.

           A door opens. Officers and clerks look up, surprised, as 
           something enters. Ilych doesn’t notice. 

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        No, just coffee...did you feel it?

           A hand touches Ilych’s shoulder. He turns to see Stepan, 
           dressed from head to toe in his blue and green NKVD uniform. 
           It fits him perfectly. The revolver hangs in a holster. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...Comrade, I need you to get these 
                        items from the requisition office. 

           He hands Ilych a list. Ilych reads it, the phone slipping 
           from his hand. Stepan looks over the young man’s suit.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Your uniform, it’s at home?

                                 ILYCH
                        Yeah. Why, is the suit okay?

                                 STEPAN
                        You might get blood on it.

           Ilych stares up at him, surprised. Stepan nods.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...its time. We’re finishing this.

           INT. LUBYANKA - MAJOR’S OFFICE - MIDDAY 

           Light passes through the Major’s empty office. Dmitry is 
           huddled in a corner, with his locket. He’s still handcuffed. 
           Locks shift at the door. Dmitry hides the locket in his sock 
           as Stepan, Ilych, and a WARDER enter. 

           Stepan carries a bag and a wooden chair. Ilych has a plastic 
           tarp and curtains. The warder brings a ladder.

                                 DMITRY
                        ...what is, what-

                                 STEPAN
                        (Calm, cold)
                        Turn around. Close your eyes.

           Dmitry stands, turns to face the wall, and closes his eyes. 
           The team gets to work. Ilych lays the plastic tarp across the 
           floor while Stepan helps the warder put up the curtains, 
           blocking the windows entirely. Dmitry shakes.

           Stepan then takes the ladder, puts it in the middle of the 
           room, and climbs it. The warder reaches into the bag and 
           hands Stepan a meat hook. Stepan hangs it from a chandelier 
           hook in the ceiling. 

           With this done, Stepan opens the bag and draws a bottle of 
           vodka. He sits down in the chair, across the room from 
           Dmitry, and drinks. A beat. When he speaks, he is very calm. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...turn around. Open your eyes.

           Dmitry turns around to see the changed room. He moans and 
           faints. The warder rushes over to hold him up. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Ilych. Smelling salts.

           Ilych opens the bag and hands Stepan a bag of smelling salts. 
           Stepan gets up, walks over, and shoves a wad under Dmitry’s 
           nose, snapping him back to consciousness.

           Stepan leans in close to Dmitry.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Dmitry, look at me. This is it. 
                        This is your last chance. You will 
                        confess. One way or the other.

                                 DMITRY
                        No, no-

                                 STEPAN
                        Who gave you the dead man’s 
                        passport? Whose names are on your 
                        list?  
                                 DMITRY
                        No, not, it’s not, I’m not, I can’t 
                        give you what you want. I can’t.

           Stepan stares at him. A beat.

                                 STEPAN
                        Take his clothes off.

           Dmitry struggles as the warder starts to rip off his clothes. 
           Ilych holds out Dmitry’s arms while Stepan climbs the ladder.

                                 DMITRY
                        No, wait!

                                 STEPAN
                        One, two, three.

           The three men hoist Dmitry up, locking his handcuffs into the 
           meat hook. Dmitry is now hanging helpless and naked in the 
           air, his toes barely touching one of the chairs. 

           Dmitry struggles to breathe, frightened, taking in quick 
           gasps of air. Stepan picks up the bottle and swigs vodka.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...Dmitry Nikolayevich, under 
                        Article 58 of the Criminal Code, 
                        I’m accusing you of counter-
                        revolutionary activity. You will 
                        admit your crimes or you will-

                                 DMITRY
                        No, no, you don’t want to do this. 
                        You can’t, please! Please listen! 
                        Listen! I know, I know you don’t 
                        want to do this. Let me down. You 
                        want to let me down. You’re scared, 
                        right? I know you’re scared. 

           Stepan stares at him for a long moment. The two men lock 
           eyes. Silence.

           Suddenly Stepan screams, knocking over the chair. In a burst 
           of rage, he snaps one of the wooden legs off and charges at 
           Dmitry, swinging it like a club.  

           Dmitry screams in pain as Stepan beats him. Ilych’s eyes go 
           wide. Stepan keeps hitting Dmitry’s naked body with hard, 
           brutal blows.

                                 STEPAN
                        Give me names! Give me the names!
           The wooden leg snaps. Stepan starts using his good fist and 
           boots. Ilych rushes forward, pulling him off Dmitry. 

           Stepan paces back and forth, breathing hard. Dmitry hangs, 
           coughing in pain as blood drips off him. Stepan takes the 
           vodka, swigs hard, then searches in the sack. 

           He pulls out a long, thick iron chain and hands it to Ilych.

           Ilych fingers fumble around the chain. He’s shaking. He looks 
           at Dmitry’s bloody body, then back at Stepan. His mouth 
           quivers. A beat. He shakes his head. 

           Stepan angrily snatches back the chain. He paces, drinks, 
           then approaches Dmitry’s back. The man’s half-conscious. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Confess, accused. Give me names.

           Dmitry mumbles something, his mouth full of blood.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        What was that?

                                 DMITRY
                        (Choking on blood)
                        ...go fuck yourself, Comrade.

           Stepan swings the chain at his back. Dmitry screams.

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           Dmitry hangs, barely conscious, the skin on his back torn to 
           bloody shreds. The tarp is covered in blood. Ilych stands in 
           corner on the room, very pale. The warder is gone.

           Stepan sits in another corner, drinking. The bloody chain 
           rests at his feet.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...I’m out of time, accused. Give 
                        me what I want. This can get worse.

           Dmitry coughs blood, barely awake. He talks to himself.

                                 DMITRY
                        ...Yuliya...Sasha...Yuliya...

           Stepan gets up and pours vodka down Dmitry’s bloody back. The 
           pain brings him back into focus.

                                 STEPAN
                        The names. Accused. Give me the-
           Dmitry begins to laugh softly. His laughs grow louder, 
           delirious and hysterical. Finally he starts to softly and 
           fluently speak in Polish. He grins as he whispers.

           Stepan turns to Ilych. Ilych swallows hard, then translates.

                                 ILYCH
                        (Translating)
                        ...I, uh, I just figured it out. 
                        It’s a playground. This place is a 
                        playground. You’re playing make 
                        believe. All you people do is play.

           Dmitry laughs again, softly, then continues to speak. Ilych 
           translates, struggling with words. 

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        (Translating)
                        ...you dress up in these outfits, 
                        these stupid outfits, and you drag 
                        people in here and you pretend. But 
                        you and I know, don’t we? We know 
                        there really is an enemy of the 
                        people in this room. A traitor. And 
                        he likes to play. 

           Blood comes down Dmitry’s lips as he grins. Stepan’s face is 
           hard and cold. He draws a pack of matches.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...there’s a reason I used to order 
                        100 proof grain. It’s flammable. 

           Stepan strikes a match and tosses it on Dmitry’s back. His 
           skin erupts in flames. Dmitry screams and writhes in agony. 
           His feet kick the chair out from under him.

           Ilych rushes out of the room. Stepan watches the flames burn. 
           Without the chair for support the meat hook snaps from the 
           ceiling, dropping his flaming body to the floor.  

           Ilych quickly returns with a blanket. He smothers it over 
           Dmitry’s back, killing the flame. He then grabs Stepan.

                                 ILYCH
                        Damn it, Stepan, you’re going to 
                        kill him! You lost your mind?

           Stepan shoves him away angrily. 

                                                          CUT TO: LATER
           Time passes. A STAFF DOCTOR now stands over Dmitry’s 
           unconscious body, helping Ilych apply bandages to the burns. 
           Stepan is drinking in the corner. He has no more anger.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...is he going to die?

                                 NKVD STAFF DOCTOR
                        Hard to say. Might if you keep this 
                        up. I recommend a stop for the day. 
                        Let the accused rest. 

                                 STEPAN
                        No. Thank you doctor. Ilych, leave. 
                        I’ll find you if I need you.

           Ilych gives Stepan a worried look. Stepan doesn’t budge. 
           Ilych gets up and follows the doctor out of the room.

           For a moment, Stepan simply stares at his prisoner. Then his 
           sagging eyes shift away, noticing something small and shiny 
           in the pile of Dmitry’s clothing. It’s his locket.

           Stepan picks the locket up and snaps it open. A worn photo of 
           Dmitry’s wife and little daughter sits inside.

           Stepan studies the photo for a long moment. Finally he closes 
           the locket, slips it in a pocket, and finishes his bottle.

           With a clumsy hand, he draws the pack of smelling salts and 
           steps over to Dmitry. He presses the salts to his nose.

           Dmitry awakens with a coarse moan. Stepan sits beside him.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        (Gentle)
                        Sshh. Give me the names, Dmitry. 
                        Please, just give me the names. 
                        This is why I can’t stay here 
                        anymore. I hate this. But if you 
                        don’t confess, I am going to have 
                        to do something I don’t want to do. 
                        Please don’t make me do it. Just 
                        give me names.

           Dmitry says nothing, his stare is distant and dull. A beat. 
           Stepan gets up and stumbles out the office.

           INT. LUBYANKA - INTERROGATION WING - LATER

           Staggering slightly, Stepan makes his way down the 
           interrogation wing hallway. He comes to a cell door, blocked 
           by two WARDERS.
                                 STEPAN
                        Let me in.

           The warders look at each other.

                                 NKVD WARDER
                        Senior Lieutenant Nazyuta’s in 
                        session, she-

                                 STEPAN
                        Let. Me. In.

           The two men give each other a look, then step aside. Stepan 
           opens the door.

           INT. LUBYANKA - NAZYUTA’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Stepan enters the cell and immediately freezes. Nazyuta is 
           sitting in a chair, completely naked. A TK automatic pistol 
           rests on her lap. In a corner of the room an OLD MAN cowers 
           hunched over, weeping and crossing himself.

           Nazyuta gives Stepan a casual glance.

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA
                        ...yes, Comrade? 

           Stepan looks at the old man, then back at her. She shrugs.

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA (CONT’D)
                        Orthodox Priest. Never seen a naked 
                        woman. Can I help you?

                                 STEPAN
                        I...I want it back.

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA
                        What back?

                                 STEPAN
                        You know what.

           She tilts her head, feigning ignorance.

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA
                        Comrade, I’m not sure what you-

                                 STEPAN
                        Don’t. Don’t. It was mine, I built 
                        it, you stole it when I was 
                        demoted. I want it back.
           A beat. She nods at a bag in a corner. Stepan stumbles over 
           to it and searches. He pulls out a thick round object covered 
           in a burlap sack. He takes it and heads for the door.

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA
                        I know you think I’m your enemy. 

                                 STEPAN
                        I don’t have time for this.

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA
                        If I was your enemy, I suppose I 
                        would have told Volkov about Dmitry 
                        Nikolayevich. Or his soap list. Or 
                        Truth. Instead the Senior 
                        Lieutenant has been chasing 
                        amputees around, hasn’t he?

           Stepan freezes. She looks his uniform up and down.

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA (CONT’D)
                        ...believe it or not, some of us 
                        don’t want a man like that to win. 
                        We keep our options open. It’s good 
                        to have you back, Comrade.

           Stepan stares at her, then the priest, then leaves. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - MAJOR’S OFFICE - LATER

           Stepan enters Major’s office, flanked by two WARDERS and 
           carrying the item. Dmitry is still laying on the floor.

           Stepan pulls the burlap off, revealing an iron crown. Screws 
           run along its inside. Dmitry starts to cry when he sees it. 

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           Time has passed. The room has changed. The bloody tarp is 
           gone. The curtains are gone. A table is now in the room. 
           Dmitry sits at it, dressed and shivering, a pen in hand. He’s 
           writing a list of names.

           His naked back is raw and bleeding. His forehead is ringed by 
           small wounds. The bloody crown sits on the floor nearby. 
           Stepan and Ilych stand above him, watching him work.

           Dmitry drops his pen. He slips out of the chair, about to 
           pass out. Stepan and Ilych grab him as he falls.

                                 STEPAN
                        Ilych, the salts.
           Dmitry waves them away with his hand. He picks up the pen and 
           finishes writing. Ilych takes the paper from him and reads.

                                 ILYCH
                        “I Dmitry Nikolayevich Ivanov
                        confess to being a member of a 
                        counter-revolutionary cell intent 
                        on the destruction of the Soviet 
                        Union. I joined the cell when I was 
                        nineteen, out of hatred for 
                        collectivization. I had two 
                        assignments in the cell, 1- to safe 
                        guard and memorize a list of 
                        members true names and 2- to 
                        produce fake passports for them. In 
                        both aspects we were aided by the 
                        Polish government, who have plotted 
                        the destruction of the Soviet 
                        Union, and trained us in Polish to 
                        help hide our plans. I have 
                        provided here the names of all 206 
                        members. The boxes of soap besides 
                        their initials represent crates 
                        each member was to gather over the 
                        following year in order to hide 
                        weaponry and explosives.”   

           Stepan takes the sheets of names and looks it over.

                                 STEPAN
                        Two hundred and six names. You 
                        remember them all?

                                 DMITRY
                        I remember. It was my duty.

           Stepan and Ilych give each other a look. Stepan folds the 
           list and puts it in his pocket. Dmitry swallows hard.

                                 DMITRY (CONT’D)
                        ...what...what happens now?

                                 STEPAN
                        You’ll be tried by an OSO special 
                        tribunal. We have them in house. 

                                 DMITRY
                        I want to call my wife.

                                 STEPAN
                        That’s not possible. 

                                 DMITRY
                        I’ve given you everything.
                                 STEPAN
                        You’re not mine anymore. You belong 
                        to extrajudicial now. 

           Stepan heads for the door.

                                 DMITRY
                        ...so we’re done?

           Stepan nods. 

                                 DMITRY (CONT’D)
                        And...I’ll never see you again?

           A beat. Stepan shakes his head.

                                 STEPAN
                        Don’t worry, Dmitry. No one here’s 
                        ever going to see me again. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan heads down a sunlit hall, staggering slightly. He 
           looks at his hands. They’re still caked in blood. 

           Stepan stops. He leans his head against a wall and closes his 
           eyes. He simply stands there for a long moment, breathing. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Captain Tyruin sits at a desk in his affluent office, going 
           over a report with Lieutenant Volkov.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        It’s countersigned with the 
                        dispatch, I just need warrants and-

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Senior Lieutenant Lebedev.

           Volkov turns around. Stepan is standing in the doorway. 
           Volkov looks over his uniform.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        That’s cute. He’s dressed like what 
                        he wants to be when he grows up.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        (To Stepan)
                        This is a closed meeting, you have 
                        to wait out-
           Stepan ignores this. He steps inside, closes the door, and 
           draws Dmitry’s papers from his pocket.  

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN (CONT’D)
                        ...Stepan? Is everything alright?

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Depends, how many hands do you 
                        have?

           Volkov grins. Stepan calmly approaches the desk. 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I’m wondering, you think one-
                        handed men have a problem fucking? 
                        They’re missing a grip? Or-

                                 STEPAN
                        (Calm, not bragging)
                        Comrade Captain, I have the names 
                        and arrest sheets here for two 
                        hundred and six counter-
                        revolutionary traitors, as 
                        confessed by an accused. I need-

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        You have what? 

                                 STEPAN
                        -signatories and directorate 
                        approval from the department head, 
                        which I assume is you since the 
                        Major’s death. 

           Stepan puts Dmitry’s pages on the table. Dead silence.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        ...Stepan. Two hundred and six? I-

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        No. This is, no. 

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Did you say two hundred and-

           Volkov stands up angrily. He snatches the paper.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        No! It’s not real! He made it up, 
                        he, he just made up names!  

                                 STEPAN
                        I needed new friends, right? 
                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Shut up! He didn’t win this, 
                        Captain, it’s a fake! The list’s a 
                        fake, he knew I’m up to 98 so he-

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Senior Lieutenant.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        This cocksucker cheated! It’s not 
                        real! He’s lying, he-

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Senior Lieutenant Volkov, step 
                        outside! That’s an order!

           A beat. Volkov throws the paper to the floor and storms out. 
           Stepan sits down in his chair as Tyruin picks up the pages.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN (CONT’D)
                        ...you got this from interrogation?

           Stepan nods. The Captain picks up his phone and dials.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN (CONT’D)
                        (Into the phone)
                        Records and registry. I’m coming.

           He hangs up. 

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN (CONT’D)
                        He could be right, you know. We 
                        have to run a file search, 
                        determine if the names are real. 

                                 STEPAN
                        And if they are? Do I win?

           The Captain lets out a little laugh. He turns to go.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Wait here, don’t go anywhere near 
                        Volkov. You want a drink?

           Stepan shakes his head. Tyruin reaches the door, then stops.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN (CONT’D)
                        Look, this doesn’t mean we don’t 
                        still have to talk about the-

                                 STEPAN
                        Get out of here.

           Tyruin leaves, closing the door.
           Silence. Calm. Stepan looks down at the blood on his hands, 
           then shifts in the seat and closes his eyes. He sleeps.

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           The sunlight has turned a deep color. It’s afternoon now. The 
           Captain shakes Stepan, waking him.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Senior Lieutenant. Wake up. 

           Stepan opens his bloodshot eyes. Tyruin stands before him, 
           offering the receiver to a phone. Stepan takes it.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...yes?

           Commissar Yezhov’s voice comes on the phone.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (ON PHONE)
                        Comrade Stepan, this is the 
                        Commissar. I have someone here with 
                        me who wishes to speak to you.

           A pause. There’s the sound of a phone passing hands. A new 
           nasally VOICE speaks, thick with a Georgian accent. 

                                 STALIN (ON PHONE)
                        ...do you know who I am?

           Stepan sits up in the chair.  

                                 STEPAN
                        Yes, Comrade. 

                                 STALIN (ON PHONE)
                        On behalf of the Soviet people and 
                        myself I would like to congratulate 
                        you and thank you for your service.

                                 STEPAN
                        Thank you, Comrade.

           The voice hangs up. Stepan hands the phone by to Tyruin. The 
           two men stare at each other. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - LOCKER ROOM - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           Stepan stands before a mirror in the locker room, washing the 
           blood from his hands. He studies his tired reflection.

           He turns off the sink and keeps looking at himself. Slowly, 
           something grows across his face. A small, subtle grin.
           INT. LUBYANKA - HALLWAY - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           Now dressed in his street clothes, Stepan emerges from the 
           locker room. He stops immediately. 

           The hallway is crowded, packed to capacity with OFFICERS and 
           SERGEANTS. They’re all staring at him. 

           No one speaks. Suddenly someone begins to clap. Another joins 
           in, and then the entire hallway erupts in roaring cheers.

           Smiling, Stepan moves through the crowd. People are hugging 
           him and slapping him on the back. Ilych slides close.

                                 ILYCH
                        (Shouting over crowd)
                        Is it true? You really talk to 
                        Stalin on the phone? 

           Stepan laughs and turns to leave. Ilych stops him. 

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        Dispatch just announced you won, 
                        they’re gonna give you the Order of 
                        Lenin tomorrow. Where you going?

           Stepan doesn’t answer. He pushes through the cheering crowd 
           towards an exit. Someone begins to sing. Others join in.

                                 OFFICERS
                        THE ENEMY CRAWLS EVERYWHERE, BUT WE 
                        CHARGE WITH OUR SWORDS IN HAND!
                        WE ARE FIERCE, WE ARE PREPARED
                        TO HUNT THE MONSTERS FROM OUR LAND! 

           INT. LUBYANKA - MAJOR’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Dmitry lays on the floor, half-alive, his bloody burned back 
           covered in bandages. He can hear singing through the walls.

           Dmitry stares off into the distance with lost, vacant eyes. 
           Then, softly, he laughs.

           EXT. MOSCOW - SUNSET

           The sun dips over Moscow. Silence. Peace. A phone rings.

           INT. STEPAN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Stepan’s asleep, a phone ringing on his bedside table. He 
           moans and slowly answers it.
                                 STEPAN
                        ...Stepan Sergeievich.

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE)
                        Stepan, I’ve called three times!

           The baby rabbit rests in a shoebox matted with newspaper on 
           the bedside table. Stepan strokes her, his eyes closed. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Ilych? How’d you get my number?

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE)
                        Listen to me. We got a problem, a 
                        huge problem. The people on 
                        Dmitry’s list, they’re dead. All of 
                        them are dead!

           Stepan eyes snap open. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...what, what are you saying, dead? 
                        Are they shooting them? 

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE)
                        No! They’re already dead! Dead 
                        before we get there! Arrest teams 
                        are knocking on doors but there’s 
                        no one to arrest. They’re all dead.

           Stepan sits up, fear growing on his expression. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Ilych that’s not, not possible.
                        The Captain checked registry, 
                        they’re alive! 

                                   ILYCH (ON PHONE)
                        All the people Dmitry gave us, they 
                        all died within the last forty 
                        eight hours. Too soon for registry 
                        files to catch up. They died two 
                        days ago! How is that even 
                        possible? 

           Stepan thinks hard. He looks at the rabbit’s shoebox and the 
           torn scraps of paper inside. He takes in a deep breath.

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        ...Stepan? You there?

                                 STEPAN
                        Where are you?
                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE)
                        Staff office.

                                 STEPAN
                        Is there a morning edition around? 
                        Look for Truth.

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE)
                        What? Alright, hold on...there’s
                        one here, yesterdays paper, why?

                                 STEPAN
                        Open to the back. Look at the 
                        obituaries. Look at the names. 

           A pause. Silence on the line. Stepan’s fingers start to 
           fidget nervously. His breath quickens. Finally Ilych speaks.

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE)
                        ...it’s them. It’s the names. These 
                        are the names he used.

           Stepan’s hand tightens into a fist. He closes his eyes.

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        ...Stepan, I don’t understand.

                                 STEPAN
                        (Rising anger)
                        I gave him a copy of that paper at 
                        the interrogation. He memorized the 
                        obituaries and picked names that 
                        matched initials. He tricked us.

                                 ILYCH
                        No, he, he, couldn’t have, right?

           Stepan stands up, breathing hard and angry.

                                 STEPAN
                        Get me a car, I’m coming back.

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE)
                        Stepan.

                                 STEPAN
                        And get a room, I want him in a 
                        room when I arrive and ready, we-

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE)
                        Stepan, listen! You can’t 
                        interrogate him. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
                        His trial is over, it took five 
                        minutes, they did it before they 
                        sent the teams. He’s been 
                        transferred to sentencing. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Then get him off the train!

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE)
                        They’re not sending him to the 
                        camps! The Commissar got angry when 
                        he found out about the fake list. 
                        He called and ordered Dmitry shot.

           Stepan stops. His expression drops.

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        ...hey? You there?

                                 STEPAN
                        Shot, shot when?

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE)
                        In twenty minutes.

                                 STEPAN
                        Stop it. You have to stop it. 

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE)
                        I can’t stop it. It’s under 
                        Blokhin’s Administrative Executive. 

                                 STEPAN
                        You have to stop the execution, 
                        Ilych! The man’s still hiding the 
                        truth, we need him alive, damn it!

                                 ILYCH (ON PHONE)
                        It’s Commissar’s orders, I can’t!

                                 STEPAN
                        THEN FUCKING STALL THEM! NOW!

           Stepan throws the receiver and snatches up his clothes.

           EXT. MOSCOW STREET - SUNSET

           Now dressed, Stepan rushes out onto a crowded street. Cars 
           swerve to avoid hitting him, horns blaring. 

           A car breaks, stopping right in front of him. Stepan storms 
           towards the driver’s side, flashing his identification.
           INT. LUBYANKA - STAIRWELL - LATER THAT EVENING

           TWO WARDERS carry Dmitry down a set of stairs. He’s only half 
           awake and delirious from his burns.

           EXT. DZERZHINSKY SQUARE - LATER THAT EVENING

           Stepan drives the car up to a corner outside Lubyanka. He 
           climbs out and races towards the building’s entrance.

           INT. LUBYANKA - EXECUTION CELLAR HALLWAY - LATER THAT EVENING

           A DOCTOR, a female CLEANER, and a EXECUTIONER stand at the 
           end of a dark hall, waiting. The executioner calmly smokes.

           The warders enter, carrying Dmitry. The executioner drops his 
           cigarette, grinds it out, and opens the door to a room. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan rushes down stairs, shoving past a confused CLERK.

           INT. LUBYANKA - EXECUTION CELLAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Dmitry is sitting on his knees on a plastic tarp, the two 
           warders helping hold him up. The executioner steps up behind 
           him, drawing a T-T 30 automatic pistol. 

           Drool is coming down Dmitry’s mouth. He’s barely conscious.

           The executioner calmly puts the barrel to the back of 
           Dmitry’s neck. Dmitry takes a frightened breath. Silence. His 
           lips quiver, trembling. He silently whispers a name.

           The executioner fires. Dmitry drops to the floor. The doctor 
           steps in with a clipboard and inspects the body.

                                 NKVD DOCTOR
                        He needs another.

           The doctor steps aside. The executioner fires again. The 
           doctor checks the body then signs a clipboard. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - EXECUTION CELLAR HALLWAY - LATER

           Ilych paces nervously in the hallway beside the cleaner. 
           Stepan comes rushing down the stairs.
           Ilych puts a hand on him, blocking his path. Stepan tries to 
           push past but Ilych stops him. They look in each others eyes.

           Ilych shakes his head. Stepan backs off, breathing hard.

           The door to a cell opens. Out steps the executioner and 
           doctor. The executioner shoves Stepan’s shoulder as he 
           silently heads towards the stairs. Stepan stares at the cell.

           Out step the two warders, carrying Dmitry’s half-naked corpse 
           off into another room. Stepan kneels down, exhaling slowly.

           The cleaner enters the cell with her supplies, closing the 
           door. Stepan doesn’t speak. He doesn’t move. A long beat.

                                 ILYCH
                        ...the Commissar’s on his way back. 
                        Are we going to be okay?

           Stepan doesn’t answer. A long beat.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...the competition?

                                 ILYCH
                        They, uh...I’m sorry. They took the 
                        victory from you. 

           Silence. Finally Stepan shakes his head. He suddenly marches 
           towards the stairs. Ilych follows.

           INT. LUBYANKA - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan moves quickly down a hall, Ilych trailing him.

                                 ILYCH
                        Stepan? Stepan, where are you-

                                 STEPAN
                        There’s not a lot of time, Ilych. 
                        You’re going to have to do exactly 
                        what I say. Now-

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN (O.S.)
                        Comrade Lieutenant!

           The Captain appears behind them, angry. Stepan turns around.

                                 STEPAN
                        I’m a Senior Lieutenant, Captain.
                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Not anymore you’re not. I’m 
                        supposed to keep you here until the 
                        Commissar arrives tonight.  

                                 STEPAN
                        That’s not an option. I have to go. 

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Go? Where the hell do you think-

                                 STEPAN
                        The case. There’s still more work-

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        The case is over, Stepan!

                                 STEPAN
                        It’s not over. The accused lied to 
                        us, we still don’t know the names 
                        on that list, I have to find-

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        You have to keep your peasant ass 
                        here, damn it! You have any idea 
                        how much damage you’ve already done 
                        to my career? I’m not getting some 
                        Siberia transfer just because you-

           Stepan leans in close to the Captain, glaring. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...look at me. Look me in the eye, 
                        Captain. Your career is the last 
                        thing we have to worry about now. 
                        When the Commissar gets here he is 
                        going to kill me, and then kill 
                        Ilych, then he’s going to kill you 
                        for letting this happen. It’s going 
                        to be Old Bear all over again.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Mishin was a traitor.

                                 STEPAN
                        No he wasn’t.

           The Captain looks at Ilych, nervously. Stepan leans closer.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Lieutenant, I didn’t hear you say-
                                 STEPAN
                        (Whisper)
                        Captain, we need to be honest. The 
                        lieutenants. The competition. You 
                        know what’s really going on here.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Stop.

                                 STEPAN
                        (Even softer)
                        They’re clearing us out. Everyone 
                        who fought in the Revolution, 
                        everyone who was here before Stalin 
                        and Yezhov, they’re destroying all 
                        of us one by one. This isn’t a 
                        competition. It’s a purge.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        You just made yourself a dead man.

                                 STEPAN
                        I’m the only one? Why weren’t you 
                        promoted to Major? You were next in 
                        line, but Yezhov makes up this game 
                        instead? So where’s that put you? 

           The Captain shifts uncomfortably. He looks around.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        I have a wife. A little girl.

                                 STEPAN
                        I have to prove the list is real, I 
                        have to find the real traitors 
                        before Yezhov arrives. It’s the 
                        only way to save us. You going to 
                        stop me? 

           A beat. The Captain swallows, then points at Ilych.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        You heard nothing, understand?

           Stepan turns around and keeps walking. Ilych follows. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           Stepan opens his locker, reaches onto the shelf, and takes 
           something. He slips it in a jacket pocket. Ilych watches.
                                 STEPAN
                        I need you to wait here. If Yezhov 
                        returns before I do, you need to 
                        stall him, show him the evidence. 
                        You’re in this along with me.

                                 ILYCH
                        You think I don’t know that? My 
                        Raisa’s pregnant.

                                 STEPAN
                        We’re going to be fine.

                                 ILYCH
                        Those things you said to the 
                        Captain-

                                 STEPAN
                        We’re going to be fine. Just buy me 
                        time.

                                 ILYCH
                        For what? Where are you going?

           Stepan shakes his head and heads to leave. Ilych stops him. 

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        Stepan...good luck, Comrade. 

           INT. CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Stepan drives through dark rain, breathing heavy. He pulls up 
           to an apartment building. Dmitry’s building. 

           Stepan closes his eyes, sighs, then opens the door.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan rides the groaning elevator. He reaches into his coat 
           and draws the item he took from his locker. It’s his Nagant
           M185 revolver. He also has a fistful of bullets. 

           He snaps open the cylinder and starts loading the gun.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan moves down the hall with fast, hard steps, pistol in 
           hand. He comes to a door kicks it down with one brutal blow.
           INT. COMMUNAL APARTMENT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Stepan charges into the apartment, pistol raised. Husbands 
           and wives poke their heads out of bedrooms. Women scream.

           Stepan kicks open the door to Dmitry’s room. Yuliya is in 
           bed, in her pajamas, holding her daughter. The child starts 
           crying. Yuliya grabs her protectively.

                                 YULIYA
                        No! Please, don’t-

           Stepan takes Yuliya by the arm, dragging her away from the 
           girl and into the kitchen. Other wives keep screaming.

                                 STEPAN
                        SHUT UP! ALL OF YOU!

           People struggle to calm down. They put their hands up. Stepan 
           paces, seething. Suddenly he turns to the other families, 
           shows his identification, and motions to the door. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Get out of here. Go. 

           The families rush for the hall. As they head out Stepan spots 
           Irina, the informer, carrying her son. Stepan glares at her. 

           Once they are gone, Stepan turns back to Yuliya. Her daughter 
           has stepped into the kitchen, clutching her mother’s leg. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        (More calm)
                        ...put your daughter back in bed, 
                        then come out here immediately.

                                 YULIYA
                        What are you going to do?

           Stepan doesn’t answer. A beat.

                                 YULIYA (CONT’D)
                        Please, where’s Dmitry? What has-

                                 STEPAN
                        This city, it’s a city of liars. Of 
                        secrets. Your husband had secrets, 
                        and he had lies, and he’s almost 
                        ruined me with them. Not this time.

           Yuliya shifts, frightened. Stepan motions to the little girl.
           Trembling, Yuliya guides her daughter back into the darkness 
           of the bedroom. He hears Yuliya whisper soft words to her. 
           Finally she emerges, shaking, and closes the broken door.

                                 YULIYA
                        ...she hasn’t done anything wrong.

                                 STEPAN
                        I’m not here for her.

                                 YULIYA
                        I haven’t either. Please, I don’t-

                                 STEPAN
                        I’m going to ask questions now. 
                        You’re going to give me answers. If 
                        you lie to me, like your husband 
                        did, I will execute you right here. 
                        Do you believe I’m capable of that?

           She nods. Stepan motions to the kitchen table. She sits.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...alright. The list. How did he 
                        get it? What was your husband 
                        planning and whose names are on it?

                                 YULIYA
                        What list?

                                 STEPAN
                        I have to repeat myself? 

                                 YULIYA
                        What list? Please, I-

           He draws a copy of the soap list and slams it down, pacing.

                                 STEPAN
                        This list! The soap list!

                                 YULIYA
                        I, I’ve never seen this before! I 
                        don’t know what it is.

                                 STEPAN
                        What are the Polish planning? Why 
                        was it in his coat? 

                                 YULIYA
                        What? Whose coat?
                                 STEPAN
                        Dmitry’s coat! The one he made you 
                        give him. He has this hidden in his-

                                 YULIYA
                        That, no, it can’t-

                                 STEPAN
                        Stop it. You can’t trick me, not 
                        this time. Whose names are here?

                                 YULIYA
                        I don’t know this list! I don’t 
                        know these people. I don’t even 
                        know what language this is! I-

                                 STEPAN
                        You expect me to believe Dmitry 
                        kept you in the dark? About the 
                        list, about the passport, about-

                                 YULIYA
                        (Frightened)
                        The passport. Damian, he...

           Stepan stops pacing.

                                 STEPAN
                        Damian. Damian Zajac. The Pole, the 
                        dead Pole. How did you know him?

           Yulyia twitches. No answer. Stepan takes a breath then 
           suddenly grabs her hair, pressing the pistol to her head. She 
           screams with fear.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ANSWER ME, DAMN IT! WHO WAS HE?

                                 YULIYA
                        (Sobbing)
                        No! Please!

                                 STEPAN
                        I WILL KILL YOU! I WILL SHOOT YOU 
                        IN THE HEAD! WHO WAS HE? WHO WAS 
                        HE? WHO WAS-

                                 YULIYA
                        (Crying hard)
                        Dmitry’s father! He was Dmitry’s 
                        father!
           Stepan freezes, surprised. She keeps sobbing. Slowly he 
           lowers the pistol. Then he sees the daughter, Masha, standing 
           silently in the bedroom doorway. They stare at each other.

           INT. LUBYANKA - HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Commissar Yezhov marches down a hall, flanked by BODYGUARDS.

           INT. LUBYANKA - CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Yezhov charges into the Captain’s office. Ilych and the 
           Captain are waiting. They snap to immediate attention.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Comrade Commissar, good evening. I-

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        (Raging)
                        SILENCE! Worm! 

           Yezhov’s men pour into the room, forming a rigid line.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        Damn you, Captain, damn you all, I 
                        knew this department was filled 
                        with Yagoda’s snakes, I SHOULD HAVE 
                        KILLED YOU ALL! WITH FIRE!

           Yezhov spots a bottle behind the Captain’s desk. He rushes 
           over and grabs it, ripping off the cap. The Captain flinches. 

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what I’ve done? Because 
                        of you and this department of  
                        fucking monkey traitors? Do you? 

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Comrade Commissar, I-

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        I TOLD HIM!

           Yezhov swigs from the bottle then rants, his mouth dripping. 

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        (Almost crying)
                        ...I told him. I told our beautiful 
                        Comrade Stalin that we had a 
                        Lieutenant with two hundred 
                        traitors on a list. Now what do I 
                        do? Crawl back and beg forgiveness? 
                        NO! I WILL BRING HIM A CORPSE! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        A HUNDRED CORPSES! That fucking
                        Trotskyite Lieutenant attacked me, 
                        he lied to me, he shamed me, I WILL 
                        FLAY HIS SKIN- who are you?! 

           Yezhov hiccups and points at Ilych. The young man stammers.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Comrade, this is Junior Lieutenant 
                        Sidorov, partner to Lieutenant 
                        Lebedev and-

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        SHOOT HIM!

           The guards charge forward and grab Ilych. They drag him 
           towards the door. 

                                 ILYCH
                        Wait! Commissar, please!

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        (Raging)
                        Who sent you? Beria? Who gave you 
                        that fake list?

           The guards get Ilych to the door, but he keeps struggling 
           against them.

                                 ILYCH
                        Please! Listen! The names we were 
                        given on the list were false, but 
                        the list is real! The soap list, 
                        the code word boxes of soap, it- 

           Yezhov’s face suddenly goes pale. He shouts at the guards.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        Stop! 

           The guards stop, still holding Ilych. Yezhov approaches him. 

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        ...what did you say? Boxes of what?

                                 ILYCH
                        I, uh, soap, Comrade. The Polish 
                        list we found is coded with the 
                        words “boxes of soap”. There’s a 
                        translated copy in my suit.

           The Commissar opens Ilych’s coat and snatches out the list. 
           He reads it quickly, his eyes widening.
                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        ...an arrested man had this? A copy 
                        of this list? In Polish?

                                 ILYCH
                        That and a passport from a-

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        The passport is irrelevant. Where 
                        did he get this? 

           Ilych looks at the Captain, confused.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        ...Comrade Commissar, with respect, 
                        do you know something we don’t?

           Yezhov thinks. Suddenly he turns to his staff.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        Leave. Now.

           Yezhov’s men march out. Yezhov leans against the Captain’s 
           desk, his eyes on the list. He turns to Ilych and Tyruin.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        ...close the door, get me another 
                        drink. We have much to discuss. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Commissar Yezhov exits the Captain’s office. OFFICERS snap to 
           attention as he scuttles down the hall.

           Ilych and Captain Tyruin emerge from the office soon after. 
           They stare at each other. Ilych adjusts his suit.

                                 ILYCH
                        ...I’m going to need a team.

           INT. COMMUNAL APARTMENT KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Yuliya’s no longer crying. She’s calm and quiet. She sits at 
           the table, now holding Masha and rocking her to sleep. Stepan 
           stands nearby, the gun still in his hand. 

                                 YULIYA
                        (Quietly, calm)
                        ...Dmitry’s father, Damian, he was 
                        a writer. A thinker. He was born in 
                        Poland, but he wandered the world, 
                        even after he had a son. 
                                 STEPAN
                        Why?

                                 YULIYA
                        Damian told me once that back then, 
                        he was looking for something, 
                        something to believe in. He found 
                        it. In Zurich, he met a man, a 
                        Russian exile. He taught Damian to 
                        believe. Believe in a better world.

                                 STEPAN
                        Who was the Russian?

                                 YULIYA
                        Lenin.

           Stepan eyes widen. Yuliya rocks her child and continues. 

                                 YULIYA (CONT’D)
                        It’s true. They became friends, and 
                        when Lenin returned to Russia, 
                        Damian followed. He even brought 
                        his son, to a revolution. Dmitry 
                        was four. Spoke no Russian, knew 
                        nothing. He was terrified. We met, 
                        we both lived in the same building. 
                        We protected each other. Cared for 
                        each other. I taught him Russian.

                                 STEPAN
                        Stick to Damian. What happened? 

                                 YULIYA
                        He became a revolutionary. Gave 
                        speeches, tried to rally the 
                        Russian Poles. He supported the 
                        Bolsheviks, even after they 
                        attacked Vilna. Damian thought it 
                        was the beginning of a new world. 
                        No more racism. No more oppression. 
                        That’s what he wanted to believe. 

           Stepan says nothing. A beat. She continues.

                                 YULIYA (CONT’D)
                        We heard rumors. They were rounding 
                        up Poles. Putting them on lists. 
                        When Lenin died, and Stalin came, 
                        it got worse. Kirov. The end of 
                        NEP. Damian saw it coming. People 
                        started disappearing in the night, 
                        the Mensheviks, the originals, 
                        everyone who built the country. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 YULIYA (CONT’D)
                        Stalin, he was getting rid of them 
                        all. Like he didn’t want 
                        revolutionaries anymore.

           Stepan twitches. A beat.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...what happened to Damian?

                                 YULIYA
                        He changed. Started drinking. 
                        Stopped talking. He had been on 
                        committees. Given speeches. He knew 
                        it was just a matter of time before 
                        they came for him. Hell, they were 
                        going through the phone book, 
                        rounding up anyone with a Polish 
                        name.

                                 STEPAN
                        So he ran.

                                 YULIYA
                        He disappeared. Left Dmitry behind. 
                        The boy was fifteen, no money, 
                        alone, I was all he had left. We 
                        took care of each other. Never saw 
                        his father again. Even after Masha
                        was born.

           Stepan stares at the girl. 

                                 YULIYA (CONT’D)
                        ...for years we didn’t know what 
                        happened to Damian. Then finally a 
                        letter came in the mail. It said 
                        Damian had drunk himself to death 
                        halfway across the country. He left 
                        no note, nothing, but before the 
                        old man died he had put his rain-
                        coat in the mail with his passport, 
                        sent them both back to Dmitry. I 
                        guess it was his way of saying 
                        goodbye.

                                 STEPAN
                        With a list of traitors.

                                 YULIYA
                        If that list really was in the coat-

                                 STEPAN
                        It was.
                                 YULIYA
                        If it was, I never knew about it. 
                        Neither did Dmitry. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Yes he did. He knew what it was. He 
                        picked the coat, the night I 
                        arrested him. He took it with him 
                        like he was trying to get rid of-

           Yuliya laughs suddenly, a small bitter laugh.

                                 YULIYA
                        You want to know why he picked that 
                        damn coat? What I think?

           Stepan waits for her answer. A beat.

                                 YULIYA (CONT’D)
                        That coat was the only thing he had 
                        left of his father’s, that and the 
                        passport. He could never bring 
                        himself to get rid of either. I 
                        think my husband picked that coat 
                        because he felt that if he was 
                        wearing it, if he had it with him, 
                        he’d be a little closer to his 
                        father, when you killed him.  

           Stepan says nothing. Yuliya stares up at him, calmly. The 
           little girl is asleep in her arms. A beat.

                                 YULIYA (CONT’D)
                        ...Dmitry, he is dead, isn’t he?

           Stepan says nothing. She looks down, calm and still. Silence. 
           She closes her eyes. Stepan shakes his head. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...no, you’re lying, all of it. 
                        Dmitry’s records, none of it says 
                        he’s a Pole, nothing on Damian.

                                 YULIYA
                        Damian was a wanted man, it was 
                        dangerous to be his son. Dangerous 
                        to be Polish. So Dmitry changed our 
                        name. He paid two migrant workers 
                        to give us their identity cards. We 
                        became new people. That’s all.
                                 STEPAN
                        That’s not all. Dmitry was guilty 
                        of something. He was hiding the 
                        passport at work for a reason, he-

                                 YULIYA
                        He kept it at work so it wouldn’t 
                        be here if he was ever arrested. 

                                 STEPAN
                        No, he had it there because of the 
                        presses, he had the photo cut out.

                                 YULIYA
                        He cut it out so no one would 
                        recognize the family resemblance. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Don’t lie to me! He was guilty, he 
                        was sneaking onto the printing 
                        floor at night, I know he was, he-

                                 YULIYA
                        What, those nights? Those nights 
                        when he went back to the office?

           Stepan stares, waiting. She motions around the small room.

                                 YULIYA (CONT’D)
                        You see a typewriter here anywhere? 
                        Do you? He was going back there to 
                        work on a novel. A story about a 
                        young man who’s abandoned by his 
                        father. That’s it.

           A beat. Stepan rubs his temple. He shakes his head. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...this isn’t, no, it’s not-

                                 YULIYA
                        (Calm)
                        There wasn’t any conspiracy. If 
                        that list is real he had nothing to 
                        do with it. Dmitry wasn’t a 
                        traitor. And he wasn’t a criminal. 
                        All he was, the only thing, was the 
                        son of a dead man. And you killed 
                        him for it.  

           Silence. Stepan says nothing. He takes a step back, 
           accidentally knocking over a chair. He twitches, frightened, 
           then with fumbling fingers picks it back up and sits down.
           Stepan breathes hard. He still says nothing. He just stares 
           at her. Yuliya rocks her sleeping child back and forth. 

                                 YULIYA (CONT’D)
                        ...so what now? What do you do?

           Stepan remains silent. Suddenly a sound fills the room. The 
           groaning sound of a rising elevator. It comes to a halt.

           Stepan gets up, concerned. He slips the pistol into his coat 
           pocket. Footsteps echo down the hall outside.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan creeps into the hallway. He waits. Footsteps sound 
           from around a corner. They grow louder and louder until Ilych 
           appears. They stare at each other. A beat. 

                                 STEPAN
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 ILYCH
                        What are you doing here?

           Neither of them answer. Ilych stares at the broken door.

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        ...you came here? You came here to 
                        get answers? 

                                 STEPAN
                        I told you to stay for the 
                        Commissar.

                                 ILYCH
                        I did. He sent me. 

           A beat. Stepan processes this. 

                                 STEPAN
                        The Commissar sent you here? What’s 
                        happened?

                                 ILYCH
                        You, uh, you’re not going to 
                        believe it. You won’t.

                                 STEPAN
                        What? 

                                 ILYCH
                        It’s over. The case is over. We’re 
                        off the hook.
           Stepan blinks, confused. Ilych grins. He looks around, then 
           steps closer and whispers.

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        He knew. The Commissar knew. Boxes 
                        of soap, he knows what they are.

                                 STEPAN
                        What are they?

                                 ILYCH
                        You don’t want to know.

                                 STEPAN
                        What are they? 

           Ilych puts a fingers to his own lips, quieting Stepan. 

                                 ILYCH
                        (Whisper)
                        You’re missing the point. It 
                        doesn’t matter anymore. The case is 
                        over, and the Commissar, he wants 
                        to reward us for finding this list. 
                        All we have to do is destroy it. 
                        The  case, the copies, our files, 
                        every lead, every piece of 
                        evidence, he wants every record of 
                        this soap list gone. Once that’s 
                        done, we’re free. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...free.

                                 ILYCH
                        Can you believe it? I thought we 
                        we’re done for, Stepan, it’s over.

                                 STEPAN
                        (Stunned)
                        I don’t, I don’t believe.

                                 ILYCH
                        Your copy of the list, give it.

           Stepan takes it out and hands it to him. As he does the young 
           man suddenly grabs him, pulling him into a laughing hug. 

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        ...Comrade, it’s over. You’re going 
                        to get your transfer, I’m going to 
                        get promoted. 
                                 STEPAN
                        (In shock)
                        I...the list, there’s another copy 
                        in the glove compartment, I think, 
                        the, the Pobeda. 

                                 ILYCH
                        Yeah, I got it already. All that’s 
                        left is the reference in the 
                        judiciary stack, and the woman.

                                 STEPAN
                        What woman? 

                                 ILYCH
                        The wife. Dmitry’s wife. We got to 
                        bring her in. 

           Stepan takes a step back, confused.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...what do you mean?

                                 ILYCH
                        What do you think? Yezhov’s orders.

           A beat. Stepan turns and heads down the hall to a little 
           window. He stares out at the raining street bellow. 

           A truck’s parked on the curb. TWO SERGEANTS huddle in the 
           rain beside it, with PPD-40 submachine guns on their backs.

                                 STEPAN
                        ...you brought a team?

                                 ILYCH
                        Why do you think I’m here? I came 
                        for the woman.

                                 STEPAN
                        But she, she’s not a part of the 
                        case. She doesn’t know anything.

                                 ILYCH
                        Yezhov’s orders. She’s the wife, 
                        she’s connected, he wants it all, 
                        evidence, suspects-

                                 STEPAN
                        (Strong, hard)
                        She’s not a suspect. 

           The tone takes Ilych by surprise. A beat.
                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...we got it wrong. Dmitry. The 
                        case. We got it all wrong.

                                 ILYCH
                        We got many things wrong. This is 
                        our chance to make it right.

           A beat. Stepan shifts nervously.

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 STEPAN
                        ...we don’t have to take the woman, 
                        right? We can leave her.

                                 ILYCH
                        No, we can’t. We have orders.

                                 STEPAN
                        Ilych it’s not, we can’t! It’s not, 
                        it’s not right.

           A beat. Ilych blinks. His voice grows angry.

                                 ILYCH
                        ...not what? After the things I 
                        watched you do. The things you made 
                        me a part of.

                                 STEPAN
                        Ilych-

                                 ILYCH
                        You brought me into this, you 
                        realize that, right? I had my own 
                        plans, but you made me buy into 
                        your bullshit, and look where that 
                        led us!

                                 STEPAN
                        That’s not my-

                                 ILYCH
                        You put me in danger. My wife in 
                        danger. You almost brought down the 
                        whole damn department, for what? 
                        Volkov was right about us.

                                 STEPAN
                        No, we, we thought we had a case! 
                        We were following leads, the list-
           Ilych lets out a cold laugh. Stepan stops.

                                 ILYCH
                        ...you want to know what it is? 
                        What that list really is?

           Stepan says nothing. Ilych steps closer, whispering.

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        Boxes of soap is an old code word 
                        from our own department telegraphs. 
                        That’s how Yezhov knew what it 
                        meant. We made that list. Not 
                        Damian, he just found it, and 
                        rewrote it in Polish. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...what does it mean?

           Ilych doesn’t answer. Stepan closes in, angry.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Ilych, what are the boxes of soap?

                                 ILYCH
                        (Angry whisper)
                        They’re corpses. A box of soap is a 
                        dead body.

           Silence. Stepan’s face twists. He stares at Ilych, waiting.

                                 ILYCH (CONT’D)
                        Those initials on the list? They 
                        aren’t people’s names. They’re 
                        towns. Cities. Villages, the first 
                        and last letter of each. They all 
                        line up perfectly with the places 
                        Damian went with that passport. 

           Stepan steps back. He closes his eyes, pain running over his 
           expression. He rubs his face and closes his eyes. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...Savala. Savala village.

           Stepan closes his eyes. A wind blow through the hall.

                                 ILYCH
                        You get it now, don’t you? Damian 
                        didn’t have a list of traitors. He 
                        had mass graves, where we executed 
                        traitors during the Civil War. 
           Snow begins to fall from the ceiling. The hallway begins to 
           fade around Stepan, the walls melding into a dream.

           EXT. WINTER FIELD - DREAM 

           Stepan now stands in the frozen field, his eyes still closed. 
           YOUNG SOLDIERS all around him drag PEASANT WOMEN towards the 
           barbed wire fence. The women scream but the world is silent. 

           Stepan says nothing, his eyes still shut. The peasant women 
           are being silently lined up against the barb wire. Soldiers 
           are forming a firing line before them, loading rifles. 
           Ilych’s voice enters the dream.

                                 ILYCH (V.O.)
                        Now you understand? The list, the 
                        woman, they all have to go.

           The soldiers aim their rifles. A young, freezing OFFICER 
           steps forward.

                                 ILYCH (V.O.)
                        We have to get rid of this. 

           The officer gives a silent order to his men to fire. Stepan 
           opens his eyes. The dream suddenly disappears. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan is standing back in the hallway, opening his eyes. He 
           sighs, nods, and puts his hands in his pockets. 

                                 ILYCH
                        We’re taking the woman. I’m sorry, 
                        Comrade...sooner or later, you meet 
                        the wolves.

                                 STEPAN
                        (Calm)
                        ...you’re right. You do.

           A gunshot suddenly goes off. Ilych’s shoulder erupts in blood 
           as Stepan opens fire from within his jacket pocket. 

           Ilych crashes backwards. Stepan pulls the smoking gun out and 
           walks over to the window. He looks down at the street. The 
           sergeants are racing inside, loading their submachine guns. 

           Ilych lets out a moan of pain. Stepan calmly walks back over 
           to him and searches his suit. He pulls out Ilych’s knife and 
           tosses it away, then takes back the soap list. Finally he 
           draws Ilych’s TK pistol. Stepan now has a gun in both hands. 
                                 ILYCH
                        (In agony)
                        ...what the hell?

                                 STEPAN
                        How many men, just the two 
                        sergeants? And the driver? 

                                 ILYCH
                        You shot me!

           Stepan puts a gun to his head. His voice is calm.

                                 STEPAN
                        How many men did you bring? Just 
                        the team?

           Ilych nods, grimacing in pain. Yuliya leans into the hall, 
           frightened. She gasps when she sees Ilych bleeding on the 
           floor. Stepan turns to her.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Get dressed, grab a coat, get your 
                        daughter. I’m getting you out of 
                        here. 

           She says nothing, staring at Ilych. Stepan shouts.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Look at me! There are men here for 
                        you. I think I can get you out, but 
                        we have to go. Now. 

                                 ILYCH
                        Don’t, he’ll get your kid killed!

           Stepan presses a pistol against Ilych’s wound. Ilych moans. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Yuliya, there’s no time. Decide. 
                        Are you leaving with them, or me?

           A beat. Yuliya nods then heads back into the apartment. 
           Footsteps are charging up a nearby stairwell.

                                 ILYCH
                        Can’t run. They’ll come after you.

                                 STEPAN
                        Yes. They will.
           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The stairwell door bursts open as the two sergeants enter the 
           hall, weapons raised.

                                 NKVD STAFF SERGEANT
                        Lieutenant! Junior Lieutenant!

           They head quickly down the hall and turn a corner. They find 
           Ilych bleeding on the floor where Stepan left him. 

                                 ILYCH
                        Behind you!

           The sergeants turn around just in time to see Stepan emerge 
           from a side corridor, both pistols raised. 

           The hall fills with gunfire. All three men start shooting at 
           the same time. The walls are sprayed with bullets and blood. 

           Within a matter of seconds it is over. Both sergeants hit the 
           floor dead. Stepan crashes down onto a knee, dropping his 
           pistols. He has a gunshot wound in his stomach. 

           He holds his wound, grimacing in pain. Yuliya slowly emerges 
           from the corridor Stepan appeared from, carrying her child 
           protectively. She stares at the carnage wordlessly. 

           Stepan takes a pistol and struggles to his feet. He locks 
           eyes with Ilych, who is still bleeding on the floor.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan rides the elevator with Yuliya, who is still carrying 
           her daughter. Stepan presses a hand to his wound and looks. 

           There’s no blood on his hand. It’s snow. He is bleeding snow. 

                                 YULIYA
                        ...why are you doing this?

           Stepan doesn’t answer. The elevator reaches the bottom.

           EXT. MOSCOW STREET CORNER - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan limps out into the rain, Yuliya following behind him. 
           The DRIVER is climbing out the truck, nervous and confused.

                                 NKVD DRIVER
                        ...Comrade? Where’s Lieutenant 
                        Sidorov? 
           Stepan draws his pistol, aiming it at the driver. 

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           The driver is now standing in the back of the truck where the 
           prisoners are usually kept, both his hands up. Stepan slides 
           shut the back door and locks it. He tosses the key in a 
           gutter then heads for his car. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Commissar Yezhov slams a phone down, in a rage. Captain 
           Tyruin, and Lieutenants Volkov and Nazyuta stand before him.

           Silence. A beat. Finally Yezhov begins to speak, 
           frighteningly calm. 

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        ...I want every district on alert. 
                        I want dispatch and deployment 
                        operating at maximum capacity. He 
                        has an hour head start. The capture 
                        of the traitor Stepan Sergeievich
                        is now our highest priority. 
                        Whoever brings him to me alive will 
                        be awarded the rank of Major. Use 
                        every tool. Look everywhere. Begin.

           INT. LUBYANKA - ARMORY - LATER THAT NIGHT

           SERGEANTS pull rifles off a weapon rack.

           INT. LUBYANKA - TELEGRAPH ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Female WORKERS are hard at work at a massive telegraph board, 
           pulling cables and talking fast. A male OFFICER paces nearby, 
           with a photograph of Stepan.

           INT. LUBYANKA - MOTOR POOL - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The garage doors open, revealing the raining night. Trucks 
           and sedans are racing into the storm. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - MEDICAL OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Two NURSES hold down Ilych as he screams in pain. A DOCTOR is 
           operating on his wound.
           INT. CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Stepan drives through the night, Yuliya sitting beside him, 
           her daughter in the back seat. His stomach is still bleeding. 
           He grimaces in pain. 

           A police car whips by with a blaring siren. Once the cruiser 
           is far away Stepan begins to speak. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...I think I have a way to get you 
                        out of the city tonight, but it’s 
                        dangerous. You’re a wanted woman 
                        now. You can’t go for the border. 
                        You have to avoid cities, towns, 
                        anything near an NKVD post.

                                 YULIYA
                        They’re everywhere. There’s nowhere 
                        to go. 

                                 STEPAN
                        Yes there is. There’s a village, by 
                        a river. It’s where I grew up. If 
                        my family is still there, they’ll 
                        protect you. 

                                 YULIYA
                        You’re joking.

           Stepan shakes his head. 

                                 YULIYA (CONT’D)
                        I’m not taking my daughter to some 
                        random farm. I won’t let her-

                                 STEPAN
                        No one in the department knows 
                        where I’m from. I’m just another 
                        peasant to them, from one of a 
                        thousand possible villages. They’ll 
                        never find the right one. The 
                        people there will protect your 
                        girl. It’s a good home.

                                 YULIYA
                        Dmitry was a good home.

           Stepan doen’t reply. Finally he reaches into his coat and 
           draws the soap list.  
                                 STEPAN
                        Dmitry’s father...Damian, when he 
                        left Moscow, he didn’t just 
                        disappear. He went looking. For the 
                        truth about...me. People like me. 
                        That’s why they want you now. 

           He offers her the list.

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        Hold onto this. When you’re old, 
                        have your daughter hold onto it. 
                        Damian, Dmitry, they would want you 
                        to have it. And for you to be safe.

           She stares at the paper for a moment, then takes it. 

                                 YULIYA
                        ...you still haven’t said why 
                        you’re doing this. 

           Stepan doesn’t answer. He parks the car outside an apartment, 
           and closes his eyes, wincing in pain. 

                                 STEPAN
                        ...wait here.

           Stepan opens the door, smearing blood across the handle. He 
           looks at his hands, then turns to Yuliya, strangely calm. 

                                 STEPAN (CONT’D)
                        ...I’m not cold. I’m not. 

           She says nothing. He climbs out of the car. 

           INT. STEPAN’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Stepan stumbles into his apartment, bleeding. He peels off 
           his jacket, grabbing a roll of gauze from the bathroom.

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           With his stomach wound now bandaged, Stepan moves with quick 
           purpose. He opens a map of the city, folding it to a certain 
           page as he searches for something. Stepan taps a spot. 

           He drops the map, then grabs a bag and darts through his 
           kitchen, stuffing bread, vegetables, and milk into the bag. 
           He bends over in pain, struggling to breathe. 

           Stepan opens a drawer, reaches inside, and takes out Dmitry’s 
           golden locket. He drops it in the bag, then zips it up. 
           His eyes turn to the baby rabbit, sleeping in the open shoe 
           box. He stares at it.

           The phone suddenly rings. Stepan’s eyes dart to the phone. He 
           doesn’t answer. It keeps ringing. Then it stops. 

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           The apartment’s front door is knocked down as a team of 
           SERGEANTS pour inside, weapons raised. Lieutenant Volkov 
           leads them. They do a quick sweep of the apartment. Stepan is 
           gone. No sign of him.

           Volkov’s eyes turn to the floor. He spots the small puddles 
           of blood. He paces through the apartment, following the 
           blood. He stops. He leans down.

           The discarded map is still sitting beneath the table. Volkov 
           picks it up, his face growing into a sharp grin.

           INT. LUBYANKA - STAFF OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The staff office has been turned into a war room. Maps of the 
           city are everywhere. OFFICERS are working overtime. 

           The Commissar is looking over a list with Captain Tyruin.

                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        ...because we don’t have the 
                        manpower for an entire city lock. 
                        We can’t seal every way out, too 
                        many, we have to find the right 
                        one, the one he’s going to use, and 
                        hit it with everything we-

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA (O.S.)
                        Commissar!

           They look up. Nazyuta is across the office, on a phone.

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA (CONT’D)
                        It’s Volkov. 

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           Captain Tyruin and Commissar Yezhov both have a receiver to 
           their ears, listening to Volkov on the line.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV (ON PHONE)
                        He was hurt, in a rush, left a lot 
                        behind. Clothes, money, there’s a 
                        shoe box with holes in it.
                                 CAPTAIN TYRUIN
                        Bastard stole my rabbit!

           INT. STEPAN’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Volkov is on the phone, holding the map. He’s grinning.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        But listen, he had a map here of 
                        Moscow central, and there’s a 
                        fingerprint, a bloody fingerprint 
                        on the map, over an industrial rail 
                        yard. Molokov Yards. 

           INT. LUBYANKA - STAFF OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Yezhov, the phone to an ear, snaps a finger at an officer.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        Molokov Yards! Security check, now.  

           He hangs up the phone, turns around, and spots Ilych standing 
           in the office doorway. Ilych is pale, his right shoulder and 
           arm are wrapped in a sling. 

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        Well. The young live. 

           Ilych says nothing. 

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        Hurts, doesn’t it? Being betrayed. 

           Ilych nods.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        Learn from this. Not every man is a 
                        true man. Some are cowards. Some 
                        are weak. It’s hard to tell which.

           An officer shouts, his ear to a phone.

                                 NKVD OFFICER
                        Molokov Train Yard, seven minutes 
                        ago the report line got a call. A 
                        witness reported a man in the train 
                        yard, limping, with a woman and a 
                        young girl. There’s a freight that 
                        leaves Molokov in ten minutes. 
                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        (Growing energy)
                        Stop the train. Alert everyone, get 
                        the dogs, dispatch, I want the 
                        girl, I want the mother, I want 
                        that drunken Yagoda worm brought 
                        WRITHING AND SCREAMING TO ME! NOW! 

           Officers start running for the stairs. Clerks begin 
           frantically dialing calls. Yezhov turns back to Ilych.

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV (CONT’D)
                        ...are you committed? Prove it. 

           Ilych turns to go, but stops and turns around. 

                                 ILYCH
                        What will you do? When we get him?

                                 COMMISSAR YEZHOV
                        (Calm, slow)
                        What will I do to the traitor? I 
                        will get a chisel and a hammer and 
                        make him my sculpture. Stepan 
                        Sergeivich will be art for the 
                        people when I am done.   

           A beat. Ilych turns and heads for the stairs.

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL TRAIN YARD ENTRANCE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A large dark train yard on the outskirts of Moscow. Silent 
           and calm. An empty phone booth sits nearby. Rain falls 
           softly.

           A fleet of NKVD trucks and cars pull quietly into the yard, 
           their lights off. OFFICERS and SERGEANTS emerge from 
           vehicles, carrying submachine guns and pistols. 

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL TRAIN YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Volkov, Nazyuta, and Ilych creep through the train yard, 
           pistols drawn. SERGEANTS with submachine guns follow them. 

           Ilych spots something on the ground. He stops the team. A 
           spot of blood is on the gravel. There is a trail of it 
           leading towards a cattle car compartment on a freight train. 

           Volkov nods. He gives a signal to the sergeants. They 
           converge silently on the train, weapons raised. Two sergeants 
           grab the freight door, ready to slide it open. 
           Silence. Volkov gives a nod. The sergeants slide the door 
           open with a screech of metal. The Lieutenants charge inside.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        NKVD! FREEZE!

           The interior of the cattle car is dark and silent. It is 
           empty, except for Stepan. He is sitting with his back against 
           a wall, drinking calmly from his flask. His stomach is 
           bleeding hard through his leather jacket. 

           Volkov, Nazyuta, and Ilych climb inside, pistols raised. They 
           look around, confused.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        ...where’s the woman? 

           Stepan says nothing. He grins. 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the woman?

           Stepan doesn’t answer. Volkov calls to the sergeants.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV (CONT’D)
                        Search the train. Bring her and the 
                        kid here.

                                 STEPAN
                        You’re not going to find them. 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        You sure? 

                                 STEPAN
                        You’re not going to find them, 
                        because they’re not here. 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        They’re here. We got a call. 

                                 STEPAN
                        (Amused)
                        You got a call? You mean, from that 
                        phone booth outside?

           Nazyuta lowers her pistol.  

                                 LIEUTENANT NAZYUTA
                        ...shit.
           EXT. MOSCOW RIVER - EARLIER THAT NIGHT

           Stepan, Yuliya and her daughter climb down a ladder built 
           along the side of a bridge. An industrial barge is flowing 
           down the river beneath them, passing beneath the bridge. 

           Stepan hands Yuliya the bag full of food and supplies. Then 
           he carefully draws the baby rabbit from his coat and hands it 
           to the little girl. The barge passes under the bridge.

           Stepan nods at Yuliya. She takes her daughter and jumps onto 
           the barge, landing atop a pile of cotton. 

           They land safely. Yuliya pulls her daughter close, then looks 
           up at Stepan. He watches her drift away, holding his stomach.

           INT. FREIGHT TRAIN CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The three Lieutenants stand before Stepan.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        ...no, bullshit. She’s here! There 
                        were leads at his place, the map, I-

                                 STEPAN
                        A lead? You followed a lead? We’re 
                        not detectives, you know.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        Shut up! Where is she?

           Stepan grins and drinks, blood running down his lips. Volkov 
           lowers his gun. Ilych’s hand shakes.

                                 ILYCH
                        Why’d you do it, Stepan? Tell me.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        We’re wasting time. Take him. The 
                        Commissar will get him to speak. 

                                 STEPAN
                        I’m not going to the Commissar.

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        You don’t have a damn choice!

                                 STEPAN
                        Volkov, you’re not listening. I’m 
                        not going to the Commissar.

           With his free hand Stepan starts to slowly reach under his 
           leg. Volkov and Nazyuta put their guns back up.
                                 ILYCH
                        Stepan, no. It doesn’t have to end 
                        this way.

                                 STEPAN
                        A lot of things didn’t have to end 
                        this way.

           Stepan locks eyes with Ilych. A beat. Stepan nods. They hear 
           the safety come off a pistol. 

                                 ILYCH
                        Stepan, no!

           Stepan draws his gun, aiming at Volkov. Before he can squeeze 
           the trigger Ilych fires, shooting Stepan in the chest. 

           Stepan drops the gun, dead. Silence. A beat. 

           Ilych’s hands are shaking. Nazyuta lowers her weapon. Volkov 
           drops his own and paces away in anger. 

                                 LIEUTENANT VOLKOV
                        ...shit! Fucking peasant!

           He climbs out of the train. Nazyuta sighs and follows him. 
           Only Ilych is left. His hands tremble. Slowly he lowers his 
           weapon and steps towards the corpse. He leans down, getting 
           close to the dead man’s face.

           A soft wind begins to blow. Snow begins to fall. Stepan opens 
           his eyes. Suddenly the train is gone.

           EXT. WINTER FIELD - DREAM 

           Stepan and Ilych now are in the frozen field. There are no 
           more soldiers. No more peasants. The fence is gone. The storm 
           is gone. It is silent, white, and peaceful.

           Still in the position he died, Stepan stares silently into 
           Ilych’s eyes. Slowly he reaches out a bloody hand, grasping 
           onto Ilych’s shoulder and using it climb to his feet. 

           Both men stand up. Stepan gives Ilych one last look, then  
           turns and starts to limp away towards the sunrise. 

           The wind and snow begin to envelop Stepan as he drifts into 
           the distance. Ilych is left alone in the field, his back 
           turned to us, watching as the older man fades away. 

                                                                THE END
