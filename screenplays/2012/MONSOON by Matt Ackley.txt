           The SOUND of RUNNING WATER...

           EXT. INDIA/NEPAL BORDER - DAY

           Scorching sun overhead.  Oppressively hot.

           A mile-long suspension bridge separates India and Nepal.

           MAX SMITHHAMMER (20’s, American), two 35mm cameras slung 
           over his shoulder, his Nordic body not designed for this 
           type of heat, photographs NEPALESE CHILDREN jumping into 
           the river as he crosses the bridge into Nepal.

           EXT. SUSPENSION BRIDE - DAY

           The KIDS on the bridge gather around Max, begging him for 
           money or to take their picture.

           Max crouches, using his one sleight of hand trick to pull 
           ONE RUPEE COINS out of the kids’ ears, handing them out.

           But it’s these boys who are pulling the sleight of hand, 
           purposely distracting Max as their friend slices the 
           strap to one of Max’s cameras and takes off with it.

                                 MAX
                        Hey!

           Max sprints down the narrow bridge after the kid, dodging 
           people, bicycles, and even the occasional cow.

           EXT. NEPAL/INDIA BORDER - DAY

           A single guard station.

                                 MAX
                        Stop that kid!

           The KID tries to duck past the check point, but a GUARD 
           grabs him.  Two other BORDER GUARDS quickly come over and 
           start hitting him with long wooden sticks.

                                 GUARD
                                 (to Max)
                        Sir, stay back.

           Max watches as the beating goes on uncomfortably long.

           Unable to intervene, Max lifts his lens and starts doing 
           what he was trained to - document.
           EXT. NEPAL BORDER - DAY

           A one room cement shack guards Nepal’s western border.

           Max, uneasy, cleans blood off his lens as one of the 
           GUARDS flips through his US PASSPORT.  The pages are 
           crisp, only a few stamps - Mexico, Canada, and India. 

                                 GUARD
                        This border is closed to tourists 
                        due to Maoist activity.

                                 MAX
                        I have a work visa from your 
                        embassy in Delhi.

                                 GUARD
                        Sorry.  Try back tomorrow.

                                 MAX
                        Tomorrow?  But I need to get to 
                        Rukumkot right away.  

           The guard looks up at the mention of Rukumkot.

                                 GUARD
                        Those cameras.  They are 
                        expensive, no?

           It takes a moment, but Max gets the message.  Not used to 
           paying bribes, he looks around before handing the guard a 
           FILM CANISTER with a thick roll of RUPEES hidden inside.

           SLAM!  The guard stamps Max’s passport: 

           Republic of Nepal - April 12, 2001

           EXT. BORDER - DAY

           Nepalese DRIVERS, their teeth stained red from years of 
           chewing betal nut, a local stimulant, wait for their 
           vehicles to fill up with goods and passengers.  

           Max approaches.

                                 MAX
                        How much to get to Rukumkot?

                                 DRIVER
                        Rukumkot?  You cannot go there.  
                        The police station was raided by 
                        Maoists last night.  Many were 
                        killed.  Some beheaded.
                                 MAX
                        I heard. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Sorry, Ji.  No one here will take 
                        you.  The road is blocked.

                                 MAX
                        How far is it?

                                 DRIVER
                        Fifty kilometers.

           A beat-up MOTORCYCLE leans against the wall by the 
           driver’s Jeep.

                                 MAX
                        How much for the motorcycle?

           EXT. MOTORCYCLE - MOVING - DAY

           The breeze brings instant relief from the thick heat and 
           humidity as Max drives along without a helmet.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           A sign marks the turn off to Rukumkot up ahead.  Max 
           pulls over.  He can see the military barriers and 
           NEPALESE SOLDIERS blocking the road North to Rukemkot.

           He looks out over the terraced rice fields, then again at 
           the road block, contemplating.  

           Max steers down the steep embankment and drives through 
           the rice fields to get around the road block.

           INT. RUKUMKOT POLICE STATION - DAY

           Smoke wafts through the exposed cells and rubble.  Army 
           trucks and SOLDIERS come and go.

           Max keeps to the perimeter, shocked by the smell and 
           graphic nature of the carnage.    

           Gaining his composure, Max starts photographing -- 

           SNAP: A dozen or more POLICEMEN lay motionless - stacked 
           like cord wood.

           SNAP.  SNAP:  The bodies of a few Maoist REBELS, some 
           just teenagers, are being thrown into a different pile 
           and burned.
                                 SOLDIER
                        You!  Stop!

           The soldiers point their machine guns at Max who raises 
           his hands.  

                                 MAX
                        Easy fellas.

           An OFFICER grabs Max’s camera, rips the film out.

                                 MAX
                                 (shocked)
                        You can’t do that.  I’m an 
                        American reporter.

                                 OFFICER
                                 (in Nepalese)
                        Load him in the truck.

           The soldiers grab Max, who resists getting man-handled.

                                 MAX
                        Let go of me.  I have a right to 
                        be here!

           The soldiers thrust Max into the back of the canvas-
           covered military truck.

                                 MAX
                        Okay, okay.  What about my bike?

           Inside the truck, the bench seats are lined with wounded 
           POLICE OFFICERS.  Their sunken eyes all stare up at Max, 
           obvious they were the losers here.

           Max takes a seat.  Offers one of them a smoke.

           EXT. KATHMANDU - DAY

           The capital of Nepal.  A blend of 13th century customs 
           and twenty-first century technologies.  Hindu priests and 
           cell phones.

           EXT. HILTON HOTEL - DAY

           VALETS watch curiously as the olive green military truck 
           drops Max and his motorcycle off in front of the five-
           star hotel.  

           Max, haggard, wheels his motorcycle over to one of the 
           valets, then walks into the lobby of the elegant hotel.
           INT. HILTON HOTEL - BANQUET ROOM - DAY 

           Max takes in the large banquet room that has been 
           converted into a working BULL PEN - desks, printers, fax 
           machines - and bustling with FOREIGN PRESS.

           Several fake backdrops of the Himalayan mountains are set 
           up for TV broadcasts against the far wall.

           PARKER (30’s, petulant) sits in front of a laptop at the 
           New York Times desk.

                                 MAX
                        Max Smithhammer.

                                 PARKER
                        You’re two days late.

                                 MAX
                        I got delayed at the border.

                                 PARKER
                                 (sarcastic)
                        Maybe that’s because there’s a war 
                        going on.

                                 MAX
                        I went to Rukumkot.

           This gets Parker’s attention.

                                 PARKER
                        And?

                                 MAX
                        They confiscated my film.

           Parker leans back in his chair, intertwining his hands 
           behind his head in about as demeaning a way as possible.

                                 PARKER
                        Different rules here.  Look.  I 
                        know your Charlie’s protégé, or 
                        whatever, but you’re working for 
                        me here and I don’t have time for 
                        initiative, alright?

                                 MAX
                        Sure.

                                 PARKER
                        What did you think you would be 
                        doing here exactly, Smithhammer?

           A rhetorical question, but Max can’t help himself...
                                 MAX
                                 (sarcastic)
                        I don’t know... reporting?

                                 PARKER
                        Well, here’s a news flash for you.  
                        No one gives a shit about Nepal.

                                 MAX
                        Then what are we doing here 
                        exactly?

                                 PARKER
                        Time, Max.  We’re doing our time.

           BULL PEN - NORTHEAST CORNER - MOMENTS LATER

           Max crosses the bullpen when someone catches his eye --

           CHARLIE BELL (40’s, British, handsome and knows it), a 
           BBC correspondent, does a live report against a fake 
           Himalayan backdrop.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        As Maoist rebels now control over 
                        a third of the country, King 
                        Birendra shows incredible 
                        restraint...

           A nearby TV monitor shows B-roll footage of KING 
           BIRENDRA, the King of Nepal, as Charlie reports --

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        The rebels’ top three demands are:  
                        Abolish the monarchy, write a new 
                        constitution, and immediately 
                        repeal the Mahakali Treaty that 
                        they claim allows an Indian 
                        monopoly over Nepal's vast water 
                        resources.

           Max, messing with him, purposely stands in Charlie’s line 
           of sight.  

           Charlie, composed, remains on point, fielding questions 
           from BBC London.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                                 (looks right at Max)
                        Right, Katherine.  
                                 CHARLIE BELL 
                        It would seem peculiar that water 
                        rights is third on their list of 
                        demands, but like in 1776 when our 
                        Yank friends sent their 
                        Declaration of Independence to 
                        King George, it was as much about 
                        throwing off economic shackles, as 
                        it was about personal freedoms.
                                 (almost flirtatious)
                        Thank you, Katherine.  This is 
                        Charles Bell.  BBC News.  
                        Kathmandu.

           A green light turns to red.  Charlie charges over.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        About time you showed up.  You 
                        look like shit.

                                 MAX
                        Nice backdrop.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        It’s a bloody inferno outside.  
                        Why suffer?  Shall we raise a 
                        glass to your first overseas 
                        posting?

                                 MAX
                        It’s eight AM.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Not in London.

           The charismatic Charlie drags Max away toward the hotel 
           bar leaving his crew to clean up the equipment.

           INT. HILTON BAR - DAY

           Max sits with Charlie.  Nepalese WAITERS wearing white 
           gloves hover.  

           Since they sat down, Charlie’s been eyeing an attractive 
           FRENCH CORRESPONDENT at the bar.  Nothing’s changed.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Jesus, Max.  You’re lucky they 
                        didn’t lock you up.  What did I 
                        tell you about Pulitzer fever on 
                        your first assignment?

                                 MAX
                        You did it.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Do as I say, not as I do.
           The drinks arrive.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        I’ve already cleared it with 
                        Parker to have you shoot the royal 
                        reception for the Chinese 
                        Premiere’s visit tomorrow night.

                                 MAX
                        What did you get me into here, 
                        Charlie?  Parker and Pageantry?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Relax.  It’s just temporary.  I 
                        have a three step plan.

                                 MAX
                        Just three?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        One, get you here.  Two, buy you a 
                        drink, and three...
                                 (Off Max’s look)
                        I’m working on it.  Getting you 
                        out of New York was the hardest 
                        part.  I had to trade in a lot of 
                        favors to get you here, you know.

                                 MAX
                        Look.  Charlie.  I appreciate it.  
                        Really, I do.  One more night of 
                        shooting people getting scraped 
                        off the pavement on the skin and 
                        skid beat and I...  I can never go 
                        back to that, ever.  But sitting 
                        around pool side drinking Mai Tais 
                        with guys like Parker isn’t 
                        exactly my style.

           Charlie admires the French Reporter who smiles back.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Don’t worry about Parker.  
                        Underneath all that gluttony are 
                        several skinny men trying to get 
                        out.  This is a cush posting. 
                        Enjoy it.  Before you know it, 
                        some bomb will go off in Pakistan 
                        and you’ll be on the first flight 
                        out of here.  Step three.

           Charlie waves for another round.  Max laughs, you can’t 
           get mad at Charlie and he did have a three step plan.
                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        In the meantime, talk to the ABS 
                        guy.  Australian.  He’s looking 
                        for a shooter.

                                 MAX
                        You mean one willing to actually 
                        leave the air-conditioning?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        The King’s son, Prince Dipendra, 
                        had a scandalous rendezvous with 
                        his girlfriend last year at the 
                        Sydney Olympics and the ABS wants 
                        a picture of the two of them 
                        together for a follow-up puff 
                        piece.

           Max gives a “I can’t believe I came half way around the 
           world for this shit” look.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        I know.  But it’s either that or 
                        sit around here with me getting 
                        sauced and admiring beautiful 
                        women.

                                 MAX
                        How do I find the prince?

           Charlie writes on the back of a card - hands it to Max.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        This number’s for a driver.  
                        Reliable.  The other is a heli 
                        pilot I use sometimes, an ex-pat 
                        who has his pulse on the city, 
                        knows how to find things, 
                        information.  He’s Irish and 
                        therefore unreliable.  Tell him I 
                        said as much.

           Max takes the phone numbers, happy to be doing something.

                                 MAX
                        Thanks, Charlie.  For everything.  
                        I’ll let you get back to...  work.

           Max leaves and Charlie goes over and joins the petite 
           woman from Le Monde.

           EXT. NARAYANHITY ROYAL PALACE - DAY 

           Max sits in the shade of his Nepali guide AMIT’s 
           rickshaw.  Waiting.
                                 MAX
                        I can’t take much more of this, 
                        Amit.

           Max slugs down some Himalayan bottled water.

                                 AMIT
                        Monsoons are coming, Ji.

                                 MAX
                        Not the heat.  The waiting.  This 
                        prince isn’t much of a morning 
                        guy, huh?

           A BLACK SUV with tinted windows pulls up outside a tan 
           building near the palace walls.

           Curious, Max lifts his telephoto lens --

                                 MAX
                        Amit.  What is that building over 
                        there?  The tan one.

           BAKER and JACOBS, suits and sunglasses, conspicuously 
           American, step out into the bright sunlight.

                                 AMIT
                        The Nature and Conservation Trust 
                        of Nepal.

           SNAP.  Max takes their picture.  Baker and Jacobs go 
           inside --

                                 MAX
                        A foreign non-profit?

                                 AMIT
                        No, Mr. Max.  It has been around a 
                        very long time.  The King’s 
                        brother, Gyanendra, is chairman.

           Three WHITE RANGE ROVERS emerge from the palace. 

                                 AMIT
                        Prince Dipendra.  He is coming.

           CLICK.  Max takes a picture of PRINCE DIPENDRA, 29, 
           stout, the next King of Nepal, as he throws handfuls of 
           RUPEE coins out the window of his SUV to the street kids.

           Max and Amit take off after the prince’s caravan, making 
           sure not to be spotted.
           EXT. CENTRAL MARKET - DAY

           Crowded bazaar.  Bustling.  The smell of spices and fried 
           foods fill the air.

           Max takes up position across the street from a cafe.

           EXT. FIRE & ICE CAFE - DAY

           Max, unseen, photographs Prince Dipendra with his 
           GIRLFRIEND, tucked in the back of the cleared out cafe.

           THROUGH VIEWFINDER - MAX TAKES THE OCCASIONAL PICTURE

           A CHAI WALLA brings the prince’s BODYGUARDS their tea.

           An AUBURN HAIRED WOMAN, shrouded in a head scarf, enters 
           the cafe.  

           She saunters past the bodyguards, who barely glance in 
           her direction.

           Curious, Max zooms in --

           He can’t see her face, but she appears European.  A small 
           PACKAGE in her left hand.

           CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.  Max fires away, burning film --

           She places the PACKAGE on a table and leaves.  No words 
           are exchanged.  A professional drop.

           Max’s film runs out.  He lowers his camera as she 
           disappears into the crowded market.

                                 MAX
                        Holy shit.

           Quickly packing up, Max takes off after her --

           EXT. CENTRAL MARKET - DAY

           Weaving through the throngs, Max follows her --

           On the fly, he changes out his roll of film and stashes 
           it under his baseball cap. 

           The woman moves fast, aware she is being followed.  Max 
           reloads.

           Locked and loaded, Max tries to get a photo of her face 
           before she ducks around a corner.  No luck.
           EXT. SPICE MARKET - DAY

           Waist-high mounds of cardamom, black pepper, jasmine.  A 
           thunder cloud of fragrance.

           Max spots her up ahead in the colorful alley.  A stout 
           SALT HAWKER gets in his way -- 

                                 SALT HAWKER
                        Sir, you buy from me.  Very fine 
                        salt.

           In a window REFLECTION, the woman sees Max is still 
           pursuing.  She takes off --

           EXT. NARROW STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Huge BRASS SPIKES, used to keep elephants out, adorn the 
           buildings of this part of the old city.

           Max stops at a juncture --

           A lone DONKEY licks gum off the street --

           SLAM!  Max is thrown up against one of the wooden doors.  

           A brass spike rips through his shirt, almost impaling his 
           spleen.

           Face-to-face with the woman, Max stares into her piercing 
           indigo-green eyes, wide with adrenaline.

           She holds a 12” CURVED KNIFE BLADE to his throat.

                                 AUBURN HAIRED WOMAN
                        Who are you?

                                 MAX
                        I’m a... journalist.

                                 AUBURN HAIRED WOMAN
                        Why are you following me?

                                 MAX
                        Prince Dipendra.  I saw you give --

           Max hesitates.  Feels her warm breath on his neck.

           She eyes his camera with the telephoto lens.

                                 AUBURN HAIRED WOMAN 
                        Expose the film.  Slowly.

           Max opens the camera.  Ruins the film.
                                 AUBURN HAIRED WOMAN
                        Now the other roll.

                                 MAX
                        What other ro --

           She presses the curved blade hard against his jugular --

                                 MAX
                        Okay.  Okay.

           Max reaches under his baseball cap and pulls out the roll 
           of film he stashed there. 

                                 AUBURN HAIRED WOMAN
                        Drop it.  On the ground.

           He does.  It bounces off the cobble street - just out of 
           reach.  Was it intentional?

           A flash of anger in her eyes.

           Guarded, she places the tip of the long knife directly 
           over his heart and takes a step back, holding it there.

           Max gets a good look at her now.  Definitely European, 
           maybe Russian or Italian descent.  Striking.

           She keeps her focus on Max as she stomps the roll of film 
           into the cobblestone alleyway.

                                 AUBURN HAIRED WOMAN
                        Why are you photographing Prince 
                        Dipendra?

                                 MAX
                        A story.

                                 AUBURN HAIRED WOMAN
                        Find another one.

           In a quick motion, she knees Max in the balls.  He drops.  

           She skewers Max’s telephoto lens on the elephant spike.  

           Glass rains down on him.  By the time he looks up --

           She’s gone.

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           Max picks up his cap (and pride) off the narrow cobble 
           street.  The lone DONKEY stares at him blankly.
                                 MAX
                                 (to Donkey)
                        Thanks for the heads up.

           Having learned his lesson in Rukumkot, Max shows the 
           donkey his sleight of hand trick, pulling the real roll 
           of film from his sleeve.

           INT. MAX’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Red Light.  Developing trays.  A makeshift darkroom. 

           TONGS swoosh a black and white photo in a chemical bath.

           Slowly the image starts to take shape.  The silhouette of 
           the Auburn Haired Woman comes into focus.

           Max notices something on her left hand.  It’s a small 
           tattoo of a SNOW LEOPARD.

           INT. TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT

           Same SNOW LEOPARD TATTOO magnified ten fold as a TATTOO 
           ARTIST examines the photo of it under a table-mounted 
           lens.

                                 TATTOO ARTIST
                        Very tight.  Wasn’t slung in 
                        Kathmandu.  Probably done in 
                        Tibet.  Maybe Lhasa.  Tibetan 
                        artist for sure.

                                 MAX
                        How do you know he’s Tibetan?

                                 TATTOO ARTIST
                        The style.  Plus every artist 
                        signs their work.  This one did 
                        not.  Buddhists.  No ego.

           Max thanks him and leaves.  A dead end.

           EXT. FIRE & ICE CAFE - DAY

           Max stakes out the same cafe as before.

           Prince Dipendra, bored, listens to his girlfriend drone 
           on, but Max is not focused on them.  He’s scanning around 
           for the Snow Leopard Woman.  

           No sign of her.

           The prince leaves and Max packs it in for the day.
           INT. THE BURREN - NIGHT

           A dimly lit Irish pub.  Mostly mountain climbers just 
           back from expeditions in here.  Max sips a beer in the 
           corner.

           YORK (50’s; grey ponytail; Irish accent) slides into the 
           corner booth across from Max.

                                 YORK
                        So Charlie’s sent me a Yank?  
                        Sorry I’m late.  Shuttling some 
                        boys back from Everest base camp.  
                        What can I do for you, Danny Boy?

           York calls everyone “Danny Boy.”  Max slides him the 
           picture of the Snow Leopard Woman with Prince Dipendra.

                                 YORK
                        Spying on the prince is one sure 
                        way to get castrated, lad.

                                 MAX
                        Tell me what’s happening in the 
                        photo.

                                 YORK
                        Public place.  Daytime.  His men 
                        are told not to look at her.

                                 MAX
                        What’s the package?

           York examines it more closely.

                                 YORK
                        Hard to tell.  A brick of Brown 
                        Kush perhaps.

                                 MAX
                        I’m trying to track her down.  
                        This is on her left hand.

           York closely examines the blown up picture of her TATTOO -

                                 YORK
                        Intricate work.

                                 MAX
                        She also carries a knife.  Curved.  
                        About this --

           Max gestures.
                                 YORK
                        Khukari blade.  Standard Nepali 
                        army issue.  Easier to track the 
                        tattoo.

                                 MAX
                        I went to every tattoo parlor in 
                        town.  They all say the same 
                        thing.  Tibetan artist, maybe done 
                        in Lhasa.

           York’s impressed.

                                 YORK
                        I have a few contacts in Lhasa.  
                        Give me a couple of days to ask 
                        around.

                        What you’ve really got to ask 
                        yourself, Danny Boy, is what’s 
                        this lassie have that no one else 
                        does?  Not even the Crown Prince 
                        of Nepal?

           EXT. NATURE CONSERVANCY - DAY

           Max stakes out the tan building.

           Baker and Jacobs exit.  SNAP.  SNAP.  SNAP.

                                 MAX
                        Definitely environmentalists.

           They get into their BLACK SUV and leave.

           Max, on his motorcycle, follows them --

           EXT. FORTIFIED BUILDING - DAY

           The black SUV pulls into an unmarked side gate of a 
           heavily fortified building. 

           Max slowly circles around the compound.  An American flag 
           and two uniformed MARINES come into view.

           Max, shocked, pulls over.  It’s the US EMBASSY.

           INT. THIRD STORY - US EMBASSY - LATER 

           BAKER (late 30’s, intense) and JACOBS (20’s, Midwest) 
           stand gazing out of a tinted third story window at Max 
           across the street waiting for them.
                                 BAKER
                        Find out who he is, and what he 
                        knows.

           Baker calmly studies Max through the bullet proof glass.

           EXT. ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT

           Red Carpet.  The immaculately clad NEPALESE ROYAL GUARD 
           line the palace stairs.  Swords drawn.  A King’s welcome.

           KING BIRENDRA (56, charismatic, keen intellect) and his 
           son Prince Dipendra stand stoically in full military 
           dress regalia to greet the Chinese PREMIERE.

           Max accompanies Charlie.  He takes photographs of the 
           arriving DIPLOMATS.

           He spots Parker and SNAPS his picture just to piss him 
           off.

                                 MAX
                        What do you know about the 
                        Nepalese Royal Family being 
                        involved in the heroin trade?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        They’ve been doing it for decades.

                                 MAX
                        Why hasn’t anyone ever run a story 
                        about it?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Max, the Royals own this country - 
                        the police, the military, the 
                        courts.  Best case scenario they 
                        would kill you, worst case you end 
                        up in some dungeon sipping chai 
                        through a straw for the rest of 
                        your miserable life.

           A helicopter lands on the front lawn.  Out steps the 
           King’s brother, GYANENDRA, making a splashy entrance.

           Max takes Gyanendra’s picture as he greets his brother.  
           No love lost between these two.

                                 MAX
                        Gyanendra.  Not King, but the 
                        kingpin.

           Charlie studies Max, he knows something is up --
                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        What have you been up to?

                                 MAX
                        Just doing a little digging 

           Charlie’s expression turns more serious --

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Maxwell, the Nepalese take their 
                        royals extremely seriously.  More 
                        seriously than we do, which is 
                        astonishing, you do see the guards 
                        with the large swords and 
                        automatic weapons, right?

           A Black limo pulls up and out steps the CHINESE PREMIERE 
           and his wife.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        You watch yourself, okay?

           Max purposely ignores Charlie for fun as he photographs 
           the Premiere walking up the red carpet to the salute of 
           the ROYAL GUARD.

           INT. PALACE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

           Several huge PORTRAITS of King Birendra’s predecessors 
           hang on the walls.  Not unlike what you find in 
           Buckingham Palace or the White House - a lineage of 
           lords.

           Charlie admires a portrait of a young Queen while Max 
           grazes at the buffet table.  Parker joins Charlie.

                                 PARKER
                        Charlie, there are a thousand kids 
                        each year trying to work 
                        freelance, what’s so special about 
                        this kid? 

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Remember the time and place you 
                        asked me that.
                                 (beat)
                        Maxwell is different.  He’s not 
                        just some adrenaline junkie 
                        looking for the quintessential 
                        combat picture, he’s extremely 
                        driven, in search of something 
                        else.

                                 PARKER
                        And what’s that?
                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Perfection.

                        Until he finds that, he’ll never 
                        be satisfied.

                                 PARKER
                        Why?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Because a photograph changed his 
                        life.

                                 PARKER
                        Really?  Which one?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Mine.

           EXT. HILTON POOL - 5 AM

           A passed out JOURNALIST snores loudly as he sleeps on one 
           of the lounge chairs.  Max, the only one up at this hour, 
           stands on the edge of the pool wearing swim trunks. 

           He dives and swims the length of the pool underwater.

           Max surfaces.  Rests on the side, looking around at the 
           opulence of the hotel, the snoring reporter.

                                 MAX
                        Fuck this.

           Max gets out of the pool and doesn’t look back.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN KATHMANDU - ESTABLISHING

           Narrow streets, tightly packed with all of humanity.  

           Max drives his motorcycle slowly through the chaotic 
           backpacker’s district, stopping in front of a dime-a-
           dozen Nepalese hotel:  The Hotel Shangri-la.

           INT. MAX’S ROOM - HOTEL SHANGRI-LA - NIGHT

           One notch up from a hostel.   

           Camera equipment, well organized, Max’s life blood, lives 
           on an end table inside two water-proof Pelican cases.

           Max finishes pinning several PHOTOS on the:
           WALL

           Organized like an investigative CRIME BOARD, most of the 
           pictures are of the Nepalese Royal Family:

           PICTURES WITH TITLES:  King Birenda, Prince Dipendra, 
           Prince Gyanendra.

           Also a picture of BAKER and JACOBS from outside the tan 
           Nature Trust building.  “CIA?  Buyers?” written across it 
           and a line linked to Gyanendra, the King’s brother, 
           chairman of the Nature Trust.

           A PVC TUBE is wedged across the bathroom door jamb and 
           Max starts doing pull-ups as he studies the wall of 
           photographs.  Amit enters.

                                 MAX
                        What did you find out?

                                 AMIT
                        Mr. York says the woman provides 
                        rich Chinese businessmen with 
                        exotic rarities.  Horn of rhino.  
                        Gall bladder of the bear.

                                 MAX
                        Aphrodisiacs.  What about heroin?

           Amit doesn’t know.

                                 AMIT
                        She owns a club in the red light 
                        district.  I have the address.

           Max stops doing pull-ups.  Just hangs.

                                 MAX
                        Here’s what we’re going to do.

           INT. PRIVATE CLUB - NIGHT

           Techno beats.  Black lights.  Could be in Miami or Rio if 
           it was not for the predominately Asian clientele. 

           Max, in more casual attire now, approaches the attractive 
           FEMALE BARTENDER.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Let me guess.  Guinness?

                                 MAX
                        Whiskey.  Double.  No ice.
                                 BARTENDER
                        Most guys off the mountain want 
                        the calories.

           Max does look like a mountaineer, broad shoulders, 
           athletic.  He places a hundred dollar bill on the bar.

                                 MAX
                        I’m looking for something to 
                        remember my time here by.

                                 BARTENDER
                        You and half the boys in this 
                        place.

                                 MAX
                        I was thinking of getting a 
                        tattoo.  Of a snow leopard.

           She looks Max square in the eye --

                                 BARTENDER
                        What you’re looking for is 
                        dangerous to your health.

           Then she intentionally glances upstairs, pockets the 
           money, and moves on down the bar.

           Max takes his drink --

           UPSTAIRS

           Circular booths line the outer walls.  Small private 
           parties.  Elite.

           Across the room, Max sees the Snow Leopard.  She’s 
           wearing a black thigh-high slit dress with exposed back 
           and joins a group of ASIAN BUSINESSMEN.  

           They bow to her in respect.  A deal going down and she’s 
           in charge.

           TWO SECURITY GOONS and a CONCIERGE approach Max at the 
           top of the staircase.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Can I help you?

                                 MAX
                        I’m with that party in the corner.

           A suspicious look.

                                 MAX
                        They’re clients of mine.  
                        Climbing.  I’m their guide.
                                 CONCIERGE
                        I highly doubt that.

           He nods to security.

                                 MAX
                        Hold on.  I’m leaving.

           Max scribbles a note on a PHOTO, folds it in half --

                                 MAX
                        Just give this to the woman with 
                        the green eyes.  She knows me.

           The Concierge reluctantly takes it over to her.

           She glances at AN ENLARGED PICTURE OF HER SNOW LEOPARD 
           TATTOO

           Written:  “You told me to find a new story.  You’re it.”

           Alarmed, she looks over, but Max is gone.

           EXT. PRIVATE CLUB - NIGHT

           Across the street in the shadows, Max sits on his 
           motorcycle, waiting.

           He sees the Snow Leopard, her legs mostly, getting 
           whisked away into the back of a WHITE RANGE ROVER.

           EXT. MOTORCYCLE - MOVING - NIGHT

           Max weaves through traffic.  Follows the Range Rover.

           Headlights FLARE in his rearview mirror as a SILVER 
           TOYOTA pick-up truck suddenly bumps Max’s back tire, 
           startling him.

           Max speeds up.  Tries to shake him.  The Toyota right on 
           him --

           No choice.  He has to let her go.

           Max threads between two cars, using a rickshaw as a pick.

           As Max weaves past it we realize it’s AMIT --

           Amit acknowledges Max and keeps following the girl while 
           Max zooms down an off ramp, luring them away.

           The Silver Toyota takes the bait, SWERVES across three 
           lanes of traffic, going after Max -- 
           EXT. OLD CITY - NIGHT

           Open market.  Imitation Gucci and pirated DVD’s.

           The Silver Toyota pulls along side Max, sideswipes him --

           Max dodges.  Swerves around a table --

           PEOPLE scatter --

           The Toyota takes out the table of DVD’s --

           EXT. MOTORCYCLE - MOVING - NIGHT

           Neck and neck.  

           A tunnel up ahead --

           Max can’t outrun the Toyota.  

           Being forced into a cement wall --

           An OPEN CANAL runs alongside the road.

           Max goes for it --

           EXT. OPEN CANAL - NIGHT

           Max lands.  Hydroplanes.  Recovers.  

           Pure reacting.

           Max ducks and disappears into a pitch black COLVERT --

           INT. COLVERT - NIGHT

           Dark.  Wet.  Tight.  

           No room to maneuver in here -- no room to breathe.

           The handlebars GRAZE against the sides of corrugated 
           metal --

           Max just hangs on --

           EXT. COLVERT - NIGHT

           Open air.  Water spills out of the round colvert.

           Max shoots out --
           Lands.  Eyes adjusting --

           Twenty yards.  A LOG JAM.  No time.  Nowhere to go --

           Max lays the bike down --

           Skin on cobble --

           Excruciating.  Slows him down some, but --

           Not enough as he slams into the debris pile.  Hard.

           EXT. CANAL - NIGHT

           Max lays face down in an inch of water.

           The Silver Toyota SCREECHES to a halt on a bridge 
           overhead.  The DRIVER, a large Tibetan, gets out and 
           peers down over the railing --

           Max slowly crawls out of the canal.

           He and the Tibetan stare at each other for a moment 
           before --

           Police SIRENS and RED FLASHING LIGHTS approach --

           The Tibetan watches Max hobble away into an alley --

           Another time.

           EXT. OUTSIDE KATHMANDU - NIGHT

           The WHITE RANGE ROVER with the Snow Leopard stops outside 
           a huge gate.

           Amit pulls over.  Pretends to buy some betal nut, a local 
           stimulant, from a small stand.

           He watches as the twenty-foot high wooden doors open and 
           the Range Rover pulls inside.

           INT. HALLWAY - HOTEL SHANGRI-LA - NIGHT

           Max, banged up, limping, and bleeding from a cut over his 
           eye, notices the door to his room is slightly ajar.

           INT. MAX’S ROOM - HOTEL SHANGRI LA - NIGHT

           Cautiously, Max opens the door --
                                 MAX
                        Amit?

           Instead, he’s surprised to find BAKER calmly admiring his 
           crime board on the wall.

                                 BAKER
                        Pretty impressive investigation.

           JACOBS closes the door behind Max.

                                 JACOBS
                        Rough night?

           Max finds it unsettling how unassuming they are being.

                                 MAX
                        I’ll live.  What do you want?

           Baker has the picture Max took of him and Jacobs outside 
           the Nature Trust.

                                 BAKER
                        I’m Baker.  This is Jacobs.  What 
                        if we were here to propose a 
                        mutually beneficial arrangement?

                                 MAX
                        What kind of an arrangement?

                                 BAKER
                        Perhaps we point you in certain 
                        directions, give a hand when we 
                        can, and if there is information 
                        that we could use, you share.

                                 MAX
                        You want me to be an informant?  
                        For the CIA?

                                 BAKER
                        More of a partnership, really.

           Max is dubious.

                                 MAX
                        Why me?

                                 BAKER
                        Call it serendipity.  Maybe you 
                        found us, maybe we found you.  
                        Mutual interests, what does it 
                        matter?

           Baker point at the wall of photos --
                                 BAKER
                        But what if I told you I could 
                        piece all this together for you - 
                        the heroin, the prince’s network, 
                        how he smuggles it into the US, 
                        all of it.  Not a bad story for a 
                        rookie reporter to break. 

           Max has the feeling they know a lot more about him than 
           he does them.

                                 MAX
                        What do you get out of this?

                                 BAKER
                        To be determined.  Call it an 
                        investment.

           Baker takes the picture of the Snow Leopard off the wall.

                                 BAKER
                        We can start with her.  Who is 
                        she?

                                 MAX
                        You tell me.

           Baker chuckles.  This kid has spunk.

                                 BAKER
                        Do you know where she is?

                                 MAX
                        Not yet.  Why is she so important?

                                 BAKER
                        You’re the investigative reporter.  
                        Investigate.

                                 MAX
                        Why should I trust you?

                                 BAKER
                        You shouldn’t.  But what else are 
                        you going to do, rot here, chasing 
                        your tail, or get in the game?

           Baker hands Max a 35mm CAMERA LENS.

                                 MAX
                        What’s this?

                                 BAKER
                        GPS BEACON.  Indestructible.  
                        Well, within reason.  Just take 
                        off the lens cap, and press here.  
                                 BAKER 
                        We can be anywhere in country in 
                        under an hour.  If you find her, 
                        press it.  That’s it.

           They stroll out, just like that, leaving Max alone, still 
           bleeding, staring at the GPS DEVICE in his hand.

           EXT. HILTON - DAY 

           HELI PAD.  York lands a Russian made MI-17 on the roof, 
           picking up Charlie and his CAMERA MAN.

           Max runs out, stays low, conscious of the propellers.

                                 MAX
                        I really need to talk to you!

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Going to have to wait.  Being 
                        charged by the hour.

                                 MAX
                        It can’t wait, Charlie.

           Charlie senses something is up.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        You have your gear?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                                 (to Camera man)
                        Take a day by the pool.  Full pay.

           Max loads up into the helicopter.  Acknowledges York.

           INT. HELICOPTER - MOVING - DAY

           York flies them over the lush forest of western Nepal.  
           Max and Charlie ride in back.

                                 MAX
                        I pursue the stories, if there’s 
                        information they want, we share.

           Max finishes.  Charlie, concern on his face, stares out 
           the open bay door.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Walk away, Maxwell.
                                 MAX
                        This could be bigger than breaking 
                        Iran-Contra, Charlie.  They 
                        wouldn’t have come to my room if I 
                        wasn’t close to something big.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Iran-contra?  And where’s Greg 
                        Webb now?  Unemployed and 
                        suicidal.  Leave it alone.  While 
                        you can still tell up from down.

           York hovers over a beautiful emerald green river.

                                 YORK (OVER HEADSET)
                        Mahakali dam site.   You can just 
                        make out where construction 
                        started before the rebels took 
                        over.  You got three minutes to 
                        get what you need before someone 
                        mistakes me for military and fires 
                        an RPG up my arse.

           Charlie points to what Max should photograph.

                                 MAX
                        What are these pics for?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        A source inside the summit talks 
                        told me that the Chinese Premiere 
                        and King Birenda discussed water 
                        rights.

                                 MAX
                        So?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        If it’s true, it would be the most 
                        drastic shift in Nepal’s water 
                        treaty with India in decades.  
                        Could start quite a flare up with 
                        India.

                                 MAX
                        A war?  Over water?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        They said the same thing about 
                        oil.

           Max leans out of the chopper off a harness.
                                 MAX
                        What I can’t figure out is why the 
                        CIA needs me to find the girl?  
                        They know she works with Dipendra.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        This is a deep, morally ambiguous 
                        hole you’re teetering above.  It 
                        starts out innocent enough, just 
                        sharing information, then one day 
                        they’ll want you to write 
                        something for them... maybe it’s 
                        true, maybe it isn’t.         

                                 MAX
                        Relax, Charlie.  You know I would 
                        never do that.

           York listens to Charlie and Max over the headsets while 
           he scans the tree line.  Hyper vigilant.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        If anyone ever found out, you 
                        would be putting every American 
                        journalist’s life in danger, 
                        accused of being a spy.

                                 MAX
                        Everyone already thinks we’re 
                        spies.  You taught me that.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Max, you need to listen to me, god 
                        damn it!

           This gets Max’s attention.  He comes back inside the 
           chopper.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        You’d never work as a war 
                        correspondent again, anywhere, 
                        ever.  Get it?!

                                 MAX
                        I’m not working as a war 
                        correspondent now!  I spent five 
                        years doing what I was told, 
                        taking the shit assignments, 
                        paying my dues.  Five fucking 
                        years of weather reports, car 
                        accidents, and the god damn Macy’s 
                        Day Parade.  
                                 MAX 
                        Now I get my shot, but I’m half-
                        way around the world shooting B-
                        roll of a river for a washed up 
                        lush who’d rather sit around 
                        telling war stories, trying to get 
                        laid, than growing a pair --

           Max stops himself short.

                                 MAX
                        I’m sorry, Charlie.  I didn’t mean 
                        it.  I just...  I can handle these 
                        guys.  You have to trust me.

           Silence.  Only the SOUND of the rotor blades overhead --

                                 YORK (ON HEADSET)
                        We good, gentlemen?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Yeah.  We’re done here.

           INT. OLD EMBASSY BUILDING - DAY

           A portrait of President George W. Bush hangs on the wall.  

           Jacobs and Baker pull up the Snow Leopard file on a flat 
           screen mounted on the wall.

                                 JACOBS
                        This is the first time she’s been 
                        seen since ‘98.  You want me to 
                        notify the Israelis?

                                 BAKER
                        Not yet.  Let’s see what this 
                        Smithhammer kid can do.

                                 JACOBS
                        A bit risky recruiting a reporter 
                        as an informant isn’t it?  The 
                        agency hasn’t been using them 
                        since the seventies.

                                 BAKER
                        And you believe that?

                                 JACOBS
                        Why him?

           Baker stares at the photo of a younger Kat on the screen.

                                 BAKER
                        Because she’d smell us coming a 
                        mile away.
           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF KATHMANDU - MORNING

           Amit’s rickshaw stops.  Max steps out with his camera. 

                                 AMIT
                        On the right.  Tall wooden doors.

           Max grabs his case of camera gear and crosses the street.

           EXT. VILLA - DAY 

           Max, nervous, steps up to the wooden gate.  Knocks.

           A small door swings open.  Ominous.  

                                 MAX
                        This was a terrible idea.

           Max steps through the door.  A large court yard with 
           several vehicles inside.

           The door slams shut behind him and Max is greeted by a 
           CLUB to back of the head.  He’s out cold. 

           INT. VILLA - DAWN

           DARKNESS.  The SOUND of flowing water.  Close.

           Max has CANVAS BAG over his head.  Two massive hands grab 
           his head and dunk him --

           UNDERWATER

           Max, hands tied behind his back, struggles for air.

           COURTYARD

           He’s yanked out of the water, the wet canvas bag sucked 
           into his wide mouth, making him choke.

           The sack is removed and Max’s eyes adjust to the morning 
           light --

           He takes in his surroundings.  A closed in courtyard. 
           Almost Spanish in design.  A Fountain.

           Across from him sits the Snow Leopard.  She wears a white 
           cotton dress that accentuates her contours.  Her real 
           name is KATRINA.  She goes by KAT.

           TENZIN, the giant Tibetan, takes up his periphery.  He 
           submerges Max again.  Pulls him back up --
                                 KAT
                        How did you find this place?

                                 MAX
                        Maybe your help is getting sloppy.

           Tenzin resents the comment.  When Max resurfaces Kat 
           flips through his passport.  A lot of BLANK PAGES.

                                 KAT
                        Tell me who you work for and what 
                        they want with me.

                                 MAX
                        I told you.  I’m a 
                        photojournalist.  I work for the 
                        New York Times.

                                 KAT
                        Why don’t you stay at the Hilton 
                        with all the other foreign press?

                                 MAX
                        I didn’t come to Nepal to drink 
                        and fuck.

           Kat has the picture/note Max passed her at the club.

                                 KAT
                        No.  You came for a story.

           Max teeters on the back legs of his chair, Tenzin’s left 
           hand the only thing between him and drowning.

           Kat likes him.  But needs to be sure.

                                 KAT
                        So you want to take my picture?

           Tenzin cuts Max loose.  Hands him his camera.

           Kat picks up an M16 assault rifle and starts walking 
           across the courtyard.

                                 KAT
                        Well, here’s your chance.  But I 
                        advise you.  Do not flinch.

           Unsure if he will be taking the photograph of his own 
           death, Max, nervous, raises his lens --

           THROUGH VIEWFINDER

           The American made M16 is aimed directly at him.  
           Max, adrenaline pumping, pulls focus on the barrel, then 
           her face.

           Kat FIRES --

           A BULLET grazes Max’s temple --

           Max starts shooting --

           The RAPPORT of the automatic rifle overrides the sound of 
           his camera’s motorized shutter --

           Cement chips fly off the fountain behind Max - raining 
           down on him as he holds his ground pretty well.

           Both are focused.  Pure concentration.  Almost erotic.

           Max’s film runs out.  Kat lowers her weapon.  

           She smiles.  It’s disarming.  

           Kat can tell from the slight tremor in Max’s hands that 
           he’s not used to gunfire, that he’s not military trained.

                                 KAT
                        You can’t fake reflexes.  Come, 
                        have some breakfast.

           Max notices the slight quiver in his hand.  Kat turns to 
           Tenzin.

                                 KAT
                                 (In Tibetan)
                        Leave now.  I’ll meet you there.

           Tenzin, sensing an energy, a spark, between these two, 
           yanks the roll of film from Max’s camera and crushes it 
           in his hand as he gets in his Silver Toyota and leaves.

           EXT. PATIO - DAY

           The lavish balcony overlooks all of the Kathmandu Valley.  
           Kat and Max sit for breakfast.  

           A GUARD has had a gun pointed on Max this entire time.

                                 KAT
                        What do you want from me?

                                 MAX
                        Access.  I’m investigating the 
                        heroin trade.  The royals.  It led 
                        me to you.  
                                 MAX 
                        My sources tell me you deal mostly 
                        in other goods so I thought maybe 
                        we can help each other out?

                                 KAT
                        And how do you propose to help me?

           Max lays out the pictures of JACOBS and BAKER.

                                 MAX
                        Do you know who these men are?

                                 KAT
                        Definitely American.  This one is 
                        former military.  Probably CIA.

                                 MAX
                        His name is Baker.  This one, 
                        Jacobs.  They’re looking for you.

                                 KAT
                        How do you know?

                                 MAX
                        They told me.

           This gets her attention.  She stands.  Meetings over.

                                 KAT
                        Kill him.

                                 MAX
                        Wait!

           She signals the Guard to hold --

                                 KAT
                        How do I know you didn’t lead them 
                        here?

                                 MAX
                        No!  They don’t know...  I came 
                        here to warn you.  To make a deal.

                                 KAT
                        But they know I am in Kathmandu  
                        because of you?

                                 MAX
                        Yes.  And I’m sorry about that, 
                        but, why would I come, I could 
                        have easily given them this 
                        address.

           Kat thinks it over.  Not good enough.  She gives a hand 
           signal and suddenly that BLACK CANVAS bag comes down over 
           Max’s head from behind --
                                 MAX
                                 (struggling)
                        No!

           Max is dragged away --

           INT. WHITE RANGE ROVER - MOVING - NIGHT

           Paved road.  Max rides in the backseat with his hands 
           bound.  The BLACK BAG still on his head.  

           He nervously reacts when the driver turns onto a dirt 
           Jeep path through the forest.

           EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT

           Headlights illuminate the open field carved out of the 
           thick jungle as MAHOUT TRAINERS ride on top of ELEPHANTS, 
           directing them to unload crates off flatbed trucks.

           Kat’s men, SMUGGLERS, disperse the contents onto pack 
           horses.

           The DRIVER hauls Max, hands tied behind his back, out of 
           the vehicle.  Takes the canvas bag off --

           ACROSS CLEARING

           An argument between Tenzin and TWO ARMED MEN erupts --

           Tenzin engulfs one in a massive bear hug.  Crushes his 
           rib-cage.  Drops him to the ground.  Dead.

           The other ONE goes for his gun --

           THWACK.  He falls.  Head shot.

           Max turns.  Kat is the shooter.  Swift.  Decisive.  
           Professional.

           He stares at her wondering if he’s going to be next.

           EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT

           The two dead men are whisked away while everyone gets 
           back to work.  Kat comes over --

                                 KAT
                        So what’s it going to be?

                                 MAX
                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about?!
                                 KAT
                        You want to see the drug trade.  
                        This is your chance.

                                 MAX
                        Or what?  End up like them?

                                 KAT
                        They were thieves.  I do not feel 
                        bad about killing people I can not 
                        trust.

                                 MAX
                        What do you feel bad about?

                                 KAT
                        Not killing them earlier.

           Tenzin approaches.  Scowls at Max’s presence.

                                 TENZIN
                                 (in Tibetan)
                        What is he doing here?

                                 KAT
                        When we are done with all this - 
                        people will need to know what 
                        happened here.

                                 TENZIN
                        No good can come of this.

           Max, aware they are discussing him, is more concerned  
           about the DRIVER riffling through his camera case.

           The driver says something to Kat and she pulls out her 
           Khukari knife, turns Max around.

                                 MAX
                        Look, I don’t know what he said, 
                        but --

           Kat slices the rope that binds Max’s wrists, freeing him.

                                 KAT
                        Last chance.

           EXT. RIVER VALLEY - DAY

           These valleys have their own scale.  Himalayan.  

           Max leads his horse up a narrow foot path along a steep  
           cliff to a river far below.  Not an experienced rider, 
           but he’s holding his own.
           EXT. BONGORI VALLEY - DAY

           Snowy peaks in the distance.  Max and Kat ride next to 
           each other, engrossed in a heated debate.

                                 KAT
                        Everything is a commodity.  You 
                        pedal stories of war and 
                        suffering, I smuggle drugs.

                                 MAX
                        Tell me about Prince Dipendra’s 
                        network?  Do you work for him or 
                        his uncle, Gyanendra?

                                 KAT
                        I don’t work for anyone.

           A juncture.  Kat directs her horse up toward the 
           mountains.

           EXT. WOODEN BRIDGE - DAY

           A rickety crossing.  The wood planked bridge creaks under 
           the weight of their pack animals. 

           A Tibetan RIDER turns to Tenzin.

                                 RIDER
                        Zampa iha Ghang.

                                 TENZIN
                        Zampa iha Ghang.

           The glacial rapids rage below them as they cross.  Max 
           looks down.  Instant death.

           EXT. RIVER CAMP - NIGHT

           Max eats alone.  Kat joins him.

                                 MAX
                        I think your man has a crush on 
                        me.

           Tenzin watches them even now.

                                 KAT
                        That’s just his way.  It’s not 
                        you.  He hates all Americans.

                                 MAX
                        Does he know many?
                                 KAT
                        His grandfather was trained by the 
                        CIA in the 1950’s.  They took 
                        about a hundred freedom fighters 
                        to Colorado.  Taught them to do 
                        missions into China.  Then Nixon 
                        came into power and wanted closer 
                        ties to China, so America left the 
                        Tibetan fighters high and dry.

                                 MAX
                        Three generations.  Wow.  That’s 
                        quite a grudge.

                                 KAT
                                 (with admiration)
                        He is the most stubborn man I 
                        know.

           Max can tell there is a history between her and Tenzin, 
           who glances at them jealously.

                                 MAX
                        Every time we cross a bridge the 
                        men say, Zam-pa-ee-ha-Kung.

                                 KAT
                        Kampa iha khang.  Bridges and 
                        temples.

           A curious look.

                                 KAT
                        Freedom fighters are superstitious 
                        about places of exposure.  Bridges 
                        and temples.

                                 MAX
                        Why temples?

                                 KAT
                        One entrance.  One exit.

                                 MAX
                        What about you?  You a freedom 
                        fighter?

                                 KAT
                        Everyone believes they fight for 
                        freedom.

           Kat stands.  Heads to bed.  Tenzin and Max both watching 
           her go.
           EXT. RIVER CANYON CAMP - MORNING

           Crisp blue-bird sky.  Gorgeous sunrise.

           Max, up early, leaves camp with his camera --

           EXT. RIVER - MORNING

           Cascades and clear pools.  Morning mist.

           Max stands on a granite boulder.

           He scans the canyon below, unwittingly finds --

           Kat, naked, bathing in an eddy.

           He keeps completely still as if he’s come across a rare 
           wild animal and doesn’t want to spook it.

           She’s gorgeous.  He’s breathless.

           Unable to resist, he raises his --

           VIEWFINDER

           Kat, topless, stands waist deep in the frigid pool --

           He takes a PHOTO.  Then another.

           Sensing, she turns and looks right at --

           MAX

           Caught.  Slowly he lowers his lens.

           KAT

           Bare breasts.  Goose bumps.  Piercing eyes.

           They stare at each other for another moment --

           Neither willing to break away from this erotic staring 
           contest.

           Kat, unabashed, exits the natural pool.  She grabs a 
           towel and dries herself in the warm sunlight.

           She looks up again, expecting Max to be watching, but 
           he’s gone.
           EXT. KAT’S TENT - MORNING

           Kat returns from bathing to find a single used ROLL OF 
           KODAK FILM resting on a flat rock outside her tent.

           She picks it up.  Smiles to herself.  A gentleman.

           EXT. FOREST CAMP - NIGHT

           Campfire.  Max drinks whiskey and plays a dice game with 
           several of Kat’s MEN.  They all speak in Tibetan until --

                                 TENZIN
                        She is not your type.

           Max is taken aback that Tenzin knows English.  He tries 
           to mask it by lighting a cigarette with a twig from the 
           fire.

                                 MAX
                        Kat told me you’re a freedom 
                        fighter?

                                 TENZIN
                        Tibet is our country.  Illegally 
                        seized by the Chinese.  In time, 
                        we will take it back.

                                 MAX
                        I thought Buddhists object to 
                        killing even a flea?

                                 TENZIN
                        Perhaps it is better to crush the 
                        flea so it will be reincarnated as 
                        a more enlightened being.

           The threat isn’t lost on Max.

                                 MAX
                        Smuggling animal parts in order to 
                        give Chinese businessmen hard-ons 
                        isn’t exactly what I call the 
                        enlightened path.

                                 TENZIN
                                 (getting pissed)
                        Westerners care more about saving 
                        trees than they do people.  Why 
                        are you here?  No one in America 
                        cares what happens in the 
                        Himalaya.

           Max stares into the fire.  Thinks before answering.  
                                 MAX
                        It’s my job to make them care.

           Tenzin rises.

                                 TENZIN
                        Then you are shit at your job.

           EXT. LUSH VALLEY - MORNING

           Striking camp.  Tenzin and Kat argue in Tibetan as they 
           pack up.  Max cleans his camera equipment, pretending not 
           to watch.  He has the GPS LENS in his hand, just in case.

                                 TENZIN
                                 (in Tibetan)
                        We should leave him here.  He’ll 
                        make people upset.

                                 KAT
                        You mean he makes you upset.

           His lack of response tells her he’s jealous.

                                 TENZIN
                        Why do you risk bringing him?

                                 KAT
                        He will be useful.

           Tenzin’s not convinced.  He knows there is more to it 
           than that.  He sees a spark in her when she’s around Max.

                                 TENZIN
                        You’re judgement is clouded.

           Kat kisses him on the cheek.  She switches to English --

                                 KAT
                        Trust me.

           Her kiss hurts Tenzin more than she will ever know.

           INT. OLD EMBASSY BUILDING - KATHMANDU - DAY

           Colonial design.  Modern amenities.  Baker interrogates a 
           petrified NEPALI TEENAGER.  Baker’s calm demeanor is 
           slightly chilling. 

                                 BAKER
                        Don’t you want to go to America?  
                        I can help with that.  Just tell 
                        me who your boss’s contacts are.
           No response.  Baker smiles.  He cracks open a COKE and 
           places it front of the young man.  Jacobs enters --

                                 BAKER
                        While I’m over there, I want you 
                        to write down every name and enjoy 
                        the taste of freedom.

           Baker places pen and paper on the table and joins Jacobs.  
           The kid eyes the SODA suspiciously.

                                 BAKER
                        Any word from Smithhammer? 

                                 JACOBS
                        He just disappeared.  No contact.  
                        You think he’s dead?

                                 BAKER
                        What about the girl?

                                 JACOBS
                        Langley’s sent the recent picture 
                        to Interpol and the Hong Kong 
                        office.  If she turns up, they’ll 
                        let us know.

                                 BAKER
                        Alright.  Keep a man at the hotel.  
                        I want to know as soon as 
                        Smithhammer returns.  If he 
                        returns.

           Baker turns back to the kid, who hasn’t written down a 
           single name nor touched the icy Coke.

                                 BAKER
                                 (to Jacobs)
                        What about Bell?

                                 JACOBS
                        Mahakali treaty.

           Real concern.

                                 BAKER
                        Alright, I’ll take care of it.

           Jacobs exits.  Baker calmly circles behind the kid.

                                 BAKER
                        Freedom is not given, it always 
                        has to be earned.

           Baker yanks back the boy’s head, starts pouring the Coke 
           down his throat, an impromptu waterboarding.
           EXT. BLACK MARKET - HIGH MOUNTAIN PASS - DAY

           18,000 feet.  Glaciers cover the vast Himalaya - home to 
           eight of the world’s highest peaks.

           Large canvas tents line the camp.  SMUGGLERS and their 
           goods come from as far as Turkey and Azerbaijan.

           Kat, Tenzin, and Max ride into the camp on horseback.

                                 KAT
                        These same sorts of trade outposts 
                        existed in the time of Genghis 
                        Khan.

           They ride through a gauntlet of suspicious stares.  
           Several acknowledge Kat as they pass.

                                 SMUGGLER #1
                        Zigsa.

           Kat nods.

                                 SMUGGLER #2
                        Zigsa.

           Max turns to Tenzin.

                                 MAX
                        Zigsa?

                                 TENZIN
                        It means snow leopard.

           Tenzin and the men stop.

                                 TENZIN
                        Stay near our camp.  No pictures.

                                 MAX
                        Whatever you say, boss.

           Tenzin suspiciously looks at Max, reaches over and takes 
           Max’s camera case.  He opens it.

                                 MAX
                        What do you think you are doing?

                                 TENZIN
                        I don’t trust you.  I will never 
                        trust you.

           Tenzin closes the camera case.  Instead of handing it 
           back, he rides off with it.  Max stares nervously after 
           him.
           EXT. SMUGGLERS CAMP - DAY

           A light dusting of snow accentuates the rocky terrain and 
           gathers at the base of the yurt-sized domed tents.

           Max chain smokes outside.  He goes to take a piss behind 
           a yurt and finds a MAN face down in the snow.

           He rolls him over.  He’s alive, just passed out drunk 
           from a rough night of drinking.

           A PISTOL in his belt.  Max looks around.  Clear.  He 
           takes the GUN and slips into the small of his back.

           EXT. SMUGGLERS CAMP - DAY

           Max wanders through the camp.  He notices Tenzin talking 
           with a tall TIBETAN GIRL, serving CHINESE SMUGGLERS tea.

           They guard several TIBETAN REFUGEE’s huddled around a 
           small fire. 

                                 MAX
                        They’re in pretty rough shape.  
                        Tibetan refugees?

                                 TENZIN
                        The journey from Lhasa is very 
                        difficult.

                                 MAX
                        What are they doing here?

                                 TENZIN
                        They’ve paid these men a 
                        lifetime’s wage to take them to 
                        India.

           The Tibetan Girl keeps looking over at Tenzin.

                                 MAX
                        You know her?

                                 TENZIN
                        She is my brother’s child.

           Max, shocked, notices the emotion in Tenzin’s voice.

                                 MAX
                        What will happen to her?

           Tenzin doesn’t answer.  His expression grave.  
           Several armed MONGOLIAN SMUGGLERS approach - heading 
           straight for Max.  Trouble.

                                 MONGOLIAN SMUGGLER
                        You are American photographer?

           Max glances at Tenzin for help, but Tenzin offers 
           nothing.  It was probably Tenzin who outed him.

                                 MAX
                        No camera.  See.  No problem.

                                 MONGOLIAN SMUGGLER
                                 (angry)
                        Not photographer?!

           Max realizes he’s stuck.  Perhaps the best defence is a 
           good offense --

                                 MAX
                        Yes.  Yes, I am.

           Several MORE SMUGGLERS circle around.  Tenzin just 
           watches, enjoying the show.  Max prepares for the worst --

           EXT. SMUGGLERS CAMP - DAY

           Tripod set up, Max frames a shot of a dozen SMUGGLERS 
           posing with their weapons.

           Max, in his element, has the Mongolian Smuggler adjust 
           his AK-47.

           EXT. SMUGGLERS CAMP - DAY

           Kat watches Max pack up his gear.  Sensing that he’s 
           being watched, Max turns around and catches her.  They 
           lock eyes.  The sexual tension between them palpable.

           She breaks off the staring contest and retreats inside 
           her tent, purposefully leaving the door flap open.

           INT. KAT’S TENT - NIGHT

           Max slips inside.  Kat gets dressed - her bare back 
           facing him.  She’s aware Max is there, but plays coy.

                                 MAX
                        Zigsa.

                                 KAT
                                 (doesn’t turn)
                        Don’t call me that.
           He starts lacing up the back of her corset-bra that 
           conceals her Khukari blade. 

                                 MAX
                        Why do they call you that?

                                 KAT
                        Up here it is believed that if you 
                        kill a snow leopard, then all of 
                        the leopard’s sins are transferred 
                        to your life.

                                 MAX
                        And you have a lot of sins? 

           She turns around.  Face-to-face.

                                 KAT
                        More than any man could bear.

           Her lips almost touch his.  He wants her.

                                 SMUGGLER #1 (O.S.)
                        Zigsa.  They are ready for you.

                                 KAT
                                 (to Max)
                        Time to see why I brought you 
                        here.

           Kat steps away and slips on her shirt.

           EXT. SMUGGLERS CAMP - NIGHT

           Stars only shine this bright in a handful of places on 
           earth.  The round canvas tents glow orange like giant 
           jack-o’-lanterns.

           Tenzin fumes seeing Max come out of Kat’s tent.  

                                 KAT
                                 (to Max)
                        Be polite and keep your mouth 
                        shut.  Got it?

           Max nods.

                                 KAT
                        Good.

           Kat and Max join a stoic Tenzin.  No words.  Tension high 
           between the three as they enter the biggest canvas tent 
           in camp.
           INT. CANVAS TENT - NIGHT

           A stout Mongolian named GHAN (50’s, wind-worn skin, 
           survivor) sits at a table across from Kat and Tenzin.  

           Ghan is guarded by a small ARMED ENTOURAGE as Tenzin’s 
           Niece serves him tea.  Tenzin opens a duffle full of 
           money.  A deal going down.

           Max observes silently from the entrance.

           Kat and Ghan speak in CHINESE.

                                 GHAN
                        So this is your American 
                        photographer?

           Tenzin glares, displeased both at Max’s presence and that 
           Ghan flaunts Tenzin’s Niece as his servant.

                                 GHAN
                        We were hoping the King would have 
                        sent his troops against the 
                        Maoists by now.  Be good for 
                        business.  But it looks like he 
                        seeks deals with China instead.  
                        Brave one this King.

                                 KAT
                        He is as self serving as the rest 
                        of us.  Shall we get to it?

           Ghan waves and a CRATE of American made M16 semi-
           automatic rifles are brought in by his men.  Her men 
           bring in the aphrodisiacs.

                                 GHAN
                        Tell the General we had some 
                        difficulty paying off Pakistani 
                        officials for these.  I’m afraid 
                        the price has doubled.

           Kat picks up an M16.  Evaluates it’s condition.

                                 KAT
                        I thought we were friends, Ghan?

           Ghan smiles.  Speaks in English for the first time.

                                 GHAN
                        Business acquaintances.

                                 KAT
                        He’ll pay it.  There is also the 
                        issue of the Tibetan refugees.  
                                 KAT 
                        In the future, please take better 
                        care of them. 

                                 GHAN
                                 (insincere)
                        We will try.

           Max, confused, realizes Kat is not buying heroin, but 
           trading aphrodisiacs for M16’s and Tibetan Refugees.

                                 KAT
                        And the girl.  She is Tenzin’s 
                        niece.  We would like her to be 
                        included with the others.

           A few of Ghan’s men noticeably shift.

                                 GHAN
                        She is not for sale.

                                 TENZIN
                                 (in Chinese)
                        This girl is disobedient.

                                 GHAN
                        She is Tibetan after all.  But I 
                        like her spirit.  And size.

           Ghan’s men laugh.  Tenzin stands.  Everyone’s sensors 
           tick up.

                                 KAT
                        Steady.

                                 TENZIN
                        I will give you the American for 
                        her.

           Max isn’t sure what’s happening but can tell things are 
           getting heated.  People glance at him.  Kat, surprised, 
           but contains it.

                                 GHAN
                        Why would I want that burden?

                                 TENZIN
                        He is worth ten times this peasant 
                        girl.

                                 GHAN
                        I don’t need the American 
                        government looking for him.  His 
                        wife on CNN.  Bad for business.

           Max hears the word “American” again and realizes they are 
           talking about him.
                                 TENZIN
                        No one knows he’s here.

           Ghan thinks it over.  Kat slides her hand into her jacket 
           pocket.

                                 GHAN
                        No deal.

           Tenzin takes a step toward Ghan --

           Ghan’s MEN go for their weapons --

           All hell breaks loose.

           A THUG leaps onto Tenzin’s back, knife drawn --

           Kat pulls a fresh CLIP from her pocket and before she can 
           load it into the M16 --

           BAM!  A shot is fired --

           Tenzin’s attacker drops dead --

           Kat reacts and shoots the shooter.  She realizes too late 
           it’s not one of Ghan’s men --

           It’s Max.

           Max stumbles back, stays on his feet.

           Kat whips her gun around, takes aim directly between 
           Ghan’s eyes.

           Everyone freezes.  Guns drawn.  The OK corral.

                                 GHAN
                                 (In Chinese)
                        Be still.

                                 KAT
                        Ghan, we are leaving the drugs and 
                        the guns, but taking the girl.  No 
                        one else dies tonight.

           She means him.

           No one moves.  Max, bleeding from his shoulder wound, gun 
           still drawn, provides backup.

                                 KAT
                        It’s a good deal, Ghan!

           After a long, tense few seconds, Ghan bursts out 
           laughing.  A hearty, guttural laugh.
                                 GHAN
                        See, I told you we are friends, 
                        Zigsa!  Only friends exchange 
                        gifts in this manner!  Go.  Take 
                        the girl.  She is ugly, anyhow.

           Everyone exhales.

           Tenzin, exits with his Niece, followed by Max and Kat, 
           M16 raised, who backs out of the tent last.

           EXT. SMUGGLERS CAMP - NIGHT

           Tenzin holds Max up, his labored breaths visible in the 
           cold night air.  Kat checks Max’s wound.

                                 KAT
                        No exit hole.

                                 MAX
                                 (stars spinning)
                        You lied.  There is no heroin.

                                 KAT
                                 (to Tenzin)
                        Get the horses.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - NIGHT

           Kat and Max ride together.  He is slumped over.  In and 
           out of consciousness.

           Silhouettes against the night sky.

           EXT. LAKE - MORNING

           They’ve ridden straight through the night.  A secluded 
           alpine lake up ahead.  Kat whispers to Max.

                                 KAT
                        Almost there.

           Max lifts his head --

           In the distance, perched on a cliff overlooking the 
           gorgeous lake rests a multitiered Tibetan MONASTERY.

           INT. MONASTERY - INNER COURT YARD - SUNSET

           They ride in.  Colorful prayer flags flap in the breeze.

           Max, his shirt drenched in blood, is barely conscious. 
           The head monk, LODAK (60’s, bald, tattoo on forehead) 
           greets them in the courtyard.

                                 KAT
                        Lodak.  Quickly.

           Lodak and several MONKS catch Max as he faints on the 
           dismount.  They rush him inside.

           INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

           Flickering candle light.  Max, sweating profusely, burns 
           with fever.  The monks FACES fade in and out.

           Kat THRUSTS pliers deep into Max’s shoulder wound.  

           Fishing around, she finally pulls out the bullet - it 
           CLINKS into a tin cup.

           INT. SPARSE BEDROOM - DAY 

           Max lays on a futon.  His shoulder wrapped in clean white 
           gauze.  He opens his eyes.  

           Disoriented.  He struggles to sit up.  Powers through it.

           Lodak comes in.  Smiles.  Very pleased.  Pours him some 
           thick, milky, yak butter tea.

                                 LODAK
                        Yak butter tea.  Drink.

           Max does.  Grimaces.  Lodak laughs. 

                                 LODAK
                        Good!

                                 MAX
                        Where am I?

           INT. MONASTERY COURT YARD - DAY

           Max and Kat walk.  He’s getting his color back.

                                 MAX
                        How long was I out?

                                 KAT
                        Three days.

           Several MONKS in red robes play basketball in the 
           courtyard, aggressively boxing each other out.
                                 MAX
                        What is this place?

                                 KAT
                        A safe haven.
                                 (beat)
                        Where did you get the gun?

                                 MAX
                        Off a drunk...  I just reacted.

                                 KAT
                        You’re lucky to be alive.

           Max notices that she doesn’t apologize for shooting him.

           PAGODA

           They walk past open doors.  Inside, several Monks give 
           and receive TATTOO’s.  Their bodies works of art.

           Max glances at Kat’s snow leopard tattoo.

                                 KAT
                        They are the best in all of Asia.

           Rounding the building, they enter the --

           GARDEN

           Monks cultivate beds of herbs.  They all smile at Max.  
           Many are missing some toes and fingers.

                                 MAX
                        You help a lot of these guys over 
                        the mountians?

                                 KAT
                        Some.  They did the hardest part.  
                        Leaving their country, their 
                        families behind.

           The way she says it feels very personal.

                                 MAX
                                 (realizing)
                        So you get smuggle aphrodisiacs 
                        from India, to trade for guns and 
                        Tibetan refugees from China?

                                 KAT
                        The guns are from Pakistan.

                                 MAX
                        And those go to?
                                 KAT
                        The highest bidder.  Right now, 
                        the Maoists.

                                 MAX
                        So you’re a middleman?

                                 KAT
                        Woman.

                                 MAX
                        All to pay for Tibetans to escape?

                                 KAT
                        You must be feeling better.  
                        You’re asking a lot of questions.

           He looks at her with a deeper appreciation as they walk 
           through the beautiful gardens.  

           Kat stops and picks a long BLACK POD off one of the 
           plants being cultivated.  It excretes a sticky black tar.

                                 KAT
                        This plant is extinct in the wild.  
                        Only grown here.  The sap is an 
                        addictive narcotic.  But too much 
                        and it’s a powerful psychotic.

                                 MAX
                        This is what you hand deliver to 
                        Prince Dipendra.

           She likes his investigative mind.  Tries not to show it.

                                 KAT
                        We have an arrangement.  I give 
                        him something no one else can, and 
                        he makes sure the royals stay out 
                        of my business.

           Several Monks grin at Max as they pass.

                                 MAX
                        Why are they all smiling at me so 
                        much?

                                 KAT
                        Because I’ve never brought anyone 
                        here before.

           That sits in the air for a moment as she walks away.  Max 
           watches her cross the garden.  Exquisite.
           EXT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Max returns to his room.  On the floor outside his door 
           he finds the single ROLL OF FILM - the one he took of Kat 
           bathing in the river - that he gave to her before. 

           He picks it up.  Smiles.  Goes inside.

           EXT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

           Monks eat and chat.  Quite a ruckus.  Max sits with 
           Lodak, who wears black Chuck-Taylor Converse hi-tops.

                                 LODAK
                        Katrina came to us addicted to the 
                        opium.  She had lost the will. 
                        Tenzin found and brought her here.

                                 MAX
                        Are her and Tenzin still...  ya 
                        know?

           Lodak drinks his soup.  Evades the question

                                 MAX
                        I saw Tenzin praying in the 
                        garden.  He’s Buddhist?

                                 LODAK
                        He is monk!

                                 MAX
                        But I saw him crush a man to 
                        death.

                                 LODAK
                        Tenzin follows doctrine of 
                        skillful means.  If mind is 
                        motivated by compassion, then you 
                        transcend all sins.

                                 MAX
                        So I can kill someone as long as I 
                        do it compassionately?

           Lodak shakes his head, no.

                                 LODAK
                        Mind must be motivated by 
                        compassion!  Here is story.  
                        Buddha meets robber who tells him 
                        that he will kill five hundred 
                        merchants today.  So, Buddha kills 
                        robber.  
                                 LODAK 
                        Takes on bad Dharma for killing 
                        one person, but saves robber from 
                        five hundred killings worth of bad 
                        Dharma.  Buddha kills robber out 
                        of compassion.  Saving merchants, 
                        bonus points.

                                 MAX
                        Sounds like the Buddha should have 
                        checked out what kind of merchants 
                        they were first.  

           Lodak’s laugh echoes through the dining hall.

           INT. MAX’S ROOM - MONASTERY - DAY 

           Max lays on his futon, writing in his notebook.

                                 KAT
                        How’s the shoulder today?

                                 MAX
                        I’ll make it.

                                 KAT
                        I brought you something.  To help 
                        with your circulation.

                                 MAX
                        Just as long as it’s not any more 
                        yak butter tea.

           Kat unties her silk robe.  Let’s it drop to the floor.  

           Her naked form steps onto his futon.

           INT. MAX’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Candles light the room sending shadows of their 
           intertwined, thrusting bodies, dancing across the walls.

           Max and Kat make love.  Wild.  Consuming.  Primal.

           Kat flips on top.  They climax and lay next to each 
           other, wrapped in silk sheets.

           Waiting right outside until they were finished, two YOUNG 
           MONKS open the door, delivering trays of food.  Max and 
           Kat crack up laughing, sightly embarrassed.  

           Famished, Max digs into the fruit.

                                 MAX
                        Why is Tenzin avoiding me?
                                 KAT
                        He is ashamed.

                                 MAX
                        Because I shot his attacker?

                                 KAT
                        He offered you to Ghan in exchange 
                        for his niece.

                                 MAX
                        But you stopped him?

                                 KAT
                        No.  I shot you.

           She smiles and rolls on top of him.  Pins his arms.

                                 KAT
                        What are you going to do about it?

           Playful.  A challenge.  They both know she could kill him 
           without too much trouble.

           Instead, she lets him roll on top of her, pinning her.

           EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY 

           Max, his shoulder still healing, plays one handed.

           Kat watches the game as Tenzin speaks with her in 
           Tibetan.

                                 TENZIN
                        King Birendra has officially 
                        endorsed the One China policy.

                                 KAT
                        I heard.

                                 TENZIN
                        Soon the King will force all 
                        Tibetans out of Nepal.

           The Monks are ferocious rebounders.  Max gets knocked 
           down.  Kat smirks.  Tenzin can see she is smitten.

                                 TENZIN
                        You are distracted.

                                 KAT
                        I am entertained.

           No reply.
                                 KAT
                        I’ll take care of it.  Is 
                        everything set?

                                 TENZIN
                        Yes, Zigsa.

           She looks at her dear friend.  Switches to English.

                                 KAT
                        You have not called me that in a 
                        very long time.

                                 TENZIN
                        It is best that I do.  Now.

           Tenzin doesn’t look Kat in the eye.

           Max stops playing for a second and looks over at Tenzin 
           and Kat.  There is an unrequited love here, unspoken, but 
           present.

           INT. MONASTERY - MAX’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Middle of the night.  Kat wakes with a startle.  Max, 
           lies awake next to her --

                                 MAX
                        Nightmare?

                                 KAT
                        Memories.
                                 (beat)
                        I used to dream in Hebrew, now 
                        only in English.  
                                 (beat)
                        Do you think you can ever truly be 
                        yourself in a different language?

           Max looks into her green eyes.  He’s falling in love with 
           her - he can’t help himself.

                                 MAX
                        I don’t know.

                                 KAT
                        You have no idea who I really am.  
                        What I’ve done.  What I am capable 
                        of doing.

                                 MAX
                        What do we ever really know about 
                        someone?

           He kisses her passionately and the sheets envelop them.
           INT. HILTON BAR - NIGHT

           Charlie sits at the bar.  A half drunk bottle of Grey 
           Goose sits in front of him.  Loud music permeates from a 
           private party where Kathmandu’s young elite come and go.

           Parker slides in next to Charlie, waves for another 
           glass.

                                 PARKER
                        Charlie.  What’s the occasion?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        I’m old and tired, Parker.  I 
                        don’t need an occasion.

                                 PARKER
                        I meant in there?

           A door to the private party opens as several beautiful, 
           hip, Nepalese WOMEN pass by the BODY GUARDS revealing 
           periodic glimpses of the debauchery inside.  Dancing, 
           drinking, and drugs.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Prince Dipendra’s cousin and fifty 
                        of his closest friends.

                                 PARKER
                        How’s that Mahakali piece coming 
                        along?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        The powers that be killed it.

           Parker raises his shot glass in a rare moment of 
           sincerity.

                                 PARKER
                        Hardest thing about this job... 
                        the vulnerability.

           He drinks.  Pours another.

                                 PARKER
                        And when I’m an editor someday... 
                        here’s to crushing the hopes of my 
                        reporters everywhere.

           They drink.

                                 PARKER
                        Where’s Smithhammer if he’s not 
                        off looking into the water story 
                        for you?
                                 PARKER 
                                 (snide)
                        Still searching for perfection?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                                 (covering)
                        Why?  You need him for something?

                                 PARKER
                        Just keep him out of trouble is 
                        all I ask.

           The door to the party opens again and Charlie and Parker 
           get a glimpse of Prince Dipendra and his COUSIN snorting 
           heroin off a glass table.

                                 PARKER
                        I knew I should have been a 
                        prince.

           INT. GARDEN - MONASTERY - NIGHT

           Kat and Max bathe in a large bamboo tub under the stars.  
           Steam comes off the water and their intertwined bodies.

                                 KAT
                        The royals are spoiled children, 
                        set on ruining their country. 

                                 MAX
                        King Birendra seems to be doing a 
                        good job of keeping civil war from 
                        breaking out.

                                 KAT
                        He is a politician who placates 
                        the Chinese by backing their 
                        Tibetan deportation policy.  It’s 
                        slaughter.  That is what this King 
                        supports.  That should be your 
                        story.

                                 MAX
                        Then why are you working for his 
                        son?

                                 KAT
                        Maybe the son would be better!

                                 MAX
                        So you brought me here to do a 
                        story on Tibetan refugees.

                                 KAT
                        You said you want to pursue real 
                        stories, important stories, that 
                        make a difference.
                                 MAX
                        I do, but I thought we had a deal?  
                        I warned you about those American 
                        suits and you show me the heroin 
                        trade.

                                 KAT
                        This is more important.  You’ve 
                        seen how much these people suffer, 
                        what they go through for freedom.

                                 MAX
                        You can’t save Tibet, Kat.

           A flash of anger.

                                 KAT
                        At least I’m doing something.  
                        What are the royals doing?  What 
                        are you doing?  Observing.  
                        Staying neutral.

                                 MAX
                        That’s the job.  To remain 
                        objective.

                                 KAT
                        There is no objectivity when it 
                        comes to genocide.  Being a 
                        journalist is just an excuse to 
                        never choose sides.

                                 MAX
                        I guess I could smuggle drugs and 
                        kill people.

           Kat gets out of her bath.  Steam off her skin.

                                 KAT
                        I kill when it is the only thing 
                        left to do.

           Kat walks away leaving wet prints on the slate courtyard.

           Max leans back and dunks himself, disappearing underwater 
           to bask in his stupidity.

           EXT. ALPINE LAKE - DAY 

           Wind whips across the crystal clear water.  The monastery 
           perched above him over a mile away.

           Max stands along shore, alone.
           He takes out the GPS DEVICE, rotating it in hand, feeling 
           it’s weight, contemplating.

           After a few moments, Max tosses it into the lake.

           EXT. MONASTERY - GARDEN - DAY

           Koi pond.  A FISH pokes its head up between two lily pads 
           eating a dragonfly.  SNAP.  Max takes its picture.  

           Max, looking healthy, takes PHOTOGRAPHS of the monks, 
           garden, the monestary.

           Kat leads two horses, fully saddled-up, toward him.

                                 KAT
                        What are you doing?

                                 MAX
                        I’ve been thinking.  I’m going to 
                        write about the Tibetan refugees, 
                        their journey.  Lodak’s been 
                        helping me.

                                 KAT
                        Good.  Now I won’t have to kill 
                        you.

           She mischievously smiles and mounts one of the horses.

                                 KAT
                        You ready?

                                 MAX
                        For what?

                                 KAT
                        Punishment.

           EXT. FOREST PATH - DAY

           Max grabs the saddle horn, hanging on, as his horse leaps 
           over a creek.

           Kat takes the lead - the better rider.

           Max’s horse reacts, gains.  Their horses rub shoulders --

           EXT. SECLUDED WATERFALL - DAY

           Horses graze.  Max and Kat swim naked under the falls.  
           The water and companionship washing away years of war 
           scars and loneliness.

           They look happy.  In love.

           EXT. WATERFALL - DAY 

           They lay on the grass.  Kat smiles and Max playfully 
           wrestles with her.  They’re obviously pretty smitten with 
           each other.  

           Max touches the SILVER LOCKET that hangs in the soft 
           grove of Kat’s neck.  A sepia picture of a woman inside.

                                 MAX
                        Your mother?

                                 KAT
                        Grandmother.  Taken two weeks 
                        before the Germans invaded Poland.  
                        She was sent to Aushwitz.

                                 MAX
                        She survived?

                                 KAT
                                 (proud)
                        No.  She escaped.  German guards 
                        would trade food for sex with the 
                        female prisoners.  One night she 
                        slit the bastard’s throat.  Walked 
                        to Romania.

           Max finishes examining the locket.  It returns to rest in 
           the cradle of her neck.

                                 MAX
                        You have her eyes.  Did you know 
                        her?

                                 KAT
                        She was murdered in front of me 
                        when I was six.

           Kat stares off into space, the image seared into her 
           memory, and Max sees something new in those beautiful 
           eyes - an unquenchable desire for revenge.

           INT. COURT YARD - MONASTERY - EVENING

           Tenzin is waiting for them as they arrive on horseback 
           from their picnic.
           Max watches Kat’s whole mood suddenly change as she talks 
           heatedly with Tenzin.  She comes over.

                                 KAT
                        Tenzin is going to accompany you 
                        back to Kathmandu.  I’ll meet you 
                        there.

                                 MAX
                        What’s going on?

                                 KAT
                        I’ll see you soon.

                                 MAX
                        Wait.  Tell me what’s going on.

           Kat rides off and Tenzin blocks Max from following her.

                                 TENZIN
                        It’s not of your concern.

           Frustrated, Max shoves Tenzin back and storms away.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - OUTSIDE OF KATHMANDU - DAY 

           Max and Tenzin ride in an open jeep along a deserted dirt 
           jeep trail.  Kathmandu can be seen on the horizon.

           INT. JEEP - MOVING - DAY 

           Max breaks the long silence.

                                 MAX
                        Kat told me you offered me to Ghan 
                        for your niece.
                                 (sarcastic)
                        Were you motivated by compassion?

                                 TENZIN
                        I see you learned something during 
                        your stay.

           Tenzin pulls over.   Max’s guard goes up.

                                 TENZIN
                        Get out.

           Max gets out of the jeep, starts pumping himself up to 
           fight the much larger Tenzin, but Tenzin stays in the 
           driver’s seat.
                                 MAX
                        If we’re going to do this, let’s 
                        do it!

                                 TENZIN
                        You are going to leave Nepal and 
                        never return.

                                 MAX
                        Or what?

           Tenzin pulls out the GPS DEVICE that Max threw into the 
           lake.  Max’s face is a mix of fight and flight.

                                 TENZIN
                        It is my job to protect her, even 
                        from herself.  If you try to 
                        contact her, I will tell her about 
                        this, and kill you.

                                 MAX
                        Why not kill me now?

           Tenzin reaches for something in the backseat, passes Max 
           his camera case.

                                 TENZIN
                        Make Americans see what is 
                        happening to my people.

           Tenzin ACTIVATES the GPS DEVICE, tosses it to Max, and 
           then drives away, leaving Max standing there, stunned.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - OUTSIDE OF KATHMANDU - DAY

           Two helicopters circle overhead.  Max squints up at them - 
           wind and dust blown down from the propellers - as 
           multiple SUV’s roll up on him from both directions 

           American and Indian OPERATIVES jump out.  Weapons drawn.

           Baker, not pleased, approaches Max.

                                 BAKER (V.O.)
                        Tell us where she is or --

           INT. OLD EMBASSY BUILDING - DAY

           Cupping his hand, Baker choke-holds Max from behind.  Max 
           gasps for air, trying hard not to black out.

           Jacobs intervenes.  Baker lets go.
                                 BAKER
                        Who is she working for?

           Max.  Poker faced.  Moment of truth.

                                 MAX
                        She’s nothing.  Drug smuggler.  
                        Works for herself.

                                 BAKER
                        You’re telling me that you spent 
                        the past three weeks with her and 
                        you have nothing for us?

                                 MAX
                        Sorry, Baker.  She’s gone.  What 
                        do you want me say?  No story.  
                        Why do you want her so bad?

           They can tell he’s not telling them everything.

                                 BAKER
                        Show him.

           Jacobs pulls out a BINDER.  Shows Max pictures of Kat’s 
           VICTIMS as he briefs from memory.

                        wanted for murder and treason.

           Max doesn’t want to believe him.  He looks away to cover 
           his surprise and feelings for her.

                                 BAKER
                        I thought we had a deal, Max?  Why 
                        are you protecting her?  

           Jacobs holds up the GPS DEVICE.
                                 JACOBS
                        Who’s prints are on this?

                                 MAX
                        I told you, it’s her associate’s.

                                 JACOBS
                        Where’s he? 

                                 MAX
                        I don’t know.

                                 JACOBS
                        Jesus, Max.  You must know 
                        something.

           After a long pause --

                                 MAX
                        Look.  I really don’t know where 
                        she is.  I haven’t seen her in 
                        days.  If this helps, her 
                        associate is Tibetan.  His name is 
                        Tenzin.  Big guy.  Barrel chest. 
                        Deals in black market goods in the

                                 JACOBS
                        See, that wasn’t so hard, was it?

                                 MAX
                        Can I go now?

           Baker, back to Max, stares out the window.

                                 BAKER
                        Your passport.  Leave it on the 
                        table.  You can come get it in a 
                        couple of days if this Tibetan 
                        pans out.

           Max leaves it, heads toward the door.  He eyeballs the 
           thick binder on Kat as he passes.  Once Max leaves.

                                 BAKER
                        Put a tail on him.  Twenty-four 
                        hour surveillance.  And find this 
                        Tibetan.  Tonight.

           EXT. KATHMANDU - ROOF TOP CAFE - DAY

           Popular night spot.  Overlooks Kathmandu City.  Heat 
           lightning flashes against a purple sky.
           A half a dozen empty beer bottles rest the table.  Max 
           and Charlie have been here awhile and are pretty drunk.  

                                 MAX
                        ... and now I’m pretty sure I’m 
                        being followed.

           Max finishes his tale.  Stares out over the vast city --

                                 MAX
                        Go ahead, Charlie.  Just get it 
                        over with... Tell me I told you 
                        so...

           After a long beat, Charlie’s expression softens --

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Better to have loved and...

           GUN FIRE erupts a few blocks away.  

           Max and Charlie leap out of their seats.

           MORE GUNFIRE.  Flashes.  Tracer bullets.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        It’s coming from the Royal Palace.

           Without another word they sprint for the stairway --

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Leaping from Amit’s rickshaw before it fully stops, Max 
           immediately starts taking photographs as SEVERAL BODIES 
           are being wheeled inside the emergency room.

           Charlie and Max try to enter, but SOLDIERS block their 
           path.  

           They wave their PRESS PASSES and bully their way forward.

                                 MAX
                        We’re the press!  We have a right 
                        to go in there!

           Inside Max sees King Birendra laying prone on a gurney, 
           two bullet holes in his chest.  Several other DEAD BODIES 
           lay on the floor.

           A DOCTOR pulls back a WHITE SHEET.

                                 MAX
                        Holy shit.  It’s King Birendra.

           Max lifts his camera over the soldier’s heads.
                                 SOLDIER
                        No pictures!

           The soldier grabs Max’s camera.

                                 MAX
                        Hey!

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        BBC.  Let us inside.  Now!

           More SOLDIERS rush over and drag Max and Charlie away.

           Max screams at the OFFICER who rips the roll of film from 
           his camera.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Max and Charlie are dragged outside where they watch 
           SOLDIERS pour from trucks and set up barricades.  

           Charlie gets on his cell while he still talks to Max --

                                 MAX
                        You think it was the Maoists?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Or an internal Coup.
                                 (into phone)
                        Get your asses over to...
                                 (to Max)
                        Where are we?

                                 MAX
                        Trivander Hospital.

                                 CHARLIE
                                 (into phone)
                        Trivander Hospital.  The King has 
                        just been assassinated.
                                 (beat)
                        Of Nepal, you twit!

                                 MAX
                        Can’t be internal.  I mean, why 
                        assassinate the King and then try 
                        to save him by bringing him to the 
                        hospital?

           Overhead, BEATING propellers --

           A military helicopter lands.  Out steps --
                                 CHARLIE
                                 (into phone)
                        Gyanendra.  The King’s brother 
                        just arrived.  We’re missing great 
                        footage here!  Max, you getting 
                        this?

           Gyanendra, grim faced, is rushed inside the hospital.  

           SNAP.  SNAP.  SNAP.  Max still has his second camera.

           Soldiers force a belligerent Max and Charlie to move out 
           of the area as they create a wide protective swath around 
           the hospital.

           INT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT

           The bullpen buzzes.  REPORTERS all race to be the first 
           to scoop the story.  Who assassinated the Royal family?  
           Max works with Charlie --

                                 MAX
                        So all we know is that a few hours 
                        ago, the royals were having their 
                        monthly dinner, and now eleven of 
                        them are dead, including the King.  
                        And Prince Dipendra, even though 
                        he is in a coma with a bullet in 
                        his head, he was just named as the 
                        new King.  This is nuts.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                                 (to Assistant)
                        Get me the British Ambassador on 
                        the phone.

           Max studies a cork board with head shots of the eleven 
           Royal family members who were murdered tonight - very 
           similar to the layout on the wall of his hotel room.  

           Possible suspects’ PHOTOS are on the right with the 
           MAOIST rebel leader front and center.

           Parker calls over to Max --

                                 PARKER
                        Smithhammer, tell me you have 
                        prints from the hospital.

                                 MAX
                        Drying in the dark room now.
                                 (dishing it out)
                        But Parker, I thought no one gives 
                        a shit about Nepal.
           Parker, excited, slaps Max on the shoulder.

                                 PARKER
                        This is going to be our ticket out 
                        of here.  We might even make the 
                        front page.  Massacres always 
                        sell.

           Charlie, phone to his ear, is on hold.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                                 (to Assistant)
                        Any news on why the king’s brother 
                        wasn’t at tonight’s family dinner?

           A BUZZ of activity starts up across the room.  Charlie’s 
           other FEMALE ASSISTANT runs over --

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        What is it?

                                 FEMALE ASSISTANT
                        There’s a rumor that Prince 
                        Dipendra did it.  Killed everyone, 
                        then put a bullet in his head 
                        because the King refused to let 
                        him marry some girl.

                                 MAX
                        Devyani Rana.

                                 FEMALE ASSISTANT
                        How’d you know?

                                 MAX
                        She’s his girlfriend.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                                 (to Max)
                        You have pictures of Dipendra and 
                        the girl?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah.  Back at my hotel.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Go get them.  Right now.

           Max turns to go.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        And Maxwell.

                                 MAX
                        Yeah?
                                 CHARLIE BELL
                                 (sly grin)
                        Step three.

           Max smiles back, fuck’in Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                                 (into phone)
                        Cheers.
                                 (he hangs up)
                        I have independent confirmation.  
                        A palace guard saw Dipendra 
                        carrying an M16.  Direct quote, 
                        “his face was expressionless, like 
                        a mask, as he shot everyone.”

                                 FEMALE ASSISTANT
                        CNN’s running with it!

           Charlie, Max, Parker, everyone stops and watches --

           SEVERAL MOUNTED TV’s THROUGHOUT BULLPEN

           Clips of Prince Dipendra as a child playing with guns.

           TEXT AT BOTTOM OF SCREEN:  “Massacre at the Palace.”

                                 CNN REPORTER
                        With speculation swirling in 
                        Kathmandu as to the Regicide of 
                        the Nepalese Royal family, we are 
                        hearing reports that it was Crown 
                        Prince Dipendra, the King’s eldest 
                        son, committed out of a blind act 
                        of passion, before turning the gun 
                        on himself.  Prince Dipendra is 
                        currently in a coma with a single 
                        bullet wound to his left temple.

           BACK IN BULL PEN --

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                                 (to Max)
                        If you can get back here with the 
                        photos of the prince and his 
                        girlfriend within the hour, we can 
                        run them on BBC morning World News 
                        and you’ll still have them for the 
                        Times deadline.

           Max heads for the door.
           INT. AMIT’S RICKSHAW - MOVING - DAY

           As the city wakes to the news, people start streaming 
           into the streets.  Max stares out the window at people’s 
           reaction to the news.  Utter disbelief.

                                 AMIT
                        The entire country.  No one knows 
                        what to do with themselves.

           BBC plays on Amit’s radio.  Charlie’s voice --

                                 CHARLIE BELL (ON RADIO)
                        His face was expressionless, like 
                        a mask.  Then Prince Dipendra, in 
                        an attempt to take his own life, 
                        put his pistol to his left 
                        temple...

           EXT. CITY CENTER - DAY

           Thousands of MEN are queued up outside barber shops.  
           They pay their respects to the fallen King by having 
           their heads shaved.  A sea of baldness.

           Amit can’t get past.  The streets too packed.

                                 MAX
                        Wait here.  I’ll walk.

           INT. MAX’S ROOM - HOTEL SHANGRI-LA - DAY 

           Max riffles through the stack of the eight-by-ten prints 
           until he find the ones of Dipendra and his girlfriend at 
           the cafe.  

           He takes a moment to look at the ones of Kat and the 
           drop, seeing her much differently now.  

           He instinctively takes the photos of her out of the 
           stack, leaving them in his room.

           EXT. HOTEL SHANGRI-LA - DAY

           Max exits.  Makes his way through the hordes of mourning 
           Nepalese.

           Someone is following him.  A BLOND AGENT.  American.  One 
           of Baker’s men.  Max picks up the pace, weaving through 
           the crowded street.
           EXT. KATHMANDU - CITY STREETS - DAY 

           Max rounds a corner and SOMEONE in a GREY HOODIE grabs 
           him and pulls him into an open garage.

                                 GREY HOODIE
                        Be still.

           The BLOND AGENT passes by --

           INT. GARAGE REPAIR SHOP - DAY

           Kat lowers her hood.  Head shaved.  Her Auburn hair down 
           to a quarter inch like half the men in Kathmandu.  It 
           shows off her eyes even more.

                                 MAX
                        Kat, what’s --

           She kisses him.  He kisses back.  Passionate. 

                                 KAT
                        I wasn’t sure I’d see you again.

                                 MAX
                        Why?

                                 KAT
                        People are looking for me.  Those 
                        suits.  Looks like they are after 
                        you as well.

                                 MAX
                        What do they want?

                                 KAT
                        Sins past?  Sins present?
                                 (beat)
                        You need to destroy all ties to 
                        me.  Every picture.  Of Lodak.  
                        The Monastery.  No trace.  The 
                        negatives.  Where are they?

           Her eyes are constantly moving.  Scanning the crowd. 

                                 MAX
                        Safe.  In my hotel.

                                 KAT
                        Promise me you’ll destroy them.  
                        Get out of Nepal. 

           Kat sees something she doesn’t like out on the street.
                                 KAT
                        I’m sorry.

           She darts out into the crowd that lines King Birendra’s 
           funeral procession.

                                 MAX
                        Kat, wait!

           Max can’t stop himself.  He goes after her --

           EXT. STREETS - KATHMANDU - DAY

           All of Kathmandu seems to be out in the streets lining 
           the funeral route.  Over half a million PEOPLE.

           King Birendra’s body, wrapped in saffron cloth, is being 
           carried on an open platform.

           Max pushes through the crowd --

                                 MAX
                        Kat!

           Behind the King’s body, a covered Palanquin carries his 
           wife’s remains, too disfigured to be displayed openly.

           Max spots Kat for a moment before she disappears into the 
           carpet of bald heads that follows the procession.

           Thousands weep for their fallen King.

           Max pulls out his cell phone and calls --

           INT. RICKSHAW - MOVING - DAY

           Amit, weaving through the city.  Max rides in back, keeps 
           looking to see if they are being followed.  

           Military barriers block a lot of the streets. 

                                 MAX
                        Can you get to the Hilton?

           Amit takes a short cut.

                                 AMIT
                        No problem, Ji.

                        Gyanendra is about to make an 
                        announcement.

           He turns up the RADIO --
                                 GYANENDRA (ON RADIO)
                        In regards to the rumors of the 
                        tragedy that occurred last night.  
                        A report has come to our attention 
                        that an automatic weapon went off 
                        suddenly, seriously injuring King 
                        Birendra and several more of my 
                        immediate family.

                                 MAX
                        He’s saying Dipendra accidentally 
                        fired a machine gun that somehow 
                        killed eleven people?  That’s 
                        ludicrous.

           The mood on people’s faces on the street has changed from 
           concerned loyal subjects to angry mob.  They too are not

                        Everyone believes Gyanendra is 
                        behind the massacre.

           Hundreds of NEPALI CITIZENS start marching toward the 
           palace, grabbing rocks, planks, anything they can throw.

                                 MOB
                        Gyanendra the murderer!

                                 MAX
                        Amit.  Forget the Hilton.  Follow 
                        them!

           Amit pulls a hard U-turn.  Guns it.

           In back, Max, focused, loads his camera as they follow 
           the angry mob back the other way.

           EXT. ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT

           Dark streets.  Hundreds carry TORCHES.  Their flames 
           ignite the sky.

           ARMY SOLDIERS blockade the palace.  

           The gates suddenly open and Gyanendra’s caravan of White 
           Range Rovers make their way through the crowd trying to 
           get inside.

                                 ELDERLY NEPALESE MAN
                        Murderer!!

           ROCKS are being thrown at Gyanendra’s vehicles. 

           Windshields spiderweb.
           CAR TIRES are rolled into the streets.  Set ABLAZE.

           Without warning, ARMORED VEHICLES spray the torch bearing 
           mob with WATER CANONS --

           People are wiped off their feet --

           Max photographs everything, much steadier than before, no 
           longer a rookie.  He switches to his short lens --

                                 AMIT
                        We have to get out of here, Ji.

                                 MAX
                        Just a few more --

           A volley of RUBBER BULLETS hits the crowd --

           One SHATTERS Amit’s jaw --

           Max, realizing, drags Amit to his feet and they get the 
           hell out of there...

           As Gyanendra’s hobbled caravan enters the palace.  Safe.

           INT. CLINIC - MORNING

           Hundreds of INJURED line the corridor.  Amit gets patched 
           up by a NURSE.  Max talks to Charlie on his cell.

                                 MAX
                        Well, you have to admit Charlie, 
                        it’s pretty fucking convenient 
                        that Gyanendra was absent from the 
                        dinner and that somehow his wife 
                        and son survived unscathed.

           BEEP.  Call waiting.

                                 MAX
                        Charlie.  I got another call.  
                        I’ll be there with the pics as 
                        soon as I can.
                                 (answers other call)
                        Yeah.

                                 BAKER
                        Smithhammer.

                                 MAX
                        How’d you get this number, Baker?

                                 BAKER
                        Outside.  Two minutes.
           EXT. CLINIC - MORNING

           A black SUV waits in front of the clinic.  Jacobs stands 
           by the open back door.  Baker inside.

           INT. SUV - MOVING - DAY

           Max rides in back between Baker and Jacobs.  Cozy.

           Jacob’s flips open a camcorder screen.  Presses play.

                                 JACOBS
                        This was taken from a surveillance 
                        camera at the royal palace the 
                        night of the massacre.

           CAMCORDER - BLACK & WHITE FOOTAGE

           A palace gate.  Security check point.  Kat carries a 
           small duffle bag.  The guards wave her through.

           Kat’s good at knowing where the cameras are positioned, 
           conceals her face, but Max notices the SNOW LEOPARD 
           TATTOO on her left hand.  No denying it’s her.

                                 JACOBS
                        We believe she wore a mask of 
                        Prince Dipendra.  Was in and out 
                        in under ten minutes.

           Baker hands Max a rubber MASK of Prince Dipendra’s face.  
           Convincing.

                                 BAKER
                        All witnesses corroborate that the 
                        assassin never spoke.  His face, 
                        “like stone.”

                                 MAX
                                 (quoting Charlie’s 
                                  source)
                        “His face was expressionless, like 
                        a mask...”

           Max’s looks pale.  Stunned.  It adds up.

                                 MAX
                        Where was Dipendra’s body found?

                                 BAKER
                        What?  Why?

                                 MAX
                        Just tell me where he was found.
                                 BAKER
                        In the garden.  On a bridge over a 
                        pond.  Single round.  Left temple.

           Max sits.  Subconsciously touches the scar below his 
           collar bone where Kat shot him.

                                 BAKER
                        Your girl murdered eleven people, 
                        Smithhammer.  We’re not sure why.  
                        I think you do.

                                 MAX
                        Compassion.

           Baker and Jacobs look at each other.  All of the blood 
           rushes from Max’s face.

                                 BAKER
                        Stop the car.

           EXT. BUSY STREETS - EVENING

           Max pukes in the gutter.  Baker hands him a handkerchief.

                                 BAKER
                        Take us to her, Max.  This is not 
                        just a story.

           A donkey cart approaches.  Max, acting on pure impulse, 
           breaks for it, uses the cart as a blocker.

           Jacobs starts after him, but Baker intervenes --

                                 BAKER
                                 (unconcerned)
                        It’s alright.  Give him some time.  
                        He’s not going anywhere.

           Jacobs seems less sure, but yields to Baker’s authority.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

           Sprinting, Max turns a corner, and stops.  Makes sure 
           he’s not being followed.

           EXT. KATHMANDU - ABANDONED STREETS - NIGHT

           Military trucks patrol enforcing the mandatory curfew.

           Sealed store fronts.  Parked rickshaws.  Nothing stirs.  

           Except Max, who darts through the empty streets --
           EXT. KAT’S VILLA - NIGHT

           Max stops outside.  There’s no guards at their posts or 
           at the front gate.  No lights on.  He heads inside --

           INT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

           It’s eerily quiet.  Cleared out.  Only the SOUND of the 
           fountain with the BULLET HOLES.

           INT. KAT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           He comes inside.  Empty except for the warm breeze that 
           blows the paper-thin, ceiling-high drapes.

           Max hears the SIRENS outside echo through the narrow 
           streets of Kathmandu announcing the mandatory curfew.

                                 MAX
                        Jesus, Kat.  Tell me you didn’t do 
                        this...

           EXT. KATHMANDU STREETS - NIGHT

           Max works his way through the streets avoiding the 
           occasional Army patrol.  

           TWO SOLDIERS round a corner, spotting Max --

           He takes off --

           EXT. SLUMS - KATHMANDU - NIGHT

           Max, trapped, tries a door.  Locked.  Then another.  No 
           luck.  He turns the knob on the third and --

           INT. SLUM APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Max ducks inside.  A NEPALESE FAMILY stares at him as if 
           he’s a ghost. 

           A soldier POUNDS on the door.  Max holds the door knob.

                                 NEPALI SOLDIER
                                 (in Nepalese)
                        We’re looking for a white man.  
                        Have you seen him?

           The FATHER stares at Max.
                                 FATHER
                                 (in Nepalese)
                        I think I would know if a white 
                        man was in my house.  Are you 
                        stoned?  Get lost!

           The Soldiers move on to the next apartment --

                                 FATHER
                                 (to Max)
                        They are gone.  Tea?

           Max loosens his grip on the door knob, impressed by the 
           Father’s calm hospitality.

                                 MAX
                        Thank you.

           The Man’s WIFE serves Max a cup of chai.  Max sees 
           footage of Prince Dipendra as a young man on the small TV 
           tuned to the local news.

                                 MAX
                        What’s happened?

                                 FATHER
                        Prince, King Dipendra, he died one 
                        hour ago.  Gyanendra is now King.

           Images of a young Prince Dipendra at a shooting range.  
           Max moves closer - intently examines the screen.

                                 MAX
                        Dipendra was right handed.

           Dipendra indeed fires his pistol with his right hand.

                                 MAX
                        Then he wouldn’t put his pistol in 
                        his left hand to kill himself.

           The family all stare at a stunned Max as he realizes Kat 
           really is responsible for killing the royal family.

           EXT. SIDE ALLY - HOTEL SHANGRI-LA - NIGHT

           Max peeks around the corner.

           He sees TWO AGENTS - one American, one Indian - dressed 
           as tourists in front of his hotel.

           Max heads up the fire escape to the roof.
           EXT. HOTEL SHANGRI-LA - NIGHT

           Max climbs down a gutter --

           He reaches his balcony and slips inside --

           INT. MAX’S ROOM - HOTEL SHANGRI-LA - NIGHT

           Inside, he’s surprised to find Kat tearing up the place, 
           looking for something.

                                 MAX
                        Find what you’re looking for?

           Startled, Kat snaps around, silenced pistol aimed at his 
           head.  Max raises his hands up, and she lowers the gun.

                                 KAT
                        The negatives.  Where are they?

                                 MAX
                        I told you I would take care of 
                        them.

           Max is tentative.  Unsure he trusts her.  The gun.

                                 MAX
                        What’s going on, Kat?

                                 KAT
                        I had to make sure.

           She’s not her composed self.  Seems rattled.

                                 MAX
                        You should leave.  Right now.  
                        There are two CIA agents outside.

                                 KAT
                        I know.  Give me the photos.

           Max walks over to the bathroom door, dislodges the PULL 
           UP BAR from the door jamb.  Inside are the negatives.

                                 KAT
                        Clever.

           Before handing it over.

                                 MAX
                        You were at the palace.

                                 KAT
                        How do you know that?
                                 MAX
                        There’s a tape.  Security camera.

                                 KAT
                        Where is it?

                                 MAX
                        What were you doing there?

           Max eyes the pistol at her side which she clenches more 
           tightly.

                                 KAT
                        There’s no time for this, Max.  
                        Who has it? 

                                 MAX
                        Why?  Are you going to kill them 
                        too?

           They stand there in the dark, each trying to read the 
           other.  A chasm between them now.  She realizes he 
           doesn’t trust her.

           A KEY in the lock of the door.  They both turn --

           Kat grabs a chair and jams it under the door handle, 
           buying some time, but when she turns around -- 

           Max is already outside --

           INT. MAX’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Jacobs kicks open the door.  Gun drawn.  He runs out onto 
           the patio --

           EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT

           Max climbs up the rain gutter, the NEGATIVES tucked into 
           his belt.

           Kat is right behind him - one story behind - coming fast.

           Max jumps to an adjacent balcony --

           Almost drops the negatives, recovers --

           EXT. ROOF TOP - HOTEL SHANGRI-LA - NIGHT

           Max sprints across the roof top.

           An AGENT comes barreling through a rooftop door --
           PHST!  Kat fires her silenced pistol at the Agent, who 
           dives behind a chicken coop, unscathed.

           Kat runs after Max across the flat roof tops that sprawl 
           for miles across the city.

           EXT. ROOF TOPS - OLD CITY - NIGHT

           Max scrambles over the slate roof tops that are packed 
           with NEPALESE hoping to get a glimpse of the royal 
           cremations.

           Kat, nimble, twenty-yards back, gains on him --

           Jacobs and two other AGENTS behind her, and pursuing --

           EXT. BAGMATI RIVER - ROYAL GHAT - NIGHT

           Sandal wood.  Stacked higher than a grown man.

           Several BRAHMIN PRIESTS, draped in white robes, place 
           King Birendra and the other nine ROYAL BODIES onto the 
           beds of the sweet scented wood.

           EXT. ROOF TOPS - NIGHT

           A WIDE GAP between two buildings.

           Max LEAPS.  Lands and rolls.   A magnificent jump.

           Kat stops short.  Too big a gap, and they stand facing 
           each other on opposite sides, trying to read the other’s 
           sad eyes.

           The city amazingly still as the eight royal funeral pyres 
           ERUPT in FLAMES in the distance.

           A few DROPS OF RAIN begin to fall.  The Monsoons.

           Kat looks down --

           Several canopies, put up in anticipation of the rain, 
           reach out from the balconies below them.

           Max nods, warning her that Jacobs is approaching behind 
           her, sorriness in his eyes.

           Kat smiles at Max, and then she JUMPS --

           Surprised, Max rushes to the lip of his roof.  Sees 
           canopy after canopy collapse under her weight, slowing 
           her fall.
           Kat lands hard in the alley below.  Battered, but okay.

           Jacobs reaches the gap between the buildings --

                                 JACOBS
                                 (into radio)
                        The woman got away.

           He sees Max duck into a doorway --

                                 JACOBS
                                 (defeated)
                        So did Smithhammer.

           EXT. JODPUR DISTRICT - NIGHT

           Amit, jaw bandaged, comes out in the rain to meet Max.

                                 AMIT
                        Monsoons have come.

                                 MAX
                        Yeah.  I need you to hold on to my 
                        negatives for me.  Keep them safe.

                                 AMIT
                        With my life, Ji.

           Max knows he will.

           INT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT

           Charlie, disheveled, bed head, opens his hotel room door.

           Max, soaking wet, looking haggard, stands in the hall.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Christ, Maxwell.  What the hell 
                        happened?

                                 MAX
                        I need your help, Charlie.

           Charlie lets Max in, instinctively looking left and right 
           down the hall before closing the door.

           INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Max enters.  Charlie’s FEMALE ASSISTANT pulls her jeans 
           over her panties.

                                 MAX
                        Hey, Chloe.
                                 FEMALE ASSISTANT
                        Hey, Max.

           Max paces.  The TV is on.  BBC News.  Chloe grabs the 
           rest of her clothes and shuffles out of Charlie’s room.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        What’s going on?

                                 MAX
                        I don’t know.  But I’ve really 
                        stepped in it this time, Charlie.

           Max paces.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Calm down.  You’re outside 
                        yourself, Maxwell. 

                                 MAX
                        I shouldn’t have come here.  I 
                        might be putting you in danger.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Max.  Sit down.  You’re not making 
                        any bloody sense.

           Max heads for the door.

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Maxwell!
                                 (Max stops)
                        You’re soaking wet.  Why don’t you 
                        take a shower, I’ll order us some 
                        food, a couple of drinks, and 
                        we’ll sort all this out, alright?

           Max, drenched and distraught, finally agrees.  But first 
           he bolts the door, just to be sure.

           INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM - 3 AM

           Max, in the bathroom, talks to Charlie out in the room.

                                 MAX
                        I know who killed the royal family 
                        and it wasn’t Prince Dipendra. 

           He waits for Charlie’s response, but doesn’t get any --

           Max walks out wearing only a towel to find Charlie, drink 
           in hand, looking rather peaked.
                                 MAX
                        I have the proof, but can’t...  
                        What?  What is it, Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        Sorry, old chap.

                                 BAKER (O.S.)
                        I thought we had a deal, 
                        Smithhammer?

           Baker sits calmly in a chair.  Jacobs guards the door.

                                 MAX
                        Something came up.

           Charlie can’t look Max in the eye.

                                 BAKER
                        Don’t look so surprised.  
                        Charlie’s indiscretions have 
                        always given us plenty to bargain 
                        with, eh, Charlie?

                                 CHARLIE BELL
                        I tried to warn you.  A deep 
                        ambiguous hole.

           Baker pours Max a drink.

                                 BAKER
                                 (to Max)
                        I see you found the girl.

                                 MAX
                        She found me.

                                 BAKER
                        Where is she?

                                 MAX
                        I don’t know.

           Baker studies Max’s face.  Uncomfortably long.

                                 BAKER
                        What if I told you I have a story 
                        for your paper about a bright, 
                        young, ambitious, reporter who 
                        made a deal to work for the CIA...

                                 MAX
                        That’s not what happened.

                                 BAKER
                        According to who?
           Baker points to the BBC TV footage of the eleven Royal 
           funeral pyres burning.

                                 BAKER
                        She murdered eleven people in cold 
                        blood, Max.  You are not the type 
                        to want that on your conscience.  
                        To be involved in this.

                                 MAX
                        And what type would that be?

                                 BAKER
                        The self-preserving kind.

           Max thinks carefully for a moment.  Baker sips his drink.

                                 MAX
                        What do you suggest we do?

           EXT. TURQUOISE POOL - HILTON HOTEL - DAY

           Rain drops on the swimming pool.  A BELL BOY spies on Max 
           as he slips past the diving board. 

           The Bell Boy immediately makes a phone call --

                                 BELLBOY
                        He’s leaving, Zigsa.

           EXT. HILTON HOTEL - DAY

           An Indian Intelligence officer, aka RAW AGENT, working 
           with the CIA, spots Max exiting a side gate.

                                 RAW AGENT
                                 (on radio)
                        He’s departing the Hilton now.  On 
                        foot.

           The RAW AGENT follows Max down the street.

           EXT. KATHMANDU - DAY 

           Max picks up the pace, doing his best to lose the tail.

           EXT. BAGOTI RIVER - DAY 

           It’s raining hard now.  Max runs along the flooded river.

           He looks back.  The RAW AGENT still coming.  He can’t 
           shake him.
           Behind both of them, a motorcycle RIDER watches both Max 
           and the RAW AGENT.

           INT. SHIVA TEMPLE - DAY

           White marble floors.  Slick from the rain.

           Max ducks inside --

           An elaborate maze of hallways.

           The RAW AGENT, gun drawn, moves slowly through the 
           corridors, checking each corner --

           Max searches for an exit.  All corridors lead him deeper 
           into the shrine --

           INT. SHIVA TEMPLE - INNER SHRINE - DAY

           Max enters the main sanctuary.  A BRAHMIN PRIEST sits in 
           prayer.  Incense burns.

           The RAW AGENT, gun raised, steps between two marble 
           pillars --

                                 RAW AGENT
                        You should know better than to 
                        enter a building with no exit, Mr. 
                        Smithhammer.

           Kat comes sprinting out of the shadows --

           She slides across the wet marble, sweeps out the Indian 
           Agent’s leg.

           As his head bounces off the hard marble, Kat elbows him 
           in the face, just to be sure.

           From the floor, Kat sweeps the blind spots of the room 
           with her silenced pistol, operating on autopilot.

           She clears three corners and then lands her aim on Max.

           His face tells it all --

                                 MAX
                        You shouldn’t have come back for 
                        me.

           Not even her years of training, of discipline under fire, 
           can stop her legs from buckling slightly as everything 
           comes into clear focus.
                                 KAT
                        Bridges and temples.

           She drops her gun and it CLANGS on the white marble floor 
           as a SWARM of AGENTS take her down in a massive scrum.

           In all the photographs Max has taken of pain and 
           suffering, nothing compares to the way Kat looks at him 
           right now.

           INT. SHIVA TEMPLE - MOMENTS LATER

           They haul her away.  Kat doesn’t resist.

                                 BAKER
                        You did the right thing, 
                        Smithhammer.

           Max sits down on the wet marble, exhausted.  He notices 
           the RAW Agent who followed him going ballistic at Jacobs 
           for using him as bait without his knowledge.

           EXT. OLD EMBASSY BUILDING - DAY 

           Puddles outside.  The streets drenched.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Jacobs watches Baker work over Kat in the interogation 
           room directly below them.

           Max enters.  An AGENT stops him at the door.

                                 AGENT #1
                                 (to Jacobs)
                        Sir?

                                 JACOBS
                        You can’t be in here, Smithhammer.  
                        No way.

                                 MAX
                        You wouldn’t be here right now if 
                        it weren’t for me.  This was the 
                        deal, we share, right?

           Jacobs thinks it over.

                                 JACOBS
                                 (to Agent)
                        He’s okay.
           They look down through a huge one-way viewing panel in 
           the floor into the interrogation room below.

           INTERCUT - OBSERVATION AND INTERROGATION ROOMS

                                 BAKER
                        You comfortable?  Can I get you 
                        anything?  Cigarette?  Food?  Soft 
                        drink?

           Max notices the high tech recording equipment.

                                 BAKER
                        Why don’t you tell me about 
                        Tripoli?

                                 KAT
                        The game you’re playing is not 
                        winnable.  There are way too many 
                        variables.   One day you’ll 
                        realize all of this was a complete 
                        waste.

                                 BAKER
                        Is that what you told your two 
                        Mossad buddies as you slit their 
                        throats?

                                 KAT
                        All men betray sooner or later.

           She looks up through the ceiling panel.  Max feels as if 
           she’s looking right through him.

                                 BAKER
                        You were at the palace the other 
                        night.  Helping the prince.

           This gets a small reaction from Baker.  She’s smart.  
           Goading him.  Max listens intently --

                                 KAT
                        You think Gyanendra will be your 
                        puppet, but you didn’t really do 
                        your homework, Michigan, because 
                        any Nepali street kid can tell you 
                        the people don’t trust him.  King 
                        or not.

           Baker’s balls his fists.

                                 KAT
                        So, who will they turn to now?  
                        The very people you want least in 
                        power.
           SLAM!  A hard right to her face.

           Baker strikes her again, cracks open her lip.  She grins 
           through bloody teeth.

           Max needs some air.  Steps out of the observation room.

                                 BAKER
                        I can’t decide who I’ll enjoy 
                        handing you over to more, 
                        Gyanendra or your old Mossad 
                        buddies.

           Kat, her lip bleeding, SPITS in Baker’s face.

           Baker hits her again.  Knocks her unconscious.

           INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

           Max sees Baker leave the interrogation room and he slips 
           inside the room unnoticed. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Kat’s bound to her chair.  Head slumped.  Blood and 
           saliva strands to the floor.

           Max leans in to wipe the blood from her lip --

           BAM!  She head butts Max to the face.  Blood gushes from 
           his nose.

                                 KAT
                        Tenzin was right about you all 
                        along.

                                 MAX
                        Kat.  I’m not with these guys.  We 
                        had an arrangement, but...

                                 KAT
                        Looks like you chose a side.  
                        Bravo.

           She looks away in disgust.

                                 MAX
                        What’s going on?  Did Gyanendra 
                        hire you?  What treaty?  His One 
                        China policy?

           No answer.  Blood gushes from Max’s broken nose.
                                 MAX
                        Kat!  Tell me what happened!

                                 KAT
                        Why should I?  I’m just a story to 
                        you.

           They stare at each other, both bursting with pride, 
           neither willing to admit they love the other.

           OBSERVATION ROOM

           Jacobs comes back into the empty room with a cup of 
           coffee.  He looks down and sees Max talking to Kat.

                                 JACOBS
                        Fuck!

           He presses a button --

                                 JACOBS
                        Smithhammer.  Get out of there!

           INTERROGATION ROOM

                                 MAX
                        I can’t help you if you won’t tell 
                        me --

                                 KAT
                                 (angry)
                        You think I give a shit about what 
                        they do to me?  You think I want 
                        to live?  What do I have to live 
                        for?

           A challenge.

                                 MAX
                        You have...  Tenzin, Lodak, the 
                        monastery.  Did you do it for 
                        them?  For Tenzin?

                                 KAT
                        Shut up.  Don’t say their names!

                                 MAX
                        Kat, you need to listen to me --

                                 KAT
                                 (looking up)
                        I did it!  Do you hear me!  I 
                        said, I DID IT!!!  I killed them.

           Kat, bound to the chair, thrashes and screams up at the 
           ceiling panel.
           Max takes a step back -- Her sudden confession makes him 
           question if she really did do it.

           Jacobs comes running in.  Yanks Max out of there.

           Kat continues to scream and thrash.

           A caged animal.

           INT. MEN’S ROOM - AMERICAN EMBASSY BASEMENT - DAY

           Unsure what he believes anymore, Max comes in to clean 
           up.  He finds Baker washing Kat’s blood off his hands.

                                 MAX
                        What’s going on, Baker?   You 
                        showed me evidence that she did 
                        it.  Did she?

                                 BAKER
                        I showed you evidence that she was 
                        there that night.

           Max slams Baker up against the paper towel dispenser.  

                                 MAX
                        Fuck you!  Who did it?  You?!

           Baker thinks.  The only SOUND is of the FAUCET still 
           running.

                                 BAKER
                        Our people didn’t execute this if 
                        that’s what you mean.

                                 MAX
                        Jesus Christ, who teaches you guys 
                        to talk like that?!  How about a 
                        straight fucking answer?  Who 
                        authorized and carried out the 
                        assassination of King Birendra?

           A look.  Max lets go of Baker’s shirt.  Baker goes back 
           to washing the blood off his hands.

                                 BAKER
                        We’re just moral support on this 
                        one.  Dad in the bleachers.

                                 MAX
                        Support of who?  Is she even 
                        involved in this?

                                 BAKER
                        Honestly.  I don’t really know.
                                 MAX
                        How is that even possible?

                                 BAKER
                        This is a finesse sport.  We 
                        encourage, suggest, and when 
                        things don’t go as planned, damage 
                        control.

                                 MAX
                        Damage control? 

           Baker doesn’t answer.  He calmly lathers.  Kat’s blood 
           turns the soap pink.

                                 BAKER
                        I’m going to need the negatives of 
                        Jacobs and me outside Gyanendra’s 
                        nature conservatory.

           Max looks at Baker in the mirror washing his hands.  The 
           water pouring out of the faucet, his mind putting it all 
           together.

                                 MAX
                        Charlie knew.  He was looking into 
                        it, but you had him kill the 
                        story. 
                                 (realizing)
                        The Mahakali treaty.  Jesus. You 
                        had King Birendra assassinated 
                        because he was going to sell his 
                        country’s water to China instead 
                        of India.

           Baker shuts off the water.  Methodically dries his hands.

                                 BAKER
                        You know how long a person can go 
                        without water?  Three days.  A 
                        child?  Try holding a country 
                        together when half a billion 
                        people run out of fresh water.  We 
                        need a stable, nuclear, India.  
                        They need water.  The choices 
                        become very simple.

                                 MAX
                        You’re insane.

           Baker, righteous, almost a fatherly tone.

                                 BAKER
                        We’re saving lives here, Max.  
                        Millions of lives.  
                                 BAKER 
                        How is it that the Maoists, made 
                        up of mostly illiterate farmer’s 
                        sons, put ending the Mahakali 
                        Water Treaty with India third on 
                        their list of demands?  Third.  
                        Why do you think that is?

                                 MAX
                        Because China is backing them.

                                 BAKER
                        Millions of lives.

           Baker exits.

           Max stares at himself in the mirror, then slams his fist 
           against the metal paper towel dispenser.

           INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

           Exposed pipes.  Max stops Baker before he goes back 
           inside the interrogation room.

                                 MAX
                        What will happen to Kat?

                                 BAKER
                        We’ll hand her over to Gyanendra 
                        for insurance.  If this continues 
                        to blow up in his face, he’s going 
                        to need a get out of jail free 
                        card.

                                 MAX
                        So Gyanendra botches it and she’s 
                        your Lee Harvey Oswald to march 
                        out in front of the cameras 
                        because the entire country figured 
                        out he’s behind it.

                                 BAKER
                        We actually could use someone with 
                        your particular skill set right 
                        now.  If people read it in the New 
                        York Times...

           Baker’s opportunistic nature disgusts Max.

                                 MAX
                                 (with contempt)
                        Get Charlie to do it.

                                 BAKER
                        Look, Max.  You have your whole 
                        career ahead of you.  A 
                        potentially bright career.  
                                 BAKER 
                        Choice assignments, access to 
                        world leaders, perhaps a best 
                        selling book, maybe even a 
                        Pulitzer if you play your cards 
                        right.
                                 (beat)
                        Go get those negatives and we’ll 
                        talk about your future.

           Confident he knows Max better than Max does, Baker turns 
           and re-enters the interrogation room.  Max and Kat lock 
           eyes for a second before the door slams shut.

           EXT. MAX’S ROOM - HOTEL SHANGRI-LA - DAY

           Max smokes on his balcony watching the rain.

           The file he gave to Amit sits on a chair - an inside 
           exclusive on the biggest assassination of modern times.

           Max picks up the photograph of Kat, bathing in the river.

           He stares at it for a long time.  

           Perfection.

           EXT. OUTSIDE KATHMANDU - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           World famous Tibetan Temple of the Tigress.  The huge 
           center dome is lit up and visible for miles.

           EXT. TEMPLE OF THE TIGRESS - NIGHT

           Max approaches the temple’s outer wooden doors.  He 
           recognizes an ARMED GUARD as one of Tenzin’s men.

                                 MAX
                        Please give this to Tenzin.

           He hands him the photo of Kat.

           INT. TIGRESS TEMPLE - NIGHT

           A MONK leads Max to the central shrine. 

           The domed cathedral on the inside is adorned with statues 
           and ancient hand-painted murals on the walls.

           Tenzin, shirtless, sits alone in the Lotus position, 
           meditating.  Max sees that his entire torso is tattooed 
           in Tibetan Sanskrit.  Buddhist prayers.
                                 TENZIN
                        Sit.

           Max sits down next to him.  Not exactly the confrontation 
           he was anticipating.

                                 TENZIN
                        This mural depicts the famous 
                        Jatica tale of the Tigress mother. 

           They look up at the mural of a Tiger.

                                 TENZIN
                        Tiger mother is starving and 
                        unable to produce milk for her 
                        cubs so she will have to eat them.  
                        Buddha sees this and lays down so 
                        she will eat him instead.  Allow 
                        her to produce milk for her cubs.  
                        But the tigress mother is even too 
                        weak to kill Buddha so Buddha 
                        opens up his veins with a knife 
                        and lets her lap up his blood.  Do 
                        you understand the meaning of this 
                        story?

                                 MAX
                        You would sacrifice everything for 
                        her.

                                 TENZIN
                        Would you?

           Max hesitates and before he can answer Tenzin swings, 
           knocking Max across the floor.  Tenzin rises, grabs Max, 
           incredibly agile for his tremendous size.

                                 TENZIN
                        I should have killed you long ago.

           He catapults Max into a nearby wall.

           Tenzin slams Max to the floor - cringe worthy.

           Max slowly rises.  Almost wants the punishment.

           He raises his fists.  Walks into Tenzin’s reach.

           Big hit to the face.  He’s down again.  

           Then up, and again down.  The beating of a life time.  

           Tenzin looms over Max, fist cocked back, he holds --

                                 TENZIN
                        Why are you doing this?
           He can see it in Max’s eyes, he loves her.  They both do.

                                 MAX
                        Do it.

           But Tenzin lets go.  Sits down, breathing heavy from the 
           penance he just dished out.

           Max slowly pushes himself up to a seated position against 
           the wall.  They rest side-by-side.

                                 MAX
                        I know where they are keeping her.

           EXT. OLD EMBASSY BUILDING - DAWN

           Pouring rain.  A three car caravan pulls up front.  An 
           AGENT jumps out of the black SUV and runs inside.

           INT. OLD EMBASSY BUILDING - DAY

           Baker, Jacobs, and Kat, her hands handcuffed behind her 
           back, wait in the atrium.  The Agent hands the KEYS to 
           Jacobs.

                                 AGENT
                        Streets are flooded.  Low 
                        visibility.

                                 BAKER
                                 (to Kat)
                        Time’s up.  

           She feigns a head-butt.  Baker flinches.  Makes her day.

           Max enters.  His own face pretty beat up.

                                 JACOBS
                        What the hell happened to you?

                                 MAX
                        Bike accident.

                                 BAKER
                        You got the negatives?

           Max hands over a file.

                                 MAX
                        I want to come along.  See this 
                        through.

           Baker coldly flips through it - makes sure it’s all 
           there.
                                 BAKER
                        Let’s go.

           Kat steams.  Her affection for Max has mutated into 
           simmering rage.

           EXT. FLOODED STREETS - KATHMANDU - DAY

           Three black SUV’s form a mini caravan, snaking slowly 
           through the flooded city streets.

           INT. MIDDLE LAND ROVER - DAY

           The monsoons are in full force.  The wipers useless 
           against the downpour. 

           Max rides shotgun.  Kat sits in back with Baker.  Her 
           wrists, handcuffed together behind her back, makes 
           sitting excruciating.

           Baker flips through Max’s file.

                                 BAKER
                        This is some fine investigative 
                        journalism.

           Flipping the page, Baker comes to the PHOTO of him and 
           Jacobs outside Gyanendra’s Nature Trust.  He tears it up.

                                 BAKER
                        Perhaps this is the beginning of a 
                        beautiful friendship.

           Max grips the armrest.  Visibility is near zero.  

           Jacobs can barely make out the tail lights of the lead 
           vehicle which suddenly turn RED.

           Jacobs SLAMS on the breaks --

                                 BAKER
                        What is it?

                                 JACOBS
                        Not sure.

           The wipers SWOOSH back and forth.  Rain PELTS the roof.

           Jacobs squints at something move outside - something BIG!

           An ELEPHANT suddenly SLAMS down on the roof of the lead 
           vehicle - crushing everyone inside.
                                 BAKER
                        Get us out of here!

           SMASH!  Behind them.  Another ELEPHANT crushes the sweep 
           vehicle.

                                 JACOBS
                        We’re blocked in.

           Kat swings her legs to the ceiling - a perfect half-pike - 
           and slides her handcuffed wrists up and over her feet --

           On the downswing she loops the chain over Max’s head, 
           dragging him by the neck into the backseat.

           GUN FIRE erupts outside --

           As an elephant grabs their front axel, lifting the SUV 
           off the ground to a 30 degree angle --

           Baker draws his SIDEARM --

           The vehicle suddenly drops to the ground.  Hard.

           Kat has Max by the jugular --

                                 KAT
                                 (to Jacobs)
                        Unlock the doors or I break his 
                        neck.

           She pulls the 3 inch chain hard across Max’s throat - his 
           face immediately turns red from lack of oxygen.

           Baker presses his Smith & Wesson directly into Kat’s 
           forehead.

                                 BAKER
                        You think I care?

                                 KAT
                        Kill me and you’re all dead.  I 
                        assure you.

           Kat’s composed tone is chilling.  Baker hesitates for a 
           second.  It’s enough for Kat to disarm him --

                                 KAT
                        Can always tell the field agents 
                        from the suits.  Reflexes.  Unlock 
                        the doors.  Now.

           Baker can see the vehicle is surrounded by MASKED MEN.  

           And those damn wipers SWOOSHING back ‘n forth.
                                 BAKER
                                 (to Jacobs)
                        Do it.

           Kat slowly backs out, using Max as her human shield.

                                 KAT
                                 (to Baker)
                        Pass him the file.

                                 BAKER
                        Why?

                                 KAT
                        Insurance.

           Reluctantly, Baker hands the file to Max.

           Kat and Max back out of the vehicle and disappear behind 
           the veil of rain.

           FRONT SEAT

           A massive elephant HEAD fills the windshield, followed by 
           the vehicle lurching off the ground again, rising up --

                                 BAKER
                        Shoot it.

                                 JACOBS
                        What?!

           The elephant tilts the SUV up and over with them inside.

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           Kat forces Max down the alleyway, Baker’s gun against the 
           back of his skull.

           Tenzin is up ahead.

           Sporadic GUN FIRE persists behind them --

           Max looks back --

           EXT. KATHMANDU - STREET - DAY

           A battered Baker crawls out of the vehicle into the 
           flooded streets.

           A military truck pulls up to the three crushed vehicles, 
           two elephants, mayhem.
           Blue-fatigue wearing NEPALESE SOLDIERS stream out and 
           take up positions.

           Tenzin waits by his SILVER TOYOTA.  The engine running.

           He gives Kat a puzzled look as she still holds the gun to 
           Max’s head.

                                 TENZIN
                        Quickly!

           Two-by-two, the soldiers dart up the street, kneeling and 
           taking aim at Kat --

           They FIRE --

           Tenzin grabs Kat. His huge arms envelope her, protecting 
           her with his massive frame --

           Bullets riddle across TENZIN’s back --

           Kat feels his weight slumping against her, his grip 
           loosens.  

           She tries to slow his fall.  His mass too much --

           Tenzin leans against the Silver Toyota.

                                 TENZIN
                                 (to Max)
                        Take her.  Go!

           Kat turns, opens fire.  Wrathful.

           SOLDIER

           Face shot, killed instantly, his finger remains depressed 
           on the trigger, spraying machine gun fire everywhere --

           The shots spatter across the body of the male elephant.

           ELEPHANT

           It rears up in pain, trumpeting wildly.  Berserk.

           Kat turns back around to find Max helping Tenzin into the 
           Silver Toyota.

                                 MAX
                        Kat!  Come on!

           She jumps in the back seat next to Tenzin.  Max gets in 
           the driver’s seat and takes off --
           INT. SILVER TOYOTA - MOVING - DAY

           Max tears down a steep staircase.

                                 MAX
                        Hold on!

           Kat struggles with Tenzin in back.  Desperately tries to 
           stop the bleeding from his chest.  Too much blood.

                                 TENZIN
                        Katrina.

           He looks at her with huge eyes.

                                 KAT
                        Don’t talk.  You’re going to be 
                        okay.

           They both know she’s lying.

                                 TENZIN
                                 (in Tibetan)
                        Do you remember the first time I 
                        saw you?  So pale.  Fragile.

                                 KAT
                        You thought I was dead.  You saved 
                        me.

                                 TENZIN
                                 (In Tibetan)
                        My little white dove.

           A content expression on his ashen face.

           She FEELS the air coming out of his lungs through the 
           bullet holes.  She frantically tries to stop it with her 
           hands.

           Then no more air seeps out --

           He’s gone.

           Kat, devastated, gently lowers his head back onto the 
           headrest.

           INT. SILVER TOYOTA - MOVING - DAY

           Max drives.  Checks the rearview mirror constantly.  Kat 
           now rides shotgun.  She seethes over Tenzin’s death.

                                 KAT
                        It should be you lying back there.
                                 MAX
                        Kat, I --

           She lashes out, punching him across the jaw.  

           Max instinctively hits the breaks, hydroplaning into the 
           side wall of the alley, ricocheting off, and spinning to 
           a stop.

           Before Max knows he’s okay, Kat double kicks him out of 
           the driver’s side door.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY 

           Max lands on his back in a puddle.

           Kat leaps on top of him, still handcuffed, punching him 
           across the face.

                                 KAT 
                        You played me all along!  Set me 
                        up!

           Straddling him, she points the barrel of Tenzin’s gun to 
           his heart.

                                 KAT
                        The monastery.  Do they know about 
                        the monastery?  Did you tell them!

                                 MAX
                        Kat.

           His tone says of course not.

           She stares at his face.  As much as she wills it away, 
           her true feelings for him betray her... in a single tear.

                                 KAT
                        You expect me to believe anything 
                        you say?

                                 MAX
                        No.

                                 KAT
                        Ask me if I did it.

                                 MAX
                        Kat.  Please.

                                 KAT
                        Ask me!
                                 MAX
                        I don’t care.

           Kat holds the barrel of the gun against Max’s chest.

                                 KAT
                        You cared before.  ASK ME!

                                 MAX
                        All that matters now is that I get 
                        you safely to the Tigress Temple.   
                        You can kill me there, if you 
                        want.

                                 KAT
                        How do you know about --
                                 (realizing; stunned)
                        You told Tenzin the route.  You 
                        planned this --

           Max gazes up at a her.  The gun barrel.  She’s shaking.  
           Boiling over with emotion at Max’s betrayal, Tenzin’s 
           death, and having to do this --

           BAM.  BAM.  BAM.  Kat fires her gun.

           She looks up into the pouring rain --

           Kat gets up.  Walks back to the pick-up.  Physically and 
           emotionally spent.

           Max lays in the puddle, opens his eyes, the rain soothes 
           his bruised face.  She couldn’t do it.

           EXT. KATHMANDU - STREETS - NIGHT

           Site of the ambush.  The three wrecked black SUV’s.

           Baker and Jacobs talk with an ARMY CAPTAIN while huddled 
           over a map of the city.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        There are road blocks here and 
                        here.  They can’t get out of the 
                        city.

                                 BAKER
                        What about this road?

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Flooded.  They would not be able 
                        to get across the Bagmati River 
                        unless --
                                 BAKER
                        Unless what?

                                 CAPTAIN
                        They have elephants.

           A look.

                                 JACOBS
                        What about the airports?

                                 CAPTAIN
                        There are five private and of 
                        course Tribhuvan International.

                                 BAKER
                        Have officers check passengers on 
                        all international flights.

                                 JACOBS
                        Tell them to check all the female 
                        passenger's hands for a small 
                        tattoo of a snow leopard.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        You want them to check every hand 
                        of every woman boarding all 
                        international flights?  That will 
                        be extremely difficult.

                                 BAKER
                        Just do it!

           The Captain radios it in.  Baker’s calm and calculating 
           veneer showing a few cracks.

                                 JACOBS
                        What do we tell Washington?

                                 BAKER
                        Nothing.  Yet.  I can contain 
                        this.

           Jacobs’ expression implies he isn’t so confident.  Their 
           jobs on the line.

                                 JACOBS
                        She won’t fly unless she ditches 
                        Smithhammer.

                                 BAKER
                        He’s already dead.
           EXT. BAGMATI RIVER - KATHMANDU - NIGHT

           Tenzin lays prone in a wooden row boat.

           Max waits by the Toyota while Kat says goodbye.

           She gently kisses Tenzin’s forehead.

           Stepping back, she casts the boat out into the water.  It 
           floats downstream, carrying Tenzin with it, into the 
           mist.

           INT. SILVER TOYOTA - NIGHT

           Max and Kat sit in the truck.  She has Tenzin’s gun in 
           her hands.

                                 MAX
                        He loved you.

                                 KAT
                        Perhaps too much.

                                 MAX
                        I don’t believe that.

           He loves her too.  Notices the handcuffs.

                                 MAX
                        We need to go.  You sure you don’t 
                        want to go to the monastery?

                                 KAT
                        Even if we could get there, I 
                        won’t risk bringing this to them.

           She looks at him.

                                 KAT
                        Why’d you come back for me?

                                 MAX
                        I guess I found something worth 
                        choosing sides for. 

           They sit quietly for a moment.

                                 KAT
                        Do you trust this guy? 

                                 MAX
                        What choice do we have?
           INT. AIRPORT HANGER - NIGHT

           York’s under the hood of his Russian-made helicopter when 
           Max and Kat burst into the hanger.  They both look beat 
           to shit.

                                 YORK
                        Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  Those 
                        American wankers do that?

           Kat conceals her pistol.

                                 MAX
                        York, we need a lift to the 
                        border.  Right now.

                                 YORK
                        Not in this shit, I’m afraid.

           York picks up a wrench, understanding something is up.

           Kat raises her gun --

                                 KAT
                        Mine’s bigger.  Drop it.

           He does.  She pats him down.  York notices her hands are 
           cuffed.  The tattoo.

                                 YORK
                        So this is your elusive snow 
                        leopard lassie.

                                 KAT
                        Open the bay doors.

                                 YORK
                        I told you, I can’t fly in --

                                 KAT
                        This is a Russian made MI-17 with 
                        twin turbine engines regulated to 
                        4000 meters at 60 knots.  I’ve 
                        flown in much worse.

                                 MAX
                        York, I’d do what she says.

           Kat sees a HACKSAW on York’s work bench.

                                 KAT
                        First, get these off me.
           INT. HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAWN

           The sky is ominous as they skirt swaths of clouds.  Rough 
           thermals and pelting rain.

           York keeps it low so at least they won’t be too high if 
           they go down.

           Kat and Max face each other in back.  Cargo door open.

                                 KAT
                        I got a call from the prince’s 
                        body man and went to the palace to 
                        make a delivery.  I never saw the 
                        prince.  Perhaps he smoked too 
                        much of the tar I sold him and 
                        lost his mind.  Or maybe I was set 
                        up and he was already dead.  I 
                        don’t know.  I just want you to 
                        know that it wasn’t me.

           He nods.  They sit silently for a moment.

                                 KAT
                        Now I need to shoot you in the 
                        leg.  Give you an alibi.

                                 MAX
                        You just enjoy shooting me.

                                 KAT
                        Perhaps.

                                 MAX
                        I’m going with you.

                                 KAT
                        You can’t.  They’d find you.

                                 MAX
                        I don’t care.

           She plays along, wishing it could be so.

                                 KAT
                        Where would we go?

                                 MAX
                        Tel Aviv.
                                 (off her surprise)
                        They’d never look for us there.

           She touches her locket with picture of her grandmother.
                                 KAT
                        I’d take you to my grandmother’s 
                        house, in Jerusalem.

                                 MAX
                        I would like that.

           They both know it’s not going to happen, but it’s nice to 
           enjoy the fantasy.

           Kat spots a military helicopter following them in the 
           distance, snapping them back to reality.

           She nods to Max who looks out and sees it.

                                 KAT
                        I told you I dream in English.

           EXT. RICE FIELD - DAY

           York touches down in the flooded rice paddies near the 
           river.  Max and Kat jump out, ducking underneath the huge 
           rotor blades.

           A long SUSPENSION FOOT BRIDGE hangs over the Mahakali 
           river separating Nepal and India.

           EXT. SUSPENSION FOOT BRIDGE - DAY

           Max and Kat run across the wooden-planked bridge 
           clutching the metal cable railings --

           It takes all their strength to hold on.

           The river, at flood stage, rages thirty feet below them.

           EXT. SUSPENSION BRIDGE - DAY

           They stop half way across the bridge.  Mid-river.

           Through the sheets of rain they can make out INDIAN 
           BORDER GUARDS along the far shore, cutting them off.

                                 KAT
                        They must have radioed ahead.

           Back on the Nepali side a helicopter lands --

           Baker and Jacobs jump out, guns drawn.  Kat shakes her 
           head, ironically.

                                 KAT
                        Zampa iha Ghang.
                                 MAX
                        Bridges and temples.

           She evaluates the Indian guards.  Suicide.  

           An enormous uprooted TREE floats by in the turbulent 
           brown water below.  No escape.

           She hands Max the Smith & Wesson she took from Baker.

                                 MAX
                        I could have borne your sins.

                                 KAT
                        I know.

           Max kisses her.

           The Indian BORDER GUARDS take up positions on the far 
           side of the bridge while Baker and Jacobs block the 
           Nepali side.

           Max and Kat don’t care.  Still locked in a passionate 
           embrace -- the rain wet against their faces.

           Suddenly Kat pulls away.

           She climbs over the railing.  The river rages below.

           Baker draws his GUN --

           Kat glances at Max one last time.

           Baker FIRES as --

           Kat DIVES --

           Max watches her fall toward the brown water.  

           She hits the swift current and disappears.

           Max scans downstream.  He doesn’t see her surface.

           The gusts of wind swing the bridge violently.  Max grabs 
           onto the cable railing to brace himself -- 

           On the railing.  A drop of blood.

           He lifts his hand.  More blood.  Not his.

           EXT. NEPALI SHORE - DAY

           Max, drenched, steps back onto terra firma.

           Baker and Jacobs come running up.
           Without breaking stride, Max thrusts Baker’s pistol into 
           his hand and keeps on walking.

                                 MAX
                        You got her.  And her sins.

           Baker and Jacobs share a look.

           They see the Indian military officers on the other side 
           of the bridge scanning the shoreline.  

           The brown water rages below.  No escape.

           INT. MILITARY HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY 

           Max sits in the open compartment chopper across from 
           Baker and Jacobs.

           They fly over miles of bright green terraced rice 
           paddies.  Max stares out at the landscape.

                                 BAKER
                        You’re going to have to do better 
                        than that.

           The Monsoon rains are clearing up.  Some sunshine peeks 
           through.

           Max pulls out the file, the decision heavy in his hand.  

           Resolved, Max passes it over to Baker who grabs it 
           eagerly, but Max holds onto his end of the file.

                                 MAX
                        Let her go.  If she survived that, 
                        she deserves to live.

           Baker doesn’t like to lose, but he wants the file.

                                 BAKER
                        We still have to get control of 
                        the story.

                                 MAX
                        I’ll write the article for the 
                        Times, but after that, we’re 
                        through.  For good.

                                 BAKER
                        What’s the cover story?

                                 MAX
                        We stick to the original.  Prince 
                        Dipendra did it for love.
                                 MAX 
                                 (beat)
                        I’ll make them believe it.

           Max lets go of the file.  Stares out the window.

           Baker leans back, smiles to Jacobs, satisfied Max will 
           deliver.

           Max glances at the river one last time.  No sign of Kat.

           For love...
