           The ROAR of twin diesel engines as we -- 

           FADE IN: 

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

           A commercial FISHING TRAWLER bobs across heavy chop. More 
           rust than boat.

           QUICK CUTS --

           as the European crew hoist up nets filled with their catch. 
           Hard, beaten faces. 

           A SHADOW suddenly falls over the deck -- fishermen looking to 
           the sky as a:

           A BOEING 747-200B

           SCREAMS overhead -- SHOOTS past them -- and HITS the water 
           with a HUGE CRASH -- wing and the fuselage SNAPPING off and 
           BURSTING into flames. 

           A massive wave swallows the plane and it sinks to:

           THE OCEAN FLOOR

           vomiting debris: luggage, chairs, bodies. The impact sends up 
           a thick cloud of dust and dirt. 

           When the haze washes away, we see a familiar blue stripe 
           across the plane’s body -- along with the words:

                              “THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA”

           Air Force One has just gone down. 

           SNAP TO -- 

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - MID SECTION CABIN - SAME

           An underwater tomb. We swim through twisted metal, past 
           overhead bins hanging open, to a cabin where at least THIRTY 
           CORPSES are still in their seats, oxygen masks suspended in 
           the murky underwater space -- to arrive at:

           A WOMAN

           by a window -- gorgeous face framed by floating angelic 
           blonde hair. 

           A light catches her WEDDING RING -- still glistening.

           SMASH TO --
           BLACK. MAIN TITLES:

                                        BLACK BOX 

           GO TO --

           EXT. BROOKLYN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           As we SOAR over the Brooklyn Bridge to arrive atop the 
           limestone townhouses of Park Slope -- an ALARM BLARES.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           An alarm clock reads 6:30 am. A hand soon enters frame. Snaps 
           it off. Golden light frames:

           ALEX BISHOP

           34, handsome, strong and resolute. He stretches and flips 
           over to his other side. Finds his six-year old daughter EMMA 
           in bed beside him -- already wide-awake -- staring directly 
           into his eyes -- excited to start the day. Cute. Precocious.

                                 EMMA
                        Hi.

           Alex, half-awake, can only manage a smirk.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           CLOSE ON -- A TV

           as it switches on. Carmen Sandiego. But just as quickly it 
           shuts back off. 

           Emma looks up at Alex -- disgruntled.

                                 EMMA
                        Mommy says it’s OK as long as I eat 
                        all my cereal.

                                 ALEX
                        Sorry, sweetie. My rules today: no 
                        TV at the table.

                                 EMMA
                        But it’s educational.

                                 ALEX
                        Write your Congressman.

           He fixes her cereal and toast. Takes the seat at the 
           breakfast nook across from her. Starts reading an online news 
           story on his i-Pad.
           We note the publication: FOUNDATION -- and the byline: BY 
           ALEX BISHOP.

                                 EMMA
                        Daddy?

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah, sweetie?

                                 EMMA
                        Are you gonna lose your job?

           Alex looks up.

                                 ALEX
                        What? Where’d you get that?

                                 EMMA
                        Penny’s dad says journalism is a 
                        dying industry.

                                 ALEX
                        Oh and what does Penny’s dad do?

                                 EMMA
                        He plays shortstop for the Mets. 

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah, well, tell Penny’s dad so is 
                        playing for the Mets. 

           Alex’s phone buzzes from the other room. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                             (rising; leaving)
                        Finish your cereal. 

           And as soon as he steps out of the kitchen -- Emma switches 
           back on the TV. Trouble-maker.

           INT. FOYER - SECONDS LATER

           As Alex picks his charging cell phone off a small table. 
           Checks the display. Answers.

                                 ALEX
                        Hey Leo, what’s up?
                             (listens)
                        No, I’m with my daughter. I told 
                        Noah I’d be in at 10. Why, what’s 
                        going on?

           Suddenly -- the house phone RINGS. Whatever Leo is saying we 
           can see from Alex’s side that he’s agitated.
                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Wait, wait, slow down, I gotta grab 
                        the house phone. Hold up a second.

           Alex moves back into:

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           And picks up the land line -- his back to Emma and the TV.

                                 ALEX
                        Hello.
                             (listens)

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Daddy.

                                 ALEX
                        No, I haven’t heard from her yet. 

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Daddy.

                                 ALEX
                        No, I think I would know --

                                 EMMA
                        Dad.

           Alex turns --

                                 ALEX
                        Emma, I’m on the --

           -- and stops short when he sees Emma’s face: a mix of 
           confusion and fear. He follows her eye-line to:

           THE TELEVISION

           where we see that her program has been replaced by BREAKING 
           NEWS -- featuring a report on the Air Force One crash.

           Alex is instantly GUTSTRUCK. He hangs up the phone -- in 
           SHOCK. Steps closer to the television -- passing:

           A PHOTOGRAPH

           taped to the fridge behind him: Alex, Emma and the blonde we 
           recognize from Air Force One. 

           Meet LISA BISHOP, Alex’s wife.

           RESUME ALEX:
           stunned silent -- looking at the TV -- in disbelief -- then 
           catching his daughter’s face -- eyes welling -- world 
           SPINNING. Off which -- everything gets SPED UP -- as we SLAM 
           TO --

                        It’s still too early to speculate

                        -- no, we have no evidence to 
                        suggest we are under attack. There

           operating out of a CLASSIFIED LOCATION pour over Air Force

                                 COMMENTARY (V.O.)
                        Three weeks since the crash of Air 
                        Force One, military investigators 
                        are still piecing together what 
                        happened that fateful day. 
                        Meanwhile, an independent, 
                        bipartisan commission is being 
                        created by congressional 
                        legislation to prepare a full and

                        the flight data recorder recovered 
                        from the wreckage of Air Force One. 
                        The two voices you will hear belong 
                        to its captain, Colonel Joseph 
                        Turner and First Officer, Lt. 
                        Mitchell Hodges.

           9) A TRANSCRIPT

           appears over a still of Air Force One and a file photo of its 
           captain, COLONEL JOSEPH TURNER, and first officer, LT. 
           MITCHELL HODGES -- both career Air Force.

           The following recording cuts in and out of STATIC and WARNING 
           SOUNDS:

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        Hydro pressure is all lost. 

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        We're not gonna make it. 

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)

                        Mayday! Air Force One. Mayday! 

           STATIC fills the soundtrack -- replaced by the hymn "For All 
           the Saints" -- as we GO TO --

           10) LISA BISHOP’S FUNERAL

           Friends and family in attendance. No dry eyes. Alex sits -- 
           holding Emma’s hand -- solemn. The coffin is draped with an 
           American flag.

                                 COMMENTARY (V.O.)
                        Two years after the crash of Air 
                        Force One, the AFO Commission 
                        prepares to release their final 600 
                        page report on the tragedy that 
                        took 92 American lives. 

           11) AFO COMMISSION HEARING

           The 11 people that make up the Air Force One (AFO) Commission 
           stand before us. They are comprised of former Senators, 
           Governors and Congressmen. 
           The chairman is the former Secretary of State, MARTIN LAUER, 
           50’s, distinguished, and fully aware of the responsibility 
           that has befell his shoulders.

                                 MARTIN LAUER
                        After an exhaustive two year 
                        investigation, in which we heard 
                        testimony from aviation experts and 
                        mechanical engineers from both the 
                        private and military sector, as 
                        well as representatives from the 
                        Air Force Office of Special 
                        Investigations, the Federal 
                        Aviation Administration, the FBI, 
                        CIA and the Department of Homeland 
                        Security, we are in unanimous 
                        agreement that this tragedy 
                        resulted from a succession of human 
                        and mechanical malfunction: 
                        specifically temporary 
                        inconsistency between the airspeed 
                        measurements, likely following the 
                        obstruction of the pitot tubes that 
                        led to a stall which would have 
                        made it impossible for any pilot to 
                        recover.
                             (beat)
                        I know there are those who were 
                        hoping for better answers. People 
                        to blame. Guilt to assign. I’m 
                        sorry, but this is the truth and it 
                        needs to be accepted. We will 
                        grieve --

           SLAM TO --

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING

           CLOSE ON -- RUNNING FEET

           pounding pavement. 

                                 MARTIN LAUER (V.O.)
                        We will remember. We will go on.  

           We TILT UP -- finding Alex -- a lone figure running with the 
           Manhattan skyline looming in the backdrop -- concentrated 
           face barely visible underneath a grey hoodie. He’s still 
           boyish, but hardened. Haunted. SUPER:

                                    THREE YEARS LATER

           He speeds past us -- like he’s being pursued -- a loud RUSH 
           OF WIND as we SMASH TO --
           A SUBWAY CAR

           thundering down a dark tunnel.

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY

           Tightly crammed with morning commuters. Alex stands -- a 
           backpack slung over his shoulder -- eyes catching:

           A WOMAN

           with blonde streaks in her hair -- sitting across from him. 
           Her image triggers a memory.

           FLASHBACK --

           INT. BEDROOM - THREE YEARS EARLIER

           Alex lies in bed with his wife, LISA, massaging her feet. 
           It’s a perfect Sunday morning -- the kind Alex always looked 
           forward to.

                                 LISA
                             (cooing)
                        Mmm....now this is what husbands 
                        are for.

                                 ALEX
                        I thought it was to hunt and 
                        gather.

                                 LISA
                        And give great foot massages. I’m a 
                        lucky wife.

                                 ALEX
                        Good thing you reminded me. I don’t 
                        even recognize you with that hair.

                                 LISA
                        You don’t like it? I think it makes 
                        me look blonde.

                                 ALEX
                        It makes you look like you should 
                        be offering me a showcase showdown.

           She playfully tries to kick him.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I’m sorry, you’re beautiful, 
                        you’re beautiful.

           She stops. Their gazes meet. She’s enamored.
                                 LISA
                        God, I love you.

           Off Alex -- smiling -- equally in love --

           RESUME PRESENT:

           where we see in his current face just how lost he is without 
           her -- still carrying the pain.

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        I love you too.

           Then as Alex’s fingers play with the wedding ring he still 
           wears -- MUSIC BUILDS -- as we GO TO --

           EXT. MEATPACKING DISTRICT - MORNING

           A windy day. Camera pulls off the Hudson River -- and past 
           various WAREHOUSES -- to pick up Alex -- making his way up a 
           cobblestone street to a:

           NARROW OFFICE BUILDING

           tucked away off 10th Street -- with a construction chute 
           running down the side -- onto scaffolding. 

           Alex steps to the front door and pushes the buzzer for the 
           building’s sole occupant: “FOUNDATION”.

           NEW ANGLE -- A CCTV CAMERA POV

           staring down at Alex. He looks up. Gives a wave. BZZZ! The 
           heavy front door is buzzed open and Alex enters:

           INT. FOUNDATION OFFICES - RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS

           A modern space. Exposed brick. Giant wall screens display 
           Foundation’s online stories -- mostly investigative political 
           reports. A well-regarded independent news source.

           Alex passes DENA, the receptionist behind her desk.

                                 ALEX
                        Hey Dena, how’s your throat?

                                 DENA
                        It’s getting better, thanks. 

                                 ALEX
                        Red onion and raw honey always does 
                        the trick.
                                 DENA
                        Tell that to my boyfriend. Says he 
                        won’t kiss me now.

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah well, you’re too good for him 
                        anyway. See you later.

           She smiles and buzzes Alex through a glass door. PRELAP:

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        Situation is gonna get worse before 
                        it gets better, trust me.

           INT. FOUNDATION - NEWSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A large open office space dotted with cubicles and lined with 
           walls stacked with every publication imaginable.

           The staff is small -- but talented. About NINE REPORTERS. And 
           young. Median age is only 25. 

           Alex walks with his boss, managing director NOAH KESSLER, 
           40’s, ex-New York Times editor and wise beyond his years.

                                 NOAH
                        We talking Taiwan or my dating 
                        life?

                                 ALEX
                        Both. Two days ago, the Chinese 
                        defense minister was killed in a 
                        car bomb outside his summer home in 
                        the Zhejiang Province. 

                                 NOAH
                        I hope you’re not pitching me a two 
                        day old story.

                                 ALEX
                        The Guoanbu identified his assassin 
                        as Chun Zhang, a Taiwanese national 
                        with ties to their security 
                        service. As a result, Beijing has 
                        positioned 1200 cruise and 
                        ballistic missiles against key 
                        Taipei targets, including military 
                        bases, TV stations and airports. 

                                 NOAH
                             (shaking his head no)
                        The death of a high ranking Chinese 
                        official aside, this is all just 
                        posturing. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NOAH (CONT'D)
                        If Beijing ever moved on Taipei, 
                        the President would deploy the 
                        Nimitz battle group into the Taiwan 
                        Strait and the Chinese don’t have 
                        anything that can take out our 
                        carriers. 

                                 ALEX
                        That would be true -- except for 
                        the intelligence the CIA just 
                        received indicating that the 
                        Chinese have developed a new ASBM 
                        designed specifically to target a 
                        moving aircraft carrier. 

           Noah pauses. The longer this conversation has gone on, the 
           less hypothetical it seems. 

                                 NOAH
                        What the hell was Taiwan thinking?

           Alex shrugs. Unsure.

                                 ALEX
                        I just work here.

                                 NOAH
                        And you’re getting this from where?

                                 ALEX
                        Same source as always.

                                 NOAH
                        Be specific: same mystery source as 
                        always.

                                 ALEX
                        In two and a half years, he hasn’t 
                        steered me wrong yet.

                                 NOAH
                        A man of your intelligence and 
                        grasp of international policies 
                        being led to water by someone you 
                        only communicate with through the 
                        internet, Alex.

                                 ALEX
                        We work on the internet, Noah.

                                 NOAH
                        You know what I mean.
                                 ALEX
                        I never quote him directly. He’s 
                        just background. 

           Noah thinks. Nods. But warns:

                                 NOAH
                        Don’t misspell Philippines again.

                                 ALEX
                        That was one time.

           Alex leaves.

                                 NOAH
                        And have a draft on my desk by end 
                        of business. 

                                 ALEX
                        You won’t be sorry.

                                 NOAH
                        I will be if you’re right.

           Alex rounds a corner. Noah watches him go -- as we PRELAP:

                                 ALEX
                        Ben, Alex Bishop.

           INT. FOUNDATION - ALEX’S OFFICE - LATER

           START ON -- A PHOTOGRAPH

           of Alex and Emma, smiling at Coney Island. A precious 
           father/daughter moment.

           POP WIDE --

           Alex sits at his desk -- on the phone -- surrounded by stacks 
           of research documents. We see he’s methodically organized. 

                                 ALEX
                        Whoa, whoa, don’t hang up, this 
                        isn’t about you. 
                             (beat)
                        Well, it’s a little about you. I 
                        got a source. Looking for a second 
                        one. China, Taiwan. True or false: 
                        China’s position of their arsenal 
                        against Taipei: show of strength or 
                        strength of show? 

           JUMP CUT -- MOMENTS LATER
           and another phone call:

                        Mr. Jacobs, Alex Bishop from

           JUMP CUT -- MOMENTS LATER

           as Alex punches in a new phone number.

           JUMP CUT -- MOMENTS LATER

           and another conversation:

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        I’m not looking for a hypothetical. 
                        I got plenty of those on my own. 
                        What I’m looking for is a quote 
                        from you, on the record: if China 
                        moves on Taiwan, will President 
                        Dreyfuss move on China, are we 
                        talking early stages of the next 
                        World War? 

           JUMP CUT -- MOMENTS LATER

           where we see Alex typing away -- while consulting his hand-
           written notes. Just then -- SHELLY, a pretty co-worker, pops 
           her head into his office.

                                 SHELLY
                        Hey. Takin’ lunch orders. Chinese 
                        or street meat?

           Alex sees it’s now 12:30. He realizes he forgot something -- 

                                 ALEX
                        Shit.

           -- and scrambles to get up -- RUSHING out.

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Where we see Alex RACING up to a coffee shop.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Alex bombs inside, nearly out of breath. He looks around. 
           Doesn’t see what he’s searching for. Then -- A HAND appears 
           at the far end of the counter, waving at him. He crosses up 
           to his sister-in-law:

           RACHEL SADLER
           25. Leather jacket. Purple streaks in her hair. Fun.

                                 ALEX
                        Hey, sorry I’m late.

                                 RACHEL
                        Please. Only 15 minutes? That 
                        practically makes you early.

           LATER

           the two are at a booth -- laughing -- in mid-conversation.

                                 ALEX
                        And I hope you told him to get the 
                        hell out there right?

                                 RACHEL
                        Well...eventually.

                        Hey, fuck off. Not all of us have 
                        your impossible standards Alex. 
                        Speaking of which I heard things 
                        went pretty well with Marcy. Do 
                        tell. She's a lady and won't say 
                        anything.

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah. She’s sweet. Thanks for the 
                        intro.

                                 RACHEL
                        So you gonna call her?

                                 ALEX
                        It’s a busy week for me.

                                 RACHEL
                        You should. She told me she thought 
                        you were cute.

                                 ALEX
                        Thought you said she didn't say 
                        anything.

                                 RACHEL
                        It was in her tone. 
                                 ALEX
                        Rachel, you're my sister-in-law. 
                        Why do you keep pressuring me to 
                        date? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Answer me this, Einstein: would you 
                        have ever talked to my sister if I 
                        didn’t force you to?

                                 ALEX
                        No.

                                 RACHEL
                             (smiling)
                        Then I'm your only hope.

           Alex laughs. Shakes his head. Goes back to his food. Rachel 
           sees an opening.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        So Emma e-mailed me. Asked if I 
                        would take her to D.C. tomorrow. 
                        For the tribute. 

                                 ALEX
                        Emma has school. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Third grade. What she gonna miss?

                                 ALEX
                        Multiplication.

                                 RACHEL
                             (beat; gently)
                        She really wants to go, Alex.

                                 ALEX
                        Let me think about it.

                                 RACHEL
                        She says you already told her no.

           Alex nods.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        She also says you’re still having 
                        trouble sleeping. 

                                 ALEX
                        Emma says a lot. I need to do 
                        something about that.
                                 RACHEL
                        She’s worried about you. We both 
                        are.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m fine. I’m sorry she’s worried. 
                        I’ll talk to her.

                                 RACHEL
                        Maybe she’s not the only one you 
                        should talk to. 

                                 ALEX
                        I said I’m okay, Rach. The 
                        anniversary always make it harder, 
                        you know that. 

                                 RACHEL
                        She was my family too, Alex. But 
                        this isn’t healthy.

                                 ALEX
                        Are you asking me to forget?

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m asking you not to forget. We 
                        all miss her so much but what 
                        happened is now a part of you. You 
                        were a victim and you have to 
                        accept that. 

           Off Alex -- who we can see is having a hard time doing just 
           that -- we GO TO --

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           As Alex and Rachel step out of the restaurant. He gives her a 
           hug and a kiss goodbye -- as we make an ABRUPT CUT TO --

           INT. ANONYMOUS ROOM - SAME

           Where a TECHNICIAN lords over a room filled with monitors and 
           keyboards, constantly humming and processing, screens 
           bursting with code. Where the fuck are we?

           FULL SCREEN -- THE MONITORS

           featuring real-time video taken by security cameras and 
           satellites all around the world -- employing facial 
           recognition software so the minute the computers spot someone 
           on a watch-list in the footage, they isolate them by location 
           and display bio's, statistics and known acquaintances.

           AN IMAGE OF ALEX 
           soon pops up -- saying goodbye to Rachel -- audio of their 
           conversation playing over speakers.

           The tech logs information -- fingers moving a mile-a-minute -- 
           as we SNAP TO --

           EXT. BROOKLYN - NIGHT

           Alex hikes out of a subway station and starts walking the 
           tree-lined block to his house. PRELAP:

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        Alright baby, get to bed.

           INT. APARTMENT - EMMA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           As Alex tucks his daughter under the covers.

                                 ALEX
                        So you know, I spoke to Aunt Rachel 
                        today. She says you e-mailed her.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ALEX
                        Don’t be sorry. She’s family. But 
                        we talked about you going right --

                                 EMMA
                             (interrupting)
                        Dad --

                                 ALEX
                        We did right?

           Emma nods.

                                 EMMA
                        Yes.

           She looks down -- forlorn.

                                 ALEX
                        And if you really wanna go...I’ll 
                        call Rachel and give her the okay.

                                 EMMA
                             (lighting up)
                        Thanks, dad.
                                 ALEX
                             (hugging her)
                        I love you, Emma...and I’m sorry if 
                        I ever --

           Emma looks at him. Takes him off the hook.

                                 EMMA
                        Good night, dad.

           Alex smiles. God, she’s her mother. Rises.

                                 ALEX
                        Night.

           On his way out -- almost a threat:

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        And you are gonna learn how to 
                        multiply.

           He kills the lights -- as we GO TO --

           A SUBWAY CAR

           shooting past us.

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY

           Alex is lucky enough to have grabbed a seat this time. He 
           catches the rider next to him reading the AM subway paper. He 
           can’t ignore the front page: 

                          REMEMBERING AFO -- WE WILL NEVER FORGET

           Alex looks away -- as we CUT TO --

           EXT. FOUNDATION OFFICES - DAY

           Alex heads to work. Same routine. Just another day.

           INT. FOUNDATION - ALEX’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Alex passes JEFF, his assistant, at his desk, sipping coffee.

                                 ALEX
                        Morning.

                                 JEFF
                        Morning. Staff meeting in five. 
                        Coffee?

           Alex says “no” and enters his office. Plops down. Finds:
           A MANILA ENVELOPE

           resting up against his computer monitor. Blank -- except for 
           his name typed onto a white label.

           Alex takes the envelope. Wasn’t expecting one. Light. Slices 
           it open. Dumps into his palm:

           A FLASH DRIVE

           Alex’s eyes narrow -- curious.

           JUMP CUT -- SECONDS LATER

           as Alex inserts the drive into his computer.

           NEW ANGLE -- THE COMPUTER MONITOR

           as a file logo appears. Alex double-clicks.

           AN AUDIO FILE 

           starts to play over speakers. 

           STATIC 

           at first -- Alex unsure what he’s listening to -- but it soon 
           becomes crystal clear.

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        Roger Andrews, this is Air Force 
                        One. Cruising to a final altitude 
                        of 35,000 feet, nothing but blue to 
                        Virginia. 

           Alex BLINKS. Holy fuck -- this is the black box recording 
           from Air Force One.

           WE PLAY THIS ENTIRE SEQUENCE ON ALEX -- RIVETED -- GOING 
           THROUGH THE ALL EMOTIONS:

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        Little wake turbulence.

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        Level out, it's about ten degrees 
                        to the right level.

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        Roger.

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        Let me get back on the DME.
           The audio is suddenly filled by the shocking and sudden sound 
           of an EXPLOSION -- BOOOOOOM!

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        What the fuck was that?

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        Hydro pressure is all lost.

           Another EXPLOSION -- BOOOOOOM!

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        What the hell -- ?

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        Report, what’s happening back 
                        there?

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        We have a fire on engine number 
                        three, we have a fire on engine 
                        number three.

                                 COL. TURNER
                        We’re losing airspeed. I got no 
                        control.

           An alarm SOUNDS.

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        Jesus, smoke in the cockpit, smoke 
                        in the cabin.

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        Shut down engine number two! 

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        The gear won't retract!

           Another EXPLOSION -- BOOOOOOM!

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        What the fuck is going on?!?!

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        This is Air Force One, we have a 
                        code red. Request priority 
                        instructions. We are under attack. 
                        Repeat we are under attack.

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        We're not gonna make it! 
                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        Affirmative, I declare a full 
                        emergency. 

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        Mayday! Air Force One. Mayday! 

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        The airspeed -- the airspeed -- !

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        Oh my God.

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        Give it all you got, give it all 
                        you got.

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        Okay!

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        Set max power!

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        I can’t hold it. 

           Dual stall warning horns BLARE.

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        Bring it up, BRING IT UP!!!

                                 LT. HODGES
                        HOLY SWEET JESUS!

           THE SOUND OF IMPACT --

           -- then CHILLING STATIC.

           Alex is completely FROZEN. A statue. He can’t believe his 
           ears. Everything he was told -- everything the world believed 
           -- was a lie and this is the proof.

           A beat -- as he just sits there -- mind trying to process 
           what he just heard -- the deafening silence shattered by:

           JEFF

           sticking his head in.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey. Staff meeting’s starting.

           Alex jumps. 
                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Whoa. Sorry. You alright?

           Alex turns back to the screen.

                                 ALEX
                        Tell them I’ll be late.

                                 JEFF
                        But today there’s --

           Alex spins -- SNAPPING:

                                 ALEX
                        I SAID I’LL BE FUCKING LATE!

           Jeff is thrown. Never seen Alex explode. He nods and quickly 
           gets the hell out of there. Alex then reverses the recording. 
           Wants to hear it again.

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        What the fuck is going on?!?!

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        This is Air Force One, we have a 
                        code red. Request instructions. We 
                        are under attack. Repeat we are 
                        under attack.

           INT. ANONYMOUS ROOM - SAME

           A RED ALERT FLASHES on a monitor -- as a computer picks up 
           the Air Force One recording playing in Alex’s office and 
           matches the words from the black box transcript to an AUDIO 
           WATCH LIST.
           The Tech immediately grabs a phone.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        Sir, we have a confirmed audio hit 
                        off one of our watch lists. 
                        Recommend priority one protocols. 

           INT. FOUNDATION - ALEX’S OFFICE - SAME

           As the black box recording ends:

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        I can’t hold it. 

           Dual stall warning horns BLARE.

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        Bring it up, BRING IT UP!!!

                                 LT. HODGES
                        HOLY SWEET JESUS!

           Off which -- Alex quickly pulls out the zip-drive and pushes 
           away from his desk -- as we QUICKLY CUT TO --

           INT. FOUNDATION - BATHROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Where Alex practically collapses against the sink -- throwing 
           open the faucet. 

           He cups his hands. Catches water. Splashes his face. Lets it 
           run down as he stares at his reflection. He’s still 
           completely STUNNED. Needs a moment. Gathers himself.

           A beat -- then he shuts off the water -- and exits the 
           bathroom -- everything getting SPED UP -- as we BEGIN A FAST-
           PACED INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. A HALLWAY SOMEWHERE - INTERCUTTING

           As we track the back of a MAN heading up to a door -- and 
           swiping a key card through a scanner. A red light turns green 
           and the door unseals. Man enters:

           INT. A LOCKER ROOM SOMEWHERE - CONTINUOUS

           Where SIX MEN are changing out of clothes. Ex-Jarheads. 
           Bullet scarred military bodies. They slip on the same non-
           specific WHITE OVERALLS. 

           INT. FOUNDATION - CONFERENCE ROOM - INTERCUTTING

           Where the morning staff meeting is in progress. Save Alex, 
           all NINE EMPLOYEES are present. Noah holds court.
           INT. FOUNDATION - HALLWAY - SAME

           As Alex makes his way up a corridor -- heading straight for 
           the glass conference room doors.

           INT. A GARAGE SOMEWHERE - INTERCUTTING

           As the six men, now all dressed in identical work uniforms, 
           move with purpose and efficiency into a white van marked: 

           “PLG CARPET CLEANING” 

           which promptly peels out of an underground garage. 

           KNOCK, KNOCK.

           INT. FOUNDATION - CONFERENCE ROOM - INTERCUTTING

           As Alex opens up the door -- looking for Noah.

                                 NOAH
                        Alex, perfect time, can you get the 
                        team up to speed on the situation 
                        in Taiwan --

                                 ALEX
                        I need to talk to you.

                                 NOAH
                        Can’t it wait?

                                 ALEX
                        No.

           The look on Alex’s face says he means it. Noah rises. 

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - INTERCUTTING

           As the nondescript carpet van maneuvers around traffic.

           INT. FOUNDATION - NOAH’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Noah passes his ASSISTANT --

                                 NOAH
                        Ingrid, hold my calls please.

           -- and walks into his office with Alex, who shuts the door 
           behind him.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        You alright? You look like shit.

           Alex holds up the zip-drive.
                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                                 ALEX
                        This came to me this morning in a 
                        blank envelope.

           Alex breezes past his boss and plugs the zip-drive into his 
           computer. The file pops up. 

                                 NOAH
                        Alex, are you sure --

                                 ALEX
                             (cutting him off)
                        Just listen.

           Noah stops. Alex clicks on the file and the flight data 
           recording from Air Force One plays.

           Noah can’t believe his ears -- taken completely aback.

                                 NOAH
                        Where...did this come from?

                                 ALEX
                        I told you. It was in an envelope 
                        on my desk when I got here this 
                        morning.

           Noah goes back to the recording.

                                 COL. TURNER (V.O.)
                        What the fuck was that?

                                 CABIN VOICES (V.O.)
                        Hydro pressure is all lost.

           An EXPLOSION.

                                 LT. HODGES (V.O.)
                        What the hell -- ?

           Alex goes to the window. Helps himself to a glass of water. 
           Downs it all in one gulp. As he puts down the glass --

           -- we see his hand is SHAKING. He takes a moment to center 
           himself again -- then turns back to Noah -- who reacts to the 
           sound of Air Force One CRASHING into the Atlantic Ocean.

                                 NOAH
                        How do we know this is genuine?
                                 ALEX
                        We don’t, but if it is --

                                 NOAH
                        If it is, it’s evidence that 
                        someone cut the official black box 
                        recording and the leader of the 
                        free world was murdered. But if 
                        it’s fake, someone is trying to 
                        hurt you. Who do you think could’ve 
                        sent it to you?

                                 ALEX
                        I have no idea. But that’s step 
                        one.

                                 NOAH
                        No -- step one is taking one step 
                        back.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m not gonna sit on this.

                                 NOAH
                        I’m not suggesting that, but we 
                        need to know what we have here, so 
                        we know how to proceed.

                                 ALEX
                        What we have is proof my wife was 
                        killed. There was obviously a bomb -
                        - 

                                 NOAH
                             (cuts him off)
                        We need to be extremely careful. 
                        Now obviously, you’re in an 
                        emotional state --

                                 ALEX
                        This isn’t about me! Don’t you get 
                        it, this was planned by someone --

                                 NOAH
                        -- on an extremely emotional day.

                                 ALEX
                        Noah, that’s bullshit and you know 
                        it.

                                 NOAH
                        My point is we need to think about 
                        this objectively or not at all.  
           Alex stops. Calms.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Now...if this was anyone else, what 
                        would we do?

                                 ALEX
                             (beat)
                        Verify it. 

                                 NOAH
                        Exactly. 

           He locks eyes with him.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        And I promise you we’ll get to the 
                        truth of this.

           Alex nods. Have to do.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Now...think that Deep Throat of 
                        yours could’ve sent this to you?

                                 ALEX
                        He’s never done anything like this 
                        before. But I’ll ask.

           EXT. FOUNDATION OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

           The cleaning van pulls up and stops directly in front.

           INT. FOUNDATION - ALEX’S OFFICE - SAME

           Posts a PHOTOGRAPH of a JFK.  

           Waits. BZZZZ -- CUT TO --

           INT. FOUNDATION - RECEPTION AREA - SAME

           As one of the men in overalls is buzzed into the lobby.

                        Can I help --

           IN A FLASH --

           The man in overalls draws a silenced Vektor R6. Dena has 
           barely time to react before -- PHFT! -- there’s a bullet 
           between her eyes -- dropping her instantly.
           THE HIT SQUAD

           advances inside -- military formation -- faces now COVERED 
           behind SKI MASKS -- as:

           SHELLY

           comes walking into the lobby -- on her way out. She sees the 
           men -- the masks -- the guns -- the guard. 

           PHFT! PHFT! 

           Bullets erase her heart and brain -- hit squad making their 
           way further inside -- expert efficiency -- on the hunt.

           INT. FOUNDATION - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           As the hit team moves swiftly and quickly down the corridor.

           A FOUNDATION REPORTER

           steps out his office. But before he can yell --

           -- there’s a GLOVED HAND over his mouth -- and a BOOT to his 
           knee -- dropping him -- while a GUNMAN stands over him and 
           levels his gun at his face. He pulls the trigger -- PHFT! -- 
           as we GO TO --

           INT. FOUNDATION - ALEX’S OFFICE - SAME

           Where Alex continues to refresh the message board -- waiting 
           for a response on his post. Doesn’t get one.

           He then PAUSES -- when he sees:

           HIS CELL PHONE

           is registering NO SERVICE. His eyes narrow -- confused. He 
           then tries the land line -- but gets met with a BUSY SIGNAL.

           The phones have shut off. 

           Off Alex -- eyes narrowing -- curious:

           INT. FOUNDATION - ANOTHER OFFICE - SAME

           Another FOUNDATION EMPLOYEE is on the phone when he catches 
           the gunmen REFLECTED in his computer screen. He reacts --

                        Jesus --

           PHFT! PHFT! PHFT! Three QUICK SHOTS take him out -- employee 
           TOPPLING OVER -- SPILLING HIS DESK -- A LOUD CRASH! 
           INT. FOUNDATION - ALEX’S OFFICE - SAME

           The commotion causes Alex to look up. Rising -- he pockets 
           the flash-drive and goes to the door to investigate. 
           Immediately sees:

           SHADOWS 

           coming up the hall. Bodies and gun barrels. His mind zeroes 
           in on the threat and he turns to his assistant -- oblivious 
           in his chair.

                                 ALEX
                        Jeff, get down!

           THE GUNMEN

           come running up -- spraying shots -- Alex DIVING -- TACKLING 
           Jeff to the carpet -- bullets whizzing overhead.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Jeff, are you --

           He looks down. FREEZES. Jeff is DEAD -- body riddled -- his 
           blood now all over Alex’s clothes.

           Alex -- adrenaline-pumping -- shit, shit -- looks over. Sees 
           the gunmen moving up the corridor.

                                 NOAH (O.S.)
                        Alex?

           He turns. Sees:

           NOAH

           at the other end of the hall -- turning straight into the 
           gunmen’s path -- then stopping short -- fixed when he sees 
           the hit squad leveling guns.

                                 ALEX
                        NOAH -- RUN!!!!

           But it’s too late. PHFT! PHFT! PHFT! Noah is SHREDDED right 
           in front of Alex’s eyes.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        NO!!!

           Bullets fly back in Alex’s direction -- but he quickly DUCKS 
           behind a desk. The gunmen come for him. He’s running out of 
           time. He looks for options. Spies:

           directly across the hallway from where he’s sitting. It’s a 
           suicide run -- but he has no choice. Then as the gunmen swing 
           around to take him out -- 

           -- Alex BOLTS -- bullets chasing -- as he BOMBS across the 
           hall -- through the emergency door -- alarm WAILING -- lights 
           STROBING.

           CUT TO --

           INT. FOUNDATION - VARIOUS - SAME

           Where we see members of the hit squad systematically and 
           mercilessly eliminating the other Foundation employees -- as 
           we RETURN TO --

           INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

           As Alex goes TEARING DOWN the steps -- heart about to EXPLODE 
           -- stopping fast when he sees:

           ENERGY SAVING LIGHTS

           starting to SWITCH ON from below -- followed by FOOTFALLS 
           coming up from beneath him. 

           Alex quickly PIVOTS -- charging BACK UP the steps -- two at a 
           time -- racing for his life -- camera just trying to keep up -
           - HAND-HELD MADNESS as:

           THE SHOOTERS 

           OPEN FIRE -- bullets RICOCHETTING. Then barking into their 
           comm links:

                                 GUNMAN
                        He’s heading to the roof -- he’s 
                        heading to the roof!

           RESUME ALEX:

           sprinting -- slipping -- pushing himself up -- charging 
           ahead. 

           NEW ANGLE -- ONE OF THE GUNMEN

           EXPLODING out of another stairwell door -- one floor beneath 
           Alex. He gives chase -- GAINING -- as Alex reaches the ROOF 
           ACCESS DOOR and --

           EXT. FOUNDATION OFFICES - ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           -- BURSTS outside! -- moving to shut the door when:
           WHAM! The gunmen THROWS all his weight into the door -- 
           KNOCKING Alex down to the gravel.

           The shooter RACES onto the roof -- but Alex acts fast and 
           grabs a handful of gravel -- THROWING it into the gunman’s 
           face before he can fire.

           He SCREAMS in agony. Alex gets up -- CHARGES. The gunman 
           SLAMS back up against the door -- SHUTTING it -- before back-
           up can arrive.

           The gunman drops his weapon. Alex picks it up. BELTS the 
           gunmen across the face with it -- PISTOL-WHIPPING him. 

           BULLETS

           suddenly RIP through the access door -- causing Alex to RACE 
           AWAY to the roof’s edge -- where he SKIDS to a stop. Looks 
           down. Sees:

           THE CONSTRUCTION CHUTE

           going down the side of the building. 

           He turns back around as the gunmen charge onto the roof and -- 
           fuck he’s gotta do it -- makes the quick HAIL MARY MOVE to --

           -- LEAP OFF THE BUILDING -- INTO THE CHUTE -- SQUEEZING 
           THROUGH IT -- DROPPING AND SHOOTING ALL THE WAY DOWN TO:

           THE SCAFFOLDING BELOW

           where he vomits out the bottom with a loud CRASH -- impact 
           knocking the wind out of him. He GASPS.

           BACK ON THE ROOF:

           one of the gunmen gets on his comm. Relays Alex’s location.

           RESUME ALEX:

           as he somehow gains the strength to roll off the scaffolding 
           and into the alley -- body ACHING -- but he’s gotta move -- 
           stumbling back onto:

           EXT. MEATPACKING DISTRICT - SAME

           Where he goes CHARGING away from the Foundation offices. A 
           beat later --

           THE GUNMEN

           exit the front doors -- into their awaiting van -- ROARING 
           after him -- as we SLAM TO --
           INT. ANONYMOUS ROOM - SAME

           Where the tech hacks into Foundation’s close circuit SECURITY 
           SYSTEM. Accesses the VIDEO FEED. Pulls up the footage of the 
           gunmen shooting up the office -- and ERASES IT.

           Off which -- we hear a loud SCREECH -- as we GO FAST TO --

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - SAME

           As the van does a hair-pin turn around the corner -- gunning 
           after:

           ALEX

           running in front of it -- arms pumping -- cutting back onto 
           the sidewalk -- into a CROWD -- SLAMMING into bodies like a 
           pinball -- soon spying:

           A GROUP OF NYPD COPS

           standing near their cruiser. Van still on his ass -- about to 
           run him down -- Alex quickly CUTS LEFT -- making a beeline 
           for the cops -- SCREAMING:

                                 ALEX
                        HEY! OVER HERE! HELP!

           The cops turn in his direction. See Alex. The blood. The gun. 
           Instantly draw Glocks -- YELLING:

                                 COPS
                        GUN!/GET ON THE GROUND!/DOWN NOW!

           Alex stops -- throwing up his arms. 

           Cops RUSH him fast -- hurling him down -- planting his face 
           into pavement -- the cleaning van DRIVING on -- out of view. 

           Then off Alex -- WINCING -- the sound of handcuffs RATCHETING 
           -- we GO TO --

           INT. A DIFFERENT HALLWAY SOMEWHERE - NIGHT

           Where we see a MAN IN A SUIT walking -- Harvard and American 
           flag pins glistening. 

           INTERCUT:

           INT. A DIFFERENT HALLWAY SOMEWHERE - INTERCUTTING

           As the man in the suit’s phone rings. He stops. This is 
           THOMAS QUAYLE. 40’s. Close-cropped grey-hair.

                        Our world is getting smaller by the 
                        second. Tell me you have a plan in 
                        place to contain the damage. 

           INT. LEAR JET - INTERCUTTING

           Where we meet DAN RICHTER, 60’s with snowy-white hair. More 
           on him to come. 

                                 QUAYLE
                        I thought you never wanted to know 
                        specifics, Dan.

                                 RICHTER
                        Cut the shit, Tom. People are gonna 
                        start asking questions and I’m not 
                        gonna have the answers. How the 
                        fuck did the recording get out?

                                 QUAYLE
                        We’re still looking into it.

                                 RICHTER
                        Well why you’re looking into it, 
                        are we exposed or not? 

                                 QUAYLE
                        We’re still contained.

                                 RICHTER
                        This is a fucking disaster. 

                                 QUAYLE
                        No, a disaster is what happens if 
                        you don’t do what we pay you to do -
                        - which is not to worry about me. 

           CLICK. Quayle hangs up.

           END INTERCUT.

            -- as MORTON, Quayle’s number 2, crosses up to him.

           Establishing.

           INT. 22nd PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Alex sits in a seat -- despondent -- cuffed. He hears 
           something. Looks up. Soon -- the door UNLOCKS and swings 
           open. In walks Alex’s lawyer and friend, MICHAEL ARNOLD. 

           To the GUARD:

                                 MICHAEL
                             (re: cuffs)
                        Are those necessary?

                                 GUARD
                        That’s for you to prove counselor.

           The guard leaves. Closes the heavy steel door behind him. 
           Michael looks back to Alex.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You alright? How’s your --

                                 ALEX
                             (cutting him off)
                        Is Noah --

           Michael nods.

                                 MICHAEL
                        They all are.

           Alex can’t believe it -- head spinning.

                                 ALEX
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Tell me what’s going on.
           Alex hesitates.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Hey man, I can’t help you if I 
                        don’t know your side.

                                 ALEX
                             (looking up; incredulous)
                        My side? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        What happened at your office?

                                 ALEX
                        What are they saying happened?

                                 MICHAEL
                        They don’t know, but there are nine 
                        people dead and a preliminary 
                        ballistics report matches one of 
                        the slugs to the gun you were 
                        carrying when you were arrested --

           Alex is about to faint.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        -- plus the blood on your shirt 
                        that matches one of the victims.

                                 ALEX
                        I didn’t kill anyone, Mike. You’ve 
                        known me since college. Noah, Jeff, 
                        Shelly, Dena -- I worked with them 
                        for years. They were my family.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I understand, but I need more from 
                        you if I’m gonna do my job.

           Alex debates. How much can he involve Michael? A beat -- then 
           he shakes his head.

                                 ALEX
                        Not yet. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Alex --

                                 ALEX
                        -- But you need to do me a favor. 
                        When I was arrested, the police 
                        took a zip drive from my back 
                        pocket. Can you get it back for me?
                                 MICHAEL
                        Why, what’s on it?

                                 ALEX
                        Can you do that for me?

                                 MICHAEL
                             (beat)
                        I’ll look into it.

           Alex nods. Thanks.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        You’ll be arraigned in the morning.  
                        What are you gonna do about Emma?

           Alex pauses. Shit, he forgot all about Emma.

                                 ALEX
                        Umm, it’s fine. She’s with Lisa’s 
                        sister.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Alex, I just need to ask. Given 
                        that today is...well today, is 
                        there any chance --

                                 ALEX
                        What, that I snapped? That I killed 
                        my friends and co-workers because I 
                        lost my wife three years ago?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Had to ask.

                                 ALEX
                        No. You didn’t.

           Michael nods. Okay. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sit tight. We’ll get through this.

           He rises. Leaves. Alex watches him go.

           INT. 22nd PRECINCT - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Exiting -- Michael flags down a passing LIEUTENANT.

                                 MICHAEL
                        ‘Scuse me, Lieutenant.

           The lieutenant stops. Michael hands over his card.
                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m Michael Arnold. I’m 
                        representing Alex Bishop. I was 
                        wondering if was at all possible to 
                        get a look at his personal 
                        belongings.

                                 LIEUTENANT
                        Would if you could, but someone 
                        from the FBI picked up his stuff an 
                        hour ago.

           As Michael reacts -- the lieutenant walks away. Off which -- 
           music starts to BUILD -- as we GO TO --

           INT. 22nd PRECINCT - MOTOR POOL - DAY

           As a handcuffed Alex is led to an awaiting Crown Victoria by 
           two seasoned NYPD DETECTIVES. 

           They put him in the backseat and shut the door. Seconds 
           later, the Crown Vic peels out of the garage.

           SNAP TO --

           GOD’S POV over the city. We just make out the Crown Victoria 
           driving down an avenue.

           INT. CROWN VICTORIA - DAY

           Alex sits quietly in the back -- eyes out the window -- mind 
           exhausted -- body still aching.

           INT. ANONYMOUS ROOM - SAME

           Where the technician is keeping track of the unmarked car 
           with the use of several traffic cams.

           As the Crown Victoria drives past -- entering lower

           INT. CROWN VICTORIA - SAME

           As Alex notices the car breezing past New York City Criminal 
           Court -- home to Central Booking. 

           He turns back to the two detectives -- up front -- silent.

                                 ALEX
                        Where are you taking me?
           They don’t respond. Alex looks up. Sees they are taking him 
           across the nearby BROOKLYN BRIDGE.

           This isn’t right. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Where are we going?

           Again -- no response. Alex is getting increasingly nervous. 
           That’s when he sees:

           reflected in the front mirror. He whips around. Sees the 
           white van driving up behind them.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Shit -- fuck. 

           He whips back forward. The cops have no reaction. 

           Alex knows they’re in on it -- and immediately starts 
           SCRAMBLING -- trying to slip the cuffs from his back -- under 
           his feet -- Detective #1 the first to take notice -- YELLING:

                                 DETECTIVE #1
                        HEY! PUT YOUR FUCKING LEGS DOWN!

           Alex doesn’t listen -- getting his hands in front of him. 

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME

           As the white van ROARS UP --

           INT. CROWN VICTORIA - SAME

           -- Alex pivots around in his seat -- and starts KICKING out 
           the window.

                                 DETECTIVE #1
                        HEY! 

           Detective #1 goes for his Glock as --

           -- SMASH! -- Alex BREAKS the glass -- wind RUSHING IN!

           DETECTIVE #2

           cranks the wheel -- 

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME

           -- causing the Crown Victoria to swerve wildly into another 
           lane --
           INT. CROWN VICTORIA - SAME

           -- THROWING Alex across the back of the car as -- 

           BANG! 

           Detective #1 discharges his gun -- bullet just missing Alex -- 
           who quickly crawls back over to the busted window and reaches 
           out --

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME

           -- throwing open the door. He’s about to jump out when --

           VROOOOSH! -- the white van BULLETS FORWARD -- nearly taking 
           Alex’s head -- EXPLODING the door to Crown Victoria CLEAN 
           OFF. 

           INT. CROWN VICTORIA - SAME

           Alex JUMPS BACK -- FUCK THAT WAS CLOSE! 

           Detective #1 AIMS again -- about to fire. Alex -- zero choice 
           -- 

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME

           -- LEAPS out of the moving car -- HITTING the ground at 45 
           mph -- SMACKING HARD against pavement -- into a ROLL. He just 
           settles when:

           HEADLIGHT BEAMS

           hit him in the face. He looks up. 

           TRAFFIC

           is ROARING UP toward him -- and he quickly ROLLS out of the 
           way as --

           -- the white van SKIDS to a stop. REVERSES at TOP-SPEED.

           Alex pushes himself up off the ground. Has to out run the van 
           -- about to take him out when -- he HOPS onto the hood of an 
           oncoming truck -- CLIMBING onto the roof -- just as --

           -- the van CRASHES into the truck -- SLAMMING into the front 
           bumper -- glass SHATTERING -- metal SMASHING.

           But Alex can’t stop now -- has to keep going -- rolling off 
           the truck -- back onto the bridge -- leaving a PILE-UP behind 
           him -- running for his life -- sweat pouring -- living a 
           NIGHTMARE -- the sound suddenly DROPPING OUT -- replaced by:

                        So we know everything about him, 
                        but we don’t know how the fuck he 
                        got away from us? 

           Silence from the team.

                                 QUAYLE (CONT’D)
                        Any record of any service?

                        Can we have the subject’s psych 
                        profile please?

           A TECH pulls up a PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE on Alex.

                                 MORTON (CONT’D)
                        Since the crash, Bishop’s been one 
                        of 33 individuals we’ve had under 
                        permanent audio and visual 
                        surveillance: home, office, gym, 
                        phones, email. Psych-ops flagged 
                        him following an incident at a town 
                        hall meeting three years ago. 

           NEW ANGLE -- A MONITOR

           Hand-held video footage appears of a haggard and wild-looking 
           Alex raging at an AIR FORCE SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR at a town 
           hall meeting.

                                 ALEX
                        Telling us what? You’re not telling 
                        us anything! How did this happen!?! 
                        These things don’t just happen!

           The image freezes as Alex is man-handled and taken down 
           forcibly by SECURITY.

           RESUME:

                                 MORTON
                        On the drive home, he got snagged 
                        for a DUI. Blew a .22. Judge gave 
                        him probation. First offense. But 
                        he quickly cleaned himself up for 
                        the sake of his 7 year-old 
                        daughter. Went back to work. Never 
                        mentioned the crash again. Dr. 
                        Gillings diagnosed him with acute 
                        clinical depression and survivors 
                        guilt. He’s never fully accepted 
                        his wife’s death. 

                                 QUAYLE
                        And he won’t now. He’s gonna see 
                        this through to the end. 
                                 MORTON
                        There’s state and federal warrants 
                        out for his arrest. There’s no way 
                        out for him. 

                                 QUAYLE
                        I don’t care. I want full 
                        containment and exposure protocols 
                        in place. Activate the asset.

           Morton nods --

                                 MORTON
                        Yes, sir.

           -- and grabs a phone -- as we GO TO --

           INT. ONE BEDROOM RENTAL - DAY

           Cheap as they come. Walls lined with water stains and 
           cigarette burns. 

           YAHGER 

           lies in bed -- staring up at the ceiling. Ex-Special Forces. 
           Half moons under his eyes. Hasn’t slept in days. 

           A baby is crying in the adjacent room. He doesn’t stir. Numb.

           A CELL PHONE

           buzzes on a dresser. His eyes shift. A beat -- and he rises. 
           Checks the display and pockets the phone.

           JUMP CUT -- SECONDS LATER

           as Yahger pops up a prescription medicine bottle. Dumps some 
           Zoloft. Swallows.

           JUMP CUT -- SECONDS LATER

           as Yahger produces a SIG .40 Cal. Racks the slide. Press 
           checks the chamber. Slips it behind his back -- under his 
           shirt. Exits. 

           There will be no evidence he was ever there.

           GO TO --

           EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           A low-rent maintenance shop in Queens. Tomb-like silence. We 
           see the back door has been BUSTED OPEN.
           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Where we find Alex, lit by moon shadow, rummaging through a 
           row of open employee LOCKERS.

           QUICK CUTS --

           as he finds an extra set of clothes. Slips them on. Locates a 
           wallet. Some bills. Then a phone. We hear it DIALING -- as we 
           GO TO --

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

           A starry night. Peaceful. We PAN DOWN from the Washington 
           Monument to find Rachel walking with Emma -- her phone 
           ringing. She doesn’t recognize the number. Answers.

                                 RACHEL
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT:

           EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           As Alex talks -- tucked behind the garage -- away from the 
           road and any person/camera.

                                 ALEX
                        Rachel, it’s me, how’s Emma?

                                 RACHEL
                        She’s fine. What phone is this?

                                 ALEX
                        It doesn’t matter. Look --

                                 RACHEL
                        I gotta say I thought you’d be 
                        calling us every hour on the hour --

                                 ALEX
                        Rachel, I need you to shut up. 
                        They’re gonna be listening to this 
                        call.

           Rachel quiets -- now worried.

                                 RACHEL
                        What are you talking about, who?

                                 ALEX
                        Doesn’t matter. I need you to do 
                        something for me. It’s extremely 
                        important. I need you to take Emma 
                        and disappear until you hear from 
                        me. You understand? Disappear. I 
                        don’t wanna know where you’re 
                        going, but don’t use your credit 
                        card or anything with your name on 
                        it. Can you do that for me? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Alex, what the hell is --

                                 ALEX
                        Please. I don’t have much time. I 
                        need to know you and Emma are safe.

                                 RACHEL
                        Okay, you’re freaking me out now.

                                 ALEX
                        Rachel, promise. 

           Beat.

                                 RACHEL
                        Okay.

           Alex exhales -- relieved. 

                                 ALEX
                        Let me talk to Emma.

           Rachel hands the phone to Emma.

                                 EMMA
                        Hello.

                                 ALEX
                        Emma, hey, how are you?

                                 EMMA
                        What’s going on? Aunt Rachel’s 
                        scared.

                                 ALEX
                        I know, but everything’s okay, 
                        baby. I just want you to know how 
                        much I love you. No matter what you 
                        hear, you have to believe that. Do 
                        you believe that?
           Emma is thrown -- but still:

                                 EMMA
                        Yes.

           Alex smiles.

                                 ALEX
                        I love you, baby. Be a good girl 
                        and I’ll talk to you real soon.

           Alex hangs up.

           END INTERCUT.

           Alex then quickly turns the phone over -- pops out the 
           battery -- and throws it into his pocket.

           We then hear the sound of an AIRPLANE ENGINE ROAR -- as we GO 
           TO --

           EXT. AIRPORT MOTEL - NIGHT

           Establishing. Located right by JFK. Seedy as hell.

           tuned to the news -- re-broadcasting footage of the AIR FORCE 
           ONE CRASH ANNIVERSARY TRIBUTE in Washington, DC -- earlier 
           that day. 

           PRESIDENT HOWARD DREYFUSS 

           reads from the Bible -- as images of make-shift memorials and 
           photos of President Singer dissolve into each other.

                                 PRESIDENT DREYFUSS
                        “God is our refuge and strength. He 
                        dwells in his city, does marvelous 
                        things and says, be still and know 
                        that I am God.”

           POP WIDE --

           and we see Alex checking in -- paying cash to the pimply-
           faced NIGHT CLERK. As he preps a key -- the sound of names 
           being read draws Alex’s attention back to the TV -- where:

                        Lisa Bishop, Jordan Mallah...

           Off Alex -- reacting to his wife’s name -- shaken -- GO TO --

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Alex steps inside. Stains you can and can’t see.

           JUMP CUT -- SECONDS LATER

           as Alex crashes -- lays his head down on the bed -- in badly 
           need of sleep. As his eyes close --

           FLASH CUT TO --

           TURQUOISE OCEAN

           stretching to the horizon. 

           RESUME ALEX:

           eyes fluttering under their lids.

           RESUME OCEAN:

           as we PULL BACK TO REVEAL we’re inside:

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - MID SECTION CABIN - DREAM SEQUENCE

           Alex stares out the window -- at the endless expanse of water 
           thousands of feet below -- then turns to the woman in the 
           seat beside him:

           LISA

           who smiles sweetly at him -- before taking his hand in her’s. 
           Alex smiles back -- then stares ahead -- at:

           THE PRESIDENTIAL SEAL

           on the wall in front of him. 

           POP WIDE --

           The cabin is filled with VIP’s: donors, State Department 
           officials.

           Suddenly -- TURBULENCE. Then a DING -- and the seat belt sign 
           LIGHTS UP. Alex -- tensing up -- turns to Lisa -- who looks 
           back in his direction as --

           -- BOOM! AN EXPLOSION LIGHTS UP THE SIDE OF HER FACE!
           Alex just has enough time to react before --

           -- AIR FORCE ONE DROPS TWO HUNDRED FEET! 

           ALEX AND LISA GRIP THEIR SEATS -- EVERYONE SCREAMING NOW -- 
           ENGINES WHINING -- OXYGEN MASKS SWINGING WILDLY -- THEN --

           -- ANOTHER EXPLOSION! -- AIR FORCE ONE RIPPING APART -- AS WE 
           SLAM BACK TO --

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - PRESENT

           As Alex BOLTS AWAKE -- sweating -- disoriented. A beat -- as 
           he calms himself -- heart POUNDING. He sits back up -- 
           shutting his eyes -- stabilizing himself. Another beat -- 
           then he looks up -- calmer -- to:

           THE STOLEN CELL PHONE

           resting on the dresser.

           INT. AIRPORT MOTEL - SAME

           Where the night clerk sits at his post, flipping through a 
           community college Chemistry book, not paying attention to the 
           TV, still on, still playing the news -- now featuring:

           A NBC 4 REPORT

           on Alex’s escape from the Brooklyn Bridge -- complete with 
           MUG SHOT and COMMENTARY:

                                 COMMENTARY
                        ...suspect identified as Alex 
                        Bishop escaped from custody earlier 
                        today. Bishop, whose wife Lisa, was 
                        a translator for the State 
                        Department, died during the Air 
                        Force One crash three years ago and 
                        sources tell us the anniversary may 
                        have caused some sort of psychotic 
                        breakdown. If you see Bishop --

           Clerk looks up and immediately recognize the man in the mug 
           shot as the guest in room 224.

           RESUME ALEX:

           as he pulls out the cell phone battery from his pocket and 
           plugs it back in -- beginning a FAST-PACED INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT. HIGHWAY - INTERCUTTING

           As a fleet of POLICE CRUISERS and a SWAT VAN ROAR BY.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - INTERCUTTING

           As Alex logs onto the conspiracy theory message board we saw 
           him post on at Foundation. Sees someone has replied to his 
           message with an image of:

           SOVIET PREMIER NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV 

           Alex then takes the phone and puts it up to the mirror -- 
           revealing an ENCRYPTED MESSAGE hidden in Khrushchev’s face. 

           EXT. AIRPORT MOTEL - INTERCUTTING

           As the cop cars THUNDER UP -- SCREECHING to a stop -- police 
           EXPLODING out -- RUSHING inside.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - INTERCUTTING

           As Alex writes down the message:

                                  BARTHOLDI PARK -- 2 PM

           He pockets the paper and unplugs the battery again -- as we 
           GO TO --

           INT. AIRPORT MOTEL - HALLWAY - INTERCUTTING

           As a SWAT TEAM charges down the hall -- an imposing moving 
           force -- cutting straight up to Alex’s room -- TEAM LEADER 
           giving the nod to one of his men -- who SWINGS a SLEDGE 
           HAMMER and --

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- WHAM! -- the door EXPLODES off its hinges. Wood SPLINTERS! 
           SWAT STAMPEDES inside but -- Alex is GONE. Off which -- we GO 
           TO --

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           As an Amtrak train ROCKETS by.

           INT. AMTRAK TRAIN - DAY

           An exhausted Alex sits by the window -- head resting against 
           the glass -- but he can’t afford sleep. Not now.

           INT. QUAYLE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Where wall monitors display every news broadcast from around 
           the world -- majority of which are devoting coverage to the 
           escalating situation between China and Taiwan -- as well as 
           America’s possible involvement in the conflict. We get a 
           sampling:
                                 CNN
                        ...on the orders of President 
                        Dreyfuss, the Nimitz battle group 
                        just left the Japanese port of 
                        Yokosuka on Tokyo Bay -- en route 
                        to Taiwan -- despite repeated 
                        warnings from Beijing that they 
                        will attack anyone who interferes 
                        with this "internal security 
                        operation”.

           We see Quayle takes little notice of the coverage. As if he 
           was already aware of what was going to be covered.

           Soon -- Morton enters. 

                                 MORTON
                        Sir, we have an update on Bishop.

           Quayle looks up from his desk.

                                 QUAYLE
                        Where’s the asset?

                                 MORTON
                        En route. One hour out.

           Quayle nods and rises -- as we GO TO --

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           FLYING over our nation’s capital -- before arriving:

           EXT. BARTHOLDI PARK - DAY

           Across from Independence Avenue -- dotted with people. Alex 
           comes walking up -- eyes on the lookout -- checking faces. 

           But he’s not sure what he’s looking for -- and hopes he’ll 
           know when he sees it.

           Soon -- he makes his way over to:

           THE BARTHOLDI FOUNTAIN

           and sits down. Waits. Seconds tick by like minutes. He feels 
           exposed. Is this a set up? Unsure. He continues scanning 
           people. All he sees is danger lurking. 

           HIS POV SNAPS AROUND: 

           a LOCAL reaching into his pocket -- for a GUN? No -- just a 
           PHONE. Then -- a VENDOR locking eyes with him -- then turning 
           away -- giving change to a CUSTOMER.
           A DRUNK

           can be heard slurring words -- STUMBLING nearby. Alex avoids 
           eye contact. Looks back to his watch and sees it’s 2:02. Is 
           his contact going to show?

           Unsure. Just then --

           A MAN IN A RAINCOAT

           approaches -- coming straight at Alex. Could be him. 

           No. He cuts right at the fountain -- going to meet his 
           GIRLFRIEND. They walk off together.

           Alex -- shit -- looks back at his watch. 2:05. Looks back up. 
           That’s when he sees:

           HIS FACE ON THE COVER OF USA TODAY

           and he rises -- heading over to a NEWSSTAND to pick up a 
           copy. He quickly flips through it. The story pegs him as a 
           crazed employee who shot up his own office.

           Alex is STUNNED -- reading over phrases like “mental 
           breakdown” and “accusations of plagiarism”.

           Fuck he thinks -- they’re not just trying to kill me -- 
           they’re trying to kill my reputation. 

           He quickly puts the paper down -- turning to see:

           TWO DC COPS

           on patrol -- and Alex immediately freezes. Fuck. He turns his 
           back to them. 

           Shit -- can’t stay out in the open like this. A beat -- then 
           he makes the call --

           -- to start walking calmly away from the park -- when:

           CLICK! A SPRINGFIELD ARMORY XD 

           appears in his back -- a voice WHISPERING:

                                 VOICE
                        Walk forward, eyes ahead, don’t 
                        turn around.

           Alex nods. Starts forward. Tries to get a look at the person 
           holding him at gunpoint -- but can’t. Gets led down a:

           TUNNEL
           where the voice stops Alex. 

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Turn around.

           We assume the voice belongs to Yahger but when Alex turns 
           around he comes face to face with:

           ERIC BRYANT

           30’s. Steel-jawed. All-business. He pats Alex down -- looking 
           for bugs. Doesn’t find any. He tucks his gun behind his back.

                                 BRYANT
                        I honestly figured this for a 
                        fool’s errand. I didn’t think you’d 
                        be alive today.

                                 ALEX
                        Who are you?

                                 BRYANT
                        Frank Church. Fidel Castro. Ronald 
                        Reagan. Nikita Khrushchev. 

           Alex reacts. They’re the names of all the people his source 
           has hidden messages in.

                                 BRYANT (CONT’D)
                        You’re a desperate man coming to 
                        me.

                                 ALEX
                        I had no choice. I need your help. 

                                 BRYANT
                        Not with this.

                                 ALEX
                        Please. You have to. I have no 
                        where else to go.

           Bryant considers Alex -- then:

                                 BRYANT
                        What do you know? Start at the 
                        beginning. Give me all the details. 
                        Leave nothing out. 

                                 ALEX
                             (recapping)
                        Alright...when I showed up for work 
                        yesterday, there was a manila 
                        folder on my desk. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALEX (CONT'D)
                        Had my name on it. When I opened it 
                        up there was a flash drive inside. 
                        I played it and it was the black 
                        box recording from Air Force One. 

                                 BRYANT
                        What did it say?

                                 ALEX
                        It said there were explosions. That 
                        it wasn’t an accident. The plane 
                        was taken down. 

                                 BRYANT
                        You’re suggesting that the United 
                        States government covered up the 
                        murder of their own Commander-in-
                        Chief?

                                 ALEX
                        Who else has power like that?

           Bryant pauses -- thinking -- then:

                                 BRYANT
                        And you have no idea who sent it to 
                        you?

                                 ALEX
                        I thought maybe you might’ve.

                                 BRYANT
                        No.
                             (beat)
                        Who else knows about this?

                                 ALEX
                        Besides you? No one.

                                 BRYANT
                        You didn’t tell anyone else?

                                 ALEX
                        Anyone I told is dead.

           Just then --

           THE DRUNK

           from before comes stumbling up the tunnel. Bryant takes Alex 
           by the arm and starts moving him out.
                                 BRYANT
                        We gotta move. They know you’re 
                        here.

                                 ALEX
                        What?

                                 BRYANT
                        Just keep walking.

           INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - SAME

           Quayle lords over several technicians -- watching screens of 
           uplinked videos and satellite imagery of Bartholdi Park. We 
           see Bryant leading Alex away on one of the screens as --

           EXT. BARTHOLDI PARK - SAME

           -- the drunk catches up them -- still on the move.

                                 DRUNK
                        Hey young man, can I get some 
                        change?

                                 BRYANT
                        Fuck off.

                                 DRUNK
                        Come on man, one lousy dollar. 

                                 BRYANT
                        I said --

           IN A FLASH --

           The drunk is SOBER -- LASHING OUT -- KICKING out the back of 
           Bryant’s knee -- KNOCKING him to the ground -- STOMPING on 
           his face -- SLAMMING his head against the concrete -- DRAWING 
           a Smith & Wesson Model 442 Airweight -- and STICKING it in 
           Alex’s face.

           Meet ROBERT HIRSCH -- 50’s -- gray hair -- face like a worn 
           suitcase -- been everywhere.

           Alex is completely MYSTIFIED. Hirsch speaks with a slight 
           BOSTON IRISH ACCENT.

                                 HIRSCH
                        He was right about one thing.

           Hirsch then leans down -- exposing:

           A HIDDEN COMM LINK
           under Bryant’s shirt. He rips it loose.

                                 HIRSCH (CONT’D)
                        We gotta keep moving.

           He then pockets his gun -- replacing it with a phone. Snaps a 
           picture of Bryant’s face -- as we GO TO --

           INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - SAME

           As the room reacts to Hirsch’s introduction -- everyone 
           ACTIVATING -- trying to regain control:

                                 TECH
                        He’s getting help, he’s getting 
                        help!

                                 QUAYLE
                        Alpha, beta teams, move in.

                                 MORTON
                        Yahger, you are a go. I repeat, 
                        you’re a go.

           EXT. BARTHOLDI PARK - SAME

           As a GRAB TEAM EXPLODES out of twin black vans -- concealing 
           guns and fanning out. 

           Chief among them -- the asset we recognize as:

           YAHGER

           leading the squad.

           INT. TUNNEL - SAME

           Hirsch is walking ahead -- when Alex reaches down and draws 
           Bryant’s Springfield Armory XD. COCKS the trigger.

                                 ALEX
                        Who the fuck are you?

           Hirsch turns.

                                 HIRSCH
                        I’m the one you’ve been dealing 
                        with for the last three years.

                                 ALEX
                        He said the same thing. How do I 
                        know I can trust you?
                                 HIRSCH
                        You don’t.

                                 ALEX
                        Then why should I?

                                 HIRSCH
                        I’m not asking you to.

                                 ALEX
                        Then why’d you come here?

                                 HIRSCH
                        I needed to know what they knew 
                        about me.

                                 ALEX
                        Who?

           Hirsch pauses -- hearing something. He then turns and walks 
           away -- without answering.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        WHO!?!

           Still no answer. Alex runs up to him. Throws his hand onto 
           Hirsch’s shoulder. 

           Bad move.

           Hirsch GRABS Alex’s hand -- CRANKS it back -- CRACK! -- SPINS 
           and -- WHACK! -- BELTS Alex across the face -- dropping him 
           like a hot plate -- before continuing on -- not skipping a 
           beat -- slipping Bryant’s comm into his ear -- and exiting 
           the tunnel.

           Off Alex -- bleeding -- trying to get this head around what’s 
           happening -- GO TO --  

           EXT. BARTHOLDI PARK - SAME

           As Yahger’s team continues the hunt -- searching for Alex. A 
           moment later --

           -- Alex comes rushing out of the tunnel -- head whipping in 
           every direction -- looking for Hirsch -- FREEZING when he 
           sees:

           YAHGER AND THE GRAB TEAM

           heading toward him. 

           He spins back around -- scanning -- then through the crowd:
           HIRSCH

           calmly exiting the park -- hands in his pockets.

           Alex pauses -- thinking -- grab team advancing on every side 
           of him. 

           He forms a fast plan -- pulls out Bryant’s gun and -- BANG! 
           BANG! -- OPENS FIRE INTO THE AIR.

           INSTANT PANIC! HAND-HELD MAYHEM! 

           PEOPLE SCATTER -- a STAMPEDE cutting in front of Alex and the 
           grab team -- giving Alex the opening to TAKE OFF -- BOOKING 
           through the park -- in pursuit of Hirsch -- throwing people 
           aside -- grab team RACING after him -- but Alex isn’t 
           stopping -- reaching:

           THE PARKING LOT

           where Hirsch climbs into a SUV and PEELS AWAY. Seconds later -
           -

           ALEX

           comes running up -- just missing him. He turns. Sees another 
           MAN about to get into an Audi nearby. 

           Alex crosses over to him -- aiming his gun -- SCREAMING at 
           the driver to: 

                                 ALEX
                        GET AWAY, GET AWAY!

           VERY FAST -- Alex YANKS the driver away from the Audi -- HOPS 
           inside -- SLAMS the door -- HITS the gas -- and SPEEDS AWAY 
           as:

           YAHGER AND THE GRAB TEAM

           run up -- take aim -- and lay down some fire -- bullets --

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           -- SHATTERING the rear windows -- raining in glass -- Alex 
           DUCKING -- turning the wheel -- CUTTING onto --

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           -- a busy street -- SLAMMING into an oncoming car -- but NOT 
           STOPPING -- TEARING OFF -- THUNDERING after Hirsch’s SUV.
           INT. SUV - SAME

           As Hirsch switches gears -- twisting the wheel -- 

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           -- making a tight turn -- tires SCREEEEEEECHING.

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           Wind whipping -- Alex takes the same corner -- 

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           -- as TWO POLICE CRUISERS explode out of a side street -- 
           joining the pursuit -- cutting into the lane behind Alex.

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           Alex -- driving on pure instinct -- catches the cruisers in 
           the rear-view -- bubble lights spinning.

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           As one of the cop cars pulls alongside Alex --

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           -- who CRANKS the wheel -- and --

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           -- RAMS the cruiser hard -- sending it CRASHING head-on into 
           a hydrant -- BUSTING the engine -- taking it out of the 
           chase.

           INT. HIRSCH’S SUV - SAME

           Cars FLYING up in the windshield -- Hirsch swerves to avoid 
           multiple collisions -- blowing past other cars -- trying to 
           shake Alex off --

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           -- but he’s GUNNING for him -- the second cruiser still on 
           his ass until --

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           -- Alex switches gears -- seeing a traffic light up ahead 
           switch to RED. He SLAMS HARDER on the gas and --
           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           -- EXPLODES through the intersection -- narrowly dodging a 
           crash -- the cop car unable to do the same -- getting CLIPPED 
           in the side -- sending it SPINNING out of control.

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           Alex continues to race forward -- gaining ground on Hirsch.

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           As Alex RAMS into the back of the SUV --

           INT. SUV - SAME

           -- JOLTING Hirsch -- who loses control of the wheel -- 
           swerving wildly -- before steading the ride.

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           Alex FLOORS it again -- 

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           -- SMASHING into the SUV -- harder -- sending the two cars 
           veering toward an UNDERPASS --

           INT. SUV - SAME

           Hirsch tries to spin the wheel --

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           -- but it’s too late -- Alex sending Hirsch’s car CRASHING 
           into a stone barrier -- 

           INT. SUV - SAME

           As the AIR BAG DEPLOYS -- catching Hirsch’s face --

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           -- while Alex’s head SNAPS forward -- neck nearly breaking.

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SECONDS LATER

           Then with cars still ZIPPING by -- a POLICE HELICOPTER now 
           BUZZING overhead -- Alex and Hirsch both STORM out of their 
           cars -- up to each other -- SCREAMING:

                                                          ALEX
                          HIRSCH
           What the fuck do you think --
                                              I want answers Goddammit!
                                 ALEX
                        Who killed my wife? Who’s behind 
                        this!?! TELL ME!

           Hirsch pauses -- seeing Alex’s intensity -- the fire in his 
           eyes -- then calming:

                                 HIRSCH
                        I don’t know.

                                 ALEX
                        But you can find out. You always 
                        have information for me and I need 
                        to know --

                                 HIRSCH
                        But I don’t wanna know.

                                 ALEX
                        What the fuck does that mean?

                                 HIRSCH
                        It means this time is different and 
                        you should turn yourself in and 
                        accept whatever you get cause it’s 
                        better than going up against 
                        whoever it is that is after you 
                        now.

                                 ALEX
                        I got a daughter -- I can’t turn 
                        myself in. I have to find out what 
                        to happened to my wife!

                                 HIRSCH
                        Why? It won’t bring her back.

                                 ALEX
                        That’s not the point.

                                 HIRSCH
                        It is the point. And as soon as you 
                        realize that, the better off both 
                        of us will be -- because right now 
                        you’re a threat to everyone you 
                        know.

           NEW ANGLE -- THE GRAB TEAM VAN

           roaring down the street -- in and out of traffic -- moments 
           from them.

           RESUME:
                                 ALEX
                        I can’t drop this.

                                 HIRSCH
                        Then I’m sorry.

                                 ALEX
                        Fuck sorry. You’ve helped me 
                        before.

                                 HIRSCH
                        Anonymously. 

                                 ALEX
                        I can’t do this on my own! 

                                 HIRSCH
                        I don’t get involved! 

                                 ALEX
                        Then why show up at all? 

                                 HIRSCH
                        I told you: to know what they know 
                        about me. Now that I do, I’m gone 
                        for good.

           He heads back to his car.

                                 ALEX
                        You’re a fucking coward you know 
                        that. 

           Hirsch ignores him.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        When did you ever fight for 
                        anything, huh?

           But that strikes a deep nerve -- and he charges back over to 
           Alex -- right in his face -- spitting:

                                 HIRSCH
                        Hey fuck you! You don’t know shit 
                        about me. You just sit in your 
                        fucking office and wait for people 
                        like me to tell you when to take a 
                        piss. People like me who risk their 
                        lives for you, this country and if 
                        Lisa wasn’t your wife --

                                 ALEX
                        Wait, you knew my wife?
           Hirsch quiets -- revealing too much. Alex presses:

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        How did you know my wife?

           He’s about to say when -- 

           ONE OF THE GRAB TEAM VANS

           appears. They have to move fast.

                                 HIRSCH
                        Get in the car.

           Alex and Hirsch quickly get back in the Audi -- Hirsch now 
           taking the wheel -- PEELING AWAY -- the grab team van in fast 
           pursuit -- following them back onto:

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Where the van TEARS after the Audi -- EXPLODING through 
           traffic -- ROARING UP -- SLAMMING into the back of the Audi --

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           -- ROCKING Hirsch and Alex -- who spin to escape a car 
           approaching in the window. 

           Slicing through traffic:

                                 HIRSCH
                        Look through the glove box.

           Alex does. Finds a map.

                                 HIRSCH (CONT’D)
                        Find me a route.

           INT. VAN - SAME

           As Yahger locks and loads an IMI Uzi.

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           As Hirsch -- twisting the wheel -- confesses:

                                 HIRSCH
                        I used to work with Lisa.

                                 ALEX
                        At the State Department?

           He shakes his head.
                                 HIRSCH
                        Lisa didn’t work for the State 
                        Department.
                             (turns to Alex)
                        She was CIA.

           Alex is floored. Just then --

           -- BULLETS START WHIZZING BY THEIR HEADS!

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           As Yahger unloads the IMI Uzi out the window -- SHREDDING the 
           back of the Audi --

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           -- causing Alex and Hirsch to DUCK -- rounds FLYING -- glass 
           SHATTERING all around them -- sending fragments SPRAYING.

                                 ALEX
                        TURN RIGHT HERE, TURN RIGHT!

           Hirsch does --

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           -- hoping the curb -- screaming down another street -- the 
           van matching the same move -- gunmen still FIRING.

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           Going 50 -- 60 -- 70 mph -- Hirsch creates an opening between 
           two cars -- SPEEDING AHEAD -- the van not skipping a beat -- 
           Hirsch not able to shake them -- until he sees --

           UP AHEAD --

           A CONSTRUCTION SITE

           and he spins the wheel -- driving straight for it -- 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

           -- the van right on his ass -- breakneck pace -- when --

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           -- Hirsch makes a last second turn -- just cutting around: 

           A TRAILER

           which the van is unable to avoid -- CRASHING right into it as 
           the Audi SPEEDS ON -- 
           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME

           -- exiting the construction site -- and back onto:

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           Where it disappears around a corner.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME

           As the second grab team van arrives -- gunmen from the 
           crashed car jumping out -- 

           INT. VAN - SAME

           -- Yahger activates an explosive device hidden inside the 
           car. Steps out --

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME

           -- and jumps into the second van -- doors sliding shut -- as 
           it RACES OFF -- leaving the other car behind.

           A beat later --

           -- BOOOOOOM! -- the first van EXPLODES -- INCINERATING any 
           evidence of who or what was inside it. Off which -- we 
           QUICKLY SMASH BACK TO --

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           Where the Audi hasn’t slowed at all -- still hauling ass. 
           Right behind them --

           THE SECOND VAN

           careens around a corner -- ROARING UP.

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           Alex calls out directions --

                                 ALEX
                        Left, take a left!

           Hirsch spins the wheel -- as the Audi takes MORE GUNFIRE.

           INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - SAME

           Where Quayle and his team continue to monitor the chase.
           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           The Audi cuts around the car in front of them -- shaving off 
           side-mirrors -- the van still eating up road -- closing. 

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           Hirsch continues to drive focused -- but urgent:

                                 HIRSCH
                        Where am I going?

                                 ALEX
                             (consulting the map)
                        Take the next right, then another 
                        right.

                                 HIRSCH
                        What?

                                 ALEX
                        Trust me.

           Hirsch comes up to the first right --

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           -- and makes the sudden fast turn -- van SCREECHING to copy. 
           Off which -- we SMASH TO --

           A NEARBY TRAIN CROSSING

           and the Audi speeding toward the tracks -- 

           -- just as a TRAIN comes roaring down them. They have to time 
           this just right.

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           Hirsch switches gears. DROPS the hammer.

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - SAME

           And BLOWS through the crossing -- just clearing the train one 
           second before it would OBLITERATE IT -- ROARING AHEAD -- 
           leaving:

           YAHGER’S VAN

           behind. No choice but to stop. Out of the chase.

           INT. AUDI - SAME

           Alex looks back ahead -- rattled -- as we RETURN TO --
           INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - DAY

           Where Quayle is LIVID.

                                 QUAYLE
                        I want every feed in and around the 
                        park pulled. Scrub every image for 
                        Bishop’s source. I want a face, a 
                        name and everything he’s done from 
                        birth til right now. Get on it!

           The team hurries -- carrying out Quayle’s orders -- as we GO 
           TO --

           EXT. ROADSIDE DINER - NIGHT

           A complete dump. We see the Audi parked in front. PRELAP:

                                 HIRSCH (V.O.)
                        I grew up south side of Boston.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Populated by TRUCKERS -- downing coffee. Alex and Hirsch are 
           at a table together. Patsy Cline plays over the jukebox.

                                 HIRSCH
                        Little punk kid. Not much of a 
                        future. Nickel and dime robberies 
                        by the time I was 10, graduating to 
                        armored cars and banks by 19. No 
                        way I wasn’t gonna end up dead or 
                        in jail -- but then one night, me 
                        and my friends decided to hit up a 
                        vault, completely ignoring every 
                        rule I set up for myself. Ended up 
                        tripping an alarm. Three friends I 
                        was with went down for it. I 
                        somehow got out. Ran like hell. 
                        Didn’t stop. Ended up all the way 
                        in the Army, if you could fuckin’ 
                        believe it. Wasn’t long before the 
                        agency noticed I was talented. 
                        Pulled me out. Drew me in. Trained 
                        me in ways you couldn’t imagine. 
                        Then non-official cover posts in 
                        Beirut, Berlin, Damascus, Rome. 
                        They moved me around every four 
                        years before finally dry-docking me 
                        in New York.

                                 ALEX
                        Tell me about Lisa.
                                 HIRSCH
                        Before I left the agency, Lisa 
                        worked for me at the Shop. I was 
                        her handler.

                                 ALEX
                        The Shop, what’s that?

                                 HIRSCH
                        It was the CIA’s Systems 
                        Procurement Group. We’d figured out 
                        ways to access high security 
                        installations: military bases, 
                        embassies, intelligence hubs. Then 
                        we’d break-in. Plant surveillance.  
                        Crack firewalls. Vaults. Obtain 
                        codes. Your wife was a chief 
                        analyst. As good as they come. 
                             (means it)
                        I liked her a great deal.

           Hirsch sees that Alex is having a hard time with this.

                                 HIRSCH (CONT’D)
                        She never told you because she 
                        wanted to protect you and Emma -- 
                        but she never did anything more 
                        than the planning. 

           That seems to take the sting out -- but only slightly. 

                                 ALEX
                        The people who killed her took 
                        everything away from me. The black 
                        box is the key to bringing them 
                        down.

                                 HIRSCH
                        You’ll never get it -- if it even 
                        still exists.

                                 ALEX
                        But maybe if I find out who sent it 
                        to me.

                                 HIRSCH
                        If whoever gave it to you wanted 
                        you to know who it was from, 
                        believe me you’d know. Shit, 
                        they’re probably just as scared as 
                        you are. If more so.

                                 ALEX
                        And you?
                                 HIRSCH
                        I already told you. I don’t do this 
                        anymore -- and you should quit 
                        while you’re alive.

                                 ALEX
                        You don’t have a choice anymore. 
                        You can’t just disappear. They’re 
                        gonna come after you now too.

                                 HIRSCH
                        I’ll take my chances.

           Beat.

                                 HIRSCH (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

           Alex just looks at him -- shaking his head.

                                 ALEX
                        Don't apologize to me. 92 people 
                        died and you knew the truth and 
                        chose to ignore it. 

           With that -- Alex rises -- and leaves in a huff. 

           Off Hirsch -- those words starting to resonate -- we GO TO --

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Where we see Alex hiking -- cars ZOOMING past -- splashing 
           mud. He tries to flag one down. No takers -- until:

           THE AUDI

           comes pulling up. Slows. Alex stops. Hirsch swings the door 
           open. Waits.

           Alex considers Hirsch -- sees he’s serious -- then climbs 
           into the passenger seat. He shuts the door and Hirsch pulls 
           away -- as we CUT TO --

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME

           Where we reunite with the asset we remember as:

           YAHGER

           on his knees -- praying -- before looking over to the bed 
           where his gun is resting on a white hotel towel -- just 
           cleaned. He picks it up -- and SLAMS home a magazine -- as we 
           GO TO --
           EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK - NIGHT

           Parallel to railroad tracks -- a series of WAREHOUSES. The 
           Audi comes driving up -- pulling into one of the warehouses -- 
           stopping inside:

           AN INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR

           which it rides up to:

           INT. WAREHOUSE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           A large industrial space -- filled with electronic equipment 
           and rows and rows of file cabinets. Alex steps out of the car 
           -- following Hirsch up to his work space -- which also 
           includes a cot.

                                 ALEX
                        This your home?

                                 HIRSCH
                        One of them.

                                 ALEX
                        How many places you got?

                                 HIRSCH
                             (plopping down at his 
                              desk)
                        Not counting two private storage 
                        lockers, three switch-out cars and 
                        four different sets of Go-Bags in 
                        bus stations and airports -- seven. 
                        You can never be too careful when 
                        it comes to information or an exit.  

                                 ALEX
                        Three days ago I’d say you were 
                        paranoid.

                                 HIRSCH
                        When I left the agency, I went into 
                        private security. Just made enough 
                        cash to disappear last year.

                                 ALEX
                        Why’d you wanna disappear so badly?

                                 HIRSCH
                        Cause after 20 years of 
                        intelligence work, you get a real 
                        good look at humanity’s dark side.

                        You see what we’re really capable 
                        of and once you do, it’s best to 
                        avoid it as much as possible.

                                 ALEX
                        Doesn’t exactly track with you 
                        feeding me intel.

                                 HIRSCH
                        I suppose it doesn’t, but you have 
                        to be loyal to something.

                                 ALEX
                        The truth?

                                 HIRSCH
                        Your wife.

           Alex stops. Hirsch sees the look.

                                 HIRSCH (CONT’D)
                        Easy sport, I’m old enough to be 
                        her father. She was my protégé, 
                        that’s all.

           Under this -- Hirsch plugs his camera phone into a computer. 
           Pulls up the photo he took of Bryant. Starts running facial 
           recognition software on the image.

                             (distracted)
                        Huh?

                        Is someone with your daughter?

           Alex nods.

                        Lisa’s sister. Rachel. I told her 
                        to go into hiding. I don’t know 
                        where.

           Hirsch nods.

                        you. Go to the closet. Help 
                        yourself to some new clothes.

                        In the bathroom, under the sink, 
                        there’s some hair dye. We gotta 
                        change your whole appearance.

           Alex nods -- heads away.

           INT. WAREHOUSE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Alex steps inside -- carrying a new set of clothes. He shuts 
           the door behind him. 

           Looks in the mirror. Almost doesn’t recognize the reflection: 
           all cut up -- disheveled -- exhausted.

           He splashes his face with water -- trying to rouse himself. 
           He then ducks down -- opening up the cabinet beneath the 
           sink. Finds the bottle of hair dye.

           As he grabs it -- he pauses -- mind racing -- eyes narrowing. 
           A memory triggers. 

           FLASH TO --

           INT. BATHROOM - THREE YEARS AGO

           Where Alex watches his wife dying her hair blonde in the 
           bathroom sink.

           RESUME PRESENT:

           as Alex realizes something -- his jaw tightening. Off which -- 
           we RETURN TO --

           INT. WAREHOUSE OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

           As Hirsch continues to run facial recognition software on 
           Bryant’s photo -- looking for a match against several 
           intelligence databases -- when:

           ALEX 

           comes storming up -- face tight -- looking like he’s about to 
           blow up. Hirsch turns around in his chair --

                                 HIRSCH
                        Hey, we almost --

           -- and WHAM! -- Alex BELTS Hirsch across the face with a 
           closed fist -- knocking him off his chair.

                                 HIRSCH (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck!?!
                                 ALEX
                        Lisa wasn’t an analyst. She didn’t 
                        do research. She was an operative, 
                        wasn’t she?

           Hirsch is silent -- Alex now EXPLODING:

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        WASN’T SHE!?!

           Hirsch spits blood from his cut lip -- and looks up at Alex.

                                 HIRSCH
                        She ran missions, yeah. When I left   
                        she was heading her own office, 
                        reporting directly to the director. 

                                 ALEX
                        And the President?

           Hirsch nods. Explains what she was really doing on Air Force 
           One. Alex looks furious -- prompting Hirsch to ask:

                                 HIRSCH
                        You mad cause I didn’t tell you or 
                        cause she didn’t?

                                 ALEX
                        We never kept secrets. I thought I 
                        knew everything about her, but 
                        now...

                                 HIRSCH
                        Your wife loved you. Talked about 
                        you and Emma all the time. She was 
                        truly special, Alex. And no matter 
                        who she was, she was that. Don’t 
                        forget: you saw the real her. 
                        Everyone else, including me, saw 
                        the lie.

           Alex pauses -- Hirsch’s words resonating with him. A moment 
           of silence passes -- then:

           THE FACIAL RECOGNITION PROGRAM

           gets a hit -- matching Bryant’s picture against a database. 
           But Alex doesn’t break from Hirsch.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m sorry.

           Hirsch nods -- conceding.
                                 HIRSCH
                        Got a good right there.
                             (beat; back to serious)
                        Don’t fucking do it again.

           Alex smirks. Offers a hand. Hirsch takes it. Tension buried. 

           Hirsch then sits back down and looks to the monitor -- where 
           a classified bio of ERIC BRYANT appears.

                                 HIRSCH (CONT’D)
                        Let see who we got.
                             (reading)
                        Bryant, Eric, R. Enlisted Army at 
                        18. Ranger school, sniper school. 
                        Four years as Delta. Special 
                        Forces. Three tours in Iraq, 
                        Afghanistan. Dishonorably 
                        discharged a year ago. Punched out 
                        his CO.

                                 ALEX
                        So he’s no longer government. 

                                 HIRSCH
                        Or he’s not officially. Let’s see 
                        who’s paying his bills.

           Hirsch types some commands -- breaking through firewalls and 
           pulling up:

           BRYANT’S FINANCIAL RECORDS

           and looking them over we see an entry for a company called:

                                 ALEX
                        The Straton Group. Never heard of 
                        them.

           Hirsch pulls up the company website. Reads the official 
           description:

                                 HIRSCH
                        The Straton Group pioneers 
                        technology and solutions to combat 
                        global risks faced by the national 
                        security community. 

                                 ALEX
                        Can you get us a board of 
                        directors?

           Hirsch types again. Pulls up a list of board member names. 
           Alex recognizes one immediately:
                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Martin Lauer.

           Hirsch pulls up Lauer’s profile. We immediately remember him:

                                 HIRSCH
                        From the AFO Commission.

           Alex nods. Jesus. Off which -- music SPIKES -- as we GO FAST 
           TO --

           Shooting over America’s heartland -- nothing but golden 
           fields -- until a building complex comes into view:

           EXT. THE STRATON GROUP HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Comprised of several structures -- sprawling and imposing. 
           Looks like the main hub for any Fortune 500 company.

           flaps proudly in the breeze -- atop a pole.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
                        Good afternoon, the Straton Group.

           Where we find Quayle sitting at the head of a large glass 
           conference table -- BOARD MEMBERS on either side -- listening 
           to an EMPLOYEE give a FINANCIAL PRESENTATION at the head of 
           the room.

           Quayle’s SECRETARY crosses up to her boss -- handing him a 
           phone.
                                 SECRETARY
                        The call you were waiting for sir.

           Quayle nods -- taking the phone -- heading over to a window.

                                 QUAYLE
                        This is Quayle.

           INTERCUT RICHTER:

                                 RICHTER
                        Time to get your fucking house in 
                        order, Tom.

                                 QUAYLE
                        Everything is under control.

                                 RICHTER
                        Not on my end.

                                 QUAYLE
                        Then that’s your problem.

                                 RICHTER
                        My problem is your problem. Don’t 
                        forget who your biggest customer 
                        is. I’m starting to hear things.

                                 QUAYLE
                        What kind of things?

                                 RICHTER
                        Hearings. Investigations.

                                 QUAYLE
                        Just whispers.

                                 RICHTER
                        No, yesterday it was whispers. 
                        Today they’re talking into 
                        bullhorns. Where are we with 
                        Bishop?

                                 QUAYLE
                        Closing the net. 

                                 RICHTER
                        And this new player, Hirsch?

                                 QUAYLE
                        Him too.

                                 RICHTER
                        Get this done. 
           Richter hangs up. 

           END INTERCUT.

                        Good morning, Director.

                        want to send a shadow? 

           Morton pulls up the identity of subject 26-B and when he sees 
           it’s Lauer --

           a 70 foot statue comprised of five aluminum pieces buried in 
           the ground -- giving the appearance of an afflicted man 
           attempting to free himself from the Earth.

           Lauer turns. Finds:

           ALEX

           also holding an umbrella -- with his hair now dyed DARKER.

                                 ALEX
                        Know who I am?

           Lauer nods.

                                 MARTIN LAUER
                        You’re the wanted man.

                                 ALEX
                        I wanna know about the Straton 
                        Group.

                                 MARTIN LAUER
                        I’m sure there’s literature you 
                        could download.
                                 ALEX
                        I wanna know what they don’t 
                        publicize -- like crashing Air 
                        Force One.

                                 MARTIN LAUER
                        And you’re here for what? A 
                        confession? What do you expect to 
                        accomplish today?

                                 ALEX
                        I’m gonna burn them to the ground.

                                 MARTIN LAUER
                        Please. You’re standing in 
                        quicksand, trying to push up the 
                        air. You need a better plan. 

           Alex takes out a pre-paid cell phone. Dials.

                                 MARTIN LAUER (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 ALEX
                        Introducing you to the better plan.

           Lauer’s eyes narrow -- waiting. What’s Alex’s play here? A 
           beat -- then someone answers the call.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Me. I’m with him right now. You 
                        where you’re supposed to be?
                             (beat; nods)
                        Hold on.

           He hands the phone to Lauer -- who puts it to his ear. We 
           hear Hirsch’s voice.

                                 HIRSCH (V.O.)
                        Your wife is very beautiful. It’s 
                        understandable then why she chooses 
                        to keep the blinds up in the master 
                        bedroom...which just happens to 
                        allow for perfect line of sight.  

           Lauer’s eyes widen. Alex shows no emotion.

           EXT. BUILDING - ROOF TOP - SAME

           Where we see Hirsch staring through the Leupold Mark 4 scope 
           of a NEMESIS ARMS VANQUISH SNIPER RIFLE.

                             (into an ear piece)
                        At this range, it’ll take half-a-
                        second to take her head clean off.

           RESUME ALEX AND LAUER:

           Lauer reacts -- lowering the phone -- then hanging up and 
           dialing his wife.

                                 MARTIN LAUER
                        Melissa, where are you right now? 

                                 MELISSA (V.O.)
                        I’m at home.

                                 MARTIN LAUER
                        Where at home?

                        In the bedroom, why?

           Lauer hangs up. Looks at Alex.

                                 MARTIN LAUER
                        You’re no killer.

                                 ALEX
                        Not according to the people you 
                        work for. Now who would you rather 
                        protect: them or Melissa?

           Lauer pauses -- then lowers his guard:

                                 MARTIN LAUER
                        You and your wife are so much

                        against here. They will go the

                        Wait, what do you mean, Taiwan?

                                 MARTIN LAUER
                        You really think what’s happening 
                        isn’t by design -- their design?

           PHFT! 

           A bullet RIPS through the top of Lauer’s umbrella and through 
           his head -- spraying blood -- SCARY AND FAST.

           Alex -- shit -- as Lauer collapses instantly to the ground. 

           Then just as fast -- a second round slices through Alex’s 
           umbrella -- GRAZING his cheek -- knocking him to the ground.

           PHFT!

           A third bullet hits Alex in the leg. 

           He SCREAMS and SCRAMBLES -- SCURRYING behind the Awakening 
           statue -- a fourth bullet striking the aluminium hand as he 
           DUCKS behind it -- PING!

           NEW ANGLE -- ALEX’S LEG

           gushing blood.

           Alex acts quickly -- pulling off his belt -- and tying it 
           around his thigh -- creating a tourniquet -- YELLING from the 
           pain.

           NEW ANGLE -- SNIPER SCOPE POV

           cross-hairs searching for Alex’s head -- unable to see him 
           behind the statue.

           RESUME ALEX:

           trapped -- looking out -- seeing Lauer’s dead body sprawled 
           across the ground -- blood and brain matter mixing with the 
           rain.

           INT. BUILDING - EMPTY FLOOR - SAME

           Perched at a window overlooking the harbor is:

           YAHGER

           aiming an Olympic Arms K23B rifle.

           RESUME SNIPER SCOPE POV:

           as Alex’s profile suddenly appears in the cross-hairs. Easy 
           kill shot.
           Yahger starts to pull back on the trigger -- about to take 
           out Alex when --

           HIS HEAD EXPLODES -- BULLET PIERCING HIS TEMPLE!

           What the fuck just happened?

           NEW ANGLE -- HIRSCH

           looking up from his rifle -- having just taken Yahger out.

           POP WIDE -- 

           and WE REVEAL that the roof top we saw Hirsch on earlier is 
           actually at the Harbour -- NOT across the street from Lauer’s 
           wife.

           RESUME ALEX:

           pelted with rain -- bleeding -- but alive.

           EXT. NATIONAL HARBOR - ROOFTOP - SAME

           QUICK CUTS --

           as Hirsch systematically breaks down the sniper rifle into 
           WEAPON PIECES -- barrel, receiver, butt stock, scope -- and 
           zips them up into a TACTICAL BACKPACK -- throwing it over his 
           shoulder -- and disappearing down a fire escape.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE OFFICE - NIGHT

           Establishing. Eerily quiet. We see the lights suddenly SHUT 
           OFF and --

           INT. WAREHOUSE OFFICE - NIGHT

           -- BOOM! -- the door EXPLODES OPEN! A HIT SQUAD BURSTS IN -- 
           wearing GT-14 NIGHT VISION MONOCULARS and carrying silenced 
           Zastava M21A assault rifles. 

           They’re looking for Alex and Hirsch -- but the office is 
           DESERTED -- and upon closer inspection --

           -- all the COMPUTER HARD DRIVES have been removed -- files 
           EMPTIED -- and the monitors, tables and chairs soaked with 
           Clorox. Off which -- we GO TO --

           A nondescript APARTMENT COMPLEX for rentals only.

           INT. HIRSCH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Bare. No photos or art. Not even a TV. Just supplies, a stack 
           of books, a table and a few chairs.

           QUICK CUTS --

           as Alex lies down onto a table -- belt removed from around 
           his thigh -- his pant leg cut open -- revealing the bullet 
           wound -- still bleeding.

           Hirsch prepares SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS to remove the slug. 
           Snapping on a pair of gloves -- he gets to work -- dousing 
           the wound with alcohol.

           Alex winces -- and just starts talking to get his mind off 
           the pain:

                                 ALEX
                        So you believe him? Lauer?

           Hirsch wipes excess blood away from the wound with a cloth.

                                 HIRSCH
                        I’m starting to think that Straton  
                        will do anything to protect their 
                        interests.

           Hirsch then takes some forceps:

                                 HIRSCH (CONT’D)
                        This may hurt.

           Alex nods and steadies himself. Hirsch probes the wound with 
           the forceps. Alex fights through the pain:

                                 ALEX
                        Lauer says they’re manipulating the 
                        United States into a conflict with 
                        China. President Singer would’ve 
                        never authorized such an action. He 
                        said as much in his UN speech two 
                        weeks before he died.

                                 HIRSCH
                        But Dreyfuss?
                                 ALEX
                             (gritting)
                        Yesterday, he ordered the Nimitz 
                        battle group into the Taiwan 
                        Strait. In 24 hours we could be at 
                        war thanks to Straton.

                                 HIRSCH
                        Old story. Don’t like the king’s 
                        rule. Just replace the king. 

           Hirsch then starts fishing around for the bullet with the 
           forceps.

                                 ALEX
                        Think my wife knew about Straton? 
                        Is that what Lauer meant what he 
                        said we were alike?

                                 HIRSCH
                        It’s possible. But any secrets she 
                        had about them died with her. 

           Finally -- there! -- Hirsch gets a handle on the slug and 
           with a sharp tug -- yanks it clean out. 

           Alex exhales -- sweating.

           Hirsch then drops the bullet into a nearby jar. CLINK. Turns 
           back to his patient.

                                 HIRSCH (CONT’D)
                        What do we you wanna do now?

                                 ALEX
                        You mean after I pass out?

           Hirsch nods.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        My wife, the country, they deserve 
                        answers, not more lies. I wanna 
                        bring the whole fucking company 
                        down. 

                                 HIRSCH
                        You can barely stand up. 

                                 ALEX
                        Somebody has to.

           Off which -- music BUILDS -- everything SPEEDING UP -- as we 
           SLAM TO --

           A DIGITAL LOCK

           as Hirsch attaches an electronic code breaker to it. Starts 
           downloading numerical code possibilities until the correct 
           four digit pin is entered. The lock UNSEALS -- and Hirsch 
           slips inside:

           INT. OFFICE SOMEWHERE - NIGHT

           Completely empty. Lit by moon shadow. Hirsch beelines over to 
           a computer terminal and switches it on. Gets met by a STRATON 
           GROUP screen-saver.

           He’s just broken into their Washington DC branch office. As 
           he types -- he gets met by a series of FIREWALLS -- which he 
           expertly BYPASSES.

           Where we see a public works van parked in the adjacent alley.

           INT. VAN - SAME

           Where Alex is keeping his eyes on a computer monitor -- which 
           is synced into Hirsch’s screen -- so Alex sees everything 
           that Hirsch decrypts.

           INT. THE STRATON GROUP - D.C. BRANCH - OFFICE - SAME

           As Hirsch cracks the final firewall -- gaining access to

                                 ALEX
                        According to this, Straton just 
                        moved $50 billion to off-shore 
                        accounts.

                        What the hell are they spending $50 
                        billion on?

           Hirsch’s eyes narrow -- lost. Alex explains:

                        If China goes to war with America, 
                        Beijing would have to devalue their 
                        currency to be able to afford it. 
                        Which would give Straton the 
                        ability to buy back America’s debt. 
                        They would control our entire

                        least wipe off your prints.

                        Force One wasn’t an accident.

                                 HIRSCH
                        But an act of foreign terrorism.

           And as this all comes together --

                                 ALEX
                        Jesus Christ.

           -- an ALARM SOUNDS -- JOLTING Alex.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           ON HIRSCH’S SCREEN --

           we see a SECURITY ALERT FLASH -- and the files are INSTANTLY 
           DELETED from both computers.

           Alex tries to stop them from erasing -- but it’s no use.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Fuck, fuck.
                             (into his comm)
                        Hirsch, get the fuck out of there 
                        now!

           INT. THE STRATON GROUP - D.C. BRANCH - OFFICE - SAME

           Too late. Hirsch hits the floor as -- BAM! -- the door KICKS 
           IN -- GUNMEN STORMING INSIDE -- ANNOUNCING THEMSELVES WITH 
           CONTROLLED BURSTS FROM H&K MACHINE GUNS -- DESTROYING 
           EVERYTHING IN THEIR PATH -- INCLUDING COMPUTERS AND WINDOWS: 
           RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT! 

           Bullets whizzing by -- Hirsch draws his Glock. Fires back. 

           BANG! BANG!

           Two gunmen go down -- the third ducking back -- as Hirsch 
           lays down more cover fire -- RISING -- and rushing out 
           another door -- as we RETURN TO --
           INT. VAN - SAME

           As Alex LEAPS behind the wheel -- throws on the ignition and 
           PEELS AWAY.

           IN THE WINDSHIELD -- A STRATON GUARD 

           steps out of a side door -- in front of the van -- about to 
           level his machine gun and FIRE when --

           -- Alex HITS the gas -- SLAMMING into the guard -- SPINNING 
           him like a top -- and THUNDERING around the corner and back 
           in front as --

           EXT. THE STRATON GROUP - D.C. BRANCH - SAME

           -- Hirsch EXPLODES out of an access door -- just as the van 
           SCREECHES to a stop in front of him.

           STRATON GUARDS

           soon come rushing up -- firing -- as Alex LEAPS out the front 
           door -- laying down cover rounds from a Sig -- trading 
           bullets with the guards while SCREAMING at Hirsch to:

                                 ALEX
                        Get in the van!

           Hirsch -- also firing -- jumps into the passenger seat. Then 
           as the guards DUCK BACK -- Alex -- still firing -- climbs 
           back into the van -- 

           INT. VAN - SAME

           -- drops the hammer -- and SPEEDS OFF --

           EXT. THE STRATON GROUP - D.C. BRANCH - SAME

           -- bullets chasing them -- but they’re GONE -- around a 
           corner. GO TO --

           EXT. LAWRENCE, KANSAS - NIGHT

           SILENTLY SAILING over corn fields at night -- nothing but 
           black -- until we arrive at the Straton Group Headquarters.

           A TOWN CAR

           pulls up in front. Quayle steps out and heads inside.
           INT. THE STRATON GROUP HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           As Quayle makes his way up to a sealed door -- placing his 
           hand onto a scanner -- which then unlocks the magnetic seal 
           and allows him access to:

           INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Which EXPLODES WITH SOUND -- from techs SCRAMBLING -- trying 
           to get a handle on the DC security breech. 

           Entering with full authority:

                                 QUAYLE
                        Alright, it’s been twenty minutes, 
                        what do we know?

           But no one answers -- still buzzing -- working. Quayle heads 
           over to a computer terminal -- and RIPS it right out of the 
           desk -- HURLING the machine across the room -- where it SLAMS 
           against the wall -- SILENCING THE ROOM.

                                 QUAYLE (CONT’D)
                        What. Do. We. Know?

           Morton steps up.

                                 MORTON
                        We know Bishop and Hirsch gained 
                        access to our protected server for 
                        117 seconds.

                                 QUAYLE
                        And in that time saw what?

                                 MORTON
                        We don’t know.

                                 QUAYLE
                        You don’t know or I don’t wanna 
                        know?

                                 MORTON
                        We don’t know. It could’ve been any 
                        number of things: office 
                        extensions, petty cash receipts --

                                 QUAYLE
                        Classified intelligence files, eyes 
                        only DOD briefing books. 

                                 MORTON
                        We should know more in an hour.
                                 QUAYLE
                        An hour?

                             (chiming in)
                        Iron Mountain.

           Quayle -- whipping around when he hears that:

                                 QUAYLE
                        What?

           A TECH sits nervously -- now on the spot.

                                 TECH
                        I think they know we’re a tenant.

           Quayle’s jaw tightens. Fuck. 

                                 HIRSCH (V.O.)
                        Iron Mountain.

           INT. HIRSCH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Where we see Hirsch showing Alex images on his computer of:

           IRON MOUNTAIN

           a heavily fortified storage facility in Pennsylvania. Over 
           the following -- we see images of what he’s describing rotate 
           on the computer screen:

                                 HIRSCH
                        The main archive facility is 22 
                        stories underground. Taking up 145 
                        acres of a 1,000-acre limestone 
                        mine -- with corridors stretching 
                        for miles -- making it a giant rock 
                        maze -- protected by former Special 
                        Forces, motion sensors that’ll pick 
                        up anything bigger than a beaver, 
                        biometric scanners and key-cards. 
                        The FBI and the Social Security 
                        Administration have offices inside 
                        and it’s also where our government 
                        keeps the wreckage of Flight 93. 
                        Got its own sewage system, 
                        electricity and fire department. If 
                        the black box is being housed 
                        inside, I don’t see a way to get 
                        it.
                                 ALEX
                        Well, somebody did. Someone sent me 
                        a copy of the recording.

                                 HIRSCH
                        Only Straton’s top brass has access 
                        to their vault. Wanna ask them one 
                        by one who sent it to you?

           Alex knows that’s not an option. A beat -- as he thinks. This 
           is what he’s best at -- coming up with scenarios -- but 
           nothing is coming to him. 

                                 ALEX
                             (exasperated)
                        Shit.

           Alex rises from his seat and crosses the room -- up to the 
           window. Stares out -- lost.

           Hirsch turns to stare at his back. Another beat -- then:

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        What’s today, Tuesday?

                                 HIRSCH
                        Wednesday, I think.

           Alex pauses.

                                 ALEX
                        Emma has ballet today. They’re 
                        practicing for their recital next 
                        week. 

           A beat -- then Alex turns around -- face full of resolve and 
           commitment. He crosses up to Hirsch.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        The black box is what we need to 
                        end this. You and my wife used to 
                        break into places. You and I are 
                        going to break into this one.

           And we can see he means it. Off which -- music BUILDS -- as 
           we SMASH TO --

           EXT. PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           As the camera ZOOMS over western Pennsylvania -- above a cow 
           pasture -- to a high chain-link fence topped with razor wire. 
           Beyond it -- a private road disappears into a cliff face 
           that’s sealed off by a heavy steel gate -- controlled by 
           motion sensors and GUARDS with semi-automatic machine 
           pistols.

           This is IRON MOUNTAIN.

           NEW ANGLE -- AN EMERGENCY VENTILATION GRATE

           located outside the first security checkpoint. Welded shut.

           HIRSCH

           unzips a TACTICAL BACKPACK. Draws from it: a WELDING TORCH. 
           IGNITES it -- FWOOM!

           ALEX

           looks on as KA-CHING -- Hirsch finishes the weld and the 
           grate OPENS -- Alex shining a flashlight into the:  

           UNDERGROUND VENTILATION TUNNEL

           now exposed below -- a tight, narrow space.

           INT. TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           As Alex and Hirsch -- both wearing dark overalls -- squeeze 
           their way through the tube -- a gruelling three mile crawl on 
           their backs -- noses touching the tunnel ceiling -- barely 
           able to breathe. Suddenly --

           Alex STOPS. Sees:

           A MOTION SENSOR 

           embedded in the tunnel wall. To Hirsch -- whispering:

                                 ALEX
                        Motion sensor.

           Hirsch STOPS. Alex hands him a tiny aerosol can. Hirsch aims 
           and sprays the sensor -- covering it with a thin coat of 
           transparent, oily mist.

           Done. Hirsch nods.

                                 HIRSCH
                        Let’s go.

           They continue to snake up the shaft -- as we GO TO --
           EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN - SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY

           As a BLACK SUBURBAN drives up the private road -- to the 
           steel security gate.

           TWO IRON MOUNTAIN GUARDS approach. The car windows lower to 
           reveal:

           QUAYLE

           sitting in the back -- along with Morton and THREE STRATON 
           SECURITY MEN -- dressed in black suits.

                                 GUARD
                        Good morning, gentlemen. I need 
                        ID’s and social security numbers 
                        for each individual please.

           As the guards collect ID’s from Quayle and his team -- we 
           RETURN TO --

           INT. TUNNEL - SAME

           Where Alex and Hirsch -- grunting -- continue to torture 
           themselves -- straining to make it down this tube -- as we GO 
           BACK TO --

           EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN - SECURITY CHECKPOINT - SAME

           As the lead guard confirms everyone’s identities --

                                 GUARD
                        Enjoy your visit.

           -- giving a wave to a:

           GUARD TOWER

           where the GATE GUARD presses a button -- opening up the giant 
           sliding entry gate.

           The Suburban drives ahead -- into the mouth of the mountain -- 
           music DRIVING US -- as we CUT TO --

           INT. TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           As Hirsch stops -- reaching another GRATE at the end of the 
           tube -- and uses the can again -- spraying mist to reveal:

           SENSOR BEAMS

           criss-crossing the grate.
           Hirsch then moves his backpack around to the front -- unzips 
           a pocket -- and pulls out:

           TINY REFRACTING MIRRORS

           which he carefully uses to disarm the beams. 

           Satisfied -- he drills out the vent screws -- allowing him 
           and Alex to drop into:

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - AIR PURIFICATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Filled with large air purifying machines -- constantly 
           WHIRRING.

           Alex and Hirsch make a beeline to the far wall -- Hirsch 
           drawing an electrical masonry saw from his bag. He starts 
           cutting into the wall -- as we GO TO --

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - RECEIVING AREA - SAME

           A massive underground space -- forged out of a limestone 
           mine. Rocks for ceiling and walls. LOADERS haul steel 
           containment crates around on forklifts. With armed SENTRIES 
           looking on -- Quayle and his team wait by their car for:

           RICHARD MOORE

           to arrive. An Iron Mountain execute vice-president.

                                 MOORE
                        Mr. Quayle? Richard Moore. Welcome 
                        to Iron Mountain. This way please.

           He leads Quayle and his team into an awaiting HUMVEE which 
           then drives down one of four separate rock-lined passageways.

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - AIR PURIFICATION ROOM - SAME

           Alex looks over his shoulder -- as Hirsch finishes his work, 
           cutting a hole into the next room.

                                 HIRSCH
                        Got it.

           The two step into:

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - CIRCUITRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Full of plugs, lights and servers. Hirsch reaches up to the 
           ceiling and pushes away a panel -- exposing the security 
           system's main inbound and outbound wires.

           IN QUICK CUTS --
           Hirsch produces a small cutting tool and uses it to strip the 
           plastic coating off -- exposing the copper wiring beneath. 

           He then clips a new, precut piece of wire between the inbound 
           and outbound cables -- taking all the facility’s sensors out 
           of the loop.

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - MOORE’S OFFICE - SAME

           As Moore directs Quayle to a BIOMETRIC PALM PRINT SCANNER. 
           Quayle puts his hand down and the machine reads it. Confirms 
           his identity.

                                 MOORE
                        Excellent. Now if you wish we can 
                        proceed to the vault --

           Quayle and his men are led out.

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - CIRCUITRY ROOM - SAME

           VERY FAST --

           Hirsch pops open a utility box. Connects a clip to a pair of 
           wires -- attaching it to a military laptop. 

           With a few keystrokes -- he hacks into the Iron Mountain 
           vault roster. Finds the vault owned by the Straton Group.

                                 HIRSCH
                        Vault 2-25, North Corridor C.

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - SAME

           As a Humvee transporting Quayle and his team journeys down a 
           dark passageway -- a CATACOMB of winding rock corridors.

           RESUME ALEX AND HIRSCH:

           as they quickly remove their overalls to reveal they’re 
           wearing Iron Mountain uniforms underneath. SLAM FAST TO --

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - ANOTHER PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Alex and Hirsch discretely make their way down a corridor -- 
           bags in hand -- looking like maintenance workers -- and up to 
           a secure door -- Alex positioning himself in front of Hirsch -
           - so no one can see him --

           -- slipping in a custom-made laser-cut SKELETON KEY -- with 
           encrypted diodes -- into the lock. Turns. CRACK -- the door 
           opens. Alex and Hirsch slip inside -- as a: 

           SECURITY TEAM
           drives past on a Humvee -- just missing them. 

           Off which -- we GO TO --

           A VAULT 

           built into a rock wall. We’re now:

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - NORTH CORRIDOR C - MOMENTS LATER

           A private corridor. Alex and Hirsch step up to the imposing 
           steel door.

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - SECURITY OFFICE - SAME

           Where we see a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS. One of them shows 
           North Corridor C -- but Alex and Hirsch aren’t in the image -- 
           having looped the feed earlier.

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - NORTH CORRIDOR C - SAME

           QUICK CUTS --

           as Alex and Hirsch drop their bags -- unzipping them to 
           reveal SAFE CRACKING GEAR.

           HIRSCH

           then clamps a drill to the vault. And with that --

           WHHHHHHZZZZZRRRNNNNN!!! -- Hirsch starts CUTTING into the 
           steel vault door -- as we GO TO --

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - SECURITY OFFICE - SAME

           Where the guards are still oblivious.

           RESUME CORRIDOR:

           The drilling stops. Hirsch feeds a scope into the hole he 
           just drilled.  

           A tiny LCD screen attached to the cable shows the inner 
           mechanisms of the SAFE LOCK.

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - CIRCUITRY ROOM - SAME

           As the door to the room opens -- a SECURITY OFFICER stepping 
           inside -- seeing the open ceiling panel and the re-configured 
           wires.

           He instantly gets on his walkie-talkie -- as we GO FAST BACK 
           TO --
           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - NORTH CORRIDOR C - SAME

           FULL SCREEN -- THE INTERIOR OF THE VAULT LOCK

           as the gears start to move and lock into place.

           Alex looks down at Hirsch’s LCD monitor -- which shows the 
           notches lining up. 

           Suddenly -- AN ALARM SOUNDS!!!!

           Alex and Hirsch look up -- shit! -- as we SLAM TO --

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - SECURITY OFFICE - SAME

           As guards MOBILIZE -- grabbing Colt AR-15 Law Enforcement 
           Carbines -- RUSHING OUT -- as we RETURN TO --

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - NORTH CORRIDOR C - SAME

           Where Alex and Hirsch speed up their efforts. Seconds later -- 
           the vault’s inner mechanisms start to UNCLICK.

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - CORRIDOR - SAME

           As a fleet of Humvees ROAR PAST.

           RESUME ALEX AND HIRSCH:

           as Hirsch grips the wheel bolt and spins it until it STOPS 
           and the vault door CLUNKS OPEN -- Alex looking inside but --

           -- IT’S EMPTY!!!!!!

           Nothing but rock and an empty floor -- where the black box 
           recording was once kept.

           Alex’s jaw DROPS -- REELING -- FUCK! -- Quayle beat them to 
           it. Just then --

           -- the Humvees can be heard roaring up the corridor -- Hirsch 
           whipping over to Alex. Have to get the fuck out of there now.

                                 HIRSCH
                        Alex!

           RESUME HUMVEES:

           speeding up.

           RESUME ALEX AND HIRSCH:

           now hauling ass -- RUNNING down the corridor -- disappearing 
           down a tunnel of BLACKNESS when --
           -- FLASHLIGHT BEAMS draw down on them -- Alex and Hirsch 
           looking up -- seeing:

           ANOTHER HUMVEE

           roaring up -- Alex and Hirsch quickly PIVOTING around -- 
           SPRINTING AWAY -- Humvee CATCHING UP -- about to run them 
           down when -- they quickly TURN RIGHT -- CUTTING DOWN another 
           corridor. 

           The Humvee BLOWS PAST -- thisclose to clipping them.

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - SAME

           HAND-HELD CRAZINESS -- as Alex and Hirsch -- arms pumping -- 
           dash down the corridor.

           MORE GUARDS

           come rounding a corner ahead of them -- taking aim -- Alex 
           and Hirsch quickly THROWING THEMSELVES through a side access 
           door -- entering:

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - STAIRWELL - SAME

           Where they go TEARING UP several stories -- tripping several 
           more MOTION SENSORS along the way -- ALARMS BLARING -- but 
           they don’t stop -- can’t stop -- RUNNING for their lives -- 
           as we GO TO --

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - SECURITY OFFICE - SAME

           Where security monitors Alex and Hirsch on one of the screens 
           -- relaying their position -- watching them throw open 
           another set of doors -- as we SLAM TO --

           EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN - PRIVATE ROAD - SAME

           As Quayle’s black Suburban drives past -- away from the 
           facility -- kicking up gravel.

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - CORRIDOR - SAME

           As two SECURITY GUARDS are about to hop into their Humvees 
           when --

           -- CLICK! CLICK! 

           Alex and Hirsch whip around each side -- aiming Glocks at the 
           guards.

           RESUME PRIVATE ROAD:

           as the Suburban continues away from Iron Mountain. 
           INT. SUBURBAN - SAME

           CLOSE ON -- A STEEL CRATE

           in the back -- strapped down: THE BLACK BOX.

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - CORRIDOR - SAME

           As Alex hops behind the wheel of the Humvee -- turning the 
           ignition --

           -- Hirsch cuffs the two guards together -- about to join Alex 
           when --

           -- RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT! -- BULLETS START RAINING IN -- THE BACK 
           OF THE CAR GETTING RIDDLED -- ALEX AND HIRSCH BOTH DUCKING 
           DOWN -- SPARKS FLYING!

           MORE GUARDS

           start running up behind them -- unloading -- Hirsch spinning 
           around -- RETURNING FIRE -- trying to keep them off -- 
           yelling back over to Alex -- SCREAMING at him to:

                                 HIRSCH
                        GO! GO!

           Alex looks back to him -- you sure? 

                                 HIRSCH (CONT’D)
                        NOW!

           BANG! BANG! BANG! Hirsch continues to fire back -- 

           INT. HUMVEE - SAME

           -- Alex dropping the hammer -- ROARING AWAY -- looking in the 
           rear-view at:

           HIRSCH

           trading rounds -- then taking a bullet -- DROPPING -- Alex 
           unsure of his condition -- his image DISAPPEARING as the 
           Humvee SPEEDS ON.

           Alex -- fuck! -- whips his head back up -- jaw tightening.

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - CORRIDOR - SAME

           As the Humvee THUNDERS BY --

           -- officers direct security teams to take up positions --
           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - CORRIDOR - SAME

           -- OPENING FIRE on the Humvee as it speeds past -- bullets 
           TEARING into metal -- sending up SPARKS -- but Alex doesn’t 
           slow -- finding another gear -- TWISTING down another rock 
           pathway -- still taking heavy rounds -- then HOOKING around a 
           third corridor.

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - RECEIVING AREA - SAME

           As the MAIN PERIMETER GATE starts to CLOSE.

           INT. HUMVEE - SAME

           As Alex looks up -- sees the gate ahead -- about to trap him 
           inside the facility. He SLAMS harder on the gas and --

           INT. IRON MOUNTAIN - RECEIVING AREA - SAME

           -- SQUEEZES right through the gate -- metal SHAVING as it 
           SHOOTS --

           -- OUTSIDE -- ROARING AWAY -- guards still firing -- but the 
           Humvee out drives the bullets -- DISAPPEARING.

           Off which -- we GO TO --

           EXT. BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA - NIGHT

           Small town, USA. Strictly blue collar. Quiet streets. Almost 
           empty.  

           A POLICE CRUISER

           drives past us -- on patrol. Passes:

           ALEX

           stepping out of shadows -- looking worse for wear. A hunted 
           man -- with no black box -- and no more options. 

           Off which -- we PRELAP:

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        How is she?

           INT. YOUTH HOSTEL - NIGHT

           Where we find Rachel -- on a pay-phone -- Lisa asleep on a 
           cot in the room behind her.
                                 RACHEL
                        Sleeping. Scared.

           EXT. BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA STREET - SAME

           Alex -- on a pay-phone:

                                 ALEX
                        I’m sorry.

           INTERCUT:

                                 RACHEL
                        What about you? 

           Alex is silent -- spirit crushed.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Alex?

           A beat -- then:

                                 ALEX
                        Rach, what if I told you, an 
                        American company was involved in 
                        the crash of Air Force One? That 
                        they did it because President 
                        Singer would never go along with a 
                        plan to attack China.

           A long pause -- then:

                                 RACHEL
                        Are you asking me as your brother-
                        in-law or as a journalist?

                                 ALEX
                        A journalist.

                                 RACHEL
                        Is this a theory of yours?

                                 ALEX
                        It was.

                                 RACHEL
                        Do you have evidence? 

                                 ALEX
                        No.

                                 RACHEL
                        Then as your sister-in-law I would
                        say forget it.
                                 ALEX
                        Thought you told me not to forget.

                                 RACHEL
                        I told you I was worried about you 
                        and now I’m even more so. Four days 
                        ago, we’re talking about you not 
                        calling my friend back and now 
                        you’re saying my sister was 
                        murdered. That the tribute me and 
                        your six year-old daughter attended 
                        without you was based on a lie.

                                 ALEX
                        I know -- which is all the more
                        reason to find an end to this. I 
                        just don’t know what it is.

                                 RACHEL
                        Then let me tell you what I know:
                        your daughter cries out for you, 
                        the police and the FBI think you’re 
                        a killer, and I had to go into 
                        hiding.

                                 ALEX
                        I know...and if there was another
                        way out I would take it. But I have 
                        to see this through to the end or 
                        else me, you, Emma, will never be 
                        safe -- and Lisa would’ve died for 
                        nothing.

                                 RACHEL
                        But you already said -- you have 
                        nothing. Now just please come home.

                                 ALEX
                        I can’t come home. I need infor --

           Alex pauses -- like a bolt of lightning just hit him.

                                 RACHEL
                        Alex?

           Silence -- Alex’s mind playing something over and over.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Alex?

                                 ALEX
                        I gotta go.
                                 RACHEL
                        What? Alex, wait --

           But he doesn’t -- hanging up -- exiting -- as we GO TO --

           CLOSE ON -- A STOLEN CREDIT CARD

           as Alex swipes it -- purchasing internet minutes -- MUSIC 
           DRIVING US -- as we INTERCUT --

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           As a bus drives by -- spewing black smoke into the sky. 

           RESUME ALEX:

           at the internet cafe -- face bathed in the blue glow of his 
           monitor -- furiously looking up his late wife’s financial 
           records. 

           INT. BUS - INTERCUTTING

           Alex sits in the back -- quiet -- determined to see this 
           through -- music CONTINUING.

           INT. INTERNET CAFE - INTERCUTTING

           Where we see Alex continuing to comb through any and all of 
           his wife’s online activities -- seeing that she rented a 
           storage facility outside Virginia in her father’s name three 
           years earlier. 

           GO BACK TO --

           THE BUS

           as it blows past:

           EXT. STORAGE FACILITY - NIGHT

           Massive. Rows of containers. 

           NEW ANGLE -- ALEX

           as he walks up to one of the units -- aims his gun and -- 
           BANG! -- blows the lock off -- and heaves open the roll-up 
           metal door.

           It SLIDES UP -- Alex looking inside -- but we don’t get to 
           see what he sees.

           And off Alex -- we CUT TO --
           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Outside an affluent home in the posh Bethesda, Maryland 
           suburb of Washington, DC. A car pulls into the driveway. 
           Parks.

           INT. HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           The front door opens up. The man we recognize as:

           CIA DIRECTOR DAN RICHTER

           steps inside -- briefcase in hand -- shutting the door behind 
           him. He starts to make his way toward the stairs when --

           -- a light switches on the adjacent study -- revealing:

           ALEX

           waiting for him -- gun in his lap.

           Richter doesn’t seem surprised.

                                 RICHTER
                        I was wondering how long it would 
                        take you to get to me.

                                 ALEX
                        You could’ve made it easier...by 
                        giving me the recording in person. 

                                 RICHTER
                        That would’ve defeated the purpose. 

           He drops his coat and enters:

           INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

                                 RICHTER
                        How’d you find my home?

                                 ALEX
                        Lisa told me where it was. 

           Alex produces a thick file folder -- dropping it onto 
           Richter’s desk.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        She had files on all of you.

                                 RICHTER
                        I know. She was a good agent.
                                 ALEX
                        Who found out what the Straton 
                        Group was all about. How in the 
                        beginning, the company was just 
                        doing black ops for the CIA before 
                        pushing their own agenda.  
                             (beat)
                        And how you wanted to bring them 
                        down just as much as she did. Even 
                        while you took a salary.

           Richter nods.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        You just didn’t have her courage.

                                 RICHTER
                        I’m not going to apologize for 
                        wanting to stay alive. You see the 
                        lengths they go to.

                                 ALEX
                        So you gave me the black box tape, 
                        praying on the memory of my wife, 
                        knowing I’d run the story and bring 
                        them down -- while you remained 
                        anonymous.

           Another nod. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        But why now? Why wait so long? 

           Richter pauses -- then sets his briefcase onto the desk and 
           pops it open -- drawing:

           A CLASSIFIED INTELLIGENCE REPORT

           on the Chinese military. Hands it to Alex.

                                 RICHTER
                        Chinese military is better equipped 
                        than we thought -- their anti-
                        carrier arsenal far more advanced 
                        that the DOD or even Straton 
                        anticipated.

           Alex flips through the report -- filled with missile 
           schematics marked with top secret clearance tags -- taking in 
           all the information.
                                 RICHTER (CONT’D)
                        The war would be more deadly and 
                        expensive than we could conceive 
                        of. 
                             (beat; confessing)
                        It’s just too much blood.

           Alex looks up -- full of emotion. 

                                 ALEX
                        It’s already been too much blood.

           Richter’s silent. Alex then rises -- moving past him -- to 
           the door.

                                 RICHTER
                        What are you gonna do now?

           Alex stops -- turning back -- while reaching into his pocket 
           and drawing: 

           A TAPE RECORDER

           which has been running the whole time.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m gonna play my own recording.

           With that -- he goes to walk to the door when --

           -- THE LIGHTS SHUT OUT -- PLUNGING THE HOUSE INTO TOTAL 
           DARKNESS.

           Alex and Richter both react -- thrown. Alex then looks 
           through the front door window. 

           NEW ANGLE -- ALEX’S POV

           the rest of the neighborhood lights are ON. 

           RESUME:

           Alex -- fuck -- knows something is about to happen. Then he 
           catches:

           MOVEMENT

           outside -- BODIES RUSHING past windows -- deadly silent. Alex 
           whips back to:

           RICHTER
           who has a knee on the floor -- spinning open the combination 
           lock to a safe -- unlocking the door -- reaching in and 
           pulling out:

           A STEYR M9A1

           He press checks the chamber -- readying himself -- as Alex 
           looks around for options.

           JUMP CUT -- SECONDS LATER

           as the front door lock gets picked. Silently swings open.

           A THREE MAN STRATON HIT SQUAD

           slides inside -- wearing night vision goggles and carrying 
           silenced assault rifles. 

           The shooters separate -- splitting up -- taking different 
           sections of the house.

           NEW ANGLE -- ALEX

           hiding inside a closet -- listening to the gunmen advancing. 
           His heart PUMPS. He holds his breath. 

           If he makes a sound -- he’s dead. 

           RESUME GUNMEN:

           as they continue their hunt -- guns leveled -- fucking 
           terrifying.

           RESUME ALEX:

           as he quietly backs away from the door -- foot kicking:

           AN EMERGENCY SURVIVAL KIT

           on the floor. He ducks down. Flips open the lid. Finds:

           A FLARE

           RESUME THE THREE GUNMEN:

           still on the move -- searching. 

           GUNMAN #1

           reaches the front hallway closet -- where Alex is hiding. He 
           stops. 

           GUNMAN #2
           heads for the kitchen.

           GUNMAN #3

           goes upstairs.

           RESUME:

           Gunman #1 swings open the closet door. Suddenly --

           RICHTER

           steps out from behind shadows. BANG! BANG! Fires two rounds. 
           Kills GUNMAN #2 

           Everything that happens now -- happens fast:

           Alex LIGHTS the flare -- SHOVING it into Gunman #1’s face. 
           His entire field of vision gets BURNED. He HOWLS -- BLINDED.

           Gunman #3 turns. Fires back at Richter -- RAT-TAT-TAT -- as 
           Richter gets off three more shots -- hitting Gunman #3 in the 
           chest and head -- DROPPING him as --

           ALEX

           seizes the moment and TACKLES Gunman #1 -- RAMMING him up 
           against the wall -- SLAMMING him to the ground -- then 
           KICKING him in the ribs before -- WHACK! -- CRACKING his boot 
           against his head -- rendering him unconscious.

           Alex then picks up the shooter’s fallen gun and looks over to 
           Richter -- stepping back into the hallway -- back to the open 
           front door. 

           BANG!

           A bullet spins him around. 

           BANG! BANG!

           Richter gets tagged twice in the chest -- DROPPING TO REVEAL:

           QUAYLE

           behind him -- in the doorway -- smoking gun in hand. 

           Alex and Quayle then lock eyes. There’s a small beat between 
           them -- a look of recognition. 

           Quayle then makes a move to fire. 

           RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!
           Alex UNLOADS into Quayle -- ripping him to shreds. He hits 
           the floor -- riddled.

           A beat -- as Alex just stands there -- heart still beating 
           out of his chest -- then he slowly steps forward -- over 
           pools of blood -- past dead bodies -- to stand over Quayle’s 
           corpse -- looking down at his wife’s killer.

           Suddenly -- the house gets flooded by SPINNING RED AND BLUE 
           LIGHTS -- as MARYLAND POLICE storm inside -- ordering Alex to 
           drop his gun -- which he does -- everything SLOWING DOWN -- 
           as we PRELAP:

                                 CNN REPORTER
                        -- FBI officials have raided the 
                        home office of the Straton Group, a 
                        private security firm, based in

           In which we see FBI AGENTS -- some in windbreakers -- others

           and offices.

           As President Dreyfuss takes the podium.
                                 PRESIDENT DREYFUSS
                        Good afternoon. I’ll keep this 
                        brief as I know everyone has 
                        questions and I will do my best to 
                        add truth to rumor. To start with, 
                        yes, the FBI has seized what 
                        preliminary tests confirm is the 
                        actual flight data recording from 
                        Air Force One which seems to 
                        drastically contradict the original 
                        investigation findings that 
                        President Singer’s plane crashed 
                        strictly due to mechanical and 
                        human error. 

           CUT TO --

           INT. FBI HOLDING CELL - DAY

           Where we find Alex -- sitting in a steel chair -- eyes on the 
           floor.

                                 PRESIDENT DREYFUSS (V.O.)
                        Rest assured, this President and 
                        this government, will do everything 
                        within our considerable power to 
                        bring justice to the guilty and 
                        right this horrific wrong.

           Alex looks up -- as the door swings open and:

           EMMA

           come running inside -- Alex jumping off his chair -- HUGGING 
           his daughter -- SQUEEZING her tight -- then looking up and 
           seeing:

           RACHEL

           smiling from the doorway.

                                 PRESIDENT DREYFUSS (V.O.)
                        The memories of the fallen will be 
                        avenged. They have not died in 
                        vain.

           Off Alex -- overwhelmed -- DISSOLVE TO --

           A BOUQUET OF RED ROSES

           passing several headstones. We’re now:
           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           A beautiful sunny day. WE FOLLOW Alex -- as he makes his way 
           across the cemetery -- to his wife’s headstone.

           He takes a moment -- looking at the words “DEVOTED MOTHER AND 
           WIFE” -- before:

                                 ALEX 
                        So they finally let you out, huh?

           Alex turns -- finding:

           ROBERT HIRSCH

           walking up -- right arm in a sling -- left hand holding 
           flowers.

                                 HIRSCH
                        Funny how a call from the Attorney 
                        General will do that for you.

           Alex smiles.

                                 HIRSCH (CONT’D)
                        You did her proud, Alex. 

                                 ALEX
                        Thank you for everything.

                                 HIRSCH
                        My pleasure.

           Hirsch bends down -- and lays his flowers at Lisa’s 
           headstone. Rises.

                                 ALEX
                        So what are you gonna do now?

                                 HIRSCH
                        Thinking about getting my old job 
                        back actually. 

           We see Alex is happy to hear that.

                                 HIRSCH (CONT’D)
                        Seems there’s still a lot of good 
                        fights to be had. 

           Alex nods.

                                 HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                        You take care.
           With that -- Hirsch turns and walks away. Alex watches him go 
           -- then looks back to Lisa’s headstone.

           A beat -- as he shuts his eyes -- remembering. FLASH TO --

           INT. BEDROOM - FLASHBACK

           Where we see Alex and Lisa together -- on that perfect Sunday 
           morning -- laughing in bed -- in love.

           RESUME PRESENT:

           as Alex opens his eyes -- 

           -- and smiles -- her memory no longer haunting him.

           He then rests the roses down -- and kisses the top of her 
           headstone -- before turning around -- heading out of the 
           cemetery -- 

           -- and into an awaiting car -- where:

           EMMA

           turns to him in the passenger seat. 

                                 ALEX
                        Ready to go home?

           She nods. Alex smiles. The car pulls away. MUSIC BUILDS -- as 
           we SMASH TO --

           BLACK.
