                   The following story is inspired by actual events.

           FADE IN on ENDLESS CORN FIELDS sitting under a Fall night 
           sky. A sharp-edged wind howls. The stalks bend.

                              Kankakee, Illinois 1991

           OFF-SCREEN, we hear a CLICK, followed by STATIC and finally 
           the faint WHIR of CASSETTE WHEELS turning.

                                 MAN’S VOICE 
                        Mother, it’s me... I’ve been 
                        kidnapped and I’ve been buried 
                        alive. 

           COURT STREET, the primary vein of town. Taverns, delis, a 
           Circle K gas station. Vacant at this late hour.

                        I won’t be released until a payment 
                        of one million dollars cash is 
                        made. 

           THE YESTERYEAR, an elegant riverfront restaurant. Closed, 
           dark for the night.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        You will be called again at 10 AM 
                        with instructions on where to drop 
                        the money. Please stay by the 
                        phone. 

           THE KANKAKEE RIVER. Black water winds through dense woodland.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Once the money has been collected 
                        you will be told my location. 

           WE’RE DRIFTING THROUGH A FOREST of spindly, naked Hardwoods. 
           Faintly a POUNDING is heard. THOOMP... THOOMP... THOOMP...  

                                 MAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        If you attempt to contact the 
                        police you will never see me alive 
                        again.  

           MOVING CLOSER to the noise... the POUNDING LOUDER, more 
           URGENT... TILT DOWN... the ground is TREMBLING... the BOOM! 
           BOOM! BOOM! of someone hitting wood... PUNCHING it... 
           desperate to get out and —  

           INT. PICK-UP TRUCK, MOVING DOWN A RURAL ROAD — LATE AT NIGHT  

           TIGHT ON A MICROCASSETTE RECORDER as — CLICK — the cassette 
           wheels stop. A perfectly manicured fingernail presses the 
           REWIND button. As the wheels spin back, WE PAN UP to NANCY 
           RISH, 27, blonde, indecently beautiful...

           ...and nervous now. Hands shaking as she brings a Virginia 
           Slim to her lips and stares blankly out the passenger window.  
                                 NANCY
                        You were supposed to have the 
                        blindfold on. That was the plan. 
                          (beat)
                        He saw my face. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.C.)
                        You don’t know that. It was dark — 

                                 NANCY
                          (certain of it)
                        He saw my fucking face. 

           PUSH IN ON NANCY... as she pulls her knees to her chest... a 
           dark reality settling in... TIGHT ON NANCY’S FACE as we —  

                                                        SMASH TO:

           INT. BANQUET ROOM, KANKAKEE MARRIOTT — MORNING  

           TIGHT ON NANCY. The most beautiful NINE YEAR-OLD GIRL we’ve 
           ever seen. Brilliant cerulean eyes under her almost white-hot 
           golden hair. She struts around the stage with the other 
           JUNIOR PAGEANT CONTESTANTS, owning every step. A homespun 
           banner reads: JUNIOR MISS DAIRY PRINCESS.  

           One-by-one, the girls stand beside the MC and introduce 
           themselves to the audience. It’s Nancy’s turn. 

                                 NANCY
                        My name is Nancy Elaine Rish from 
                        Kankakee, Illinois. My ambition is 
                        to be a model, or an actress on All 
                        My Children. My favorite hobbies 
                        are dancing... 

           IN THE AUDIENCE 

           is CONNIE RISH, 30, Nancy’s single, doting ‘pageant’ mother. 
           Connie’s more girl than woman and that’s intentional as she’s 
           petrified of aging. She mouths the words as Nancy speaks. 

                                 NANCY (O.C.)
                        ...singing, getting my nails done, 
                        laughing with friends and...

           NANCY   

           flashes an impish smile, covers her mouth in an oops. 

                                 NANCY
                        ...Hot fudge sundaes. 

           As Nancy moves along, her eyes lock in on a HEAVYSET JUDGE 
           like a wanton single girl capturing her target across a bar. 
           Judge meets her stare. By the time Nancy makes her turn, he’s 
           become deeply hypnotized. 
           ON THE STAGE, AMID THE AUDIENCE’S APPLAUSE —  

           The NOW-CROWNED DIVISIONAL WINNERS POSE, bouquets in hand.

           PUSH IN ON NANCY — front and center. Junior Miss Dairy 
           Princess. She’s a star. Bright, sparkling, ready to explode. 

                                 CONNIE (V.O.)
                        I always knew you were special.

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM — AFTERNOON 

           GLIDE ACROSS THE WALLS OF THE BEDROOM, covered with pageant 
           sashes, ribbons, and first place trophies... 

                                 CONNIE (O.C.)
                        When you were just five years old 
                        this man came up to me at the mall.

           ...Atop the dresser are mawkish SEARS PORTRAIT STUDIO PHOTOS 
           of Nancy and Connie over the years... 

                                 CONNIE (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Came right up to me and asked if 
                        you might be interested in doing 
                        some modeling. I said, no, uh-uh, 
                        there’s training still to be done.

           ...Shelves are crammed with HUNDREDS of unopened, untouched 
           Barbie doll boxes..

                                 CONNIE (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                          (chuckles, embarrassed)
                        Truth is, you probably could’ve 
                        been a star right then. I think a 
                        part of me just wanted you all for 
                        myself.

           WIDER — Nancy and Connie sit on Nancy’s bed. Connie combs 
           Nancy’s hair while Nancy watches an episode of Paper Moon, 
           transfixed by Addie (Jodie Foster) and her get-rich schemes. 

                                 CONNIE (CONT’D)
                        When I was a girl, my Mom would 
                        talk about Shirley Temple. How the 
                        same word came to everyone’s mind 
                        when they saw her. Sparkle. Some 
                        people just have it. You have it, 
                        Nancy. You sparkle. 

           (O.C.) A CAR DOOR SHUTS. Nancy glances outside her window and 
           notices a MOVING VAN in the driveway next door.

           EXT. RISH HOME (BUNGALOW STYLE), BACKYARD — AFTERNOON 

           Nancy combs a tanned, anorexic Barbie doll’s hair. A rubber 
           ball rolls before her. She searches for its source. A face 
           peers over the top of the neighboring fence. JIMMY KEENE, 10, 
           the new neighbor: long-haired and red-blooded.  

           Jimmy VAULTS the fence, and heads over, stopping within 
           inches of Nancy. He bends down and picks up the ball. 
                                 NANCY
                          (sniffs the air)
                        What’s that smell? Are you wearing 
                        perfume? 

                                 JIMMY
                        No, it’s my dad’s Aqua Velva. I’m 
                        Jimmy. Who are you? 

                                 NANCY
                        That’s for you to find out. 

           She stands and walks back toward the house.  

                                 JIMMY
                        ...Wunna be my girlfriend? 

           She pauses at the rear door, her back still facing him. 

                                 NANCY
                        You’re not my type. 

                                 JIMMY
                        Oh yeah? Well what’s your type? 

                                 NANCY
                        Rich and famous. 

           She smiles to herself, then her face goes slack and she turns 
           back to Jimmy, her expression laissez faire. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I can show you around town tomorrow 
                        if you want. 
                          (patronizing)
                        If it’s okay with your parents.    

           He regards her as if discovering a new species, as the BACK 
           DOOR SLAMS shut behind Nancy. 

           ON BIKE WHEELS TURNING — DAY 

           NANCY and JIMMY cruise down the tree-lined town streets. 
           Nancy surges ahead of Jimmy. Jimmy pedals hard to keep up. 

           A SERIES OF SHOTS AS THE PAIR STOPS OUTSIDE NANCY’S HAUNTS: 

           THE ‘CUTTING EDGE’ HAIR SALON 

                                 NANCY
                        That’s where I get my hair done. 

           ‘SOPHISTICATE’ DRESS SHOP 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        That’s where they make my pageant 
                        gowns. 

           A NEIGHBORHOOD POOL CROWDED WITH YOUNGSTERS 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        That’s where I go to tan. 
           THE PRETTIEST HOUSE IN TOWN (STEPHEN SMALL’S HOUSE) 

           Behind wrought iron gates, a long driveway winds to a 
           stunning asymmetrical QUEEN ANNE VICTORIAN MANSION. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        And that’s where the Small Family 
                        lives. 
                          (wistful)
                        Nothing small about Mr. Small. 

                                 JIMMY
                        Who’s that? 

                                 NANCY
                        Look at the house. 

           Nancy climbs off her bike and puts her face between the bars 
           of the gate, studying the home. Just then — HONK! A MERCEDEZ-
           BENZ SEDAN arrives at the gate and tries to ride through. 

           In the backseat, STEPHEN SMALL, mid 30s, a severe man in a 
           tailored suit sits beside his fuddy-duddy mother, ELAINE, 55. 
           The DRIVER pantomimes for Nancy to move. Stephen’s taken 
           notice now and lowers his window.  

                                 SMALL   
                        Would you move out of the way. 

           Nancy stares at him a moment. Not moving. Small’s incensed —  

                                 SMALL (CONT’D)
                        I said — 

                                 JIMMY
                        Come on, Nancy, let’s go. 

           Nancy moves her bike mere inches, just enough for the sedan 
           to ride past. Off Nancy, fixated on the Small home — 

           EXT. KANKAKEE RIVER — DAY — WE’RE UNDERWATER AS 

           Nancy and Jimmy STREAK THROUGH. Jimmy SURFACES and looks 
           around for Nancy. She SHOOTS UP behind him, TAGS him! 

                                 NANCY
                        Gotcha! 

           She’s gone again. Underwater. Jimmy DIVES DOWN after her.   

           EXT. WOODS — AFTERNOON 

           TRACK NANCY AND JIMMY as they play a game of cat-and-mouse. 
           Nancy races past trees; Jimmy chases with abandon. 

           LATER – SERIES OF SHOTS 

           Jimmy’s lost sight of Nancy. He tries to follow her distant, 
           fleeting footfalls and giggles. 
           He slides down an ESCARPMENT... BOUNDS across a thin ROCK 
           STREAM... PUSHES through clouds of FOREST SHRUBS... the 
           forest more dense out this far, the trees misshapen. For a 
           moment he almost looks nervous.  

           Finally, he pauses at the trunk of an ANCIENT ELM, a giant 
           elder statesman towering over the young upstart birch, pine 
           and firs. Then — 

                                 NANCY (O.C.)
                        Scared? 

           Nancy’s head emerges from the ground like a periscope only to 
           disappear again. 

           Jimmy nears, looks down into THE NEOLITHIC FISSURE in which 
           she stands: a deep groove in the forest floor. He descends a 
           WOODEN LADDER propped against a wall of moss-covered 
           mudstone. He looks around, entranced by the hidden cleft.   

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Everyone’s got a place no one else 
                        knows about it. This one’s mine. 

                                 JIMMY
                        Yeah, right. I know about it now. 

                                 NANCY
                        No you don’t... You’re lost. 

           His face changes: he is. Very lost. Turning back to Nancy, 
           her focus is elsewhere. He watches as her fingertips work 
           back-and-forth the scores of an ancient etching in the 
           mudstone. Her hand clears to reveal a long-forgotten 
           declaration of love: Jimmy Loves Ci-Ci.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Looks like you’ve already got a 
                        girlfriend. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                          (beat, smiles)
                        That’s right, Ci-Ci. 

           In spite of herself, she GIGGLES. Then looks at him with the 
           most piercing stare before racing away up the trench. He 
           watches her go, glances back at the me + you sentiment in the 
           rock face, and then hightails it after her.

           INT. SEARS SPRING/SUMMER CATALOG PHOTO SHOOT — CHICAGO — 1981 

           NANCY, a 16 year old stunner now, poses in an electric yellow 
           string bikini against a tropical backdrop. She’s been at this 
           modeling game a while now. It’s old-hat to her now.

           Off to the side of the set, CONNIE shows Nancy’s portfolio 
           (all catalog tearouts) to a MAKE-UP GIRL.  

                                 CONNIE
                        That’s from Eaton’s Spring Catalog. 
                        Nancy got the cover. 

           BEHIND THE CAMERA, glad-handing the AD EXECS, is JOEL LESTER, 
           30, a visiting, smarmy freelance model scout. 
                                 JOEL LESTER
                        — yeah yeah I still have my place 
                        in New York, but I gotta keep my 
                        antennae up, yunno? The next Cheryl 
                        Tiegs might be walking through 
                        daddy’s cornfield right now.    

           He laughs, then turns and spots Nancy under the lights. 

                                 JOEL LESTER (CONT’D)
                          (to an ASSISTANT)
                        Who’s that? 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Oh, that’s Nancy. Nancy Rish. 

           Joel tilts his shades down, intrigued, soaking her in. 

           EXT. RISH HOME — FRONT LAWN — SPRING EVENING — 1981 

           Nancy is dressed in a prom mini. Connie stands behind her, 
           hands covering Nancy’s eyes. 

                                 NANCY 
                        Mom, what’s going on? 

                                 CONNIE
                        Keep ‘em closed, keep ‘em closed!

           A FLEETWOOD LIMOUSINE rolls into the drive. JIMMY KEENE steps 
           out in a gaudy white Men’s Warehouse tuxedo. He’s 17 now, his 
           long hair and natural build exude a brutish sexuality.  

           Connie pulls her hands away. 

                                 NANCY
                        Oh my gosh, Jimmy. 

           Jimmy hands Nancy flowers. The couple pose as CONNIE and MRS. 
           KEENE, 30, snap photos. NEIGHBORHOOD BOYS gape from afar. 

           NANCY & JIMMY, THE ‘IT’ COUPLE, DANCE AT THE JUNIOR PROM

           Eyes on eyes. Eddie Money’s ‘Baby Hold On’ plays. She leans 
           close, whispers in his ear — 

                                 NANCY
                        Can you hear it, Jimmy? They’re 
                        playing our song. 

                                 JIMMY   
                          (listens, smiles)
                        You’re perfect tonight, Nanc. I 
                        don’t ever wanna lose you. 

                                 NANCY
                        You’re never gonna lose me.

           Nancy holds him tighter.  
           INT. RISH HOME — NANCY BOUNDS DOWN THE STAIRWELL 

           dressed for a night out. Connie’s on her heels — 

                                 CONNIE
                        You’ve been spending a lot of time 
                        with this Joel fella lately, Nancy.

                                 NANCY
                        He gave my portfolio to some New 
                        York agents he knows.  

                                 CONNIE
                        New York? But, Nancy, I manage your 
                        career. 

                                 NANCY
                        You used to manage my career. 

           Connie’s surprised and hurt. At the door, Nancy slips on her 
           acid-washed denim jacket, and leaves. 

           EXT. RISH HOME — CONTINUOUS 

           Nancy runs to Joel’s Beemer when — 

                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                        Nancy? 

           She stops in her tracks and turns to Jimmy, staring at her 
           from his driveway. He stands beside a HARLEY SX-125 
           MOTORCYCLE, returning home from a day of donkeywork. 

           A long beat as she measures her options, trapped between two 
           lives and, as she sees it, two very different futures.

                                 JOEL LESTER
                        Come on, babe, let’s hit it. 

           Finally, Nancy climbs into the BMW convertible. Jimmy watches 
           as she DARTS OFF down the street. 

           NANCY’S HAIR IS A DANCING FIRE  

           as she and Joel fly down Interstate 94. The City of the Big 
           Shoulders dazzles on the horizon. They shout over the wind —

                                 JOEL LESTER
                        I GOT THE CALL TODAY, BABE! 

                                 NANCY
                        WHAT!?

                                 JOEL LESTER
                        NEW YORK! THEY WANNA MEET YOU!   

           Nancy SCREAMS excitedly and raises her arms in the air.
           INT. RISH HOME, NANCY’S BEDROOM — NIGHT (LATE)  

           TWO PACKED SUITCASES are open on the bed. Nancy reviews the 
           outfits inside for what feels like the thousandth time.  

           DINK-DINK at her window. Nancy looks outside. Jimmy stands in 
           the driveway. With an annoyed SIGH, she lifts the window.  

                                 JIMMY
                        How about one last swim? 

                                 NANCY
                        Are you crazy? You know I leave for 
                        New York in the morning. Besides, 
                        that water’s not good for my hair. 

                                 JIMMY
                        I’m not asking you to stay, Ci-Ci, 
                        I just wanted to say goodbye.

           EXT. KANKAKEE RIVER — NIGHT  

           Quiescent. Peaceful. In the distance, Nancy and Jimmy DASH 
           toward a cliff’s edge and LEAP across the full moon. 

           RIVER 

           Nancy surfaces from the jump. Looks around for Jimmy. He’s 
           nowhere. The water slowly becomes placid again. Then — 

           Jimmy BURSTS out of the water and DUNKS Nancy! He LAUGHS. She 
           SPLASHES him playfully then watches as he backstrokes away.  

                                 NANCY 
                        What’re you gonna do here without 
                        me?

                                 JIMMY
                        I’ll figure something out. 

                                 NANCY
                        Joel thinks I could go from New 
                        York right to Paris. That’s where 
                        the Spring collections are... Maybe 
                        you could save up and visit me. 

                                 JIMMY
                        I might not be around that long. 
                          (off her look)
                        You’re not the only one with plans 
                        to get outta this place, yunno?  

           A moment. She hadn’t thought of that until just now. This 
           place without Jimmy. It bothers her. She shakes it off. 

                                 NANCY
                        If I wasn’t such a dreamer do you 
                        think we would’ve ended up 
                        together, Jimmy?
                          (off his laugh)
                        I’m serious. 
                                 JIMMY
                        Quit the act, Nancy. It’s okay, 
                        really, I get it. 

                                 NANCY
                        What’s there to get? 

                                 JIMMY
                        Who you are. What you want. I 
                        understand, yunno.  

           She swims out towards him. Wraps her arms around his back.

                                 NANCY
                        Sometimes I think you’re the only 
                        person in the whole world who does. 

           He looks back at her. Eyes on eyes. A long, anxious moment. 
           She moves in to kiss him when — 

           Jimmy slips underwater only to emerge seconds later on the 
           riverbank. He climbs out of the water and reclines on a 
           boulder, hands behind his head. Nancy’s indignant. 

                                 JIMMY
                        End of the rainbow up here, Ci-Ci.
                        Better hurry or you’re gonna miss 
                        the sun coming up.   

           She takes a moment, then swims toward him. Climbs onto the 
           boulder, lays beside him and rests her head on his chest...  

           EXT. RURAL ROAD — NEARLY DAWN 

           VRMMM! — Nancy’s arms are wrapped around Jimmy’s waist. They 
           TEAR down the deserted road at 80 mph. Knowing she has to 
           leave, she holds him tighter, savoring this final moment. 

           EXT. PENN STATION — NEW YORK CITY — MORNING  

           Nancy steps off a bus. DRIVER hands over her luggage. 

           She takes a moment to absorb her new surroundings. Dapper men 
           and glamorous women. The marquee outside MADISON SQUARE 
           GARDEN announces The Rolling Stones. On a billboard, Lauren 
           Hutton poses for Revlon. Nancy smiles, home at last. 

           EXT. LINCOLN CENTER — WIDE — DAY 

           Nancy wheels her luggage across the plaza. 

           CLOSER ANGLE, NANCY PAUSES 

           outside an IMPRESSIVE HIGH-RISE and takes in its thirty-plus 
           stories. A DOORMAN holds the door open. Nancy glides inside.  
           INT. 30 LINCOLN PLAZA — 12TH FLOOR APARTMENT — DAY 

           Nancy enters the tastefully appointed three bedroom. A note 
           hangs from a bedroom door knob: Welcome to New York, Nancy. 
           The Ford Modeling Agency.   

           She sets her luggage down and strolls around the living area 
           admiring the panoramic city view. Her fingers graze the 
           designer gowns scattered carelessly about like rags. On the 
           coffee table are proofs from a Ralph Lauren modeling shoot. 
           Nancy lifts one. A pretty BRUNETTE stands on the bow of a 
           yacht, gazing out over endless azure water. 

           On Nancy, filled with possibility: This could be her life! 

           INT. FORD MODELING AGENCY — CONFERENCE ROOM — LATE AFTERNOON 

           GAYLE, 50, is at the tail end of an exhausting day of 
           auditions. Two MALE AGENTS sit at her side. An INTERN mills. 

                                 GAYLE
                        Okay, are we done, James? 

                                 INTERN 
                        Uhh...one more. Nancy Rish. 

           Intern hands Gayle Nancy’s composite cards. Strictly catalog. 

                                 GAYLE
                        Who’s the scout? 

                                 AGENT 1
                        Joel Lester. 

                                 GAYLE
                        Oh God. Did he sleep with her? 

                                 AGENT 2
                        What do you think? 

                                 GAYLE
                          (cringes)
                        Well, she’s 5’10. Bring her in. 

           Intern exits and returns a moment later with Nancy who struts 
           in wearing a belted shirt dress with shoulder pads. She hands 
           Gayle her portfolio. Intern rolls his eyes behind her back.  

                                 GAYLE (CONT’D)
                        Hi, Nancy. Have a seat.

           Nancy sits across from them. Smiling, eager to impress. 

                                 GAYLE (CONT’D)
                        Where are you from, sweetheart? 

                                 NANCY
                        Well, I was born in Kankakee, but I 
                        spend so much time in Chicago now 
                        that it’s home.  

           Agent 1 scribbles something onto a memo pad and slides it to 
           Agent 2 who chokes a laugh. Nancy catches it.
                                 GAYLE
                        Stand up for me, Nancy.  

           Nancy does just that and awkwardly poses.

                                 GAYLE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t need to hide behind all 
                        that make-up.  

                                 AGENT 1
                        The look they like these days is au 
                        naturel. 

                                 NANCY
                        ...o... what? 

                                 GAYLE
                        Clean and simple. Showing who you 
                        really are.  

           Nancy seems confused by this. The suggestion a crime against 
           her very nature. A queer, uneasy feeling burgeons in her. 
           She’s out of her depth and knows it. Finally...  

                                 GAYLE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for coming in, Nancy.  

                                 NANCY
                        Wait... That’s it? 

           Gayle nods. A confused beat then Nancy takes her portfolio 
           and exits, closing the door behind her.  

           HALLWAY 

           ON NANCY, walking away, not unaware of the muffled mirth 
           coming from inside the room. 

           INT. 30 LINCOLN PLAZA — APARTMENT — EVENING     

           Nancy returns to find her roommates, three slinky models 
           — CHLOE, OLIVIA and JENNIFER, 19 — hanging out in the living 
           area, drinking red wine. All three impossibly thin couture 
           models. The girls notice Nancy. 

                                 NANCY
                        Hi, I’m Nancy. 

                                 CHLOE
                          (re: Nancy’s outfit)
                        How’d the audition for Dallas go?  

           The girls LAUGH. Olivia nudges Chloe: Play nice.   

                                 OLIVIA 
                        Why don’t you sit down and have a 
                        glass of wine with us, Nancy.  

                                 JENNIFER
                        Or don’t. 

           More LAUGHS. Mortified, Nancy hurries into the bathroom. 
           INT. BATHROOM — CONTINUOUS 

           Nancy locks the door and sits on the toilet, afraid to go 
           back out. She drops her head in her hands and begins to CRY. 

           (O.C.) The PHONE RINGS.  

                                 OLIVIA (O.C.)
                        Nancy, it’s for you. It’s Karen 
                        from Ford. 

           Nancy brightens, RUNS out of the bathroom, and excitedly 
           takes the phone from Olivia.  

                                 NANCY
                        Hello!... This is Nancy.. Uh-huh... 
                        Uh-huh... But I don’t understand... 
                        What are you saying to me?... What 
                        does that mean?... Home?

           Jennifer and Chloe stifle laughs.  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        But I... I just got here...

           INT. OLDSMOBILE VISTA WAGON, MOVING — KANKAKEE — AFTERNOON   

           ON NANCY, depressed, staring out her window at the passing 
           storefronts. None taller than two stories. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Don’t be sad, Nanc. No one lasts 
                        more than a few weeks in New York 
                        anyway... How about I make your 
                        favorite dinner? We can stop at the 
                        grocery store and —  

                                 NANCY
                        I’m wanna go over and see Jimmy. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Oh, sweetheart, you didn’t hear? 

           Nancy turns to Connie. 

                                 CONNIE (CONT’D)
                        He left for California to live with 
                        his cousin. Just took off one night 
                        last week. His mother’s a wreck.

           Nancy’s stunned, trying to process the news as storefronts 
           give way to cornfields as far as the eye can see.

                                                        FADE OUT.

           INT. GILMORE’S DINER, KANKAKEE — NIGHT — 1991 

           Nancy moves across the diner floor, balancing plates of food 
           on her arms. She’s 26 now, tall and thin, blonde hair pulled 
           back to showcase those drop-dead eyes. Still beautiful but 
           ten years marooned here in Kankakee have revealed cracks in 
           the armor. She arrives at a booth and dispenses the dinners.
                                 NANCY
                        The Rocket Burger here, two Turkey 
                        Clubs, and the Lumberjack Omelet.  

           Nancy strolls off, then pauses upon seeing a TRIO OF COPS 
           drop two $5 bills as a tip before leaving.  

           Nancy walks that way and begins to gather the dirty plates. 
           In a perfected sleight of hand, she stretches across the 
           booth with her right hand while her left coolly slips a $5 
           dollar bill into her apron pouch. 

           GENE, 50s, the Milquetoast owner, approaches. 

                                 GENE
                        That’s not your table, Nanc. Maggie 
                        should be doing that.   

                                 NANCY
                        Ah, I’m all caught up anyway.  

                                 GENE
                        That’s my girl. 

           EXT. GILMORE’S DINER — GRAVEL LOT — DAWN  

           Nancy exits, smoking a cigarette as she counts her meager 
           tips. She scoffs at the total: another shitty night. 

           INT. RISH HOME, NANCY’S ROOM — AFTERNOON  

           It’s crowded with color-coordinated garment racks; dresses, 
           skirts, blouses, jeans. Nancy sleeps under a satin duvet, 
           sleep mask over her eyes. The alarm clock reads: 1:45 PM. 

           INT. BOURBONNAIS MALL, JCPENNEY’S — AFTERNOON   

           Nancy reviews the racks of clothing as she strolls through 
           the aisles. Unimpressed, seen-it-all, she approaches the 
           check-out counter where a crabby SALES CLERK, 50, is going 
           over the day’s receipts.  

                                 NANCY
                        Go find Kit and tell her Nancy’s 
                        here.  

                                 SALES CLERK 
                        Find her yourself. 

           Just then, KIT, 26, a short, spunky friend of Nancy’s, walks 
           out of the stock room with a stack of blouses in her arms. 

                                 NANCY
                        Hey-hey, Kit-Kat. 

                                 KIT
                          (looks up, beams)
                        Oh hey, Nanc! 
           INT. MALL FOOD COURT — ON NANCY AND KIT — AFTERNOON  

           CLOSE ON KIT’S TOTE BAG as she pulls out a folder. It’s a 
           veritable encyclopedia of Kankakee’s charmed circle: tear-
           outs from the ‘Society’ page, articles on corporate mergers, 
           Country Club newsletters.

                                 KIT 
                        Too bad about Peter.

                                 NANCY
                        Well, he didn’t have the will or 
                        the way. 

                                 KIT
                        I heard...  
                          (off Nancy’s glare)
                        Well, yunno, just... about his wife 
                        and all. Going to your house and...
                          (shrinking)
                        She’s crazy... As shit. 

           Nancy focuses back on the newspaper. STEPHEN SMALL, 50s now, 
           is pictured at a fundraiser beside his mother, ELAINE. Nancy 
           scribbles the word ‘DICKHEAD’ over his face. 

                                 KIT (CONT’D)
                        Oh! I knew there was something I 
                        had ‘specially for you.  

           She digs into her tote and fishes out a Kankakee Country Club 
           newsletter. Written across the top: Perfect for NANCY!!! Kit 
           flips through the pages, stops on a circled PHOTO: sandwiched 
           between TWO COUPLES is the 5th wheel: a husky man in his 40s. 

                                 KIT (CONT’D)
                        Brett Faber. Family owns a buncha 
                        Chevy dealerships. A little birdy 
                        who cocktails at the club says he’s 
                        the Last Man Standing at the main 
                        bar every Friday night.

           Nancy stares at the photo, already planning her outfit. 

                                 NANCY
                        Like shootin’ fish. I owe ya, Kit.
                          (glances at her watch)
                        Still have time to get some color. 

           EXT. KANKAKEE RIVER — LATE AFTERNOON 

           Nancy, wearing a white bikini and wayfarers, soaks in the 
           sun, reclining on the rocks she once shared with Jimmy Keene.  

           ACROSS THE RIVER 

           There’s a COOKOUT going on. A BOOMBOX plays R.E.M’s ‘Stand’ 
           as a group of local friends mingle, drink and eat BBQ. 
           CLOSE ON DANNY EDWARDS  

           30, handsome, tall, small-town. Right now he’s upside-down, 
           doing a keg stand as a crowd SHOUTS around him - twenty, 
           twenty-one, twenty-two. Danny COUGHS, SPITS out foam —  

                                 DANNY
                        Done — I’M DONE — ! 

           They stand him up. Disoriented, he high-fives the group 
           including NICK SANTO, 31, a working stiff with thinning hair.  

                                 NICK
                        Impressive, Dan-o!  

                                 DANNY
                        Whoa, that’s a rush, man. 

           Nick hands Danny a fresh beer. They look around, staking out 
           the crop of single females. 

                                 NICK
                        I’m vibing that brunette.

                                 DANNY
                          (sees the BRUNETTE)
                        Oh yeah. She’s cute. 

                                 NICK
                        She wearing a ring? 

                                 DANNY
                        Not that I can see. 

                                 NICK
                        Alright. No ring she’s up for a 
                        fling, right?  

           Danny LAUGHS. Nick gulps down his beer, pounds fists with 
           Danny and starts toward the Brunette. Three steps later a GUY 
           cruises in and kisses her. Nick spins back.  

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Okay, u-turns allowed. 

           He returns to Danny, cracks open another beer. Danny looks 
           around, admiring the scenery.  

                                 DANNY
                        Boy, it’s pretty here. There aren’t 
                        many places like this in Bedford. 

                                 NICK
                        There’s not much of anything in 
                        Bedford. I’ll borrow my dad’s boat 
                        one weekend. Give ya a real tour.   

           Danny’s eyes land on Nancy across the river. He nudges Nick. 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Holy Shit... Who is she?

                                 DANNY
                        I’d like to know. 
                                 NICK
                        So go over and find out.  

                                 DANNY
                          (coyly)
                        Nah...

                                 NICK
                        Come on, don’t be a pussy. What’s 
                        the worst that can happen? 

                                 DANNY
                        Uh, she tells me I’m a loser and to 
                        get lost. 

                                 NICK
                        Exactly. And you’re right back here 
                        drinking a beer with me. 

           Danny dithers, then, caught up in the moment, takes his shirt 
           and races into the river. 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Attaboy! 

           MOMENTS LATER    

           Danny climbs out of the water onto the rocks near Nancy. He 
           paces, looking back at her, unsure how to make his approach. 

                                 DANNY
                          (finally)
                        Hey there... 

           Nancy lowers her shades enough to take Danny in. Unimpressed, 
           she decides to just ignore him. 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I’m Danny. Looks like you’re, uh...
                          (reads her monogrammed 
                           beach bag)
                        Nancy. Anyway, I was just hanging 
                        out with some friends over there 
                        and wondered if you, uh, wanted to, 
                        yunno, join us for a Lite Beer or a 
                        wine cooler... if you’re not busy, 
                        or... It’s free.   

           He laughs. She doesn’t. 

                                 NANCY
                        You’re blocking my sun. 

                                 DANNY
                          (steps back)
                        Oh. Right. Sorry about that.

           An uncomfortable silence. Danny, getting the point now — 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Well, I should probably get back. 
                        It was good to meetcha, Nancy. 

           He heads back in the water, tail between his legs.  
           BACK AT THE COOKOUT

           Danny towels off. Nick approaches. 

                                 NICK
                        So... how’d it go? 

           Danny, staring at Nancy, makes a crash-and-burn sound effect. 

           INT. RISH HOME, FAMILY ROOM — NIGHT 

           CONNIE, late 40s now, sits on the couch making paper mache 
           birds. The years since we last saw her haven’t been kind. She 
           traded beauty for convenience and got shortchanged. 

                                 CONNIE 
                        Nancy, honey, are you almost ready? 

           INT. NANCY’S BATHROOM, UPSTAIRS — SAME 

           Nancy reviews her cocktail dress before the mirror. Adjusting 
           the sides of the V-neck imperceptibly. Over and over.  

                                 NANCY
                        Fuck...fuck...no you fuck...fucker!

           Then...she stops abruptly. Tilts her head slowly to the 
           right. A trace of a smile emerges on her face —  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Ready!

           INT. CONNIE’S CHEVY NOVA, MOVING — NIGHT  

           ON NANCY’S REFLECTION in the vanity mirror. She lengthens her 
           eyelashes, reviews her make-up, pushes up her breasts.  

           Connie drives, cigarette dangling from her lips. 

                                 NANCY
                        How do I look? 

           Connie appraises Nancy. Just like old times. Fixes a hair. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Most beautiful girl in the world.  

           Nancy makes a lip fart. The car idles outside a large and 
           stately clubhouse: Kankakee Country Club. Nancy opens the 
           door and steps out. 

                                 CONNIE (CONT’D)
                          (holding out Nancy’s 
                           jacket)
                        Hey! What about your coat, goofy? 

                                 NANCY
                          (winks)
                        Then he won’t see me. 
                                 CONNIE
                        Just like your Father. 

           The mirth runs away from Nancy’s face.  

                                 NANCY
                        Don’t ever say that to me again. 

           BOOM! — she SLAMS the car door shut. 

           INT. KANKAKEE COUNTRY CLUB, MAIN BAR — NIGHT 

           Nancy’s on a stool, eyes locked in on BRETT FABER across the 
           bar, sinking his fifth Glenlivet beside a GOLF BUDDY. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.C.)
                        Kankakee’s very own Stephen Small 
                        made national headlines today as...

           Her eyes drift up to the TV where the late news plays. Above 
           the anchor’s shoulder, a photo of STEPHEN SMALL. 

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        ...Mid America’s Chairman announced 
                        a long-speculated deal to acquire 
                        Regal International. The merger, 
                        estimated to be nearly $90 million 
                        dollars, sees Mid America taking 
                        control over 11 Chicago-based radio 
                        stations and 2 cable television 
                        stations from the privately owned 
                        radio broadcaster.

           A LAUGH snaps Nancy from her reverie. Golf Buddy says goodbye 
           to Brett and leaves. Nancy stubs out her cigarette, checks 
           her look in a compact mirror, and strolls over next to Brett. 

                                 NANCY
                        You got a light? 

                                 BRETT FABER
                        What happened to yours? 

                                 NANCY
                          (caught, adjusts)
                        Maybe I got tired of reaching into 
                        my purse. 

           She stabs a Virginia Slim between her lips. He lights it. 

                                 BRETT FABER  
                        You here alone? 

                                 NANCY
                        Mmm hmm.  

                                 BRETT FABER
                        All alone and a girl like you. That 
                        doesn’t add up.  

                                 NANCY
                        I never was any good at math... 

           He smiles and she does, too, and — 
           EXT. KANKAKEE COUNTRY CLUB — PARKING LOT — NANCY & BRETT 

           spill out of the entrance, hand-in-hand, drunk and laughing. 
           Nancy leans back against a sedan. 

                                 NANCY
                        Should we plan our first date? 

           He moves in to kiss her. She gives him her cheek. Horny as 
           fuck, he sloppily kisses her neck. She rolls her eyes. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        How about Charlie Trotter’s? Make a 
                        reservation for Friday night.

           Just then, HEADLIGHTS wash over them.  

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.C.)
                        Brett? 

           Brett looks. His WIFE’s inside a Chevy station wagon. TWO 
           KIDS in the backseat. Pulled from bed. His excitement melts. 

                                 WIFE
                        Get in the car, Brett. 

                                 NANCY
                        You’re... married...? 

           Brett climbs into the car. Wife’s eyes meet Nancy’s.  

                                 WIFE
                        I know who you are. 

           The station wagon rolls away. Nancy drunkenly stumbles toward 
           the payphone. Dials a number, shivers and covers herself.  

                                 NANCY
                        Mom...?

           INT. MALL FOOD COURT — AFTERNOON

           Nancy and Kit. A cloud of cigarette smoke. Nancy’s reading 
           the Society section of the Daily Journal.  

                                 KIT
                          (very excited)
                        Well... how’d it go with Brett!? 

                                 NANCY
                        You know that little birdy of yours 
                        from the club, Kit? 

                                 KIT
                          (ready to burst)
                        Yeah... 

                                 NANCY
                        It can go fuck itself... 

                                 KIT
                          (unnerved, regroups)
                        Anyway, I was thinking of posting 
                        up at the Hilton bar tonight. 
                                 KIT (CONT'D)
                        There’s a legal malpractice 
                        conference in town.  

                                 NANCY
                        Been there, done that. What else? 

                                 KIT
                        It’s that or Boomer Fleming’s 
                        party. 

                                 NANCY
                        You mean Poser Fleming? 

                                 KIT
                          (continuing)
                        He’s hosting it for Jimmy Keene. 

           Nancy looks up, floored. 

                                 NANCY
                        Jimmy...? But Jimmy’s — 

                                 KIT
                        Back in town. Well, Chicago. It’s 
                        gotta be, what — 

                                 NANCY
                          (lost in her own thoughts)
                        Ten years. 

                                 KIT
                        I wonder what the California sun’s 
                        done for that body.  

           Off Nancy, wondering the very same thing...

           INT. RISH HOME, LIVING ROOM — AFTERNOON

           Nancy stands behind the window sheers of the front window 
           peering out watchfully at Jimmy’s parents house. But there is 
           no sign of Jimmy, just MRS. KEENE doing some weeding. The 
           woman turns suddenly as if she knows she’s being watched, and 
           Nancy recedes behind the curtain.

           EXT. BOOMER FLEMING’S HOUSE — NIGHT 

           A large estate home in a new community. LOUD MUSIC emanates. 

           INT. FOYER — CONTINUOUS 

           CROWDED AND LOUD in here. Nancy wades through the mob in a  
           skintight dress, scanning the guests for Jimmy. She spots KIT 
           across the room and quickly hides her face.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.C.)
                        Nanc! 

           Looking up, she sees BOOMER FLEMING, 28, waving her over. 
           He’s the owner of this house, a local coke dealer, and, from 
           the leather fringe jacket and big hair, an avid Bon Jovi fan. 
                                 NANCY
                        Hey, Boom. 

                                 BOOMER
                        Come on, you don’t wunna hang out 
                        with these losers. 

           He takes her hand. They leave the crowd, walk down a hallway. 

                                 NANCY
                        What time’s Jimmy coming? 

                                 BOOMER
                        Late probably. 

                                 NANCY
                        But you’re sure he’s coming? 

                                 BOOMER
                        Yeah yeah, he’ll be here. Just 
                        gimme one second, huh. 

           Boomer pauses, KNOCKS on a door in the hall. Moments later 
           it’s opened by a brick shithouse black man, CLARENCE, 30. 

           While Boomer and Clarence talk in hushed voices, Nancy peers 
           INSIDE THE OFFICE. Another man, GARY, 30, stolid, mustached, 
           weighs cocaine on a Deering scale. There’s a lot of it, 
           divided into gram and eighth bags mostly. Finally — 

                                 BOOMER (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go. 

           Boomer and Nancy continue along, DOWN the stairs and into – 

           BOOMER’S BASEMENT 

           a huge, open space: a boy’s wet dream. We do a 180-DEGREE PAN 
           AROUND THE BASEMENT... 

           ...BOOMER introduces NANCY to some GROOVY GUYS and GIRLS. But 
           Nancy could give a shit and interrupts with a barrage of 
           questions — Do you guys know, Jimmy? What time’s he supposed 
           to be here? But you’re sure he’s coming?... 

           ...MTV on the big-screen TV. Roxette’s ‘Dangerous’ video... 

           ...THE WALLS are covered with posters; Def Leppard, Chicago 
           Bears, Sylvester Stallone...

           ...PEOPLE play arcade games, pool, air hockey, smoke pot...

           ARRIVE AT NANCY as she sits on the couch. Someone hands her a 
           mirror with lines of cocaine on it. She snorts a quick bump 
           and passes it along. 

           VERY CLOSE ON NANCY NOW. Settling in, thinking about Jimmy...
           BOOMER’S BASEMENT, SOME HOURS LATER NOW 

           ON THE BIG-SCREEN TV. MTV: The Cure now. The lights are very 
           dim and Nancy’s fallen asleep on the couch. She comes to 
           slowly, looks around. The clock reads: 3:13 AM.  

           FOYER  

           Nancy emerges from the basement. It’s quiet. Everyone gone.  

           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 

           Nancy opens doors she passes, peers inside. Each room empty 
           or filled with SCREWING COUPLES. Then...she sees something —  

           DOWN THE HALLWAY, a BEDROOM DOOR is open. Nancy makes out 
           BOOMER, CLARENCE and GARY inside. They’re talking to a group 
           of unseen men. THERE’S A DEAL GOING DOWN. Boomer opens a kilo 
           of coke. Dips a finger, tastes it. Takes a bump. Then Gary. 
           Then Clarence. Nods all around: it’s good. Boomer pulls cash 
           from a zipper bag... someone steps forward to retrieve it...

           It’s JIMMY KEENE, wearing a classic racer leather jacket. 
           Full head of hair: more handsome and cool than ever. 

           Jimmy tucks the cash away. The men exit the room. 

           Nancy hides behind the partition. They pass her one-by-one. 
           Boomer, Clarence, Gary, Four Men in Jimmy’s Crew (all very 
           hip, bad, cool). Jimmy’s last. As he passes —  

                                 NANCY
                        Jimmy. 

           He turns. Eyes-on-eyes. He doesn’t speak: just smiles at her.

                                 BUSINESS ASSOCIATE 
                        Let’s ride, Jimmy.  

                                 JIMMY
                        Gimme five minutes. 

                                 BUSINESS ASSOCIATE  
                        Come on, man, we gotta roll — 

                                 JIMMY
                        Five minutes. 

           When he talks, they listen. The rest of the crew walks out. 

           INT. BATHROOM — MOMENTS LATER 

           Nancy sits on the sink. Jimmy stands before her. They’ve been 
           sitting here for a few moments just looking at one another. 

                                 NANCY
                          (finally)
                        You just...left. 
                                 JIMMY
                        I always told you I had my own 
                        plans. Kinda surprised to see 
                        you’re still hanging around. 

           Nancy looks into his eyes. He knows what happened in New 
           York. More importantly what didn’t.

                                 NANCY
                        Did you ever think about me? 

                                 JIMMY
                          (beat)
                        No matter what, it wouldn’t have 
                        been the way you dreamed it. 

                                 NANCY
                        I hate it here, Jimmy. I hate it.  

                                 JIMMY
                        Then leave. Get on a bus. Go 
                        somewhere. You got any money? 

                                 NANCY
                        Take me with you. I’d be great in 
                        Chicago. 

                                 JIMMY
                        Yeah... yeah you probably would. 

                                 NANCY
                        Well then...? 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Nanc. Who do you think 
                        you’re talking to? I’m not one of 
                        your easy marks around this place, 
                        I know how you’re built. Besides, I 
                        got too much going on right now. 

           Undaunted, she slides a hand inside his jacket, under his 
           shirt and rubs his chest. Down to his crotch now. He takes 
           her hand away. She tries to kiss him. He turns his head. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                          (a bit desperate)
                        Don’t leave me here again.  

           A long beat. He looks like he’s making a decision. Finally —

                                 JIMMY
                        Alright. Two minutes. Be outside. 

                                 NANCY
                          (blooms)
                        Yeah? Jimmy yeah? Huh?  

           He looks at her, pulls her hair back so he can see her face. 

                                 JIMMY
                        Better fix your hair back, Ci-Ci. 
                        So you can get under the helmet. 

           He walks out. Nancy stands, turns on the sink, looks in the 
           mirror. She’s excited, anxious: the world is possible! 
                                 NANCY
                          (singing, dancing)
                        Hold on tight/You know she’s a 
                        little bit dangerous/

           She takes a deep breath. Releases it. She’s about to exit 
           when — VRMMM! a familiar motorcycle growl stops her cold. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuck! 

           EXT. BOOMER FLEMING’S HOUSE — MOMENTS LATER 

           Nancy RUSHES outside. All that remains of Jimmy are the 
           taillights of his motorcycle as he and his crew speed off. 

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM — AFTERNOON 

           ON A PRECISELY ARRANGED CLOTHING RACK, each garment adorned 
           with a detailed manila tag describing date last worn; persons

           to strategize and organize every arrow in her quiver.

           Nancy writes in Locals, then reconsiders, crosses it out and 
           fills in Losers. She attaches the label to the dress she wore 
           last night, neatly inserts it in the clothing rack. 

           KNOCK-KNOCK. Connie peeks her head in, dressed in her Dollar 
           Store work uniform.      

                                 CONNIE 
                        Madeja something. 

           She hands Nancy a homemade ‘Sand Candle.’ It’s ghastly.  

                                 NANCY
                        Thanks, mom... 

                                 CONNIE
                        See you later, beautiful.  

           Connie shuts the door. 

           INT. CONNIE’S BEDROOM — MOMENTS LATER   

           Connie’s ‘craft desk’ sits in the corner, a poster of Tom 
           Selleck stares down from the wall. Nancy enters the room, 
           bends down and reaches under the bed. 

           MOMENTS LATER 

           TEAR SHEETS FROM NATIONAL CLOTHING CATALOGS. All depicting 
           Connie, a real beauty back then. The day pant suits went out 
           of style was the saddest of her life.  

           Nancy leafs through, until...something hidden between pages. 
           An OLD PHOTO. 
           3-YEAR OLD NANCY in her FATHER’S arms, a smiling 19-YEAR OLD 
           CONNIE at his side. His startling eyes, just like Nancy’s, 
           gaze off-camera, as if searching for something else not 
           present in the picture.   

           She runs her finger over the photo...

           INT. CONNIE’S BATHROOM — MOMENTS LATER 

           Nancy stands before the mirror, breathing like she’s been 
           scared. And indeed she has been by Connie’s unabated descent 
           to normality. Reaching up, her fingers pull down the skin on 
           her face in an attempt to mimic the ravages of age. 

           Shaken, Nancy stops and puts her hands on the sinktop, 
           shaking her head, convincing herself it won’t happen to her. 

           INT. GILMORE’S DINER — NIGHT SHIFT 

           Nancy’s replacing salt-and-pepper shakers in the booths when 
           something catches her eye. IT’S DANNY. Waiting for a table.  

                                 NANCY
                        Oh God...

           Nancy U-turns, leaves the shaker tray on the counter and 
           approaches the booth of an ELDERLY COUPLE, her back to Danny. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Everything tasting okay? 

           Torpid nods. Nancy glances over her shoulder to make sure 
           Danny’s not being seated in her section when...

           ...STEPHEN SMALL WALKS IN, shakes Danny’s hand. Nancy’s 
           confused as she watches the two men sit at a booth. She 
           strategically moves near their section and begins to refill 
           ketchup bottles as she tilts an ear to their conversation:   

                                 SMALL 
                        ...that’s what Nick said...You were 
                        running your own business, no?... 

                                 DANNY
                        ...That’s right. I was...

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.C.)
                        Miss? Excuse me, Miss? 

                                 SMALL
                        ...I could use someone like you to 
                        handle things. Especially with all 
                        the new changes taking place. Come 
                        by tomorrow, I’ll show you around.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.C.)
                        Miss!? MISS!  

           Nancy whip-turns to a VERY TINY OLD WOMAN. Stares daggers and 
           MARCHES over to her booth. 
                                 VERY TINY OLD WOMAN
                          (suddenly timid)
                        My fish is cold. I think...?

           Nancy SNATCHES the plate away and vanishes into the kitchen.  

           LATER 

           Nancy watches Danny’s booth at a distance. WAITRESS drops off 
           the bill. Small examines it, lays down some cash, reexamines 
           it and takes a dollar bill back. He turns the bill to Danny 
           now. The men stand, shake hands. Small puts on his coat and 
           exits the restaurant. Danny sits back down, adds his half to 
           the bill. Nancy nears. 

                                 NANCY 
                        Give her a few extra bucks.  

                                 DANNY
                          (looks up)
                        Oh hey, hi. Hi, Nancy. 

                                 NANCY
                        I wanted to apologize for the other 
                        day at the river. I wasn’t feeling 
                        very well. 

                                 DANNY
                        You don’t have to apologize — 

                                 NANCY
                        So anyway... Yes. 

                                 DANNY
                        What’s that? 

                                 NANCY
                        I never answered you. I’d love to 
                        have a drink sometime... 

                                 DANNY
                        Danny. 

                                 NANCY
                        Danny, right.

                                 DANNY
                        You sure? I mean —  
                          (she nods)
                        Well okay, uhh, when did — 

                                 NANCY
                        Saturday. 7. Make a reservation at 
                        Vittorio’s on Eldridge. 

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah. Yeah sure. Saturday.  

           Nancy walks away. Danny puts his wallet away. It’s like the 
           wind’s been knocked from him. In the best possible way.  

                                 NANCY (O.C.)
                        Here you go. 
           STARTLED, Danny jumps. Nancy hands him a napkin with her 
           phone number written on it. Now she’s really gone. 

           INT. MAZDA 929, PARKED — AFTERNOON 

           From across the river, Nancy spies The Yesteryear Restaurant 
           with a pair of binoculars. Inside, Small gives Danny a tour. 

           INT. FIRST IMPRESSIONS SALON — SATURDAY AFTERNOON 

           CLOSE ON A MAGAZINE TEAR-OUT OF KIM BASINGER as Nancy hands 
           it to a HAIR STYLIST and slips into the salon chair. 

                                 NANCY
                        I want it exactly like this. The 
                        way it sits on her shoulders. 

           MINUTES LATER — Nancy’s CHAIR is spun around to the mirror. 
           Her hair looks exactly like Kim Basinger’s. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know... something about it 
                        just looks... different... Why are 
                        my bangs sweeping across my eyes 
                        here, while hers do it here? 

                                 STYLIST
                          (annoyed)
                        Because you have a different head. 

           SECONDS LATER — an enraged Nancy hurriedly gathers her purse 
           and jacket from the sitting area where CUSTOMERS wait. 

                                 NANCY
                          (barks at ELDERLY WOMAN)
                        Don’t trust her! She’s a cheat!

           Elderly Woman shrinks, on the verge of a heart attack. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Buncha fucking amateurs!  

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM, VANITY — EARLY EVENING 

           ON NANCY’S FACE. Eyes intense, like she’s getting psyched up 
           for a sports match. PULLING BACK, we reveal she’s staring at 
           herself in the vanity mirror. 

           Outside, A CAR DOOR SHUTS. Nancy doesn’t blink.  

           INT. RISH HOME, FAMILY ROOM — EVENING  

           Connie’s on the couch in her weekend sweats, crocheting an 
           afghan. An episode of Who’s The Boss? plays on the TV. 

           DING-DONG. Connie answers the door. Danny holds a bouquet of 
           roses. He’s dressed in Dockers and a button-down. 

                                 CONNIE
                        You must be Danny. 
                                 DANNY
                        That’s right. Danny Edwards. 

                                 CONNIE
                        I’m Connie. Come in, come in.   

                                 DANNY
                          (stepping inside)
                        Beautiful home you got here. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Probably a little smaller than what 
                        you’re used to, but it suits us. 

           Danny’s eyes sweep across the walls adorned with Connie’s 
           craft projects; pom pom animals, bottle cap frames, et al.     

                                 DANNY
                        Wow, someone’s an artist.  

                                 CONNIE
                        Oh yeah. It’s Picasso, Van Gogh and 
                        Connie Rish. 

                                 DANNY
                          (dead serious)
                        Is that right? 

                                 CONNIE
                          (nevermind, calls 
                           upstairs)
                        Nancy! Nancy honey, Danny’s here!

                                 NANCY (O.C.)
                        In-a-minute. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Sit down if you want, Danny. 

                                 DANNY
                        Oh no. I’m fine standing. 

           Connie plops back into the couch. Something flaky happens on 
           TV: frying-pan-on-the-head-type moment. Danny ROARS. Then — 

           CLICK-CLACK-CLICK. Danny turns to find Nancy coming down the 
           stairs in a knockout black cocktail dress.  

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                          (not a word, just a sound)
                        ...wow...

           EXT. RISH HOME — MOMENTS LATER 

           Exiting the home, Nancy immediately notes Danny’s FORD PICK-
           UP TRUCK. She’s taken aback slightly, but quickly masters 
           this letdown. After all, it could be a weekend car. 

           Danny jogs ahead and opens her door.  
           INT. VITTORIO’S RESTAURANT — NIGHT 

           Choice Italian. Intimate ambience. Nancy hands the wine list 
           back to the WAITER. 

                                 NANCY 
                        — the ‘85 Felsina Chianti. And I’ll 
                        have the twin lobster tails. 

           Unbeknownst to Nancy, Danny is already adding prices in his 
           head, hoping he can afford this bill. 

                                 DANNY
                          (thinks, vacillates)
                        Yunno, I’m riding a diet. Just the 
                        uh, small ceasar salad for me. 

           Waiter collects their menus. Nancy leans in, stares into 
           Danny’s eyes as though reading them for some deeper insight. 

                                 NANCY
                        Talk to me, Danny. Tell me all 
                        about you. 

                                 DANNY
                        Well, I just moved here from 
                        Beford, Ohio. Guess it’s been about 
                        a month now.

                                 NANCY
                        Business reasons? 

                                 DANNY
                        Mostly, yeah. 

           He slathers butter onto a piece of bread. While he chews — 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I come from a pretty big family. 
                        Mom, Dad and four older sisters. 

           He slips out his wallet and shows Nancy a picture of the 
           family inside a Church. Countrified MOM and DAD, his four 
           horse-faced SISTERS and their loutish HUSBANDS. 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        That’s at my sister Peg’s wedding 
                        last summer. I’m the baby of the 
                        bunch. The happy accident my folks 
                        like to say.

           Nancy’s eyes glaze over. She leans back in her chair.

                                 NANCY
                        Why does every guy feel the need to 
                        do that? 

                                 DANNY
                        Do what?

                                 NANCY
                        Bore a girl with their mythology. 
                        Do you really think that’s what we 
                        want to hear? 
                                 DANNY
                          (tucking the wallet away)
                        Oh, I thought you wanted — 

                                 NANCY
                        What I want, Danny, is to know 
                        where you’re going – the part of 
                        your story that might include me.

                                 DANNY
                        ... okay. I’m sorry, it’s just 
                        that, well...

                                 NANCY
                        What is it? 

                                 DANNY
                        Nothing. 

                                 NANCY
                        Say it. 

                                 DANNY
                        Well...you’re so glamorous, Nancy. 
                        I’m surprised you’re not a model or 
                        something. 

                                 NANCY
                          (brightens at this)
                        Well, I was... in New York. 

                                 DANNY
                        The Big Apple, huh? Would I have 
                        seen you in any magazines? 

           He has unwittingly asked the wrong question.

                                 NANCY
                        What did I just say, Danny? Does 
                        that part of my story include you?  

                                 DANNY
                        No, I guess it doesn’t. 

                                 NANCY
                        Right... Now, what type of business 
                        do you have with Mr. Small?  

                                 DANNY
                        Oh, well that’s — 

                                 NANCY
                        You can’t say, can you? It’s radio. 
                        No, no, no: TV. It’s TV, isn’t it? 

                                 DANNY
                        No. Me? TV? No, no – 

                                 NANCY
                        Bigger? 

                                 DANNY
                        Bigger than what? 
           The waiter arrives with the Chianti and pours Nancy a taste. 
           Trying to impress, she makes a show of swirling it, sniffing 
           the bouquet, sipping the wine. Finally, she nods.

                                 NANCY
                        Do you travel a lot, Danny? 

                                 DANNY
                        Just to visit clients mostly.  

                                 NANCY
                        That’s the thing with me: I love to 
                        travel. Just the other day I spent 
                        a whole hour reading an article 
                        about the Fontainebleau in Miami. 

                                 DANNY
                        Miami? Oh I don’t go that far. 

                                 NANCY
                        So this business in Bedford just 
                        kept growing and growing. So much 
                        so you had to expand and now here 
                        you are.   

                                 DANNY
                        Here I am. 

           They smile. Nancy offers her glass. CHEERS — CLINK! Upon 
           sipping the wine again, it’s bitter. She begins to fish ice 
           cubes out of her table water and deposit them into her wine 
           glass — TINK-TINK-TINK. 

                                 NANCY
                        I have a feeling about you, Danny. 
                        Things are just gonna burst wide 
                        open here for you. 

                                 DANNY
                        Well I hope so. 

                                 NANCY
                        Me, too, Danny...  

           She reaches across the table. Takes his hand in hers. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        ...Me, too.

           INT. DANNY’S PICK-UP TRUCK, MOVING — NIGHT   

           Nancy’s got a good buzz going as she lets the wind cool her 
           face. She takes in a deep breath. Even the air seems sweeter. 

           ZZZZ. ZZZZ. The pager affixed to Danny’s Dockers glows. He’s 
           quick to silence it. But he’s thinking. Nancy notices. 

                                 NANCY
                          (caring)
                        What is it? 

                                 DANNY
                        Oh it’s nothing...just one of my 
                        clients. I’ll drop you off first. 
                                 NANCY
                        You can go now... If you’re not 
                        embarrassed to have me with you. 

                                 DANNY
                        Embarrassed? Are you kidding? I 
                        just didn’t want to put you out.

                                 NANCY
                        You’re not putting me out. I don’t 
                        want to go home yet anyway. 

           He looks over at her. She’s smiling at him. 

           PICK-UP TRUCK, MINUTES LATER 

           Danny inspects addresses as he crawls down the road, turns 
           into a drive, stopping in front of the wrought iron gates of 
           The Prettiest House in Town: The Small Family Home. 

           Nancy shoots forward sharply. Danny rolls down the window and 
           presses the intercom.  

                                 DANNY
                        Hi there, it’s Danny Edwards. 

           Nancy waits anxiously. THE GATES OPEN: a portal to another 
           world. The mansion comes into view. She GASPS, grabs Danny’s 
           thigh and SQUEEZES IT TIGHT. Danny smiles, kinda likes it. 

           INT. SMALL’S HOUSE, FOYER — NIGHT 

           AN AUGUST, CATERED AFFAIR for the privileged, entitled folks 
           of Kankakee. A STRING TRIO plays. 

           SMALL and his mother, ELAINE, 70, finish a conversation with 
           an ATTRACTIVE BRUNETTE, 50.  

                                 ATTRACTIVE BRUNETTE 
                        — Nice to see you, Elaine. Very 
                        nice to meet you, Stephen. 

           When Brunette’s safely out of earshot, Elaine’s smile fades.  

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        What did you think? 

                                 SMALL  
                        Think? We talked for three minutes, 
                        Mother. I hardly know her. 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        You hardly know anyone. That’s why 
                        I waste money on these things...so 
                        you’ll meet someone. I didn’t like 
                        her. Elaine? The presumption on her 
                        part. How about Mrs. Small? Oh 
                        look, there’s William’s friend. 

           Elaine signals an ELEGANT RED-HEAD. But Small’s focused on 
           something else: the MALE SERVER, 21, passing out champagne 
           flutes behind the woman.
                                 ELAINE SMALL (CONT’D)
                        She’s pretty, isn’t she? 

           Male Server meets Small’s gaze, smiles back suggestively. 

                                 SMALL 
                        Very. 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Stephen? Stephen, that man’s here. 

           Small snaps from his reverie, spots Danny by the front door. 

                                 ELAINE SMALL (CONT’D)
                        Hurry up and get him in the 
                        kitchen. 

           NANCY AND DANNY

           Wait by the doorway. Danny sees Small waving him over. 

                                 DANNY
                        I’ll just be a couple’a minutes.  

           He heads that way. Danny and Small vanish down a hallway.

           Alone, Nancy wades through the crowd, soaking in the moneyed 
           gentry. She slips up the grand staircase, eager to explore 
           every nook and cranny of the manor. 

           INT. MRS. SMALL’S BEDROOM — NIGHT   

           A large room filled with antique furniture and silk drapes. 
           Nancy floats about, touching every appointment. 

           She opens a jewelry box atop the dresser. Slips a bracelet 
           over her wrist and checks her look in the mirror.

           LARGE WALK-IN CLOSET  

           Nancy switches on the light. Floor-to-ceiling shelves house 
           hundreds of mint JUMEAU BISQUE DOLLS. Gorgeous, expensive 
           versions of Nancy’s childhood Barbies. 

           Entranced, Nancy lifts a blonde doll from a shelf and studies 
           its pure alabaster face. As she replaces it, she notices a 
           small switch on the wall behind where the doll was. She 
           presses the button. 

           A HUMMING SOUND startles her. She steps back as two shelves 
           suddenly part to reveal a VAULT DOOR. Intrigued, Nancy 
           punches numbers into the KEYPAD. She turns the spindle wheel. 
           Nothing’s working. Then —   

           CHATTER is heard nearby. She thinks better of it and hits the 
           button a second time. Off Nancy watching the shelves hide the 
           vault door, wondering... 
           INT. GRAND STAIRCASE — MOMENTS LATER — ON NANCY 

           as she steps down and joins the party, searching for Danny. A 
           TAP on her shoulder. Nancy turns. SMALL hands her a pile of 
           dirty napkins and soiled toothpicks. 

                                 SMALL
                        Well don’t just stand there. 

           Before Nancy can explain that she’s not the help –   

                                 SMALL (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name? 

           She perks up, thinking maybe he’s interested in her.   

                                 NANCY
                        Nancy. Nancy Rish. 

                                 SMALL
                        The next time you come into my home 
                        dressed like a call girl will be 
                        your last. Do you understand me, 
                        Nancy Rish? 

           She just looks at him, mortified. The rejection is palpable. 

                                 SMALL (CONT’D)
                        Now take that trash into the 
                        kitchen.

           Nancy PUSHES her way through the crowd, bumping those in her 
           way as she moves into —

           THE KITCHEN 

           where a PACK OF TUXEDO-CLAD CATERERS scuttle about and... 
           someone’s head is in the oven. Nancy steps forward to get a 
           better view and slowly discerns — 

                                 NANCY
                        Danny...?

           Nancy approaches, YANKS Danny out of the oven. He looks up.

                                 DANNY
                        Oh, hey, Nanc. Almost through here. 

                                 NANCY
                        What the hell are you doing? 

                                 DANNY
                        Just replacing the bake element. 
                        Thing’s totally fried.

           The realization comes to her slowly, like bread rising. 

           INT. DANNY’S PICK-UP TRUCK, MOVING — NIGHT 

           NANCY SMOKES a cigarette, head against the window. She won’t 
           even look at Danny. 
                                 NANCY
                        You’re a liar, Danny. If that’s 
                        even your real name. 

                                 DANNY
                        What else would it be? 

                                 NANCY
                        I saw you in the diner talking with 
                        Mr. Small. Oh yeah you’re real big. 
                          (parrots him)
                        I had my own business in Bedford 
                        and I’d be happy to stop by the 
                        house, Mr. Small. Yeah, big fucking 
                        deal you turned out to be.

           Nancy indignantly FLICKS her cigarette out the window.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m sorry if you feel I did 
                        something wrong, Nancy. Yeah, I had 
                        a little handyman business in 
                        Bedford. I called it Odds and Ends. 

                                 NANCY
                        How perfect. The Odd part. 

                                 DANNY
                        Business wasn’t bad, I just felt 
                        like I was spinning my wheels a 
                        bit, yunno... My sisters are all 
                        older. Friends are married. Nick, 
                        he’s an old buddy of mine... 

           Nancy’s getting bored, rolls her eyes. 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        He offered to introduce me to some 
                        people in town to help me get my 
                        business started. That’s how I met 
                        Mr. Small. He needed someone to 
                        help out around the house and at 
                        that restaurant he’s got. I was 
                        glad to have the work. That’s all 
                        there is to it. No lying or 
                        pretending to be something I’m not. 
                        I’m just, yunno, me. Danny. 

                                 NANCY
                          (under her breath)
                        That’s the problem. 

           He SIGHS, unable to hide his disappointment. 

           EXT. RISH HOME — NIGHT 

           The pick-up rolls into the drive. Before it comes to a stop, 
           Nancy bursts out, SLAMS the door and stamps toward the home. 

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM — NIGHT 

           NANCY SOBS ON THE BED. She tries to compose herself but her 
           chest heaves and the sobs return. 
           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM — MORNING — A SERIES OF SHOTS 

           — The digital clock reads 7:15 AM and, strangely, Nancy’s 
           wide awake, sitting up in bed, arms crossed, thinking.  

           — Nancy PACES around the room. The gears are turning.  

           — Nancy slides out a small filing cabinet from under her bed. 
           Inside accordion files are labeled by name. Tabs include; 
           Peter Snyder, Esq...Ben Faber (Married Fuckhead)...Jimmy 
           Keene. Each file contains a history of the relationship: 
           photos, articles, likes/dislikes, outfits worn...  

           — Nancy stands in the center of the room. Surrounding her on 
           the carpet, photos from the files have been dumped and spread 
           into a circle. The men’s faces stare up at her. Each photo is 
           given a cursory assessment and promptly KICKED OUT OF THE 
           CIRCLE upon not living up to Nancy’s standards. SOOSH-SOOSH-
           SOOSH-SOOSH. Over-and-over. Face after face sent out like 
           windblown leaves. Nancy’s working up a sweat. 

           — Finally, ONLY ONE PICTURE REMAINS. It’s a photo of herself 
           and Jimmy. 9 years old. Swimming in the Kankakee River. 

           Her head falls into her hands. Helplessness overwhelms her. 
           She can’t see a way out of this... 

           ...Then, a FLAPPING SOUND. Nancy peeks over her fingers and 
           notices a Vogue sitting on the floor, open to a cologne ad. A 
           male model stares back at her. 

           Her face wrinkles curiously. She picks up the magazine. The 
           model almost looks like... Danny. Better-dressed and more 
           handsome, but maybe Danny... 

           PUSH IN ON NANCY... a smile pulling at the corners of her 
           lips... an idea flickering to life. 

           INT. DANNY’S APARTMENT — DEN — LATE MORNING  

           A modest place. Moving boxes litter the floor. Danny and Nick 
           are watching a college football game. ON THE SCREEN: a PLAYER 
           returns a kick-off and breaks free.  

                                 DANNY & NICK
                        — Go go — GO GO GO! TOUCHDOWN! 

           They cheer, high-five. The PHONE RINGS. Danny answers —  

                                 DANNY
                        Odds and Ends, this is Danny...  

                                 NANCY (O.C.)
                        I need to ask you something. 

                                 DANNY
                          (sits up)
                        Nancy...? 

           Nick, who’s heard about the date, looks at him: really? 

                                 NANCY (O.C.)
                        Are you serious about us? 
                                 DANNY
                        What...? 

                                 NANCY (O.C.)
                        About ussss, Danny! Our future 
                        together.  

                                 DANNY
                        Uh, well... I guess so, Nancy. 

                                 NANCY (O.C.)
                        Gimme your address. I’m coming 
                        over. 

                                 DANNY
                        I’m at Castle Point. Apartment 317. 

           CLICK. Confused, Danny looks at the phone, then hangs it up.  

                                 NICK
                        What was that about? 

                                 DANNY
                        She’s coming over. 

           INT. DANNY’S CLOSET — LATER THAT MORNING 

           WHOOSH! Nancy pushes aside a series of shirts on a closet 
           rod. Takes them down one-by-one, sizes them up and tosses 
           them to the floor. Danny watches from the doorway.

                                 NANCY
                          (sotto, disgusted)
                        Jesus... 
                          (back to Danny)
                        Get dressed. We’re going out. 

                                 DANNY
                        Out where? What’s this about, 
                        Nancy?  

           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE, DRESSING ROOM HALLWAY — MORNING 

           NANCY TAPS HER FOOT IMPATIENTLY, waiting on Danny. 

                                 DANNY (O.C.)
                        I’m not sure this is really me. 

                                 NANCY
                        Let me be the judge of that. 

           Danny steps out wearing a Searsucker blazer and white pants.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        You’re right. It’s not you. Get 
                        back in there and try the next one.  
           INT. DANNY’S APARTMENT, HALLWAY — MORNING 

           MOVING DOWN A TRAIL OF DEPARTMENT STORE SHOPPING BAGS, wire 
           hangers, tissue paper, size stickers, price tags: the 
           remnants of a full-scale shopping bender. 

           At the end of the hallway, ARRIVE AT NANCY sitting on the 
           edge of the single bed smoking a cigarette. 

                                 NANCY
                        Hurry up! I’ve gotta go to work. 

           Danny comes out of the bathroom in a black t-shirt and blue 
           jeans. His hair’s slicked back with gel. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Tuck the shirt in.  
                          (he does)
                        I need to see it with the jacket. 

           He slips back into the bathroom, reemerges wearing the 
           CLASSIC RACER MOTORCYCLE JACKET. Just like Jimmy Keene. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Okay now walk towards me. 

           He does, in his usual lumbering gait. The PHONE RINGS.  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you dare answer that. 

                                 DANNY
                        It might be a customer. 
                          (picks up the phone)
                        Odds and Ends, Danny speaking... Oh 
                        hi, Mrs. McGarvey... The garbage 
                        disposal, huh? Okay, what kinda 
                        sound is it making? 

           Nancy’s BOILING. Gesturing for him to cut it off. Finally – 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Actually I’m a little busy today, 
                        can I come over first thing in the 
                        morning?... Okay, see you then... 

           He hangs the phone up. 

                                 NANCY 
                        Go do it again. Shoulders back. 
                        Hand in your right pocket. 

           He does exactly as she says. Walks toward her again. If you 
           didn’t know any better you’d think it was Jimmy Keene.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Anyone ever tell you you look like 
                        Richard Gere?  

                                 DANNY
                          (flattered)
                        No, no — Do you really think so?  

                                 NANCY
                        Oh yeah. 
           Nancy drops her cigarette in a Coke can and grabs her purse. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        You’re taking me to dinner 
                        tomorrow. Be in my driveway by 8. 

           And she’s gone, leaving Danny more confused than ever.  

           INT. TGIF FRIDAY’S RESTAURANT — FOLLOWING NIGHT 

           A PAINTED FINGERNAIL PUSHES F17 On a GIBSON WURLITZER JUKEBOX. 
           A 45 obediently drops onto the platter, and Eddie Money’s 
           ‘Baby Hold On’ fills the joint.

           Danny messily picks apart a basket of chicken wings. Nancy 
           hasn’t touched her salad. She’s smoking and studying him like 
           a zoo keeper studying the behavior of a new baboon.  

                                 NANCY
                        Who are you, Danny? 

                                 DANNY
                        You know who I am — 

                                 NANCY
                        I mean what do you want out of 
                        life? What are your dreams? 

                                 DANNY 
                        Well, I’d like to own my own 
                        hardware store. Ever since I was 
                        nine years old — 

                                 NANCY
                        You had a lot of customers back in 
                        Bedford, didn’t you?  

                                 DANNY
                        Oh sure. At least fifty.  

                                 NANCY
                        How’d you keep track of them all? 

                                 DANNY
                        I had one’a them little Rolodex 
                        thingamajigs. Names, addresses, 
                        phone numbers, invoice copies —  

                                 NANCY
                        And these customers, they’d call on 
                        you all hours of the night to come 
                        and fix things? 

                                 DANNY
                        If there was an emergency, sure. 

                                 NANCY
                        Come here, Danny. Sit next to me. 

           He motions to stand — 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Wipe your face first. 
           He opens a wet-nap, cleans his face and then sits beside her. 
           Nancy reaches into her purse under the tabletop, stealthily 
           pulls out a small vial of cocaine. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever seen this before? 
                          (he shakes his head)
                        I want you to watch what I do. 

           She taps a bit of coke onto her finger, snorts a bump. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Okay your turn. 

           She taps another bit onto her finger. Brings it to Danny’s 
           nose. He snorts it, looks confused, then swallows hard. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Does it feel good?  

           He nods, unsure. Rubs his nose. Another tap onto Nancy’s 
           finger. Up to Danny’s nose. He snorts. His heart beats 
           faster. He leans back in the booth, a bit dazed.  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        How much money do you make doing 
                        your little handyman thing, Danny? 

                                 DANNY
                        Well I usually charge about $7.50 
                        an hour. Except for family. Family 
                        and friends get a discount — 

                                 NANCY
                        What if I told you about a job 
                        where you could make a hundred 
                        times that in one night? Would you 
                        be interested? 

                                 DANNY
                        Oh yeah...  

                                 NANCY
                        I can help you reach your dream, 
                        Danny. Is that what you want?   

           He looks over at her. She’s irresistible. He nods. Nancy’s 
           hand moves up his leg to his crotch. Danny goes wide-eyed.  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Do you like this song?

                                 DANNY
                        Sure, Nancy. 

                                 NANCY
                        Then it’s ours.

           EXT. ‘THE BLUE ROOM’ NIGHTCLUB – KANKAKEE – NIGHT 

           Danny watches, as Nancy flirts with the riproided DOORMAN, the 
           guy never taking his eyes off her chest as he reaches down and 
           lifts up the velvet rope. Nancy signals for Danny to follow.
           INT. ‘THE BLUE ROOM’ NIGHTCLUB – KANKAKEE – SAME 

           MOVE WITH NANCY AND DANNY as they enter the crowded club. 
           Nancy takes stock of the place. The cool cats and dealers 
           pack into semi-circular booths on the periphery. That’s where 
           she notices BOOMER, GARY and CLARENCE. 

           Nancy and Danny arrive at the bar. 

                                 NANCY
                        Order me a martini. Get yourself a 
                        scotch.   

                                 DANNY
                        Scotch? 

           She glares. He understands, nods. While Danny looks for a 
           bartender, Nancy spies Boomer’s booth where he is just now 
           being dragged onto the dance floor by a hot brunette.

                                 NANCY
                        Stay here. Don’t move and don’t 
                        talk to anybody. 

           FOLLOW NANCY as she pushes her way onto the dance floor, and 
           right into Boomer’s line of sight. 

                                 BOOMER
                        Nancy! 

                                 NANCY
                        Oh, hey. 

                                 BOOMER
                        Who are you here with? 

                                 NANCY
                        No one. Just my boyfriend. 

           She signals Danny back at the bar. He’s eating maraschino 
           cherries from the bartender’s supply. She could burn him. 

                                 BOOMER
                        Who is he? 

                                 NANCY
                        That’s Danny Edwards. You know 
                        Danny, he was a big operator over 
                        in Cleveland. 

                                 BOOMER
                        Well, what’s he doing here? 

                                 NANCY
                        You’re looking at it. Moved over 
                        here just to be with me. 

           Boomer studies Danny. Nancy’s about to walk away when — 

                                 BOOMER 
                        Bring him by the table. 

                                 NANCY
                        Maybe, yeah. We’re not staying long. 
           AT THE BAR — MOMENTS LATER  

           Nancy slides in beside Danny. He hands her the martini. 

                                 DANNY
                        I like this joint. Good vibe, good 
                        lighting. 

           He sips his scotch: the strength stuns him. She presses her 
           body up against Danny, caresses his chest.   

                                 NANCY
                        Tell me something funny, Danny. 
                        Make me laugh. 

                                 DANNY
                        Geez, I don’t know, Nancy. I’m not 
                        that funny, yunno... Well, I did 
                        have this crazy dog.   

           Nancy’s already LAUGHING, stealing glances at Boomer’s booth. 

           BOOMER’S BOOTH 

           Boomer slides in. Clarence and Gary (we met them at Boomer’s 
           party) are there, each with TWO GIRLS under their arms.  

                                 BOOMER 
                          (signals Danny)
                        You recognize that guy over there? 

                                 CLARENCE
                        Never seen him before.   

                                 BOOMER
                        That’s Danny Edwards.  

                                 CLARENCE
                        Who the hell is Danny Edwards? 

                                 BOOMER
                        He’s a mover in Cleveland. Big 
                        mover.  

                                 GARY
                        So what the fuck’s he doing here? 

                                 BOOMER
                        He’s with Nancy. 

           They watch the bar. Nancy’s laughing, hands all over Danny. 

                                 GARY
                        Gotta have something pretty major 
                        going for him if that fuckin’ tease 
                        is letting him sniff her ass. 

           Off Boomer, thinking about his business.
           AT THE BAR 

           Nancy’s giggling and watching Boomer’s booth. Boomer stands, 
           WAVES her over. Nancy smiles privately, grabs her purse and 
           pulls Danny by the hand — 

                                 NANCY
                        Remember what I said? 

                                 DANNY
                        Wait. Are these the guys? Now!? 

                                 NANCY
                        Yes, these are the guys. Yes, now. 

                                 DANNY
                        Oh. Well now I’m nervous. Nancy? 
                        Nancy, my hands are sweating —  

                                 NANCY
                        Just remember what we talked about. 
                        Always answer a question with a 
                        question and never look at anyone.

           He’s nodding, addled. They arrive at Boomer’s booth. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Hi guys! I want you to meet Danny. 

           Hand shakes and hellos all around. 

                                 BOOMER 
                        Siddown, siddown. 

           Nancy and Danny slide into the booth. 

                                 NANCY
                        We can’t really stay... Coupl’a 
                        Danny’s friends are having a party. 

                                 BOOMER
                        Nancy tells me you just moved into 
                        town, Danny.  

                                 DANNY
                          (re: Nancy)
                        Can you blame me? 

           Danny’s staring at the wall, nervously TAPPING his thigh. She 
           hugs his arm affectionately, squeezes it so he’ll stop.  

                                 CLARENCE
                        What kinda work’d you do over in 
                        Cleveland, bigfella? 

                                 DANNY
                        Did a lotta work in Cleveland. What 
                        about it? 

                                 GARY
                        You looking to do a lotta that same 
                        work here? 

                                 DANNY
                        Gotta do something, don’t I? 
           Boomer, Clarence and Gary exchange looks. Finally — 

                                 BOOMER
                        Why don’t you uh, come by the house 
                        tomorrow, Danny.

                                 DANNY
                          (to Nancy)
                        Are we around tomorrow? 

           Nancy FLICKS a zippo and brings the flame to her cigarette.  

                                 NANCY
                        What time tomorrow? 

           INT. BOOMER’S ESTATE HOME — THE NEXT NIGHT 

           BOOMER, NANCY and DANNY walk across the foyer —  

                                 BOOMER 
                        — How much product were you moving 
                        back in Cleveland, Danny? 

                                 DANNY
                        You’re really gonna ask me that? 

                                 BOOMER
                        Right. Gotcha.

           — into the hallway now. Boomer opens THE OFFICE door and they 
           walk inside. Around a table, CLARENCE and GARY cut and weigh 
           coke. Clarence nods a ‘hey’; Gary chooses to ignore them.   

           Boomer sits behind a large mahogany desk, Nancy and Danny 
           take chairs across from him. From inside his jacket, Boomer 
           produces an eighth and taps some out onto a mirror. 

                                 BOOMER (CONT’D)
                        Private stock... 
                          (as he razorblades lines)
                        We’ve been moving a kilo every two 
                        weeks. Anything more and you’re 
                        putting it on the radar. You’re 
                        gonna wanna steer clear of the 
                        Northside, too. Get in with those 
                        monkeys and everything starts to 
                        smell like shit and chicken grease.

           Boomer snorts a line. It’s good. Really good. 

                                 BOOMER (CONT’D)
                        Fuck me...

           He passes the straw to Danny. WHOOSH! It makes his nose itch 
           and he looks agitated, like he might sneeze. 

                                 DANNY
                        It’s nice, real...yunno... You 
                        selling this in the clubs? 

                                 BOOMER
                        This?

           Then, as if he failed to realize Danny’s quick wit — 
                                 BOOMER (CONT’D)
                          (laughs)
                        ... yeah, right. We keep things 
                        simple. Probably not what you’re 
                        used to, but it’s how we like it. 
                        The cops are cool until you give 
                        ‘em a reason not to be. 

                                 DANNY
                        A reason not to be?  

                                 CLARENCE 
                        Waving your money around. You wunna 
                        spend big, spend it someplace else. 

                                 GARY
                        Like Cleveland. 

                                 DANNY
                          (innocently)
                        Oh yeah? 

           A tense beat. Gary glowers at Danny. 

                                 BOOMER
                        Be cool, Gar, Danny knows. We’ll 
                        get you set-up with the clubbable 
                        stuff. C and G cut it to where 
                        everyone’s happy and our man’s got 
                        the club scene down. 

                                 DANNY
                        Our man? Who’s our man? 

                                 BOOMER
                        Cecil. He’s cool.  

           Clarence approaches and hands Danny a HALF-KILO OF COKE. 
           Danny sits very still, then looks at Nancy. She smiles.     

           EXT./INT. ‘THE BLUE ROOM’ NIGHTCLUB – NIGHT

           Nancy and Danny wait in a very long line. Suddenly, they’re 
           waved ahead by THE BOUNCER and they step to the front. Just 
           inside is a black man, 30s, stylishly dressed in jeans and a 
           sports coat. This is CECIL.

                                 CECIL
                        Cleveland Danny? 

                                 DANNY
                        Who are you? 

                                 CECIL
                        Cecil man! He’s cool, Sam! 

           Bouncer lets Nancy and Danny into the club. As they walk — 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        Heard a lot about you, Danny. I got 
                        you a nice hip hot spot by the bar. 
                        Go and get yourself set-up. 
           Cecil signals two stools at the corner of the bar he’s 
           claimed with his jacket, then wanders back into the crowd. 

           Upon taking the stools, Nancy lights a cigarette while Danny 
           reviews his look and bobs his head to the music, feeling 
           good. Off Nancy’s glare, he stops. 

           Cecil returns, drops off a mustached guy in AVIATOR GLASSES. 

                                 AVIATOR GLASSES
                          (coolly to Danny)
                        ... eightball

           Danny thinks to himself. That doesn’t work. His eyes shift to 
           Nancy who, with her cigarette hand, nonchalantly raises three 
           fingers. Reaching inside his jacket, Danny produces three 
           bindles and meets Aviator’s hand under the bartop. When Danny 
           opens his palm there’s $250 cash in it and Aviator’s gone.

           He slides the cash in a ZIPPER BAG. Cecil returns, leaves a 
           PREP for Danny who hands him $80 under the bar. And waits. 

           Eyes shift back to Nancy. She raises one finger. Danny palms 
           one bindle to the Prep who casually pockets it and leaves.  

           Before Danny can put the cash in the zipper bag, Cecil 
           returns with TWO FUN-LOVING BLONDES. He looks at Nancy and — 

           A SERIES OF TIME CUTS 

           Danny stands beside an ECLECTIC MIX OF CLUBGOERS, watching 
           Nancy for signals. She touches her earrings. Scratches her 
           chin. Rubs her nose. Holds up fingers; one, two, three, four. 
           She coughs. Finally — 

           Danny smiles and shuts his eyes, indicating he’s got it all 
           covered. PUSH IN ON NANCY as she watches Danny and WE’RE — 

           INSIDE THE RISH HOME, FAMILY ROOM 

           Nancy settles into the couch. On the coffee table: a stack of 
           MEN’S STYLE MAGAZINES. She starts from the top, flips through 
           an ‘Esquire,’ stops on a photo of Patrick Swayze and — 

           DANNY’S IN A SALON CHAIR 

           as Nancy hands STYLIST a tear-out of PATRICK SWAYZE and —   

           DANNY’S THE VERY PICTURE OF PATRICK SWAYZE      

           as a BOUNCER opens the velvet rope for him and Nancy. They 
           walk into a NIGHTCLUB where Cecil’s waiting. He puts his arm 
           around Danny and points out two stools by the bar and — 

           WE’RE ON A NIGHTCLUB DANCE FLOOR WITH NANCY AND DANNY 

           She’s taking him for a ride. Pressing up against him, then 
           retreating. 
           Circling, teasing, tempting: on the whole giving him the 
           biggest hard-on of his life as he watches her miniskirt inch 
           further and further up her tanned, glistening legs and — 

           WE’RE IN BOOMER’S BASEMENT 

           Boomer bangs away on a game of Asteroids. Turns to find Danny 
           walking down the stairwell — 

                                 BOOMER
                        Back already?  

           QUICK DETAIL SHOTS OF THE DEALING PROCESS — 

           CLARENCE AND GARY cut PRODUCT with INOSITOL in a metal bowl – 

           FUNNEL IT into LARGE ZIPLOC FREEZER BAGS, seal them —   

           NANCY POURS IT onto WAX PAPER atop Danny’s kitchen table and— 

           DANNY measures PRODUCT on an electronic scale and –  

           WE’RE UNDER THE BARTOP, ON THE DANCE FLOOR, BEHIND A BANQUET, 
           as BINDLES IN FAST CUTS are dealt by Danny. His technique 
           improving with each exchange.

           NANCY WRAPS A RUBBER-BAND AROUND A STACK OF CASH

           places it into a shoebox and slides it under her bed. 

           MARRIOTT HOTEL, DANNY AND CECIL IN AN ELEVATOR 

           DING! the doors open and they walk down a hallway — 

                                 CECIL 
                        — I been telling Boomer for years. 
                        Go to the Northside. Check out the 
                        Northside. Lotta opportunities on 
                        the Northside. He don’t listen. 

                                 DANNY
                          (like he’s lived here his 
                           whole life)
                        Yeah, but you go to the Northside 
                        and everything starts to smell like 
                        monkey shit.    

                                 CECIL
                        Monkey shit? 

           They KNOCK on a door. FRAT BOY answers, a WILD INITIATION 
           PARTY roars behind him. Danny flashes two eight-balls. 

           NANCY’S FLIPPING THROUGH A ‘GENTLEMAN’S QUARTERLY’  

           a Kevin Costner feature. Bull Durham: slicked-back hair, five 
           o’clock shadow, leather jacket, white button-down and — 
           THE NEW, FIVE O’CLOCK SHADOW ‘KEVIN COSTNER’ DANNY 

           arrives in front of a nightclub on a new HARLEY LOW RIDER. He 
           and Nancy climb off and are escorted inside by SECURITY. 

           PAN TO — NICK, waiting in the back of the line to be let in. 
           His face wrinkles: Is that Danny? No, no it couldn’t be... 

           INSIDE BOOMER’S OFFICE 

           as Boomer opens the door revealing Danny. Back for more. 

                                 BOOMER
                        Fuck, Edwards! You are working it! 

           NANCY FILLS ANOTHER SHOEBOX WITH CASH AND SLIDES IT

           under her bed where DOZENS are stacked like firewood. 

           NANCY’S ON THE DANCE FLOOR OF A NIGHTCLUB 

           watching Danny work a booth. Girls hang on him. Guys want his 
           attention. Cecil escorts groups of people to and fro. It’s a 
           revolving door of business.  

           She smiles at her creation, DANCES MORE FURIOUSLY THAN EVER.

           NANCY CLOSES A ‘SPORTS FITNESS’ MAGAZINE    

           it’s the last in her stack. Looking to her right, a new stack 
           of magazines. Luxury and Style. A smile curls and SHE — 

           GLIDES INTO A LORD & TAYLOR STORE 

           armed with a color-tabbed Lord & Taylor catalog under her 
           arm. Up ahead, TWO SALES ASSOCIATES chat — 

                                 NANCY 
                        You two. Follow me. 

           LATER — Sales Associate rings up a pile of designer items. 
           The total flashes on the register: $5,595. Blasé, Nancy opens 
           an envelope of cash and begins handing over $100’s and — 

           CLOSE ON A REAL ESTATE CONTRACT   

           as Danny signs his name on the bottom line. Behind Danny, 
           Nancy’s been staring at a COLOSSAL ESTATE HOME. She turns to 
           THE AGENT now as though awakening from a dream. 

           NANCY AND DANNY EMERGE FROM HER BEDROOM 

           arms brimming with garments. They’re moving her out. Connie 
           follows. She’s upset.   
                                 NANCY 
                        — I’m five miles up the road, Mom. 

                                 DANNY
                        You can stay with us, Connie. 

                                 NANCY
                        Shutup, Danny. 

                                 CONNIE
                        But I hate the quiet, Nancy. 

                                 NANCY
                        Buy a bird. 

           A bird?! Connie starts to SOB. 

                                 CONNIE
                        I don’t want a bird! I want Nancy! 

           CLOSE ON A CORKBOARD - NANCY’S OFFICE (ESTATE HOME) 

           and Nancy pins on images torn from DESIGN MAGAZINES. Specific 
           details circled in RED MARKER notated with Nancy’s 
           handwriting repeating a single refrain: Copy this! 

           HOUSEWARMING PARTY INSIDE NANCY & DANNY’S ESTATE HOME 

           Nancy’s giving Kit the grand tour of the now-furnished home, 
           dragging her through the crowd like a puppy. Each room is an 
           exact replica of one we saw on the corkboard. 

           Kit strokes a set of balloon curtains. 

                                 NANCY
                        Those are imported. From Asia. 

                                 KIT
                        Wowwww. Does Danny have a brother? 

           MOVING WITH BOOMER, CLARENCE, GARY & THEIR ENTOURAGE      

           as they walk up NANCY & DANNY’S DRIVEWAY. Eyes registering a 
           HARLEY, GO-KART, and HIS N’ HER JET SKIS – a blatant and 
           stupid display of sudden wealth parked in front of the house. 

           Opening the gate, they enter the BACK PATIO. Beautiful pool, 
           lavish landscaping, lots of folks partying, doing coke.

           Boomer watches Danny work the grill in a big chef’s hat. 
           Clarence angrily whispers to Boomer, whose eyes never leave 
           Danny. As a herd they head deeper into the party and we’re –

           OUTSIDE A NIGHTCLUB

           As Nancy and Danny leave for the night and approach Danny’s 
           Harley. His hand snatches a piece of paper stuck to the seat 
           of the bike. It reads: Get rid of this bike idiot and slow 
             the fuck down! He looks nervous and hands it to Nancy who 
           crumbles the paper and drops it to the ground.
           DANNY SITS ON THE EDGE OF A BED 

           Wearing only his boxer shorts. He’s looking himself over in 
           the mirror across the room. He straightens his shoulders. 
           Fixes his hair. Smells his armpits. He feels good. Ready. 

           NANCY APPLIES AN AGE-DEFYING LOTION 

           before the BATHROOM mirror. Shuts off the light, walks into 
           THE ENORMOUS MASTER BEDROOM. But...Danny’s not in bed. She 
           puts on her sleeping mask and slips under a satin duvet.   

           HALLWAY 

           Danny exits his room and MOVES to the master bedroom. He 
           takes a moment to steel his nerve, then KNOCKS on the door.

                                 DANNY
                        Hey, Nanc. Mind if I uh, come in?   

                                 NANCY (O.C.)
                        What for? 

                                 DANNY
                        Just to, yunno, say g’night and —  

           The door opens. Nancy leans out and kisses his cheek. 

                                 NANCY
                        G’night. 

           That quickly she’s gone. CLICK. Door locked again. Danny 
           stands there a moment, deflating. Finally:  

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah. You, too.   

           He starts back to his bedroom. 

           NANCY AND DANNY TOUR A MARINA WITH A BOAT DEALER AND WE’RE –

           ON A JET BOAT 

           as it CRUISES ACROSS THE KANKAKEE RIVER. NANCY SUNBATHES on 
           the bow. Danny’s at the helm. It’s now their boat and for a 
           moment, Nancy almost seems content.

           Then — a SPEED BOAT cruises past. SMALL’S AT THE WHEEL, a HOT 
           YOUNG STUD at his side. Nancy’s contentment fades as quickly 
           as it bloomed. She watches Small’s speedboat vanish...  

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. NANCY’S OFFICE, ESTATE HOME — ON A GLOSSY INVITATION  

           with a professional photo of Nancy in a one-shoulder ruffle 
           dress posing against a MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE. 
           It reads: Help Us Celebrate Nancy’s 27th Birthday at The Four Seasons Hotel. 
           Hosted by: Danny Edwards. An envelope nearby is addressed to Jimmy 
           Keene.  

           Nancy holds a felt tip pen in hand, contemplating a personal 
           message. Finally, she writes: Drop by if you’re around. She slides 
           the invite into the envelope, seals it carefully.

           EXT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL — CHICAGO — NIGHT 

           Luxury cars arrive out front. Valets scurry. 

           A GROUP OF VOICES SING ‘Happy Birthday To You’ — 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT — PRIVATE ROOM — CONNIE CARRIES

           A BIRTHDAY CAKE topped with 27 candles out to Nancy as the 
           table SINGS. Danny sits beside her. The singing ends. 

                                 CONNIE 
                        Okay, make a wish, Nanc. 

           Nancy looks around at her guests. CECIL, KIT and OTHERS. No 
           Jimmy. She takes in a deep breath and blows out the candles. 

           INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL — LOBBY — LATER 

           Nancy, Danny, Connie and Cecil exit the restaurant. Danny’s 
           bombed and Cecil has to help him walk.

                                 DANNY
                        That was a great friggin’ party! 
                        Woo-hoo!   

                                 NANCY
                        Sshh! Be quiet, Danny. 

                                 DANNY
                        Sorry, Nanc. 

                                 CONNIE
                        It was though, sweetie. Everything 
                        was just absolutely beautiful.  

           Nancy smiles, but feels like something was missing. They 
           arrive at the elevator bank. Connie and Cecil help Danny on. 
           Just as Nancy’s about to enter — 

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Ms. Rish... 

           Nancy turns to the FRONT DESK CLERK. 

                                 CLERK
                        There’s a phone call for you. 

                                 NANCY
                          (to Connie)
                        I’ll be right up. 
                                 CONNIE
                        Okay, sweetheart. 

           The elevator doors close. Nancy crosses to the front desk and  
           accepts the phone. 

                                 NANCY
                        Hello? 

                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                        Happy Birthday, Ci-Ci.

                                 NANCY 
                        Jimmy, I can’t talk right now. I 
                        have to get back to the party. 

                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                        The party’s over. Open your 
                        present. 

           Clerk hands Nancy a wrapped gift. She opens it revealing a 
           BATHING SUIT.

                                 JIMMY (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        How about a swim for old times’ 
                        sake?

           She looks around, sees JIMMY at a pay phone across the lobby. 

           INT. HOTEL INDOOR POOL — UNDERWATER — NIGHT 

           WHOOSH — NANCY STREAKS THROUGH THE WATER in her new suit. She 
           surfaces now and watches as, at the opposite end, Jimmy 
           charily walks down the pool stairs in his bathing shorts. 
           They’re the only two people in the pool. 

                                 NANCY
                        You never used to be a chicken. 

           Jimmy glares at her, then DIVES IN. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I bought a ticket once, yunno? To 
                        come see you. I got your cousin’s 
                        address from your mom and drove to 
                        the train station.  

                                 JIMMY
                        What happened?  

                                 NANCY
                        I decided I didn’t want to get in 
                        your way.

           A moment. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Why’d you come back? 

                                 JIMMY
                        Things were getting too big. 
                          (meaning her)
                        Sometimes the smart play is knowing 
                        when to cut back.  
           She smiles mischievously: fat chance.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Tell me about Danny. 

                                 NANCY
                        Oh, Jimmy. I feel like the luckiest 
                        girl in the whole world. I mean, 
                        just a few weeks ago I was begging 
                        you to take me away and now... He’s 
                        smart, handsome, ambitious. I’m as 
                        happy as I’ve ever been. Ever... 
                        What about you? Is there someone?  

                                 JIMMY
                        I was always too busy. 

                                 NANCY
                        And now? 

           He doesn’t answer. She looks at him. He at her. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                          (childishly)
                        Do you think I can make it across 
                        in a single breath? 

                                 JIMMY
                        I know better than to tell you you 
                        can’t do something. 

           She smiles, takes a deep breath and GOES UNDERWATER, swimming 
           hard for the other end. Halfway across, she gets desperate 
           for air, but refuses to stop. Finally, her fingertips graze 
           the wall and she shoots up, GULPS AIR as — 

           Jimmy presses up against her. They’re close enough to kiss. A 
           long, anxious moment. He moves in. Nancy turns away. 

                                 NANCY
                        Jimmy, I can’t. I’m with Danny now. 

           She ducks beneath his arms and walks up the pool steps. She 
           throws a towel around her shoulders, looks back at Jimmy and 
           then goes. He watches her moving away, dripping wet. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM — NIGHT 

           Nancy, unable to hide her wide smile, enters. She notices 
           Danny passed-out in the bathtub and moves that way.  

                                 NANCY
                        Come on, Danny, let’s go to bed. 

           He stirs, clambers to his feet. She helps him into bed and 
           takes his shoes off. 

                                 DANNY
                        Did you have fun tonight? 

                                 NANCY
                        ...It was perfect. 
                                 DANNY
                          (muttering drunkenly)
                        I love you, Nanc. I really... I 
                        love you... 

           She looks at him lovingly a moment, contemplates the thought, 
           then turns off the light.

           INT. CLUB EQUINOX NIGHTCLUB, KANKAKEE — LADIES ROOM — NIGHT  

           TWO TEASED-HAIR BLONDES snort coke by the sinks. 

                                 BLONDE #1
                        Oh fuck! It’s all goddamn baking 
                        soda again!

                                 BLONDE #2
                        Go see Cleveland Danny. Cuts it 
                        real fair. He’s the best around.  

           They check their look and then exit. Nancy emerges from a 
           stall. She heard their conversation and she’s thinking.

           CLUB EQUINOX — LATER 

           Nancy and Cecil speak privately in a corner. In the b.g., 
           Danny charms a crowded booth of customers. 

                                 CECIL 
                        — Well yeah. Everyone knows the way 
                        to stretch a product is to step on 
                        it. Problem is, people catch on and 
                        they don’t buy your shit no more.

                                 NANCY
                        Only if they know it’s been cut. 

                                 CECIL
                        Anyone who parties for real knows 
                        when it’s been cut... Unless you 
                        use Inositol. Inositol don’t burn. 
                        That’s what Boom uses already – but 
                        he find out you’re messin’ with his 
                        product and you in some deep shit. 

           NANCY AND DANNY’S KITCHEN 

           Danny cuts cocaine with Inositol. Cecil sits next to him, 
           keeping the math. Across the kitchen table, Nancy flips 
           through a Vanity Fair, overseeing the process.  

                                 NANCY
                        Where are we now?   

                                 CECIL 
                        We’re down to 35%. 

           LATER — Cecil SNORTS a line, smiles at Nancy — 

                                 CECIL (CONT’D)
                        It’s perfect. No burn.  
           Nancy glances down at the magazine: a PORSCHE ADVERTISEMENT 
           OF A WHITE 911 TURBO.  

           THE WHITE PORSCHE 911 TURBO, MOVING 

           Nancy positively FLIES along the river, matching the speed of 
           a JET BOAT flitting across the water and WE’RE — 

           BACK AT THE KITCHEN TABLE 

           MORE INOSITOL IN THE MIXING BOWL. Cecil scoops in some coke.  

                                 CECIL
                        That’s down to 20%. 

           Nancy watches as Danny SNORTS a bump. 

                                 NANCY
                        Well...? 

                                 DANNY
                        It’s still good. 

           NANCY SIPS A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE  

           At a roped off nightclub booth. An ANGRY MALE CUSTOMER 
           suddenly approaches and fires a gram bag of coke at Danny! 

                                 ANGRY MALE CUSTOMER 
                        T’fuck is that shit, Danny?! You 
                        cheap fucking twat!   

           Danny, stoned out of his mind, just stares back dumbly. 

                                 ANGRY MALE CUSTOMER (CONT’D)
                        I said, WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT — 

           Before he gets another word out - CECIL STANDS AND PUNCHES 
           CUSTOMER ACROSS THE FACE! A WILD FIGHT BREAKS OUT!

           Danny doesn’t move. Nancy glances across the dance floor. 
           BOOMER, CLARENCE and GARY sit in a booth, watching her. 

           BACK TO THE KITCHEN TABLE  

           MORE INOSITOL IN THE MIXING BOWL. Nancy stares across the 
           table at Cecil. Danny’s passed-out in the chair. 

                                 CECIL
                        10%.  

                                 NANCY
                        Take it lower. 

           EXT. NANCY & DANNY’S ESTATE HOME, BACKYARD — FALL MORNING 

           There’s a JET SKI in the murky, leaf-ridden pool. The jacuzzi 
           is a boiling pot of water. Danny’s arms are on the pavers. He 
           fell asleep in here. Last night. 
           Nancy approaches, kneels, shuts off the bubbles and tilts his 
           shades up. The sun frightens him like a loud noise. 

                                 NANCY
                        We’re outta milk.

           INT. GROCERY STORE, CHECK-OUT LINE — DAY 

           Danny holds milk and powdered donuts. ZZZZ. His pager glows.

           INT. PHONE BOOTH — AFTERNOON 

           Danny does a quick bump of coke, then dials a number —  

                                 DANNY
                        Hey hey, Boom-Man, it’s Cleveland 
                        D. Got your page. I’m uh, across 
                        from TGIF like you said — 

           TIRES SCREECH! Danny turns. Outside, a Mercedes pulls up 
           beside his Porsche. CLARENCE AND GARY BURST OUT! Gary takes a 
           crow bar to the Porsche windshield and — SMASH!  

           Danny ducks, tries to hold the door shut. Clarence RIPS it 
           open and PUMMELS him. Danny collapses like a fold-up chair.

           INT. BOOMER’S OFFICE — LATE AFTERNOON 

           DANNY’S FACE. Badly bruised. His right eye is black-blue, 
           swollen shut. Through his left eye he’s looking at Boomer, 
           Clarence and Gary as though peering through a dense fog.

                                 BOOMER
                        Half our clients freebase, Danny. 
                        Half. Did you really think we 
                        weren’t gonna find out? 

           Danny’s head smarts and he winces. 

                                 BOOMER (CONT’D)
                        How you were ever a name in 
                        Cleveland, I’ll never know. But me 
                        and you, Danny, we’re done. Over. 
                        Don’t even fucking think about 
                        moving product in this town again. 

           EXT. NANCY & DANNY’S ESTATE HOME, KITCHEN — NIGHT

           Danny sits in a chair at the kitchen table, head tilted back, 
           two Q-tips crammed up his nose, ice pack on his eye. 

           Nancy’s across the table in a flowing white nightgown.  

                                 NANCY
                        — he said that? Over? He used that 
                        exact word?  

                                 DANNY
                        And done. Over and done. 
           Nancy stands, paces, thinks.  

                                 NANCY
                        You know what. Fuck them. They’re 
                        scared of us, Danny. We’ve gotten 
                        bigger than them and now they wanna 
                        bully us out of town. Well we won’t 
                        go away so easily will we? 

                                 DANNY
                          (very willing to go away)
                        Uhh, yunno what, Nanc —  

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                          (on a roll)
                        We’ll cut them out. That’s what 
                        we’ll do. 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        How are we gonna do that? 

                                 NANCY
                          (stops pacing)
                        ...We’ll go right over them. 

           UNDER NANCY’S BED — A SINGLE SHOEBOX SLIDES TOWARDS US

           Nancy opens the lid and takes out the last two remaining 
           stacks of cash she hasn’t yet had time to spend.  

           INT. PORSCHE TURBO 911, MOVING — CHICAGO — DAY

           Danny drives, tilting his head to see out the cobwebbed 
           windshield. Nancy’s quiet, focused, wearing her game face. 

           INT. THE DRAKE HOTEL, ROOM 312 — AFTERNOON

           Nancy applies her make-up in front of the mirror. Her 
           cocktail dress is uncommonly understated. Danny sits on the 
           bed, shucking pistachios, watching football.  

                                 DANNY
                        Why won’t you tell me who you are 
                        meeting with? 

                                 NANCY
                        Just a friend... Order some room 
                        service if you’re hungry. 

           She grabs her purse and exits the room. 

           INT. THE DRAKE HOTEL, LOUNGE – AFTERNOON 

           Elegance personified. Nancy sits at a table for two, waiting. 
           Glancing around at the BUSINESSMEN and their DAINTY WIVES, 
           she feels like an uninvited guest, vulnerable and uneasy. 

           A shadow comes over her shoulder. JIMMY KEENE leans close to 
           her ear. Gives the place a once-over: not his style.  
                                 JIMMY
                        Let’s get outta here. 

           EXT. ASTOR STREET, CHICAGO’S GOLD COAST — AFTERNOON 

           JIMMY’S HARLEY SOFTAIL cruises down the Elm-canopied road, 
           Nancy’s arms wrapped around his waist as she watches in awe 
           of the stately residences: historic, aristocratic luxury.   

                                 NANCY
                        I want you to teach me how to ride 
                        one of these days.  

                                 JIMMY
                        You’ll have to get a jacket first. 

           She smiles, squeezes him tighter as the bike slips into the 
           alley of an ART DECO MANSION.  

           INT. JIMMY KEENE’S MANSION, BATHROOM — AFTERNOON 

           Nancy washes her hands under the British nickle faucet. She 
           lets her eyes wander across Jimmy’s meticulously laid out 
           Italian toiletries. The only anomaly in the scene a 
           supermarket container of AQUA VELVA. Nancy lifts it to her 
           nose and inhales deeply.

           INT. JIMMY KEENE’S MANSION, GREAT ROOM — SAME   

           A FIRE ROARS in the free-standing fireplace. Nancy appraises 
           every appointment, runs a finger along each curve. 

           Unbeknownst to Nancy, Jimmy enters from the back of the room 
           and stops to observe her ”shop.” She mischievously tilts the 
           mantel mirror askew. He smiles. 

                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                        How much, Nancy?  

           But she’s still perusing the room casually, as if Jimmy’s 
           come to her for a favor and not vice versa.

                                 NANCY
                        Just enough to get us started 
                        again... Danny made the mistake of 
                        getting too big. But I guess you 
                        already know that. 

                                 JIMMY
                        A version of it.  

                                 NANCY
                        He’s bringing in some friends from 
                        Cleveland to help him run things. 
                        That’s where he made his name. 

                                 JIMMY
                        Don’t bullshit me, Nancy. I know 
                        Cleveland. Its names. And I’ve 
                        never heard of any Danny Edwards. 

           If she’s caught she doesn’t let on. 
                                 NANCY
                        It’s a one-time thing, Jimmy. If 
                        you don’t want to be a part of it 
                        I’ll find someone else.   

                                 JIMMY
                        I don’t want any part of it. 

           But as Jimmy expected, Nancy doesn’t leave. She looks at him 
           as if to say: are you really going to make me beg?  

           A study door opens. A BUSINESS ASSOCIATE peers out. 

                                 BUSINESS ASSOCIATE 
                        Jimmy, it’s California. You want 
                        them to call back? 

           Jimmy shakes his head ‘no’. 

                                 JIMMY
                        It was good to see you, Nanc. 
                        There’s a cab waiting for you 
                        outside. 

           He starts toward the study — 

                                 NANCY
                        Jimmy...  
                          (he stops, turns back, a 
                           long beat)
                        Please...? 

           Jimmy almost smiles. He moves to a desk, writes a phone 
           number on a piece of paper and offers it to Nancy. 

                                 JIMMY
                        If shit goes South with your 
                        boyfriend — 

                                 NANCY
                        That won’t happen — 

                                 JIMMY
                        But if it does... and they offer 
                        him a deal for this guy... You tell 
                        him to take it.

           She tucks the paper away in her clutch. 

                                 NANCY
                        One of these days, I’m gonna have a 
                        score even you can’t pass up. 

           He steps close to her...  

                                 JIMMY
                        Do me a favor: don’t tell me about 
                        it. Just call me when it’s all 
                        over. I’ll buy you a drink.   

           Jimmy goes, disappears inside the study. 
           INT. TAXI, MOVING — LATE AFTERNOON 

           Nancy lights a cigarette, lowers the window. It was harder 
           than she thought, seeing him like that. Much harder. 

           INT. THE DRAKE HOTEL, ROOM 312 — TIGHT ON THE PIECE OF PAPER  

           JIMMY HANDED NANCY. GERRY TIFFANY #312-215-7789. Nancy dials 
           the number, hands the phone to Danny.  

                                 DANNY
                        Hi there, is this Gerry? 

           INT. GERRY TIFFANY’S HOUSE, CHICAGO, BACK PATIO — DAY 

           An ASIAN MAIL-ORDER BRIDE cleans the pool with a skimmer. 

           GERRY TIFFANY, 50, sits in a patio chair across from Nancy 
           and Danny. He looks like the manager of a discount 
           electronics store. He’s staring at Nancy’s crossed legs. 
           She’s allowing it, but clearly getting bored of the dolt. 

                                 GERRY TIFFANY
                          (hasn’t looked at Danny)
                        I like you, Danny. 

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah, Mr. Tiffany?  

                                 GERRY TIFFANY
                        Mmm hmm. I like you a lot. 

           INT. GERRY TIFFANY’S OFFICE — QUICK DETAIL SHOTS   

           DANNY HANDS GERRY an envelope of cash and — 

           CLOSE ON A SAFE as Gerry spins the dial, turns the handle, 
           removes a KILO OF COCAINE and — 

           DANNY TUCKS THE KILO OF COKE into a duffle bag and WE’RE — 

           IN GERRY TIFFANY’S DRIVEWAY as THE PORSCHE reverses out of 
           Gerry’s drive and FLIES down the road. 

           INT. PORSCHE 911 TURBO, MOVING — A FEW NIGHTS LATER 

           Danny drives. Sitting beside him, Cecil’s excited — 

                                 CECIL
                        Boomer gon’ be sorry he never 
                        listened to me! Northside gon’ make 
                        us rich, Danny! I can feel it, boy!  

           Danny watches the passing ghetto: dilapidated homes, thugs on 
           stoops looking for trouble. Welcome to the Northside.

           KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK — 
           INT. GHETTO HOUSE, NORTHSIDE — NIGHT 

           Cecil pushes the iron door open slowly, looks around. 

           TWO YOUNG BLACK CHILDREN sit on the couch passing a 2-Liter 
           bottle of Mountain Dew between them. In the Lazy-Boy is an 
           ENORMOUS WHITE WOMAN in an oversized t-shirt of a sinuous 
           rollercoaster. The TV plays an episode of Crazy Cop Chases.  

                                 CECIL 
                        Hi there. Alonso in? 

           Blank stares. Finally, the Enormous Woman BANGS on the wall 
           behind her. Moments later, a tall, broad-shouldered black 
           man, ALONSO, 40, opens a bedroom door. 

                                 ALONSO 
                        Come on back. 

           INT. BEDROOM — MOMENTS LATER 

           Danny and Cecil sit on a ratty sofa. Cecil small-talks Alonso 
           while Danny’s looks around. Bed sheets cover the windows. 
           Drug paraphernalia on the night stand. A STRUNG-OUT JUNKIE on 
           the bed smokes a crack pipe, his eyes in some other orbit.

                                 CECIL
                        — Danny. Danny. Danny-man! 

                                 DANNY
                          (snaps out of his gaze)
                        Uh? What? What’s that?  

                                 CECIL
                        The shit, man! The shit.  

           Danny reaches into his jacket, hands Cecil an eight-ball. The 
           Junkie stares at him with those big stoned eyes. Off Danny, 
           sweating, uneasy, struggling to focus —  

           INT. NANCY & DANNY’S ESTATE HOME, FOYER — NIGHT 

           Danny enters, visibly shaken by his visit to the Northside. 
           He hangs his coat on the rack and calls upstairs. 

                                 DANNY
                        Nancy? Nancy, we need to talk. 

                                 NANCY (O.C.)
                        Can it wait til the morning? 

                                 DANNY
                        No it cannot wait til the goddamn 
                        morning! Jesus Christ! 

           He MARCHES UP THE STAIRS, tries Nancy’s bedroom door. Locked. 
           He BANGS on it. HARD! Still nothing. Growing frustrated — 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Nancy, open this door! Nancy!   

           He SHAKES the knob. Finally, an annoyed Nancy opens the door 
           wearing a silk chemise. 
                                 NANCY
                        What’s the matter?

           Danny brushes past her into — 

           THE MASTER BEDROOM 

           and sits on the bed. 

                                 DANNY
                        I’m never going back there — this 
                        freakin’ guy — his freakin’ eyes 
                        were all buggin’ out at me and...

           He catches his breath, runs a hand through his hair. 

                                 NANCY
                        You’re just tired, that’s all.

                                 DANNY
                        No, Nancy, that’s not all! 
                          (beat, this is hard)
                        I... I lied to you before... about 
                        everything... 

                                 NANCY
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 DANNY
                        I didn’t come to Kankakee to expand 
                        Odds And Ends. I came here because 
                        I didn’t have anywhere else to go. 
                        Remember when I told you I wanted 
                        to run my own hardware store? 
                          (she nods)
                        Well I did. Back in Bedford. My 
                        parents owned a shop there. They 
                        retired last year so I could manage 
                        the place. Business was good for a 
                        while, but... I started loaning out 
                        equipment. To friends. People in 
                        the community I trusted. I told ‘em 
                        they could pay me back when they 
                        got on their feet, yunno? Well they 
                        never did and I never did. Pretty 
                        soon I couldn’t pay the bank loan. 
                        The store closed six months ago. My 
                        parents lost everything. Thirty 
                        years of work just... gone... 

           She sits down beside him. Not sure what to do right away. 
           Sympathy’s not her forte. Finally, she rubs his back.  

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t been able to look my 
                        family in the eye since. Heck, I’ve 
                        barely been able to look myself in 
                        the eye. And my dad, he won’t even 
                        talk to me anymore... So when you 
                        said you would help me, I thought 
                        maybe, I don’t know, I could 
                        somehow...get it all back. It was 
                        stupid... the whole thing... I love 
                        you, Nanc, but I don’t think I can 
                        do this anymore. 
           Nancy evaluates him silently. The game has suddenly changed 
           and requires a new strategy.  

                                 NANCY
                        I’ll be right back. 

           Nancy goes. 

           INT. BATHROOM — CONTINUOUS  

           Nancy opens the medicine cabinet and takes down the AQUA 
           VELVA BOTTLE we saw inside Jimmy’s bathroom. She pours some 
           into her hands, then opens the door. 

                                 NANCY
                        Danny... 

           Danny looks up. Nancy seductively peels off the straps of her 
           chemise. It drops to the floor. She stands naked before him. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        What’re you waiting for? 

           Bowled over by everything, Danny ravishes her. Nancy rubs her 
           hands all over him and breathes in the scent as Danny lifts 
           her onto the sink and pushes himself between her legs... 

           INT. ANOTHER GHETTO HOUSE, KITCHEN, NORTHSIDE — NIGHT

           CLOSE ON DANNY. Tired, stoned, sweating, but back at it. He 
           and Cecil watch as TWO BLACK MEN, 30s, sample some coke. 
           Fidgety, Danny stands abruptly. 

                                 FIRST BLACK MAN
                        The fuck are you goin’? 

                                 DANNY
                        I gotta piss. 

           INT. BATHROOM — MOMENTS LATER 

           Danny’s pissing when a COMMOTION SWELLS OUTSIDE —  

                                 MEN’S VOICES (O.C.)
                        POLICE! GET YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!

           Danny STARTLES, quickly buttons his pants. Some piss stains 
           through. He moves to the door, opens it. CECIL’S in the 
           hallway, face down, PLAINCLOTHES NARCOTICS SQUAD MEMBERS (led 
           by the Two Black Men sampling the coke) handcuff him. 

           THE COPS SEE DANNY! He RACES to the window, tries to WIGGLE 
           OUT. His pants slide down his ass. THE NARCs rush in and 
           WRESTLE HIM DOWN. Off his face pressed against the floor.

           INT. NANCY & DANNY’S ESTATE HOME, MASTER BEDROOM — NIGHT 

           THE PHONE RINGS. Nancy, asleep, tries to ignore it and 
           finally can’t. She reaches over and lifts the phone —  
                                 NANCY
                        Hello?...Who is this?...Who?...Oh. 
                        What do you want, Danny? 
                          (long beat)
                        You got what? 

           INT. FIRST TRUST BANK — THE NEXT MORNING 

           Nancy waits as a TELLER pecks away at her computer. 

                                 TELLER
                        I’m sorry, miss. It seems a freeze 
                        has been placed on that account. 

                                 NANCY
                        Well un-freeze it. 

           Teller laughs. Nancy’s not amused.  

           EXT. NANCY & DANNY’S ESTATE HOME, MASTER BEDROOM — AFTERNOON 

           Nancy takes the shoeboxes out from under her bed. One-after-
           another. All empty. She’s getting angry. 

           LATER  

           Nancy looks down at her ADDRESS BOOK. It’s opened to JIMMY 
           KEENE. His phone numbers and addresses over the years have 
           been precisely maintained. She takes a moment to steel 
           herself, then dials his number. It RINGS and then — 

                                 YOUNG WOMAN’S VOICE (O.C.)
                        Hello? 
                          (Nancy FREEZES)
                        Hello? 

                                 JIMMY (O.C.)
                          (in the background)
                        Who is it, babe? 

           Nancy hangs up the phone... 

           INT. MALL FOOD COURT — AFTERNOON 

           Nancy wears a scowl as she sits across from Kit who is deeply 
           intimidated by Nancy’s dark mood.

                                 KIT
                        — I’m sorry, Nanc. I heard about 
                        Danny, but I didn’t realize all 
                        that money was, yunno...gone.

           Nancy whirls her finger: get on with it, Kit. Kit slips out a 
           KANKAKEE C.C. NEWSLETTER and points to a photo of a FAT, UGLY 
           BALD MAN she’s labeled: Nancy! Nancy!  

                                 KIT (CONT’D)
                        Left his third wife last week. 

           Nancy glowers at Kit: are you fucking serious? 
                                 KIT (CONT’D)
                        Right. Not your type... You mind if 
                        I give him a shot then?  

                                 NANCY
                        Fire away. 

           Glancing across the concourse, Nancy sees SMALL and a MALE 
           COMPANION, 30s, talking, laughing, flirting, designer 
           shopping bags hang from Companion’s arm. 

           INT. ESTATE HOME, MASTER BEDROOM — NIGHT 

           Nancy sits on the vanity bench applying make-up. The PHONE 
           RINGS in the background. The ANSWERING MACHINE picks up — 

                                 NANCY’S VOICE 
                        You’ve reached Nancy and Danny. 
                        Leave a message after the beep.

                                 DANNY (O.C.)
                        Hi, Nancy. It’s me again. Danny. 
                        Look, I know you’re mad at me, but 
                        I just, uh, well I want you to know 
                        that I’ll do anything, anything, to 
                        make things right between us...

           It’s as if Nancy doesn’t even hear him. 

           INT. ‘THE BLUE ROOM’ NIGHTCLUB – NIGHT

           ON NANCY DANCING TO THE MUSIC as she scopes BOOMER, CLARENCE 
           and GARY nearby, hanging with a PACK OF HOT YOUNG GIRLS who 
           eye her suspiciously. A 21 YEAR OLD BLONDE approaches. 

                                 21 YEAR OLD 
                        I thought all the washed-up bitches 
                        went to Lola’s.  

           21 Year Old goes. Off Nancy, alone, watching the girls point 
           and laugh at her.

           INT. CIRCLE K, MAGAZINE SECTION — MORNING  

           Nancy frantically grabs fashion magazine after magazine from 
           the rack. Headlines include: Bring Out the Girl In You. How 
           to Feel Ten Years Younger. The New Fountain of Youth. 

           INT. MALIBU SUN SALON, WAITING AREA — AFTERNOON  

           Nancy’s TAPPING her nails anxiously. Tear-out portraits of 
           ‘youthful women’ fanned out on the table before her. 

                                 STYLIST
                        Nancy, honey, be patient. 

           Nancy SIGHS, flips through one her glamour magazines 
           aimlessly, until...an article captures her interest. She 
           leans forward... 
           CLOSE ON THE ARTICLE. PHRASES STAND OUT: $1 million Ransom 
           Paid. Young Socialite Buried, Kept Alive for 80 Hours. Family 
           Paid Kidnappers. AND PICTURES: High Society. A plywood box. A 
           traumatized Young Girl returned to her Parents.   

           Nancy unwinding all of it. Her brain in overdrive. She looks 
           around, then quietly TEARS the pages out of the magazine...

           INT. ESTATE HOME, MASTER BEDROOM — NIGHT  

           A FINGER presses the blinking ANSWERING MACHINE button. Nancy 
           sits on the bed, listening.  

                                 ANSWERING MACHINE  
                        You have 78 New Messages.

                        Nancy, it’s Danny — 
                          (she PRESSES delete)
                        Hey there Nanc uh, it’s Danny — 
                          (delete again)
                        It’s me. Just uh, in jail here — 
                          (delete again)
                        Hi, Nancy. It’s me again. Danny...

           This is the one. She let’s it play. 

                                 DANNY’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Look, I know you’re mad at me, but 
                        I just, uh, well I want you to know 
                        that I’ll do anything, anything, to 
                        make things right between us. 

           PUSH IN ON NANCY... wheels turning...

                                 DANNY’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        I got to talking with the State’s 
                        Attorney about my situation. He 
                        offered to help me if I gave him 
                        some information about Mr. Tiffany. 
                        And uh, well I guess it was helpful 
                        cause they reduced my charge. Three 
                        more weeks and I’m a free bird. 
                        It’d be real good to see if you’re 
                        around and...wanna, yunno, get back 
                        together again... 

           VERY CLOSE ON NANCY, a smile forming...

           EXT. NANCY & DANNY’S ESTATE HOME — MORNING – 3 WEEKS LATER

           A TATTERED FORECLOSURE NOTICE quivers in the bushes. 

           Nancy exits the home just in time to watch her Porsche being 
           towed away by a REPO MAN. She looks in the driveway. All that 
           remains are the Harley and Danny’s old pick-up truck. 

           EXT. ILLINOIS STATE PRISON — AFTERNOON  

           Nancy sits on the open tailgate of the truck. The prison 
           gates open and Danny steps out. 
           For a moment, the sun too bright, he doesn’t notice Nancy. He 
           looks around dumbly, like walking back in might be his best 
           option.  

                                 NANCY
                        Yoo hoo! 

                                 DANNY
                          (squints to see her)
                        Nancy? Is that you!? 

                                 NANCY
                        Hurry up! 

           INT. NANCY & DANNY’S ESTATE HOME — ON DANNY MOVING  

           from empty room to empty room. All the furniture is gone. 

                                 DANNY
                        — They took it all?  

                                 NANCY (O.C.)
                        Everything. You didn’t think things 
                        would just go back to the way they 
                        were, didja? 

                                 DANNY
                          (yes)
                        I guess not... 

           He joins Nancy in the KITCHEN now. Devoid of chairs, he sits 
           on the island.

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Where’re we gonna live? 

                                 NANCY
                        My mom said we could move-in with 
                        her until we get on our feet.  

           She offers him the ‘Jobs’ section of the local newspaper and 
           points to an ad she’s circled. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        They’re looking for a Sales Clerk 
                        at Schuler’s Hardware in town.  

           Danny looks at the ad, his depressing reality sinking in. 

           INT. RISH HOME, FRONT DOOR — AFTERNOON 

           Connie’s bursting with excitement as she holds the door open 
           for Nancy and Danny carrying their belongings in. 

                                 CONNIE
                        — Oh I’m so happy, Nancy! Hi, 
                        Danny! So handsome! 
           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM – NIGHT 

           Nancy sits up in bed wearing revealing negligee and reading a 
           Cosmo. Danny enters and is about to climb in beside her when 
           Nancy holds him off. 

                                 NANCY
                        I don’t think I’m ready to go back 
                        to all that yet.   

                                 DANNY
                        Oh... sure...

           She indicates an inflatable mattress box in the corner. 

           INT. SCHULER’S HARDWARE STORE - NIGHT 

           Danny, clad in a red Schuler’s vest and nametag, stands on a 
           step-ladder, just about finished building a five-foot ‘Sale’ 
           pyramid of light bulbs. A MANAGER approaches.    

                                 MANAGER
                        The heck’re you doing there, Danny? 
                        Bulb’s are over in Aisle 7, not 8. 

           Dog-tired, Danny begins taking the bulbs down one-by-one.  

           INT. RISH HOME, FAMILY ROOM — NIGHT 

           Danny slumps on the couch while Connie ‘scrapbooks’ photos 
           from her salad days of modeling.  

                                 CONNIE
                        This was my ‘62 spread in Eaton’s.
                        The year of the sweater dress. 

           IN THE KITCHEN, Nancy files her nails, keeping close watch on 
           Danny and his burgeoning ennui. 

           INT. SCHULER’S HARDWARE STORE — AFTERNOON     

           Danny affixes price labels to cans of paint.  

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.C.)
                        Cleveland Danny...? 

           Danny turns. We recognize the TWO TEASED-HAIR BLONDES from 
           when Nancy overheard them chatting in the club bathroom. 
           They’re dressed for a hot night out, keg bucket in hand. 

                                 DANNY
                        Oh hey — Kelly right? And McKenzie?  

                                 BLONDE #1 
                        Do you, like...work here...? 

                                 DANNY
                        Oh no, I mean — me? No way —  

                                 BLONDE #2
                        Tell me about the Never-Kink Hoses. 
                                 DANNY
                        The never-what who? 

           He follows their eyes to a button on his vest: Ask Me About 
           Our Never-Kink Hoses! 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        What’s that all about — 

           By the time he looks up, the girls are off. Out of the store, 
           into a CORVETTE waiting by the entrance where they promptly 
           let the SLICK MALE DRIVER in on their discovery. He lowers 
           his shades, peers inside, incredulous —   

                                 DRIVER
                          (big laugh)
                        No-Fucking-Way! Cleveland D!? 
                        That’s just sad. 

           A REV of the engine and the CORVETTE ROARS off. 

           INT. RISH HOME, KITCHEN — NIGHT 

           ON AN UNTOUCHED DINNER PLATE: meatloaf, corn, Ore-Ida fries. 
           Danny lethargically pokes at it with a fork. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Not feeling so hot, sweetie? Or 
                        just don’t like Momma’s meatloaf?  

                                 DANNY
                        I’m gonna head up for the night.  

           He discards his plate in the sink and heads upstairs. Connie 
           turns to Nancy. Nancy shakes her head sullenly. 

                                 NANCY 
                        While he was in jail, the men made 
                        him do certain...things. 

                                 CONNIE
                          (knows those things)
                        Oh dear. 

                                 NANCY
                        Mmm hmm. 

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM — LATER THAT NIGHT 

           Danny’s on the blow-up mattress, staring up at the ceiling. 

                                 DANNY
                        Nancy...? 

                                 NANCY 
                        Go to sleep.   

                                 DANNY
                        ...I keep thinking about the way 
                        things used to be. 

           A twinkle comes to Nancy’s face. Danny’s got a captive 
           audience now as she rolls over and looks down at him.  
                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know, just... walking into 
                        those clubs with you on my arm... 

           FLICK — Nancy turns on the lamp and, from a nearby stack of 
           magazines, finds the magazine she was reading in the salon 
           and opens it at the bookmark.

                                 NANCY
                        Here. I want you to look at 
                        something, Danny. It’s important. 

           She offers him the magazine. He starts to read the article. 

                                 DANNY
                          (confused)
                        What... what the heck is this...?

                                 NANCY
                        They kept her alive underground for 
                        80 hours... How big is Mr. Small? 

                                 DANNY
                        Whaddaya mean how big? 

                                 NANCY
                        His height.

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know. Medium. Why?     

           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, MOMENTS LATER  

           Danny BURSTS out of Nancy’s bedroom, turbid and shaking his 
           head. Nancy follows —  

                                 DANNY
                        — Oh no. No, no, no, no.  

                                 NANCY
                        What’re you no-ing about? 

           Connie emerges from the bathroom, hair up in curlers, an As-
           Seen-On-TV ‘Abdomenizer’ VIBRATING loudly around her waist. 

           Danny RUSHES down the stairs and out the front door.  

                                 CONNIE
                        What’s going on with Danny? 

                                 NANCY
                        Nightmares. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Of those men? 

           Nancy nods, heads downstairs. 

           EXT. RISH HOME, SIDEWALK — NIGHT 

           Danny’s WALKING in circles, rattled and trying to disabuse 
           his mind. Nancy stands with her arms firmly crossed. 
                                 DANNY
                        It’s crazy, Nancy. 

                                 NANCY
                        No it isn’t. You said you’d do 
                        anything. I saved the message. Do 
                        you want me to play it back for 
                        you, Danny?  

                                 DANNY
                        What I meant, Nancy, was I’d do 
                        anything within reason.  

                                 NANCY
                        Ohhh now you’re choosing. Is that 
                        it? You’ll do anything as long as 
                        anything is what you want... I 
                        can’t believe I threw it all away. 

                                 DANNY
                        Threw what away, Nanc? I’m still 
                        here. We’re still together — 

                                 NANCY
                        Not us! My modeling career, Danny! 
                        They were waiting for me in New 
                        York, yunno! They asked me to come 
                        back! But I stayed faithful to our 
                        love. I believed your stupid 
                        messages telling me how much you 
                        love me, how you’ll do anything for 
                        me. 

           Takes but a moment for her to produce the requisite tears.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I gave up everything to be with 
                        you.  

           She shakes her head in disgust, stalks back inside the home. 

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM – MOMENTS LATER 

           In preparation for Danny’s inevitable return, Nancy removes a 
           BORA-BORA RESORT BROCHURE from the night stand and sets it 
           open on her lap.  

           A KNOCK at the door. Danny peeks his head in coyly. 

                                 DANNY
                        Can I come back in? 

                                 NANCY
                        No.  

           He walks in anyway and takes a seat on the bed beside her. 
           Slowly his eyes follow hers down to – 

           The slick advert. It opens to the image of a glamorous young 
           couple reclining in chaises on an impossibly white beach. In 
           the woman’s hand, a SUNRISE COCKTAIL garnished with every 
           color of the rainbow. In bold across the top Nancy’s written 

           NANCY + DANNY FOREVER!!
           Without realizing it, Danny’s eyes drift over to the Esquire. 
           A slight nudge from Nancy and he picks it up. Her arms find 
           their way around his shoulders a bit, like a hangman’s noose. 
           She turns the pages and finds the article.  

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I miss it, too. Being on your arm. 
                        They all looked up to us. Everyone 
                        wanted to be like Nancy and Danny. 

                                 DANNY
                        I just don’t want to hurt anyone.  

                                 NANCY
                        Hurt? Jesus, Danny, what kind of 
                        girl do you think I am? No one gets 
                        hurt. And we get back to where we 
                        were. You can finally open your 
                        hardware store. See? 

           She shows him a newspaper cutout: A LARGE ‘FOR RENT’ SPACE in 
           a strip mall. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I could even work the register. 
                          (Danny brightens at that)
                        We could invite your family to 
                        town. Show them how we’ve turned 
                        things around together. Take them 
                        to Church, then to a fancy dinner. 
                        That’s what you want, isn’t it? 

                                 DANNY
                        But I...don’t even...know how — 

                                 NANCY
                        Ssshhh... I’ll explain it all... 

           Their eyes lock. She kisses him deeply, passionately, then 
           peels back the covers.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you sleep up here with me 
                        tonight?  

           He stands and climbs into bed beside her. She drops the 
           magazine onto the floor and embraces him.  

           INT. SCHULER’S HARDWARE, LUNCH BREAK — AFTERNOON 

           Using a photo from the magazine article as his guide, Danny 
           sketches a coffin-like box in a composition book. 

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        You’ll build the box, Handyman. 
                        Exactly like in the article.

           OUTSIDE SCHULER’S, DANNY LOADS PLYWOOD IN HIS CARGO BED 

           EXT. RISH HOME, DRIVEWAY — NIGHT 

           Danny LUGS the plywood sheets towards the garage. 
                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        I’ll make the call to Mr. Small.

           Looking up, he SEES Connie in a smock, painting a watercolor-
           by-number of a Unicorn under a waterfall. He freezes and 
           hustles the wood around the side of the home.    

           NANCY SMOKES AT ‘THE YESTERYEAR RESTAURANT’ BAR — NIGHT 

           Eyes focused on SMALL at a booth with a FEMALE COMPANION and 
           ELAINE. Clearly this is an arranged date. 

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        This is Claire from the Sheriff’s 
                        Department. There’s been a break-in 
                        at The Yesteryear Restaurant. We 
                        need to come down right away. 

           THE RISH HOME GARAGE DOOR RISES TO REVEAL NANCY — NIGHT 

           She looks around, expecting something that isn’t here.

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM — NIGHT 

           Danny sits on the air bed, hangdog. Nancy paces, seething. 

                                 NANCY
                        Why don’t I see any progress? 

                                 DANNY
                        It’s your Mom! She’s always doing 
                        her crafts in the garage!

           INT. CONNIE’S BEDROOM — LATER THAT NIGHT 

           Nancy CRIES crocodile tears. Connie’s beside her, consoling. 

                                 NANCY 
                        — it’s just that, with you always 
                        here, me and Danny don’t have any, 
                        yunno, private time. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Oh, honey. Why don’t I ask Drew if 
                        I can pick up some night shifts. 

                                 NANCY
                        And the garage, too. 

                                 CONNIE
                        But that’s my ‘craft shack’, Nanc. 
                        I host the gals on Thursdays. 

                                 NANCY
                        Then move it inside. Danny needs 
                        the space. He wants to try and  
                        bring in some extra money for us 
                        building birdhouses. 
           NANCY STROLLS THE SIDEWALK OUTSIDE SMALL’S HOUSE — AFTERNOON  

           discreetly SNAPPING photos with a POLAROID INSTANT CAMERA.  

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        When he steps into the garage, 
                        you’ll be there waiting for him.

           INT. RISH HOME, FAMILY ROOM — NIGHT (LATE)  

           Nancy watches Falcon Crest from the couch. Connie breezes 
           past on her way out to work. The instant the DOOR CLOSES, 
           Nancy reaches for a WALKIE-TALKIE. 

                                 NANCY
                        She’s gone. 

           Seconds later, DANNY BOUNDS DOWN THE STAIRS and WE’RE — 

           INSIDE THE GARAGE, A GOGGLE-CLAD DANNY  

           GUIDES A JIGSAW through a sheet of plywood and WE’RE —  

           BACK INSIDE NANCY’S BEDROOM  

           THE DIGITAL ALARM CLOCK BLARES. Nancy lifts her sleep mask, a 
           drowsy eye views the clock: 6:00 AM. She grabs the walkie — 

                                 NANCY 
                        Her shift’s over. 

           INSIDE THE GARAGE, DANNY SHUTS OFF HIS JIGSAW

           lifts his goggles and picks up his walkie — 

                                 DANNY 
                        Copy that, Nanc. Made some solid 
                        progress here tonight — 

                                 NANCY (O.C.)
                        Shut. It. Down.  

                                 DANNY
                        Copy. Shuttin’ ‘er down. 

           DANNY PUTS HIS TOOLS AWAY — THROWS A TARPAULIN OVER THE BOX — 
           LUGS THE BOX INTO A CORNER BEHIND THE HARLEY, OUT OF SIGHT.  

           NANCY’S BEDROOM, GLIDE ACROSS HER WALL-OF-FAME CORKBOARD  

           Now adorned with A COLLAGE OF POLAROID PHOTOS: various angles 
           of SMALL’S HOUSE, THE YESTERYEAR, SMALL’S MERCEDES, et al... 

           Stepping up to the board, Nancy pins on an advertisement of 
           LETHAL WEAPON. PUSH IN ON MEL GIBSON’S HANDGUN — 

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        You’ll need a gun, Danny. 
           DANNY DRIVES HIS PICK-UP THROUGH THE NORTHSIDE 

                                 DANNY (V.O.)
                        A gun!? Jesus, what for? 

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Intimidation.  

           INT. GHETTO HOUSE (ALONSO’S HOUSE), NORTHSIDE — NIGHT

           Alonso digs through a box in the closet. Stands now and 
           offers Danny a 9MM PISTOL. Danny nods, clueless — 

                                 DANNY
                        Got a nice weight to it.

           GARAGE, DANNY ASSEMBLES THE CUT WOOD, HAMMERS DOWN NAILS  

           and we’re beginning to see that a box is taking shape — 

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Tell him to take Route 102 out to 
                        Heiland Road.  

           NANCY’S MAZDA 929, MOVING — A RURAL AREA OUTSIDE KANKAKEE 

           ROUTE 102. Passing corn fields, silos, barns. A street sign 
           appears: WEICHERT NORTH ROAD. She pulls to the shoulder and 
           looks down the secluded dirt road flanked by heavy woods. 

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        That’s where I’ll meet you.  

           Across the street, Nancy NOTICES an ELDERLY FARMER in a corn 
           field, teasing the silks, gauging them for the harvest.  

           INSIDE SCHULER’S HARDWARE STORE, QUICK DETAIL SHOTS OF DANNY

           Lifting items: EXHAUST HOSES — LIGHTBULBS — A 12-VOLT MOTOR 
           — WIRE MESHING — A MINIATURE FAN — A DIGITAL TIMER SWITCH. 

           INT. RISH HOME, UPSTAIRS BATHROOM — NIGHT   

           Cloaked in a BLACK MOCK TURTLENECK, SWEATPANTS, GLOVES, and 
           MOTORCYCLE HELMET with tinted visor, Danny stands before the 
           mirror, rehearsing lines. 

                                 DANNY
                        Listen to me and no one gets hurt. 
                        Listen to me, palzone, and nobody —     

                                 NANCY   
                        Straighten your shoulders. 

           Nancy sits on the lip of the bath, painting her toenails. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Add a fuck or fucker. I’ll shove 
                        this gun up your asshole, fucker. 
                                 DANNY
                          (irritated)
                        Will you just let me do it my way, 
                        please. 

                                 NANCY
                          (tired, shoos him away)
                        Fine. Go practice somewhere else. 

           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY, MOMENTS LATER

           Danny exits the bathroom, MUMBLING to himself under the bulky 
           helmet as he WALKS DOWN THE STAIRS — 

                                 DANNY
                        ...maybe I don’t wunna shove it..up 
                        your asshole...

           ...INTO THE KITCHEN...where he opens the refrigerator. Takes 
           out the milk and chocolate syrup. As he mixes the two — 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        ...How would you feel if someone 
                        asked you to shove it in your ass?

           He lifts his visor to have a taste when...HIS EYES VIEW THE 
           FAMILY ROOM: CONNIE and her ‘CRAFT CLUB’ GALS. Fifteen or so 
           SEPTUAGENARIANS staring right at him. Wide-eyed, disturbed.  

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Oh hey... Hi there... 

           ON CONNIE, deeply concerned. 

           EXT. KANKAKEE COUNTRY CLUB/INT. NANCY’S MAZDA 929 — DAY

           Nancy’s parked outside the COUNTRY CLUB. She watches as 
           ELAINE SMALL exits with a CLIQUE OF AFFLUENT WOMEN. 

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        We’ll record his voice and use it 
                        to make the ransom calls. 

           Elaine looks confused, as if she can’t remember where she 
           parked. A FRIEND nears, directs Elaine to her Cadillac.

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        We’ll tell her to drive the money 
                        to Eagle Park.

           NANCY DRIFTS THROUGH A FOREST, LATE AFTERNOON  

           Alone, looking around as if searching for a guidepost...  

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        That’s where she’ll make the drop. 

           ...And there, up ahead, is the familiar ANCIENT ELM, the 
           secret hideaway she once shared with Jimmy. She smiles, 
           remembering, then moves that way. 
           IN THE GARAGE, DANNY HOOKS A MINI FAN UP TO THE 12-VOLT MOTOR 

           along with a LIGHT BULB which glows. 

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        By the time the cops are returning 
                        Mr. Small to his home, safe and 
                        sound...  

           He tests the fan. It spins.

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        ...We’ll be on a plane flying over 
                        Anguilla, looking down on the Cap 
                        Juluca Resort.

           INT. LEATHER STORE — DAY   

           Nancy browses the selection of leather motorcycle jackets. 

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        One day we’ll pass him somewhere. 
                        Who knows, maybe we’ll be living in 
                        Chicago or even New York by then. 

           EXT. RISH HOME, FRONT STEPS — NIGHT

           Nancy smokes a cigarette. VOICES RISE next door. She retreats 
           into the shadows and watches as Jimmy and a PRETTY BRUNETTE 
           exit the home, thanking MRS. KEENE for dinner. 

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Our eyes will meet and he won’t 
                        know a single thing. It’ll be 
                        like... nothing ever happened. 

           The happy couple climbs onto JIMMY’S HARLEY. Nancy watches as 
           they ZIP OFF down the street. 

           INT. RISH HOME, GARAGE — LATER THAT NIGHT  

           Nancy looks over the top of her magazine and watches Danny as 
           connects a DIGITAL TIMER SWITCH to a 12-VOLT MOTOR. He’s 
           tired, fading. Sensing this, Nancy lowers the Elle.  

                                 NANCY
                        What’s that? 

                                 DANNY
                        This? Timer switch. Tells the motor 
                        when to run and when to shut off. 

                                 NANCY
                          (indulging him)
                        Wow. It seems so complicated. 

                                 DANNY
                        Nah, I used to install a ton’a 
                        these. People programming their AC, 
                        the exterior lights while they’re 
                        away.    
                          (ready to brag now)
                                 DANNY (CONT'D)
                        I guess it could be a little 
                        tricky. You hafta wire the timer 
                        into the motor here like this... 

           Nancy watches as he CONNECTS the COLORED WIRES of the TIMER 
           SWITCH into the motor. Opens up the FACE revealing a DISPLAY 
           and a series of buttons: Day, Time, +, -.  

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        ...Then program in how often you 
                        want the fan to run.  

                                 NANCY
                        Why not just run it the whole time?

                                 DANNY
                        Motor could burn out, battery could 
                        die. But the timer here, couple’a 
                        these guys... 

           Opening his hand, he reveals two tiny, disk-like batteries. 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        ...and it’s good for about a month. 

                                 NANCY
                        And you can set that for any time? 

                                 DANNY
                        24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  

                                 NANCY
                        How about...Wednesday.

           He punches the buttons: Day, Time, +, —. Shows Nancy. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Friday? Say...11 AM? 

           Danny punches again, quicker now, showing-off: Day, Time, +, 
           —.  Holds up the display.  

                                 DANNY
                        Recognize that date? 
                          (she doesn’t)
                        It’s my birthday, goofy.  

                                 NANCY
                          (still staring at the 
                           timer switch)
                        Oh, right. 
                          (looks up at Danny)
                        We’ll celebrate in Anguilla. 

           RISH HOME, THE GARAGE DOOR RISES ON NANCY AND DANNY — NIGHT 

           THEY LOAD THE WOODEN BOX INTO THE CARGO BED 

           of the pick-up truck and cover it with blankets. 
           EXT. WEICHERT NORTH ROAD — NIGHT  

           Danny’s truck turns down the remote dirt road. 

           EXT. SECLUDED PATCH OF WOODS (BURIAL SITE) — SERIES OF SHOTS  

           — Guided by NANCY’S FLASHLIGHT, Danny LUGS the 8ft long box. 

           — Danny shakes a CAN OF SPRAY PAINT, marks an ‘X’ on a tree.

           — FROM A DISTANCE, a FLOOD LIGHT has been hung from a limb 
           and it shines down on a shirtless DANNY DIGGING A DEEP HOLE. 

           — A CLOSER ANGLE: Nancy stands outside the light, hidden in 
           the darkness, watching Danny labor as she smokes.   

                                 NANCY
                        We’ll do it tomorrow. 

           Danny pauses. Looks at her. It’s sooner than he thought. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        What’s the point of waiting? 

           After a moment, Danny begins digging again.  

           INT. RISH HOME, GARAGE — MORNING?? NIGHT?? 

           Danny’s obsessively reviewing the wooden box one final time. 
           Fan, time switch, 12V motor, light bulb, the intake and 
           exhaust hoses which will bring air from above ground.   

                                 CONNIE (O.C.)
                        Danny? 

           Danny peers above the box. Connie stands in the doorway in 
           her Dollar Store uniform. She’s just gotten back from work. 
           HE’S TOTALLY BUSTED. She walks toward him now — 

                                 CONNIE (CONT’D)
                        What’s...what’s going on out here?

                                 DANNY
                        Well um uh, this is a, uhh — 

                                 NANCY (O.C.)
                        Mom. 

           Startled, Connie turns to see Nancy standing behind her. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Oh. Hi, Nanc. I heard banging. 

                                 NANCY
                        It’s a surprise. Danny’s making a 
                        lemonade stand for the twins two 
                        doors down.

           Connie could cry: he’s coming around! She hugs Danny.  
                                 CONNIE
                        Oh I knew the fog would lift!
                          (feels the fan’s wind)
                        Look at that! There’s even a fan to 
                        keep them cool, Nancy! 

           She kisses his forehead, smiles proudly then heads inside. 

           Nancy looks at Danny: his face a tableau of fear and relief. 

                                 NANCY
                        Sorry. The alarm didn’t go off. 
                        Come to bed. Try to sleep a little.  

           INT. NANCY’S ROOM — EARLY MORNING 

           Lying in bed beside Nancy, unable to sleep, Danny stares at 
           the corkboard, a veritable BLUEPRINT OF THEIR PLAN. The 
           windows are open and the Fall breeze flutters the photos. 

           As a precaution against his ambivalence, Nancy has placed the 
           RESORT PHOTO and the PHOTO OF HIS FAMILY taken at his 
           sister’s wedding in the center of it all. 

           She wraps her arms around him and pulls him close. 

           (O.C.) A CAR DOOR SLAMS — 

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM — NIGHT 

           Nancy pulls the window curtain back, watches Connie’s Ford 
           reverse out of the drive. Turns back to Danny sitting on the 
           bed, uncomfortable as a child who needs to use the bathroom. 

                                 NANCY 
                        Get dressed. 

           PHILLIPS 66 PHONE BOOTH, PEMBROOKE — NIGHT (LATE) 

           Nancy steps inside, deposits a quarter, punches the keys.  

                                 NANCY
                        Mr. Small?... Sorry to wake you so 
                        late, this is Officer Claire 
                        Schneider from the Sheriff’s 
                        Department... I know it’s late, 
                        sir, but there’s been a break-in at 
                        The Yesteryear Restaurant. 

           INT. SMALL’S HOUSE, BEDROOM — NIGHT 

           Small’s in bed, half-asleep, phone to his ear. 

                                 SMALL 
                        Is there any damage?... Why can’t 
                        you can’t tell me anything? I’m the 
                        owner... Oh for chrissakes!  

           He hangs up the phone, looks at the clock: 2:31 AM. 
           INT. SMALL’S HOUSE, GARAGE — 2:45 AM 

           DARKNESS. Then...A RECTANGLE OF LIGHT as Small opens the 
           house door, depresses the garage door switch. 

           THE DOOR RISES. Light floods the space revealing...DANNY IN 
           THE ALL-BLACK ENSEMBLE. Crouched like a frightened alien who 
           crash-landed nearby and made its way here for shelter.   

           Small steps down, nears the Mercedes. Danny SPRINGS to his 
           feet. An absurd image reminiscent of an ill-conceived mascot 
           for a fledgling sports team.  

                                 DANNY
                        Gettindaker falzone gettindaker —  

           Under the helmet, his voice is insensible underwater talk. 
           Small STARTLES, SEES the 9MM in Danny’s hand.

                                 SMALL
                        What — what is this - who are — ? 

                                 DANNY
                        GETTINDAKER! NOW! NOW!

           Danny pulls open the driver’s door and PUSHES Small inside. 
           He slides into the backseat. 

           INT. SMALL’S MERCEDES — CONTINUOUS 

                                 SMALL
                        What do you want? Why are — 

                                 DANNY
                        Dake Route IOU tout ta Thailand.

                                 SMALL
                        I can’t hear you.

                                 DANNY
                        Dake I-O-U tout to Thailand! 

           Small’s face wrinkles. Danny flips the visor up.  

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Goddangit! Take Route 102 out to 
                        Heiland Road! Wouldja listen!? 

                                 SMALL
                        ...What’s all the way out there? 

           Danny TRAINS the gun on Small, flips the visor down. 

                                 DANNY
                        Just whoa. 

           Small starts the car. EASY LISTENING JAZZ is on the radio.  

           EXT. ROUTE 102 — WIDE — 3:00 AM 

           The headlights of the Mercedes appear in the distance like 
           owl eyes, approaching. 
                                 DANNY (O.C.)
                        Slow down... Turn here. 

           The Mercedes pivots down Weichert Road. 

           INT. SMALL’S MERCEDES, MOVING DOWN WEICHERT ROAD — CONTINUOUS 

           THE EASY JAZZ belies the tempest inside Small’s head as the 
           car progresses a rocky jaunt, the road beset by dense woods. 

                                 DANNY
                        Pull over. Turn the car off and 
                        hand me the keys. 

           Small does just that. Danny takes the keys, hands Small a set 
           of handcuffs. 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Put those on.  

           Small fumbles, finally gets the cuffs on. In the rearview, he 
           WATCHES Danny tie a BANDANA. His eyes size up the environs: 
           these woods, this road, the dark figure in the backseat. 

                                 SMALL
                        What are you going to do to me? 

           Reaching over the seat, Danny attempts to pulls the bandana 
           over Small’s eyes. Small WRITHES. AN AWKWARD STRUGGLE ENSUES 
           and in the struggle SMALL GLIMPSES DISTANT HEADLIGHTS 
           CRESTING A RISE. This is his chance.   

           His hand LIFTS THE DOOR LOCK and — 

           EXT. MERCEDES/WEICHERT NORTH ROAD — SAME

           — SMALL BURSTS OUT! TAKES OFF TOWARD THE HEADLIGHTS.

           DANNY CHASES, TRIPS on his own feet and FALLS FLAT ON HIS 
           FACE, CRACKING HIS VISOR. He gets up dizzily, keeps running, 
           clutching a pulled hamstring. 

           SMALL’S HEADING RIGHT AT THE HEADLIGHTS. FLAILING HIS ARMS! 

                                 SMALL
                        HEY! STOP! STOP! 

           The pick-up truck SCREECHES to a halt an inch from Small. He 
           moves to the passenger door. Tries the door. Locked.   

                                 SMALL (CONT’D)
                        Open up! I’ve been kidnapped!

           He looks up at the driver... IT’S NANCY. She’s shocked, 
           frightened, wide-eyed. This Was Not The Plan.

                                 SMALL (CONT’D)
                          (SHAKING the handle)
                        Lemme in! Lemme in GODDAMNIT! 

           Then...Small’s eyes narrow. He knows: she’s in on it.
           NANCY FLOORS THE TRUCK! It TAKES OFF, THROWING SMALL FROM THE 
           VEHICLE! HE LANDS HARD ON THE GROUND! 

           As the pick-up FLIES PAST, Danny glimpses Nancy inside. White 
           like she’s seen a ghost. The truck disappears. Danny pivots 
           to Small. Prostrated. Out-of-breath. Gash above his eye. 

           EXT. SECLUDED PATCH OF WOODS (BURIAL SITE) — NIGHT 

           Danny has the 9MM against Small’s back as he leads him 
           through the woods. The ‘X’ MARKED TREE comes into view. Danny 
           stops, lifts off Small’s blindfold and hands him a sheet of 
           paper on which a script has been written.

                                 DANNY
                        Read it when I say. 

                                 SMALL
                          (out of breath, reading)
                        Mother, it’s me —  

                                 DANNY
                        Wait wait wait — I didn’t say.

           Danny removes a MICROCASSETTE RECORDER from his sweatshirt 
           pouch. Presses ‘record’ and then cues Small. 

                                 SMALL
                        Mother, it’s me... I’ve been 
                        kidnapped and I’ve been buried 
                        alive. I won’t be released until a 
                        payment of one million dollars cash 
                        is made. 

           Small looks at Danny who motions for him to continue. 

                                 SMALL (CONT’D)
                        You will be called again at 10 AM 
                        with instructions on where to drop 
                        the money. Please stay by the 
                        phone. Once the money has been 
                        collected you will be told my 
                        location. If you attempt to contact 
                        the police you will never see me 
                        alive again. 

           Finished reading, Small hands the script back to Danny who 
           leads him for a few yards until they reach the edge of the 
           hole. A small slope leads down to where the open wooden BOX 
           awaits. Seeing it, Small PANICS, BECOMES HYSTERICAL —  

                                 SMALL (CONT’D)
                        No. NO! NO! PLEASE! PLEASE NO! 

           The men STRUGGLE against one another. It all stops when — 

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Gimme the gun. 

           IT’S NANCY. She steps out of the darkness, takes the gun from 
           Danny and PUTS IT TO SMALL’S TEMPLE. 
                                 NANCY
                        Get down there before I put a hole 
                        in your head. 

           Something in her eyes tell Small to believe her. Shaking, he 
           lays down inside the box. 

           Danny SHUTS THE LID and LOCKS THE HATCHES. Looking up, Nancy 
           peers over the rim of the grave, her ire focused directly on 
           him. She STALKS OFF.  

           Danny OPENS the compartment at the top of the box. He sets 
           the TIMER SWITCH. The MOTOR begins to HUM and — 

           INSIDE THE WOODEN BOX 

           IT’S SO FUCKING DARK IN HERE. SMALL STARTS TO HYPERVENTILATE. 

           Then the FAN BEGINS TO TURN. Small GULPS THE AIR like water 
           in a dessert. The LIGHT GLOWS. He notices something at his 
           feet. He strains to reach down and picks up a brown bag. 
           Dumps it out: a bottle of water, apples, Hershey bars. 

           TOOSH. TOOSH. TOOSH. THE DIRT COMING FROM ABOVE. 

           SMALL BANGS HIS KNUCKLES AGAINST THE LID. BANG! BANG! BANG! 

           DANNY  

           the hole is filled now, Danny checks the INTAKE/EXHAUST HOSES 
           protruding from the ground, bringing air. They’re clear.  

           INT. SMALL’S MERCEDES, MOVING/EXT. FIELD — ROUTE 102 —4:25 AM  

           Danny drives. In the rearview, he WATCHES the headlights of 
           the PICK-UP trailing. There’s not another car on the road. 

           He guides the sedan off the road and into a FIELD OF TALL 
           GRASS. Drives a distance, then cuts the engine. Steps from 
           the car, LAUNCHES THE KEYS and RUNS BACK THROUGH THE FIELD... 

           INT. DANNY’S PICK-UP TRUCK, MOVING – 4:45 AM 

           TIGHT ON NANCY in the passenger seat, staring blankly out the 
           window. (NOTE: this is the exact shot we saw in the beginning 
           of the film.) 

                                 NANCY
                        You were supposed to have the 
                        blindfold on. That was the plan. 
                          (beat)
                        He saw my face. 

                                 DANNY
                        You don’t know that. It was dark — 

                                 NANCY
                          (certain of it)
                        He saw my fucking face. 
           INT. RISH HOME, FRONT DOOR — 5:15 AM 

           Nancy enters and RUSHES up the stairs. Moments later, Danny 
           steps inside and hears Nancy’s door SHUT upstairs. 

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM — MOMENTS LATER 

           Nancy lies in bed, facing the wall. Inconsolable. Danny sits 
           down beside her.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m gonna fix this, Nancy. I know I 
                        messed up, but I’m gonna fix it... 
                        I love you...  

           She won’t look at him. 

           INT. DANNY’S PICK-UP TRUCK, MOVING – 5:40 AM 

           NEWSRADIO STATION to NEWSRADIO STATION. Danny switches the 
           dial, paranoid that maybe his name will be mentioned. 

           EXT. SUNOCO GAS STATION PHONE BOOTH (PEMBROOKE) — 5:45 AM  

           CLOSE ON THE VOICE RECORDER. The cassette spools turn 
           backward until...CLICK. 

           Danny deposits a quarter, dials a number. He rubs his eyes, 
           trying to fight off sleep. 

           INT. SMALL’S HOUSE, ELAINE’S MASTER BEDROOM – SAME 

           Elaine sleeps like the dead, her mouth wide open, SNORING. 

           The PHONE RINGS...and RINGS...and RINGS...

           INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH 

           Danny’s antsy, rocking back and forth, then — 

                                 ELAINE SMALL (O.C.)
                        Hello — 

           He presses ‘play’ on the recorder, puts it to the phone — 

                    VOICE RECORDER

                        Shit! 

           He hangs up. Rewinds the recorder. Deposits another quarter.  
           ELAINE’S BEDROOM 

           THE PHONE RINGS. Elaine rolls over, her snoring adopts a 
           different PITCH and she falls back asleep.

                        Goddamnit! 

           He reaches into his pocket. No more change.  

           INT. SUNOCO CONVENIENCE STORE — MOMENTS LATER 

           Danny hobbles in wearing the motorcycle helmet and approaches 
           the counter.  

                                 DANNY
                        Got change for a buck?  

           TEENAGE CLERK stares at the badly-cracked visor.  

                                 TEENAGE CLERK 
                        Your visor’s totally fucked, man. 

           INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH, DANNY INSERTS THE QUARTER 

           ELAINE’S BEDROOM 

           The RINGING manages to stir Elaine this time.  

                                 ELAINE SMALL 
                        Stephen? Stephen answer that. 

           No response. Grudgingly she reaches over and lifts the phone. 

                                 ELAINE SMALL (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Stephen? What’s going on? You sound 
                        funny – 
                                 VOICE RECORDER (O.C.)
                        I’ve been kidnapped and I’ve been

                        What? Who is... who’s there? 

           PUSH IN ON ELAINE, listening intently to the recording.

                                 ELAINE SMALL (CONT’D)
                        Oh my...oh no...wha...what...

           INT. SMALL’S HOUSE, MINUTES LATER — THESE SHOTS QUICKLY — 

           Elaine walks into Small’s bedroom. Empty. 

           Elaine walks through the foyer. Empty. 

           Elaine looks in Stephen’s office. Empty. 

           INT. SMALL’S HOUSE, KITCHEN — SAME  

           CLOSE ON A PHONE PAD. Elaine’s hand presses 9 — 1 — 

           A tremor of fear courses through her. Deep, paralyzing fear. 
           She looks around. Windows. Doors. Stairs. Someone’s watching. 
           She feels it. Her chest tightens. Knees shake. Can’t breathe. 
           She collapses into a chair. And hangs up the phone. 

           WALK-IN CLOSET   

           Elaine lifts the same BLONDE JUMEAU DOLL we saw Nancy lift 
           before. She presses the button and the shelves separate to 
           reveal the VAULT DOOR. She punches a code into the keypad. 
           CLICK. Turns the spindle wheel handle and WE’RE — 

           INSIDE THE VAULT 

           It’s about the size of a walk-in closet and is filled with 
           ANTIQUES and FAMILY HEIRLOOMS. 

           In the corner is a DEPOSITORY SAFE. Stacks of bills inside. 
           But as Elaine removes a stack, we see that these are no 
           ordinary currency notes. Instead, they’re GOLD CERTIFICATES. 
           She begins to stuff them in a duffle bag. 

           BACK IN THE KITCHEN 

           Elaine sits by the phone, waiting for instructions. 

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM — 6:30 AM 

           Miraculously, Nancy’s managed to fall asleep. 

           DANNY ENTERS THE ROOM, takes off his the black ensemble, 
           leaves it in a pile along with the motorcycle helmet and the 
           9MM under that. He sets the alarm clock for 9:00 AM. 
           Kisses Nancy’s forehead, sits on the air mattress with his 
           back against the wall. He’ll rest for a bit. That’s all. Just 
           an hour. He fights his eyes, but they 
           move...towards...sleep...

           EXT. SECLUDED PATCH OF WOODS (BURIAL SITE) — EARLY MORNING 

           WE’RE MOVING OVER THE GROUND like a spreading fog...

           ...DOWN THROUGH THE GROUND INTO SMALL’S WOODEN BOX...

           ...SMALL POUNDS HIS FISTS AGAINST THE LID! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! 
           His knuckles are bloody, the skin raw and peeling... 

                                 SMALL
                        HELP ME! HELP I’M IN HERE! HELP! 

           ZZZ! ZZZ! A SPARK inside the wire meshing! THE FAN STOPS 
           TURNING! A stream of smoke emanates. THE LIGHT GOES OUT! 

           WHOOSH! WHOOSH! THE EXHAUST HOSES ARE RIPPED AWAY! 

           SMALL STARTS TO GASP FOR AIR that isn’t there. He begins to 
           hyperventilate and —  

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM — MORNING 

           THE ALARM SOUNDS on the digital clock: a rock station SHOUTS 
           Baltimora’s ‘Tarzan Boy’ as —  

           DANNY’S EYES SHOOT OPEN. He exhales his nightmare. SEES his 
           clothes in a pile. BUT THE HELMET’S GONE! SO IS THE GUN! And 
           Nancy’s not in bed. His eyes dart to the clock: 11:00 AM! He 
           SPRINGS to his feet like his ass is on fire and —  

           INT. RISH HOME — MOMENTS LATER 

           DANNY RUSHES DOWN THE STEPS. Connie’s in the family room 
           dressed in a leotard. Bouncing on a mini-trampoline, HOOTING 
           like an owl to a workout video. 

                                 DANNY
                        Connie. CONNIE! CONNIE! 

           She looks up, removes the headphones. 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Nancy? 

                                 CONNIE
                        She went out for a walk — 

           Just then, NANCY OPENS THE FRONT DOOR. She brushes past Danny 
           and continues up the stairs. He FOLLOWS, frantic – 

                                 DANNY
                        Where were you!?  

                                 NANCY
                        I needed some air. 
                                 DANNY
                        I can’t find the gun. Someone stole 
                        the gun, Nancy. Nancy — 

                                 NANCY
                        Sshh you idiot!  

                                 DANNY
                          (quieter)
                        Someone stole the gun. 

           They enter — 

           NANCY’S BEDROOM    

           ‘Tarzan Boy’ still BLARING from the digital clock.  

                                 NANCY
                        I did. I threw it in the river. 

                                 DANNY
                        What’d you do that for? 

                                 NANCY
                        Because you would’ve screwed it up.   
                        Just like you screwed up everything 
                        else. 

           She opens her closet and pulls out her suitcase. Danny 
           notices the corkboard has been cleared of their blueprint.  

                                 DANNY
                        Where are you going?  

                                 NANCY
                        I haven’t decided yet. I’ve always 
                        wanted to see Belize.

                                 DANNY
                        What about You-Know-Who? 

                                 NANCY
                        You figure it out.  

           She RUMMAGES drawers. TOSSES garments into her suitcase. The 
           MUSIC is irritating Danny. He YANKS the power plug out. 

                                 DANNY
                        Wait for me... I can get the money. 
                          (off Nancy’s laugh)
                        I’ll get it, Nancy...I’ll get it 
                        and we’ll go together. Trust me... 

           She considers him carefully a long moment. Then — 

                                 NANCY
                        Hurry. 

           INT. PHONE BOOTH, PHILLIPS 66 (PEMBROOKE) — 12:00 PM  

           Danny slides in wearing a baseball cap and a fake mustache. 
           It’s very thick and makes him look oddly Mexican. He deposits 
           a quarter, dials, ducks his head —   
           INT. SMALL’S HOUSE, KITCHEN — SAME

           Elaine’s sitting in the same chair. She answers the phone. 

           INTERCUT DANNY AND ELAINE  

                                 ELAINE SMALL   
                        Is this Eddie? 

                                 DANNY
                        Who? No, this isn’t Eddie — 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Are you sure?

                                 DANNY
                        Yes I’m sure!

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Who are you then? And where’s my 
                        son? 

           Danny cups a hand to distort his voice. Sounds like a giant. 

                                 DANNY
                        Drop the money at Eagle Municipal 
                        Park at the Concessions Stand —

                        Is that where Stephen is?    

           Thrown, Danny decides to drop the deep voice. 

                                 DANNY
                        No, no! 
                          (patiently)
                        This is the call where I tell you 
                        where to drop the money.

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Stephen said, Mother, you’ll 
                        receive a call telling you — 

                                 DANNY
                        I know what he said, I told him 
                        what to say, maam, and, and I know 
                        that I’m late because the alarm 
                        clock didn’t, uhhh... Look, were 
                        you able to get the money? 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        You know God damn well I got the 
                        money!

                                 DANNY
                        No I don’t, I didn’t know that, but 
                        if you do that’s great. The uh drop-
                        off is Eagle Municipal Park.

                          (tries to think of some 
                           threatening, fails)
                        You do not wanna do that, maam.   

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Do you really think you’re going to 
                        just get away with this?

           He panics, quickly U-turns and FLIES BACK ONTO ROUTE 102. 

           EXT. GRASSLAND, OUTSIDE KANKAKEE — 1:45 PM 

           STRONG WIND FLATTENS THE GRASS as the Astra descends. Tiller 
           and Deacon deplane and are greeted by Chief Witten.  

                                 AGENT TILLER
                          (over the helicopter)
                        AGENT TILLER! THIS IS AGENT DEACON!

           INT. CHIEF’S CRUISER, MOVING — 2:00 PM

           Tiller and Deacon are briefed by Witten — 

                                 AGENT TILLER
                        — How many calls total then? 

                                 CHIEF WITTEN
                        She seemed foggy on that. First 
                        call came in around 6 AM.   

                                 AGENT DEACON
                        And she waits until noon to call 
                        you? Seems strange. 

                                 CHIEF WITTEN
                        They told her she was being 
                        watched. When we knocked on the 
                        door she fainted. 

           The Cruiser rides past the iron gates of the Small home and 
           the Queen Anne mansion comes into view. 

                                 AGENT DEACON 
                        ...Get a load of this place. 

           INT. SMALL’S HOUSE, KITCHEN — 2:30 PM  

           HIGH COMMAND for the KANKAKEE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS UNIT. 
           DETECTIVES and DEPUTIES mill about, searching for clues of 
           forced entry while TECHIES prep the phone for a tap. 
           At the center of the hullabaloo, Elaine sits exhausted and 
           ashen-faced, the day’s events have left her weak, shaken and 
           disordered. There’s a NURSE on hand checking her vitals. 

           WITTEN, TILLER & DEACON enter. Witten signals Elaine. Tiller 
           and Deacon approach, slide chairs close. 

                                 AGENT TILLER
                        Maam, I’m FBI Agent Tiller and this 
                        is Agent Deacon. 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        I, I haven’t done anything wrong —

                                 AGENT TILLER
                        I’m sure you haven’t. We’d just 
                        like to ask you a few questions. 
                        About the ransom call: you were 
                        told the money was to be left at 
                        Eagle Municipal Park, correct? 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Well, there were two calls.  

                                 AGENT DEACON   
                          (off his notes)
                        ...Right. The first from your son 
                        and the second from the kidnapper.  
                          (Elaine nods)
                        And you told Chief Witten you were 
                        able to get the money together. 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Yes. 

                                 AGENT TILLER
                          (incredulous)
                        A million dollars cash? 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Yes.

                                 AGENT TILLER
                        At what time approximately did you 
                        have the money? 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        About...7AM, I guess... 

                                 AGENT DEACON
                        Mrs. Small, the banks don’t open 
                        until 9. 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        I didn’t visit a bank. I keep a 
                        safe in my bedroom closet...

           Tiller looks at Witten who promptly moves to investigate. 

                                 AGENT TILLER
                        Where’s the money now? 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        With Eddie. I put it inside a bag 
                        and left it in the woods. 
                                 AGENT DEACON
                        Who’s Eddie, maam?

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        The man who makes the music. He 
                        gets the money.

           Tiller and Deacon exchange a look. 

                                 AGENT TILLER
                        Your instructions were to drop the 
                        money at Eagle Municipal Park. What 
                        was the exact location there?  

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        No, no, no, Stephen called me — 

                                 AGENT DEACON
                        We know that, but we’re more 
                        concerned with the ransom call — 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        I did exactly what I was told! But 
                        then I got lost getting back to the 
                        car, and the phone call was late — 

                                 AGENT TILLER
                        You were lost at the park? 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Yes! No! I was in the woods. Newton 
                        Road. I, I tried to remember where 
                        I was when I left, I couldn’t...

           She loses her train of thought and is overcome by exhaustion. 
           She struggles to breathe. The Nurse swoops in. 

                                 NURSE
                        I think that’s enough for now. 

           Just then, Witten returns. Tiller and Deacon stand, the men 
           confer out of Elaine’s earshot.  

                                 CHIEF WITTEN
                        You won’t believe this. 

           SSSKKKK — Witten flips through a stack of GOLD CERTIFICATES. 
           Dates fly by on the bills – all from 1933. 

                                 CHIEF WITTEN (CONT’D)
                        Gold Certificates. Must be a few 
                        hundred grand in there. 

                                 AGENT DEACON 
                        Someone passes those around – it’ll 
                        start ringing some bells. 

                                 AGENT TILLER
                        Yeah, if they don’t wash it first. 
                          (to Witten)
                        Tell me about Newton Road.   

                                 CHIEF WITTEN
                        It backs up to the river. Mostly 
                        woods over that way.  
                                 AGENT DEACON
                        How far? 

                                 CHIEF WITTEN
                        From here? Nine or ten miles. 

                                 AGENT DEACON
                        And Eagle Municipal Park? 

                                 CHIEF WITTEN
                        Other direction. Bout four miles 
                        from here.

                                 AGENT TILLER
                        Ransom call comes in at noon. She 
                        gathers the money, drives ten miles 
                        to Newton Road and makes the 
                        exchange. She then drives ten miles 
                        back and magically she’s here to 
                        answer the door when Deputies 
                        arrive at 12:10? 

                                 CHIEF WITTEN
                        Think she’s on the level?  

           They watch Elaine. The Nurse feeds her yogurt. It spills out 
           the sides of her mouth: she’s somewhere else entirely. 

                                 AGENT TILLER
                        I think she’s an old woman who’s 
                        been through a heulluva’n ordeal. 
                        For now let’s stick with a firewall 
                        around Eagle Park and pray our guy 
                        shows up soon.

           EXT. EAGLE MUNICIPAL PARK — 2:30 PM — DETAIL SHOTS 

           UNMARKED CARS patrol. PLAINCLOTHES OFFICERS prowl the gently 
           landscaped trails that wind through the man-made WOODS.  

           PARK PICNIC AREA

           YOUNG CHILDREN run and play around the picnic tables near the 
           CONCESSIONS STAND. Balloons announce a boy’s birthday party.  

           THE DOOR OF A NEARBY PORT-A-POTTY 

           It opens slightly to reveal Danny. He watches the UNMARKED 
           CRUISERS making periodic passes. In his hand, A COMPACT 
           MIRROR which he now angles to gain a VIEW OF THE DUMPSTER. 

           THE PARTY MOTHERS 

           are alerted to Danny by the glints of light coming off the 
           mirror. His behavior quickly becomes suspect. He seems to be 
           watching the young boys. Getting himself increasingly worked 
           up. And what’s he doing with his hand? Moving back and forth.
           DANNY     

           waits for a Cruiser to pass, then leaves the Port-A-Potty and 
           CROSSES to the concessions stand dumpster where he begins to 
           rummage through the gross, wet trash. Finding nothing. 

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Hi. 

           Danny turns. A YOUNG BOY, 4, watches him curiously. 

                                 DANNY
                        Oh hey. Hey, bud. 
                          (kneels)
                        You the birthday boy? 

                                 PARTY MOTHER (O.C.)
                        Billy! 

           A PARTY MOTHER approaches hastily. 

                                 PARTY MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Get away from that man, Billy! 

           She arrives. Pulls her son close, guards him. To Danny — 

                                 PARTY MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        What’re you doing here? 

                                 DANNY
                        Me? I’m uh, just, yunno...

           He sees the fear in her eyes. Knows what she must be 
           thinking. A Cruiser passes. Danny SPRINTS off.   

           INT. RISH HOME, DEN — 3:00 PM — ON NANCY   

           sitting on the couch, coolly flipping through channels. The 
           PHONE RINGS. She stands and answers it. 

                                 NANCY
                        Hello?  

                                 DANNY (O.C.)
                        She didn’t leave the money! Nancy, 
                        she didn’t leave it where I said to 
                        leave it — now I gotta tell her 
                        somewhere else to drop the cash —  

           Nancy hangs up the phone. Connie ENTERS from the garage. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Who was that, sweetheart? 

                                 NANCY
                        Danny... He’s acting very strange. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Tell me about it. 
           INT. PHONE BOOTH, CIRCLE K (PEMBROOKE) — SAME 

           Danny hangs up the phone. Inserts a quarter. Dials — 

           INT. SMALL’S HOUSE, KITCHEN — OVER THE PHONE RINGING

           UTTER SILENCE as A TECHIE SLIDES ON HEAD PHONES and — 

           THE PHONE-TAPPING DEVICE CLICKS, CASSETTE WHEELS TURN and — 

           AGENT TILLER LIFTS THE PHONE, HANDS IT TO ELAINE and — 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Hello? 

                                 DANNY (O.C.)
                        You lied to me, maam — Maam you 
                        lied and said you had the money! 

           PULLING BACK SLOWLY REVEALING — Detectives, Deputies. Tiller. 
           Deacon. Witten. So many. All as still as statues.

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        I gave you the money. 

                                 DANNY (O.C.)
                        See! You’re lying again! T’heck are 
                        you doing that for!? 

           Elaine turns to Tiller. He signals her to keep him on. 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Don’t get angry. 

                                 DANNY (O.C.)
                        Yeah, well...too late....

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        I’ll get you the money. 

                                 DANNY (O.C.)
                        You said that last time! 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Where should I drop it off? 

                                 DANNY (O.C.)
                        ...I don’t know anymore. I gotta 
                        call you back. Stay by the phone. 

           CLICK. The line goes dead.  

           Tiller turns to a TECHIE who removes his headphones.    

                                 TECHIE
                        Got it. Call came from a pay phone 
                        in Pembrooke. 

                                 AGENT TILLER 
                        Set up check points triangulating 
                        every possible entry road – main 
                        arteries, side streets, service 
                        roads, all of it.

           UNMARKED CRUISERS leave the station and SPREAD OUT over the 
           county like liquid. 

           CHECKPOINTS ARE SET-UP AT I-57, ROUTE 102, Highway 52.  

           CRUISERS PULL INTO LOTS ACROSS FROM GAS STATIONS — FAST FOOD 
           RESTAURANTS — MOVIE THEATERS — MALLS – EAGLE MUNICIPAL PARK. 

           EVERY PAY PHONE IN TOWN IS BEING WATCHED. 

           INT. BENNIGAN’S RESTAURANT, BAR — 5:30 PM

           LOCAL NEWS plays on the TV. Glum and hopeless, Danny picks at 
           a plate of buffalo wings, wipes his face with a napkin.  

                                 BARTENDER
                        Refill there, pal? 

           Danny nods. As the Bartender refills his Pepsi, he notices 
           Danny’s mustache is lopsided. Decides to ignore it.

                        In the news at his hour: police are 
                        searching for an apparent prowler 
                        at Eagle Municipal Park tonight. 

           The sickened PARTY MOTHER is interviewed beside her son.  

                                 PARTY MOTHER 
                        He was inside a Port-A-Potty... 
                        doing something strange in there. 
                        And then he tried talking to Billy. 
                        Did he touch you, Billy? 

           Eager to please, Billy nods. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Fuckin’ pederast. 

           Danny MOANS agreement, but he’s not paying attention. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Authorities tonight are looking for 
                        a Hispanic male, ‘6’0’, —  

           A PHOTO FLASHES on the screen. A crude sketch but CLEARLY 
           DANNY with the thick mustache and baseball cap. 

           BARTENDER whip-turns to Danny. Danny looks up at the TV. His 
           eyes go wide. He LEAPS from the stool, RUSHES out the door — 

           INT. DANNY’S PICK-UP, MOVING — NIGHT — SERIES OF SHOTS 

           AS IT ROLLS THROUGH KANKAKEE’S MAIN STREETS, Danny’s head on 
           a swivel as he eyes the STRIP MALLS, BURGER JOINTS, 
           CONVENIENCE STORES, desperately looking for a drop spot. 

           He glimpses himself in the REARVIEW, TEARS OFF the mustache 
           and FIRES it out the window. 
           LATER

           The truck is stopped idling behind a zebra arm with flashing 
           lights, the surface road perpendicular to the rigid frame of 
           a massive iron RAILROAD TRESTLE. 

                                 NEWSRADIO ANCHOR
                        Police tonight are asking for your 
                        help to identify — 

           Danny shuts it off. A TRAIN HORN SOUNDS and a commuter train 
           screams past obliterating the view. 

           He looks away from it, and there, below the struts of the 
           overpass, down a slope overgrown with untrampled wild grass 
           is an almost completely obscured dark creek bed.  

           That’s his spot. 

           EXT. KANKAKEE STREETS — DANNY WALKS 

           towards a pay phone outside McDonald’s. An UMMARKED CRUISER 
           enters the lot, and circles. Danny u-turns — 

           A GROCERY STORE — MINUTES LATER 

           Danny nears the pay phone when the automatic doors open and 
           TWO DEPUTIES step out. He veers in the other direction —   

           PAY PHONE AFTER PAY PHONE — FACE AFTER FACE (TIME-CUTS) 

           DANNY’S MIND betraying him now. The faces lurking near the 
           phones suddenly become spies, luring Danny into their trap. 
           Each setback increases his anxiety, his paranoia that he’s 
           being watched, followed: EVERYONE KNOWS.  

           Finally, overwhelmed, out-of-breath he ducks DOWN A DARK 
           ALLEY. Back against the brick wall, sinking to his knees. The 
           sound of HIGH HEELS is heard, approaching.

           The CLICK and CLACK become the TICKING OF A CLOCK inside 
           Danny’s head — TICK-TOCK-TICK-TOCK — louder and LOUDER AND — 

           EXT. WEICHERT ROAD, ADJACENT WOODS (BURIAL SITE) — 7:00 PM 

           DANNY RACES THROUGH THE TREES frantically. Pointing a 
           flashlight at every tree trunk...

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Some people don’t mind simple 
                        lives. The sound of loneliness 
                        makes them happy. 

           He can’t find the ‘X’ marked tree.  

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM — NIGHT 

           Nancy and Connie sit on Nancy’s bed. Connie’s combing her 
           hair just like she did when Nancy was a child. 
                                 NANCY
                        I never wanted that life. I always 
                        felt that I was meant for something 
                        special. That somehow a mistake had 
                        been made... and someone else was 
                        out there living the life I should 
                        have had while I was stuck here.  
                          (beat)
                        You were so beautiful once, Mom.

                                 CONNIE
                        Sometimes I wonder if things had 
                        been different... if I hadn’t met 
                        your father so young... but he gave 
                        me you, Nancy.  

                                 NANCY
                        What if you could do it all over 
                        again? See the world. Be the person 
                        you were always meant to be. To 
                        have people ask who you are as you 
                        walked down the street. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Oh I don’t think that way, Nanc. 
                        Sometimes those dreams are just out 
                        of reach... but that’s okay... 

           A moment. Worry suffuses Nancy’s face. She seems sad, almost 
           regretful. She turns and faces Connie. 

                                 NANCY
                        Mom...if I have to leave again, I 
                        want you know I’ll never forget 
                        where things started. 

                                 CONNIE
                        Leave? Where, Nancy? 

           Nancy sees Connie’s concern. Doesn’t want her to worry.  

                                 NANCY
                        What was that story about Shirley 
                        Temple you used to tell me?

                                 CONNIE
                          (comforted by the 
                           familiar)
                        How the same word came to 
                        everyone’s mind when they saw her. 
                        Sparkle. Just like my little girl. 

           Nancy smiles.  

           EXT. PAY PHONE AT A TASTEE-FREEZE — NIGHT 

           Danny, out of breath, lifts the phone, dials a number —  

           INT. SMALL’S HOUSE, KITCHEN – SAME 

           Tiller and Deacon pore over a map of Kankakee County. The 
           PHONE RINGS. Same procedure as before. Everyone quiet and 
           still as Tiller hands Elaine the phone. 
           INTERCUT DANNY and ELAINE. 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        ...Eddie? Is that you? 

                                 DANNY 
                          (frantic)
                        Listen to me! Listen to me I want 
                        you to call the police! Call the 
                        police and get them out to Weichert 
                        Road right now!  

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        Is that where Stephen is? 

                                 DANNY 
                        Yes-Yes-Yes! 

           Witten quietly nods to a few Deputies who leave immediately. 

                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        There’s a tree out there in the 
                        woods. I marked it with an ‘X’ but 
                        with all the crap going on and 
                        lying and now it’s night and I 
                        forgot where the hell I put him! 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        An ‘X’ on a tree? That’s my son?  

                                 DANNY 
                        Yeah.... And maam?   
                          (beat, just breathing)
                        I’m real sorry about all this. 

           ACROSS THE STREET, IN AN UNMARKED CRUISER  

           A DETECTIVE watches Danny leave the pay phone, SNAPPING 
           PICTURES of him as he goes. He lifts the two-way radio now — 

                                 DETECTIVE 
                        Suspect is a Hispanic Male. 30s. 
                        Vehicle is a white early-model Ford 
                        F-Series. Ohio plates. XBR-284.  

                                 CHIEF WITTEN (O.C.)
                        Copy that. Don’t take him just yet.

           Danny drives off in the pick-up. Detective follows... 

           INT. RISH HOME — NIGHT 

           Danny enters and DASHES UP the stairs — 

                                 DANNY
                        Nancy!? NANCY!? 

           OPENS NANCY’S BEDROOM DOOR. The HAIRDRYER’S RUNNING as Connie 
           stands over Nancy, teasing her newly-colored hair. Platinum 
           blonde. Connie shuts it off, turns to Danny. He’s a mess.  

                                 CONNIE
                        Danny? Is everything alright?  
                                 DANNY
                        Can you give us a minute, Connie? 

           Connie’s afraid to leave Nancy alone with Danny in this 
           state. But Nancy nods: it’s okay. Connie leaves.  

           Danny shuts the door behind her. Nancy turns to him, smiles. 

                                 NANCY
                        Do you like the new look? 

                                 DANNY
                        We gotta go. We gotta go now.  

           Danny finds a duffle bag and begins to stuff clothes in. 

                                 NANCY
                        Did you get the money? 

                                 DANNY
                        They know, Nancy! They got my face 
                        painted all over the news! Luckily 
                        I had the mustache. 

                                 NANCY
                        I have to tell my Mom, I — 

                                 DANNY
                        Nancy! 

                                 NANCY
                        She’s my mom.  

                                 DANNY
                        ...Okay...but hurry up.

           Nancy leaves. Danny continues stuffing his clothes into the 
           bag. He opens the closet, notices NANCY’S SUITCASE. Pulls it 
           out...it’s light. Unzips it. IT’S EMPTY. His face creases. 

           Moves to the bureau, slides out the drawers. The clothes she 
           tossed onto the bed are BACK IN PLACE, folded and arranged. 

           And the CORKBOARD. Once blank, it’s now AN INNOCENT COLLAGE 
           of fashion models and actresses. 

           Before he can think — CRACK! WINDOWS SHATTER! 

           Danny OPENS THE DOOR to find - A SWAT TEAM BARRELING UP THE 
           STAIRWELL! COMING RIGHT AT HIM! 

                                 SWAT LEADER
                        GET ON THE FUCKING GROUND NOW! NOW! 

           He’s TACKLED. FACE PRESSED TO THE FLOOR, scrunched by a boot 
           heel. He watches as they invade Connie’s bedroom.

                                 DANNY
                        LEAVE HER ALONE! SHE HAD NOTHING TO 
                        DO WITH THIS! NANCY! NANCYYYY!
           INT. WEICHERT ROAD, ADJACENT WOODS (BURIAL SITE) — NIGHT 

           HANDCUFFED, DANNY LEADS A PACK OF CIU MEMBERS through the 
           trees (TILLER, DEACON, WITTEN among them). Police dogs sniff 
           at tufts of weeds. 

           Then...Danny SEES the ‘X’ tree. A huge look of relief on his 
           face as he moves towards it, kneels down, his hands feeling 
           for the exhaust hoses – the holes are there – but BOTH HOSES 
           ARE MISSING. 

                                 AGENT TILLER
                        Is this it, Edwards? Edwards? 

           Danny nods, confused. He’s YANKED back by Detectives and 
           watches at a distance as DEPUTIES GO TO WORK WITH SHOVELS. 

           Moments later — DOOMP! They’ve reached the box. THE LATCHES 
           ARE UNDONE. THE LID OPENED...  

           ...SMALL’S BODY IS LIFTED OUT, passed up and laid on the 
           ground. His face is pale, eyes frozen in some electric 
           fright. But...he’s not coughing or writhing or moaning.

           Small is dead. 

           Danny’s face goes blank. He falls to his knees.  

           PARAMEDICS RUSH to SMALL’S BODY. High-tech equipment is 
           pulled out and hastily put to work. 

           Off Danny listening to the WHEW-WHEW-WHEW of futile CPR 
           compressions and ventilations... 

           INT. BOURBONNAIS POLICE STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM — NIGHT 

           Agent Deacon sits across from Nancy. Tear tracks mark her 
           face. She’s smoking and the ashtray’s brimming. 

                                 AGENT DEACON
                        — did you go anywhere else? 

                                 NANCY
                        I did some shopping at the mall in 
                        the afternoon. 

                                 AGENT DEACON
                        And you can verify all this? 

                                 NANCY
                        I have receipts. The stores might 
                        have video cameras, right? 

                                 AGENT DEACON
                        We’ll find out. So you didn’t 
                        notice Danny leave the bedroom? 

                                 NANCY
                        We don’t sleep together. Things 
                        between Danny and I weren’t the 
                        same after jail. He was scaring me. 
                        I made him sleep on the floor. 
                                 NANCY (CONT'D)
                        When I woke up in the morning he 
                        was there. Agent, you don’t think I 
                        had anything to do with this, do 
                        you? 

           He looks at her a long, anxious moment...then smiles.  

                                 AGENT DEACON
                        We just have to ask the questions. 
                        Sit tight a minute.  

           Deacon exits and — 

           INT. HALL OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM — CONTINUOUS 

           joins Tiller watching through the TWO-WAY MIRROR. 

                                 AGENT DEACON
                        Whaddaya think?  

                                 AGENT TILLER
                        You heard the mom. The guy was a 
                        time bomb waiting to go off. 

           Tiller studies Nancy intently.  

                                 AGENT TILLER (CONT’D)
                        One last thing...

           INTERROGATION ROOM

           Nancy lights another cigarette. She’s anxious, tense. Could 
           she really have gotten off? 

                                 AGENT TILLER (O.C.)
                        ...How’s a guy like him ever land a 
                        girl like her?   

                                 AGENT DEACON (O.C.)
                          (laughs)
                        That’s the million dollar question. 

           INT. KANKAKEE COUNTY JAIL, COUNSEL ROOM — CLOSE ON  

           FBI PICTURES OF DANNY. At the phone booth. The rough sketch 
           of the box. Small dead. Danny’s pick-up, motorcycle, etc...

           Danny stares blankly at the photos as RON WINSTON, 50, the 
           appointed public defender, editorializes the images. But all 
           Danny hears is the SOUND of the PHOTOS being flipped. Then, 
           as though coming up from underwater — 

                                 RON WINSTON 
                        — They’re going to ask for the 
                        death penalty if you don’t enter a 
                        guilty plea, Danny. Danny? 

                                 DANNY
                          (soft, nearly inaudible)
                        I never...meant for him to die... 
                                 RON WINSTON
                        Danny, those hoses were ripped from 
                        the ground. 

                                 DANNY
                        But I... I checked the hoses...

                                 RON WINSTON   
                        When you didn’t get the money you 
                        rode back out to Weichert Road on 
                        your motorcycle.  

                                 DANNY
                        No, no I never took the Harley out 
                        there. 

                                 RON WINSTON 
                        They matched the dirt on your tires 
                        to the dirt at the burial site.  

                                 DANNY
                        But that’s impossible — 

                                 RON WINSTON
                        They have a witness. A farmer out 
                        that way saw your motorcycle the 
                        morning Small was kidnapped. You 
                        didn’t want to leave any chance 
                        Small might identify you. But the 
                        guilt was too great finally, wasn’t 
                        it? That’s when you made the final 
                        call to Elaine Small.

                                 DANNY
                        He must’ve pulled them out 
                        somehow... by mistake, or...

                                 RON WINSTON
                        You’re telling me Small pulled the 
                        hoses and cut the battery that was 
                        keeping him alive? Please, Danny, 
                        take the deal. God knows you’ve 
                        caused enough harm. 

           A moment, then — 

                                 RON WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        Elaine Small had a heart attack 
                        last night. She was found dead on 
                        her kitchen floor. 

           Danny’s face falls and he starts to hyperventilate.

                                 DANNY
                        That’s terrible... terrible. Oh no,   
                        it’s all my fault.

                                 RON WINSTON
                        Police say she was particularly 
                        agitated about the money. That they 
                        hadn’t recovered it, and that no 
                        one would believe her that the guy 
                        that did all this was named, Eddie.
           A beat. Then Danny suddenly looks up. This name, though he 
           can’t place it, is somehow familiar – Elaine having greeted 
           him with this moniker the last time she answered the phone.

                                 DANNY
                        ...Eddie? But there was never any 
                        money.

                                 RON WINSTON 
                        Well on that account the FBI agrees 
                        with you.

                                 DANNY
                          (to himself, racking his 
                           brain)
                        Who’s Eddie?
                          (beat)
                        Have you heard from Nancy? She 
                        doing alright? 

                                 RON WINSTON
                        Left a couple of messages for her, 
                        but nothing yet. How about you? 

                                 DANNY
                        No. She’s not real good about 
                        checking the machine. 

           A BUZZER sounds. Time’s up. 

                                 RON WINSTON
                        Danny, take the deal. It’s the 
                        right thing to do.  

           Demoralized, Danny nods ‘okay’.    

           INT. MAZDA 929, MOVING — DAY — NANCY AND CONNIE 

           As Connie turns down their street, the two notice the front 
           lawn blanketed with NEWS CREWS and NETWORK TRUCKS. 

           EXT. RISH HOME — FRONT YARD — CONTINUOUS 

           Nancy and Connie step from the car and are promptly swarmed 
           by CAMERAMEN and REPORTERS who shove microphones at Nancy. A 
           particularly aggressive young reporter, AMBER CASSIDY, 26, 
           pushes her way through the crowd to Nancy —  

                                 AMBER CASSIDY
                        Nancy, I want to hear your side of 
                        the story! 

           Nancy, seeing some of herself in the opportunistic upstart, 
           takes her business card as they slip into the home. 

           INT. RISH HOME — DEN — NIGHT 

           Nancy and Connie share a bowl of popcorn as they watch the 
           LOCAL NEWS. FOOTAGE of the crime scene, REPORTERS hounding 
           Nancy as she hides behind dark shades. The segment ends.
                                 NANCY
                        See if I’m on Channel 3. 

           Connie switches the channel with the remote. Yep, more 
           coverage of Nancy. A KNOCK at the back door. Nancy stands and 
           moves through the kitchen. She opens the door on JIMMY. 

           INT. KITCHEN, LATER        

           Nancy and Jimmy sit at the table, drinking coffee. 

                                 NANCY
                        How could I have been so stupid, 
                        Jimmy? 

                                 JIMMY
                        Don’t beat yourself up, Nancy. 
                        There was no way you could have 
                        known. 

           (O.C.) The PHONE RINGS. We hear Connie answer in the den. 

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        ...I was waiting for you. That time 
                        you got on the train. My mom told 
                        me you stopped by and asked for my 
                        address. I told all my friends you 
                        were on your way... And you never 
                        showed. 

                                 NANCY
                        Oh Jimmy...

           She reaches over and takes his hand in hers. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        When all this craziness blows over, 
                        let’s go away. Just me and you. 
                        Make up for all that lost time. 

           Jimmy looks into her eyes, smiles. Then — 

           Connie peeks in, breaking the moment. 

                                 CONNIE
                          (excited)
                        Nancy, a producer from Good Morning 
                        America is on the phone for you. 

                                 NANCY
                          (to Jimmy)
                        I should take that. 

           Jimmy nods, stands. Nancy walks him to the back door. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for coming over...

           They share a long hug. Jimmy goes, then — 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Jimmy... 
                          (he turns back)
                        Do me a favor. 
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        If anyone asks, don’t say anything 
                        about last weekend. 
                          (off look)
                        When you took me out on your bike. 
                        Taught me how to ride. It’s just 
                        that... Danny’s been through so 
                        much already. I’d hate for him to 
                        think you and I had something while 
                        the two of us were still together.  

                                 JIMMY
                        I won’t say anything.  

           She watches as he walks off. 

           INT. DEPT. OF CORRECTIONS BUS, MOVING — AFTERNOON 

           Danny stares out the window as the transfer bus barrels down 
           a county two-lane. 

           EXT. STATEVILLE PRISON — AFTERNOON

           The bus arrives at the gates of the correctional facility in 
           Crest Hill. A site of 64 acres surrounded by a 33-foot 
           concrete perimeter with 10 wall towers. 

           INT. STATEVILLE, PROCESSING ROOM – SERIES OF SHOTS 

           Danny is strip-searched, deloused, dressed in prison blues, 
           and his head completely shaved. 

           INT. STATEVILLE, TV ROOM — NIGHT 

           Nothing glamorous. A concrete room with steel folding chairs. 
           A 20-inch TV is bolted into an iron frame. 

                                 LOCAL NEWS ANCHOR
                        We begin tonight with an exclusive 
                        interview with the people closest 
                        to the notorious Danny Edwards. A 
                        murderer who police say is one of 
                        the most cold-blooded killers in 
                        the history of the state.

           Danny, sits off by himself, wholly uncomfortable. Prisoners 
           size him up.

           Then, ON THE TV, AMBER CASSIDY, the reporter whose business 
           card Nancy accepted, appears in the DEN of the RISH HOME 
           where she’s interviewing Nancy and Connie. Connie’s doing 
           most of the talking as Nancy plays the part of the scorned, 
           disbelieving victim. She’s dressed like she’s going to a 
           funeral, eyes hidden behind dark shades, staring off-camera.  

                                 AMBER CASSIDY
                        Connie, you mentioned that there 
                        were warning signs. 
                                 CONNIE
                        That’s right. While Danny was in 
                        jail, the men there forced him to 
                        do certain things. ‘Dirty’ things. 
                        He was never right after that. 

           This gets a very vocal and amused reaction from the other 
           prisoners in the room. Danny knows this isn’t true and 
           wonders why Connie is lying.

                                 AMBER CASSIDY
                        And you saw him building the box? 

                                 CONNIE
                        He told us he was making a lemonade 
                        stand for the kids down the street.  

           PUSH IN ON THE TV SCREEN...

                                 AMBER CASSIDY
                        But it wasn’t for the kids, was it? 

           ...GETTING CLOSER...

                                 CONNIE
                        No...no it wasn’t... 

           ...CLOSER STILL AND WE’RE — 

           INSIDE THE RISH HOME  

           ...PUSHING IN ON NANCY. We see what she’s been looking at. 
           It’s a mirror across the room. She gradually adjusts her 
           broach, over and over until the edges of her lips curl into 
           the slightest hint of a smile.  

           PUSH IN ON DANNY as he begins to get the picture.

                                 DANNY
                          (to himself)
                        Why are you... smiling...?

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM — MORNING OF KIDNAPPING — 7:30 AM

           CLOSE ON NANCY. Asleep. Then...HER EYES OPEN. Not tired or 
           weary. Eyes that are very awake, alert. 

           She rolls over to view Danny who’s fallen asleep on the air 
           mattress. Quietly slides out of bed now, shuts the ALARM OFF, 
           picks up the motorcycle helmet, the 9MM —  

           EXT. ROUTE 102 — MORNING OF KIDNAPPING — 8:00 AM 

           Wearing a leather jacket, Nancy flies down the road on 
           Danny’s Harley, blonde hair peeking out under the helmet as 
           she works the levers and clutches with the acumen of one 
           who’s been riding for years. 

           She WHIZZES past THE CORN FIELD. The ELDERLY FARMER, struck 
           by the sudden engine noise, steps out of the maze and watches 
           as the bike makes its turn down Weichert Road. 
           EXT. SECLUDED PATCH OF WOODS (BURIAL SITE) — SERIES OF SHOTS 

           MOVING ACROSS THE GROUND LIKE A SPREADING FOG (the same POV 
           as before)...EXCEPT...it’s no fog at all. It’s NANCY’S POV — 
           as she approaches the ‘X’ marked tree and — 

           Nancy DIGS and DIGS and finally HITS the wooden box — 

           Nancy lifts the lid of the box. Small stares up at her. The 
           sun burns his eyes and he squints — 

           Nancy pointing the 9MM at Small, holds the VOICE RECORDER as 
           he reads from a script she’s written — 

                                 SMALL
                        — It’s 9:30 AM, Mom. You have 
                        exactly one hour to drop the money. 
                        If you’re not home by 10:30 you’ll 
                        never find me alive. Take Newton  
                        Road...

           INT. ELAINE’S CADILLAC, MOVING — 9:45 AM 

           Elaine drives down rural Newton Road, the RED DUFFLE BAG at 
           her side. The road dead-ends abruptly. She’s staring at the 
           hardwoods in a large and dense forest. 

                                 SMALL (V.O.)
                        ...until it dead-ends. At the edge 
                        of the forest, you’ll find a bag, 
                        inside that bag will be your 
                        instructions.

           EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS — MOMENTS LATER 

           Elaine steps through high grass. There waiting is a BLUE 
           DUFFLE BAG. She unzips it. A NOTECARD sits inside with 
           DIRECTIONS carefully written out.  

           MOMENTS LATER — Elaine transfers STACK AFTER STACK OF GOLD 
           CERTIFICATES from her duffle bag into the blue one. 

                                 SMALL (V.O.)
                        Transfer the money into the bag, 
                        and follow the instructions to the 
                        letter.  

           WE’RE IN THE DARK, THEN — A LIGHT GLOWS 

           ON THE DIGITAL TIMER SWITCH. The display lights up suddenly: 
             10:00 AM. Just above it: ‘ON’ begins to blink. 

           FOLLOW the colored wires to a 12V BATTERY and their 
           connection to a small BOOM BOX with an already depressed 
           ‘PLAY’ button. It’s RED LIGHT GLOWS, and suddenly Eddie 
           Money’s ‘Baby Hold On’ blares from its speakers.
           EXT. WOODS — MINUTES LATER — A SERIES OF SHOTS OF ELAINE

           lugging the heavy duffle bag through PARTS OF THE FOREST, 
           trying desperately to follow the directions in hand. The 
           song’s VOLUME INCREASING as Elaine trudges onward.

                                 SMALL (V.O.)
                        When you hear Eddie Money’s 
                        voice...

           She TIPTOES down an ESCARPMENT. Slips and rides her ass the 
           rest of the way down... TRUDGES across a thin STREAM. Her 
           shoes SOPPING with water...the WIND is picking up... 

                                 SMALL (V.O.)
                        ... you will have exactly three 
                        minutes and thirty-one seconds to 
                        quickly follow it...

           She maladroitly CLIMBS under an enormous fallen HARDWOOD... 

           She pushes through THICKETS OF FOREST SHRUBS that scrape her 
           arms and chins and neck and debris gets in her mouth.

                                 SMALL (V.O.)
                        ...until you see a single giant Elm 
                        tree.

           She looks around frantically for the tree, and finally sees 
           it, a FAMILIAR ANCIENT ELM. 

                                 SMALL (V.O.)
                        Stop there. Do not continue towards 
                        the music. Place this note back 
                        into the bag and throw it as far as 
                        you can in the direction of Eddie’s 
                        voice. This must be done before the 
                        song ends.

           She stumbles quickly over to its trunk. Unzips the bag, 
           inserts the directions, turns her head this way and that 
           trying to get an exact bead on the music, and then hoists up 
           the bag and swings it back-and-forth before letting it fly. 

           As it arches towards us, it’s descent seems impossibly and 
           improbably long – down, down, down, just as the song ends.

           EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS — MOMENTS LATER 

           Elaine emerges. Can’t find her direction. This certainly 
           wasn’t the way she came in. She starts walking East. No, no 
           that’s not it. West now? Doesn’t seem right. She freezes. 
           Checks her watch: 10:15 AM. No time: she heads East. 

                                 SMALL (V.O.)
                        When the money’s been collected you 
                        will receive a call telling you 
                        where I can be found. Remember, you 
                        must be back home by 10:30am!
           INT. ELAINE’S CADILLAC — MORNING   

           Elaine enters. Flustered. Scared. Sweating. Turns the car on. 
           The clock reads: 10:25 AM. 

                                 ELAINE SMALL
                        DAMMNIT! GODDAMNIT! 

           She throws the Caddy into gear and TEARS OFF. 

           EXT. BURIAL SITE — EARLIER (8:30 AM)

           Small stands reading the last of Nancy’s script into the 
           micro-cassette recorder she holds before him.

                                 SMALL
                        Mother, please don’t be late.

           Nancy hits the stop button and motions Small back into the 
           box with Danny’s gun. 

           She CLOSES THE LID ON THE BOX, LOCKS THE HATCHES, THEN — 

           OPENS the breathing compartment, PULLS the wires from the 12-
           VOLT MOTOR, and RIPS THE EXHAUST HOSES FROM THE GROUND — 

           INT. THE WOODEN BOX — SAME 

           ZZZ! ZZZ! A SPARK inside the wire meshing. THE FAN STOPS 
           TURNING. A stream of smoke emanates. THE LIGHT GOES OUT. 

           THE EXHAUST HOSES ARE RIPPED OUT. SMALL STARTS TO GASP FOR 
           AIR that isn’t there. He begins to HYPERVENTILATE and —  

           INT. NANCY’S BEDROOM — NIGHT — ON NANCY  

           as she SEES DANNY ENTER THE ROOM IN THE VANITY MIRROR. She 
           conjures a smile, turns to him in that platinum blonde hair.

                                 NANCY
                        Do you like the new look? 

           Off that 1,000 watt smile WE’RE BACK — 

           ON DANNY BEING ESCORTED DOWN F-BLOCK 

           As he passes other cells, INMATES HECKLE the ‘new fish.’ 

                                 DANNY
                          (to himself)
                        Smiling? ...why are you smiling?

           AND IT HITS DANNY ALL AT ONCE. HE KNOWS. It’s a yoke he 
           cannot bear. His legs fail him. He collapses to the ground. 

           TWO GUARDS lift him by his arms and carry him along the 
           concrete concourse, his limp legs dragging behind him. And 
           then, in a final futile plea, he SCREAMS OUT  — 
                                 DANNY (CONT’D)
                        YOU DID THIS! YOU DID THIS! TO MEEEE! 

           His cell bars slide open. GUARDS TOSS HIM INSIDE. THE SOUND 
           OF THE BARS SLAMMING SHUT IS DROWNED OUT BY —

           TURNING MAGAZINE PAGES – WHOOSH-WHOOSH-WHOOSH —  

           INT. GILMORE’S DINER, NIGHT SHIFT — SEVERAL WEEKS LATER  

           Nancy’s back in uniform, dully flipping through a Glamour 
           behind the counter. The place is empty less a few truckers 
           and vampires. She looks up at the clock: 5:00 AM. 

           MINUTES LATER — Nancy grabs her coat from the rack. Gene’s 
           counting totals at the register. 

                                 NANCY
                        G’night, Gene. 

                                 GENE
                        See ya tomorrow, Nanc. 

           NEWTON ROAD — PREDAWN

           Nancy’s Mazda approaches the dead-end, pulls to the dirt 
           shoulder where the engine is cut. 

           Everything is still, eerily quiet. She steps from the car, 
           and sets out into the woods.

           EXT. DEEP FISSURE IN THE FOREST FLOOR — DAWN 

           Inside the hole looking up at early light reflected through the 
           forest canopy. FOOTSTEPS and Nancy’s face peers down at us.

           She climbs down the old wood ladder. 

           Coolly notices the blue duffle bag. Rolls it over, unzips it. 

           There’s the money. STACKS AND STACKS OF GOLD CERTIFICATES. 

           She smiles casually, as though there was never any doubt. 

           She reaches down and yanks the timer from the boombox and 
           manually presses play: Eddie Money’s ‘Baby Hold On.’ 

           She does a little dance over to the mudstone wall. Fingers 
           grazing the primordial stone. As though hearing a voice, she 
           stops. Brushes away some dust and moss until she finds the 
           ancient etching –– Jimmy Loves Ci-Ci.  

           EDDIE MONEY’S VOICE BEGINS TO ECHO AS IF FROM A GREAT DISTANCE 

           INT. STATEVILLE, ISOLATION — NIGHT

           Danny, wearing a straight-Jacket, sits on the floor of a 
           padded cell rocking back and forth, back and forth. His lips 
           move to Money’s lyrics but he makes not a sound. 
           THE RHYTHMIC CLAP OF gentle WAVES caressing THE SHORE OF — 

           AN IMPOSSIBLY BEAUTIFUL BLINDING WHITE BEACH  

           Nancy, clad in a black bikini hiding beneath a white kaftan, 
           reclines on a tasteful beige colored chaise. Wayfarers in 
           place, and a wide-brimmed straw hat to top it all off. 

           She’s reading a USA TODAY, a feature tilted, The Man She 
           Thought She Knew. There’s a photo of Nancy staring out over 
           the Kankakee River, reflective. And another of Nancy and 
           Danny, the happy couple at Nancy’s 27th birthday party. She 
           looks at Danny. In his prime here. Hair slicked back. Stylish 
           suit. Winning smile. Her eyes slowly drift over to — 

           JIMMY KEENE

           shirtless, lying atop the chaise beside hers. He’s asleep, 
           SNORING lightly, head tilted unflatteringly to one side and 
           sunglasses askew.  

           Nancy studies him a long moment before her eyes move back to 
           Danny. And then back to Jimmy once more. A doubt registers on 
           her face. Then, Jimmy stirs — 

                                 JIMMY
                        What’s the matter, Nanc? 

           He sits up, fixes his shades and runs a hand through his 
           coiffed hair. Nancy smiles, exhales: that’s better. 

                                 NANCY
                        Nothing, I was just... thinking. 

           A SERVER clad in all-white arrives with a cocktail which he 
           hands to Nancy. She nods a ‘thank you’ and Jimmy offers the 
           man a tip. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Will you go and get me the suntan 
                        lotion from the beach hut, Jimmy? 

                                  JIMMY
                        Sure, Ci-Ci. 

           Jimmy stands and heads up the beach. 

           Watching him go, Nancy looks disturbed, as if something is 
           troubling her, some deep moral dilemma that must be puzzled 
           through alone.

           Nancy sets the newspaper on the sand and reaches into her 
           beach bag. She removes the BORA BORA ADVERTISEMENT she was 
           coveting earlier in the story. 

           It’s now clear Nancy is lying on the exact same beach, 
           wearing the exact bathing suit as the model in the picture, 
           same hat, and same drink – right down to the glassware. 

           Looking at the picture, her eyes narrow.

           Her arm begins to move ever so slightly to match the position  
           of the hand that’s holding the colorful libation in the 
           picture. 
           She reaches over to adjust the ORANGE MARASCHINO GARNISH  
           until it’s precisely as it is in the resort’s advert, of a 
           kind with everything else.

           Then and only then, does her hand lower the fanciful ad, 
           tucking it back into her bag. 

           She returns to her exalted pose on the chaise. Her ample 
           chest rising and slowly exhaling, and then finally 

           She smiles. Not a pageant smile, but an expression that is 
           the most genuine and authentic to ever grace her face. 

           The moment seminal for her – at last a perfect mirror.    

           WE PUSH IN ON THE NEWSPAPER...on the picture of Nancy and 
           Danny together...

           As wave upon wave breaks on the shore, the ink begins to 
           bleed. The features of Nancy and Danny slowly melt away until 
           they vanish altogether.

           A final wave crashes angrily onto the beach and the newspaper 
           is carried out to sea... 

                                   —  The End  —
